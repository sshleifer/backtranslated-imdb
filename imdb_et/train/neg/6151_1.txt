... and * in some way * as clean, logical and understandable as this tired Hollywood clichés can see in this pathetic amount. <br /> <br /> I'm 27 years old and I'm 16 years of my life through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character of the film, I was successful mainly because of the logic, because I was thinking over and over again to keep it away from reality and to know what actually happened and what was not. Finally, I was really successful because of medicines, but I definitely fled from madness because I knew before I took the difference between what was real and what wasn't. <br /> <br /> I am right to say that this movie is a complete scam. Not only does it deceive the story of the main character (who was not faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly it shows consolation, a darkened view of schizophrenia - which is completely inadequate. Schizophrenia is a structure of the mind, not a disease. Schizophrenic * is not * "a normal man with a disease" - someone who looks and knows things differently from most people from the beginning: things like time, space and personality are not strong for him. He feels it can be bent, it can change, mutate and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, schizophrenia has a rich, imaginative inner world that "normal" people do not expect - but he is trapped in it because he cannot associate with most people and his world becomes poorer and poorer until he finishes it is completely different from what depicted in this ridiculous "treat", a tear-jerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People who are not the main owners should look strange, weird and absurd, like Lynch's Eraserhead. It should be * impressive, weird, harsh hallucination, because it is schizophrenia. This does not mean * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, look at "Naked Lunch," "Lost Highway," read P.K. Dick's "Mars-Split-Split" or "Ubik", DO watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or play "American McGee's Alice" on your computer and you may have a vague idea of ​​what it is. Don't look at the "good feeling" movie of the month, with banal situations, purified characters and visual lines and foolish plots. "The Cell" is the most accurate film about schizophrenia, his visions and internal continuity - it is violent, weird, confusing and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Again, schizophrenia is not yet a detail, it is not a pure, tedious trick that is played. It pops up on your face and doesn't let you go: the walls break down, people become strange hostile creatures, you feel like you want to go back from time to time, you're not sure you're the one you think everything feels. .. weird, unnatural. Believe me, it is much more than what is depicted in this soap-like melodrama
