It's not a movie. It is a set of independent, poorly designed and poorly assembled scenes that look like the results of a 10-year twilight with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - one who has greasy hair, dead pans, ipods and nervous beliefs - will find themselves in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you did this within ten minutes, don't worry about matching what you saw in the context of the above-mentioned European artist's mindset. It is a real and complete waste of time, money and film that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine's tide. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, characters with no endless vacuum packings are currently going to go to much of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors who take social action at Wal-Mart's snack bar?
