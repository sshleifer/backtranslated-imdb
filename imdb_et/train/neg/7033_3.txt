Black candles are rather confusing for the same director who brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among other things ... I only note what I've seen. In any case, we have a couple who loves love and then somewhere near the voodoo doll, and then strikes it and the man tongues. Not sure if it was good for some of them. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to explore and hear the will or something, and of course everyone else besides him has something that happens to worship the devil. It is really hard to say who is at the moment of the film and sometimes sometimes confuses. Season things, there is a simulated goodness scene (I hope it is simulated) with a black goat, definitely a crowd pleasing. Ugh. Sometimes it is a "Rosemary baby" that is a child, because the hostess always gives one woman a herbal tea and the place they are, no matter what nasty satanic herbs are. But these herbs are not the only thing that strikes this movie. The end result seems to start again, and many viewers may wonder where they have been in the middle. It's not traceable, it's not very good, and I think it all depends on what you want to see in the movies, and there wasn't much that worked for me. 3 out of 10
