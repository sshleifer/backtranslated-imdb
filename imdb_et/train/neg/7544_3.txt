First, this movie was not so bad. It was fun ... at least for me probably all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original so you can't compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of this strange Christopher Reeve movie "The Spirit of Fucking". These two films have different plots, but both have horrible disgust and unwanted comedy. <br /> <br /> The thick man is probably a mystery / thriller / men, please don't fret about the women's movie. I do not know that the whole pagan thing and the sacrifice were a little behind. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self, goes to a secluded island called Summeris when he gets his long lost fiancé in calligraphy. who claims to have his daughter taken by the compatriots and hidden. Cage is a police officer and he is a tired policeman, he goes to a semi-uncharted island, leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get more amazing than the big Amishian women who are on the island and carry her from the lost girl's location. His fiancé is not a helper who seems to be tiring and tired all the time. The drill stays on the island as he learns that the missing girl is her daughter and she is a happy man who was threatened to fall victim to the island's becoming a victim. <br /> <br /> In this movie, men don't appreciate so well. Sick Twisted Feminism Display? <br /> <br /> I found the movie ridiculously, especially when the cage strikes some women and runs around a bear suit. I think there were too many jugs in this movie. I find that the whole angry concept of women is separated from the island without caring for men quite amusingly, but the way this film was portrayed was just strange. While most women are somewhat painful and angry, it is clearly a form of sexism. If you had the opposite of roles, I would have turned off the film from nasty. This movie is something to watch, maybe just one or two times. This is not a thriller, which should be classified simply as strange.
