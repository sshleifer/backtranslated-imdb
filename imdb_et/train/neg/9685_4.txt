I don't know about you, but I've always known the "ART" cinema. The first "art" film I managed to get was Peter Greenaway "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and His Lover", which spoke out of my mind and creative sport. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... that was what the "art cinema" was, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the goal of the visceral screen. Life, in real life, can be like living in a madhouse, and the art expressed is what it is. I love all kinds of movies, but especially those that both offer entertainment and have something to say, whether I agree with this view or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN" is dry, clinical "comedy "where father and son gather harem for their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very short reference to Fellin in the film, unlike the previews. The main goal of the film is the "close" relationship between the father and the son, which is concentrated after the death of the mothers. In the early stage of the film, the sadness of the fathers is plausible, you may feel his pain. Later, Greenaway standards, harem gathering, love and death observations, and flesh displaying flesh ... One can claim this, but I feel the film is low and pointless. And the idea of ​​being a comedy is puzzling for me. Mostly, how good it is ... especially good is Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (though bad Mandy should put her clothes back) What's missing on the movie is a convincing story and the usual Greenaway movement that made her other movies so wonderful to watch . <br /> <br /> Although full of knowledge and casual taboo, "8 1/2 Women" is too cut and sticky to be considered an art, too funny to be funny and just <br /> > Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleeping bed. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
