I was sad about this movie because it seemed wrong and the characters were not strong enough to make the movies tough. The main idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately he was unable to excite, really intimidate or shock - the whole movie had a part that I thought it was terrible, but even what didn't redeem it. At the end of the movie I liked Kate's character, because he seemed to soften and become a bit more realistic at the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really necessary for the film, and I think the director / writer could take away many of the characters used for some purpose if he had left it to the main characters, making it more of Kate's part as he has worked - Jeremy's action was wooden, saying the least, and I was uncomfortable looking at bad screen chemistry - or because of lack of it. Damage. Disappointment.
