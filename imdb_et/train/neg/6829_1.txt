I've written at least half a dozen dirty reviews of this lousy little flick and none of them are published, so I have to admit that someone on imdb.com really likes this terrible movie. The idea that some oysters can revive the military tank that has been erected in the desert for over ten years and makes this fighting machine again, ridiculous. That is the way and the direction. Leave it on.
