Writer Hamm and director Dante are a huge disappointment. Their previous co-operation during the first season of "Homecoming" was complicated and fun in all the right ways. The bad handling of this intriguing assumption left me confused. The alleged "payout", which shows a general alien who takes something out of the brains of infected psychopaths, was completely satisfied and explained something. If the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the planet of human infection, why did they go in such a sadistic and misognistic fashion? Why not just trigger a completely deadly virus a la Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of men being men? I had the hope that the episode would improve when I look, but it just made it more pretentious and uncomfortable. The religious subtitle just seemed forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm was supposed to think it was deep. I like the work of both Dante and Hamm, but it was simply unobtrusive.
