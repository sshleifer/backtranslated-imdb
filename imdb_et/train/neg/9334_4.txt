In Mexico, OK is sliding on a hit-man (Scott Glenn) who grabs the race with a fighting American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after the hit. He will pay them to bring him to the border? but things don't go away. <br /> <br /> It starts well enough but quickly fights and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Potential twisting is poorly set and hard to believe. The lack of a tongue and essentially no reason why he left, leaving one man to another, made it ridiculous - and the end was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is a male agent hit by the US agent, but it seems a little confused when the script is boring and slow.
