Christopher Lambert is a tedious and disappointing GIDEON. This film could have been classic when Lambert performed, as well as Tom Hanks Forrest in Gump or Dustin Hoffman like Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN or Sean Penn Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Too bad because the story is meaningful to us, performances supported by Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connor, and Shelley Wints were great. 3 out of 10
