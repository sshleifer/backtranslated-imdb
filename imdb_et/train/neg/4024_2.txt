This movie is just terrible. Poor John Savage had to drop this little to be in another movie. It is a rare vampire type that helps a woman who looks like being washed out and thrown into the streets that are the dancer's local band club. She tastes one drop of blood from another dancer who is one of those rare vampires because they get out of the dressing room on the floor. From this rare vampire there will be a short leader who looks like a cross between the 80s punk rocks and the purple-haired Olsen twins. This movie is just crazy with a savage tattooed spider with Savage and dance, as well as one of the rare ones. He quotes Elephant Man and Jimmy Durant and I just had to laugh. It just turns red. And then the toughest special effects they might have are throwing Corri's bodies and pulling them out of their mouths. And you can say it is all fake. His son does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and becomes more harmful than the object of peace. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me, but I just hated it. Even the photography stinks, the camera shakes in and out in such a way, and try to make it look like vampires move fast to keep the camera going and then the camera turns all bright behind the Savage son. Around the corner until he dazzles himself. Avoid it!
