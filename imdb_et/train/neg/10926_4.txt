Though the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, the performance is as usual. Although the practical mummy effects are not bad and the "Gun Nut" sign is worshiping, the only real feature is that Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin are reunited on a small screen. I think it was the whole idea. They do the best they have, but for me the "black" moments were the first 40 minutes or when Morena was doing some Tomb Rider-style shorts. Not very ear cinema, what I know, but you can't deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin once again casts it as a man you love to hate. If you just want to look at a couple of your favorite Firefly characters, they will have some better material for some time, then it may be for you. If you want good action and character formation, we recommend looking elsewhere.
