Imagine Big Chill being cast in twenty milligrams, with characters of all kinds, and an iguana-like male lizard that casts them around and has an idea of ​​stupidity here. On the positive side, the film does not rob the monster. There are no peek-a-boo shots or night scenes where you have to imagine what it looks like; he's a nation there. Unfortunately, this design and design are not inspired. A little mystery may have helped. Think of you, I've seen a lot worse, but if you want to get him out on the full screen, your monster is better to see. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Front! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a twist that involves a supposedly dead brother that doesn't make any sense. It didn't come as a surprise when the script was dirty. As for operation; Let's just say that it was not painfully bad, but I do not expect to see a lot of these children in cinematographic events in the future. <br /> <br /> Gore quotient: 2 out of 5; Nudity factor: 1 in 5; Intelligence coefficient: negligible
