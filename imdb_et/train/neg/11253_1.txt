Visually interesting, but falls to the originality department. This annoying workout technique carries thin after the opening battle. The Jewish law has burned toast charisma, but in its defense there are some of the worst dialogues in the film I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it takes you out of the movie, and I thought about work, bill, dogs, and so on. Paltrow is as wooden as they can. It could have been saved by a lovely movie noir dialogue or top camp. My only complaint about the technique is that Black & White film (sorry, computer) would be helpful because it looks like Turner painted in black and white. Just a big boring cliche. I'd rather break my femur as I sit through this endurance test.
