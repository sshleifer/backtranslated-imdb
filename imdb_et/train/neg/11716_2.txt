After I think about myself, there are too few good writers and leaders or many producers. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie anyway. Terrible so it's not fun, but rather your teeth and trembling. Makes the movie "it's wrong". Diving is zero. By now, most of you are probably used to terrible mistakes / strange movies that have hackers on your computers, and so on. This film is like this in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good movie in the movie is the little girl Emily, who has been played by Eliza Bennett. I hope he gets big and at least ... makes something worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Don't look at it. There is not even a decent activity in this. Waste of time.
