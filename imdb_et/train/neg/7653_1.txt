First of all, I would like to say that if I had to honestly evaluate this movie from 1 to 10, I would give it -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is bad. All from story, management, editing is terrible. The story isn't even half-decent to get started (you can't wait a lot because it's based on a video game, something I didn't know about entering a movie), but management and editing made it even worse. The movie cuts at uncomfortable points and goes into scenes that are not fully linked in advance; Some, like in the middle of a quick sex scene, do not even make sense of the story, seeing how the characters do not feel the feelings of each other. You could go to a movie that waits for you to see the heap of pound on the screen for an hour and a half and you would still be disappointed. Frankly, if you pay for watching this movie, you are wasting your money and if you don't pay anything, you are wasting one and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and don't look at it.
