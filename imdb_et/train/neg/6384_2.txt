I was recently on the web where I was looking for a website with public movies. In his long list of films, this film was and I thought I should be hallucinating with such an offensive title and assumption. But no, it's actually what it was. And since the movie was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to try. If it had turned out to be a porn movie, I would have stopped. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team, with a budget of about $ 49, tried to make a Star Trek-style movie about a very homosexual men traveling around the galaxy, erasing a woman's oppression, killing all women - as they did the Earth! And in any case, they met with joy and thanks to the homosexual men of the planet. <br /> <br /> Fine, it's not. With some of the most famous and minor names I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them to IMDb without removing my review! But even though it is all dirty, it was strangely observable and worth looking at. However, as I have already mentioned, the raw material names and odd content (though nudity) are only adult films. By the way, this film left me with 1001 questions about WHO WHAT to do and WHO was a target audience! It may not be the absolute worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably strange and perhaps the most offensive!
