I liked this movie until the end. Of course, it was cheerful and quite unlikely, but it keeps my attention in the rainy afternoon. Until the end, it is. For the final performance in a prestigious classical conservatory where he has won the catching-up of other classical students, what does the main character do? Wow them to your grasp and fulfillment of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and kills Carmen with a great sensual Habanera and makes it a completely forgotten pop song for Brittany Spears-wannabe. My ears bleed! And at the highest moment of his horror, his teachers gave him a steady position! Any teacher who is not in Spears' fantasy would have failed him locally. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
