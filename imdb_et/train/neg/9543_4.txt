Let's face it ... if you rent a forgotten 80th legacy STDVD, and you expect it to be better than the above, then you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code adds a long list of unnecessary queues that the DVD market has so easily met. Such films do not need a spoiler because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The plot of this "movie" is as follows: Nerd meets a girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd can randomly accompany the top secret government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; the nerd and the girl come under bullying behind another country; nerd and girl meet some important old man who dies in the "movie" key; maid and girl are caught; the secret government computer goes crazy; nerd has been recruited with the ultimate secret government computer; nerd wins Top Secret Computer using the first Wargames movie using the same old Top Secret computer; nerd saves the day; jokes can be put down. <br /> <br /> The End. <br /> <br /> Functional, scripts, effects, scores and cinematography are what you expect - Class B. Some familiar faces are here and if you are not a big fan of Colm Feore, you should avoid it. This movie doesn't make you crazy enough to eat your toes, seeing it, so if you like cheap STDVD queues, you're home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick's league was involved in some "masterpieces" that he couldn't even shoot for five seconds. But could you blame him?
