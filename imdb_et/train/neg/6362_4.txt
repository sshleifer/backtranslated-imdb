I am a fan of the great Italian films of the 1970s, and I do not hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among all her favorite actors, so I went to this film with some hopes. But soon it turns out that this is largely a nonsense movie that doesn't go anywhere. Obviously no one will wait much more, but the fact that it is useless becomes more annoying if you think it is also quite boring and no character is interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on "rogue"; in that case, steals, fights and smuggles things. This is basically the whole film that this film has. The film has a real 'seventieth style' for it, and the idea that it is all very carefree goes well. Sometimes it seems that the directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to pass on some points, even though this point is not, it doesn't work very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a joy, and so is it here; he is definitely the best film about the film and the order in which he hangs naked is the best part of the film. In general, Rogue probably has some appeals to people in the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't offer much.
