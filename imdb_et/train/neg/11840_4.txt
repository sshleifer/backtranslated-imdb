Anything that may be interesting in this material has sunk in the first few seconds, when you give up on responsibility, that the events we need to see will never know and "It's whisper [rumor] most often of" Hollywood's most sensational "secrets ". <br /> <br /> Okay, okay? So we don't get anything new (and E! 'Mysteries & Scandals' gives you a better point of reference in a particular case ... and it's not much of a confirmation). What can we do? <br /> <br /> We know that Hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents. There's no big news. More interestingly, we learn what a washed director is willing to do to restore power in the entertainment sector and / or in a political institution. This raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich talks about his experience through these experiences. But what has been said to be so cynical and ugly and confusing, we feel guilty of witnessing a hooey heap that goes out historically. <br /> <br /> The film's tone has curious quality that I found more irritating than fun. We are not empathetic to anyone. And the great "Citizen Kane" polishes Davies's and Hearts's relations much more convincingly. In "Cat In Me", we are never sure that Davies' motives belong to Hearst. As soon as we have been told one thing, he has done another. <br /> <br /> And do we have to believe that Davies was in love with chaplains? Or, he simply catches one of America's most powerful and apparently moral citizens. The film never makes it clear. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are convincing. Yacht and period costumes are perfectly cleaned. I looked more at the construction of some men's jacket paws when I followed the story of many of Hollywood's most famous figures. Nobody remembers that the scenario is pure fiction. Disclaimers in the film make it eligible and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Performers cannot be injured even though Meg Tilly is out of parody here. Kirsten Dunst never loses. It gives the most beautiful result of the landscape chewing in the sea. Only Joanna Lumley rises over the material, but so much that she seems to be more distant from the whole business than telling her. One of his first lines is: "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she wants her not to be. <br /> <br /> It is not equal to Bogdanovich's trick, so bad-it-good "At Long Last Love". It has been sitting on something serious in trying, but it hesitates and stumbles mainly because it is so full of bitterness against the "beast" called Hollywood. This is a national film by a filmmaker. And not just the names of countries that put Oneida on one weekend, but the audience is also pretty dirty.
