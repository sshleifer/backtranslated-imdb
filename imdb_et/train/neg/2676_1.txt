** Possible Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This direct-video mess combines weapon hero, class Z effects, Nazis, mummy and endless lesbian footage, and it's still boring; video for 45 minutes driving only SEEMS like Eternity. The only good part is one of the flourishes where the bad guys force the 400-pound ego and one leg of the villain almost breaks down under the footprint. Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch TV, bow or tennis instead.
