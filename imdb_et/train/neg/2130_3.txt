I think I'm going late for the party. I saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 movie version when I turned it on. show because I remember doing it so much fun. I had no impression of this newer version. It was not just fun. It was not colorful. It lacked the greatness of the youth. The lighting was bad. Nobody seemed to mention this fact. It's not moody music, it's bright and beaten. The lighting decision was a poor creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of flaws. I have no point in this version. The lighting was terrible and the general performances broke down. The dance numbers also seemed anemic. We have music videos today. At least the dance numbers could have been measured by some of the best or the best in Broadway. The choreographer was a sleeping wheel that seemed like. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were extremely talented, some were very wrong in the election choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin and so many talented Latin performers, it would not have been right to put one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is an African-American, cute and talented but poor casting. Jason Alexander was struggling because he always did intelligent work, but he wasn't Albert. He was uneven and I think it's obvious to most people who see this version. Must be translated from one medium to another. The greatness and the light of the performance music must be TRANSLATED. During the filming, the stage script is not fair. The spirit, the nature of production, must be pointed out. For me, Bye Bye Birdy's 1963 film production was brilliant and lively, while the 1995 production was as grim as lighting and weak as dance figures. This proved to be a regrettable waste of the efforts of many truly talented people.
