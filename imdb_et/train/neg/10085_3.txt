Why do all Lifetime films have such anemic titles? "Unexpected Love" - ​​Ooh, How Provocative! "That much I know" would have been better. The film is nothing special. Real people don't really talk like these characters and situations are really attacked. A straight woman, "lesbian", seemed more than easter. If you want to look very hot at women who can look very discreet, you can enjoy it. Although it seems to have been written by someone who is unable to keep people in the world. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?
