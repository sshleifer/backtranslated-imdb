I can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that all my 51-year-old on this planet, which is a worse (presumably child) film I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three big kids to see it, and even they tried to raise a smile for all the embarrassing 90 minutes. I leave the other day in sexual indendoes, but they were both tasty and film. They should pay YOU to check that you do not pay them. It's really terrible, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this movie should be put up for money with a false pretext for money. <br /> <br /> Aplogis my misspellings, but I'm so upset that he spoiled the time I had with my grandchildren, Stephen
