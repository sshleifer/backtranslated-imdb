The Vampire's henchman wants to invite him after he's in love with a five dollar whore in this extremely low budget horror comedy. I can't explain all the positive comments about this movie. I encrypt it for massive hallucination, but it is still disturbing. One redeeming factor (and it is very generous to me here) can be a grandfather who is the only semi-pleasant character in this confusion. Don't waste your money or time. In fact, there is an advisory word here when Troma puts it out on a DVD, but does not do it by itself, probably crap. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Add-ons: Comment on Omar and Kirk; second comment with cast and team deleted scenes; sprays; troma interactivity; radiation march; "Terror Firmer" clip; Theater trailer; Caravan Trailers, "Teenage Roof Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My Class: D
