This TV soap opera script is so bad that even A. Hopkins had to play as an undergradic drama student at some point to bring his script to a dead character. I don't know if it was the director's goal, but Hopkins' Ciano didn't speak anything but vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano was all this, but then why make him a movie? Mussolini was a bit more convincing and his long way was closer. Edda Mussolini was just ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent script), while he was supposed to be the central character of this alleged family drama. See it only if you enjoy Venezuelan soap opera.
