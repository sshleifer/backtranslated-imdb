I've read all the comments on this movie. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama <br /> <br />. As such, I read a book based on this <br /> <br /> film. Film is ugly and degrading fiction. I do not criticize it for changing small details or events for dramatic purposes; It's not a <br /> <br /> documentary. However, the script changes the effects, the reaction, the <br /> <br /> realities and changes in every major character. It makes an enormous <br /> <br /> real relationship between Harrari and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry of a Tibetan woman (which suppresses Tibetan culture) to Harra's gift box, Harrare's <br /> <br /> heart, all this movie is wrong - except <br /> <br /> for amazing photography. I understand that Potala (palace) shots were smuggled out of Tibet. <br /> <br /> Making a real story about the relationship between two people, one of them is very important for the world to create a <br /> <br /> movie star is sad
