After seeing this movie, I complained about the quality of my local cinema soundtrack or whether the cinema sound system might be faulty. At least in the first half of the film, it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is talking about because of the dazzling of 20 music and soundtracks. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment, but not so - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I was told that the subject of my complaint was an important part of making a movie. Music and sound had to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. These days, the directors are moving to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where and how you see the film is the same as the sound score. <br /> <br /> So besides the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find out elsewhere), soundtrack distortions are in themselves a good reason to make a note of this movie. You only hear the sound of the soundtrack distorted and certainly not the noise of the cat.
