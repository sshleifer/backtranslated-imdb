Swayze is not very convincing by Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; it was my ultimate hero in films like 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952 "Zenda prisoner" and 1950 "Solomon King mines"; Patrick Swayze fails. Even the depiction of Elder Alan Quaterman by Sean Connery in the "Union of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was otherwise very good on the big flop. Alison Doody also lacks the role of Deborah Kerri's grandson-leading wife, and last but not least, Umbopa's role as impressive Siriaque makes it very difficult for anyone to fill her shoes! For someone who was disappointed with Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now recommend it very much if you can't get your hand on the granger version.
