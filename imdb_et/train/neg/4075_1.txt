I'm a horror / gore movie freak and this flick was so bad, I felt embarrassed not only by the "actors" but also by the director and the bad juice producer who actually put it up for the money. /> <br /> You are expecting some great carnage, a little story, and a LEAST direction or dialogue from the title. Instead, you get the one that looks like a more violent and sexual episode of the Three Stooges. At least I'm laughing at three Stooges. Looking at this mess, I turned to another TV and started watching Howard Sterni until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I was watching Stern. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie I understand that I can create a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, a $ 50 dollar change and a broken computer. This film is my inspiration for making a non-budget line. Look at this movie if you dare, but warn ... there is a lot here, but a lot of talk and very little action. This makes "KaZam" Meryl Streep's film. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Germany did not ban it because of sex or violence. Other countries have to consider.
