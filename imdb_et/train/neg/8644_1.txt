It's a complete Hoax ... <br /> <br /> The film is clearly captured in the state of Northwest India in Rajasthan. Watch the Scene - the vehicles are India; writing the whole is Hindi language in India. Journey through the typical streets of Jaipur. The palace is also located in Amer - about 16 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers (in the movie) in the DVD bonus seem to feel the sound of their lives in Kabul and around them. Almost all of their action scenes are captured in India. The scene in which they see a group singing at the fire is so fake that they didn't even think of turning it into an Afghan folk song. They just recorded Rajasthan folk song. How do I know that because I have traveled extensively to this area. They are just on a band wagon to make a big deal on this issue. I call the filmmakers to deny it.
