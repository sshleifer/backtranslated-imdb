Seeing when I hate reading long essays, hoping to find a point and be disappointed, I first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. Correct terrible. And no, surprisingly, for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I could agree with him, seeing that he gave the film the rank he deserved, but he attacked sadly by reading what he said. I am quite ashamed that I take the same side as someone who commented that the film certainly does not have good looking women. Let me first say, "Wow! It was definitely a serious in-depth review there. My mind can barely understand the philosophical motives of the film." Seriously, however, the "essential female" movie should not be considered as the absence of "beautiful women". If you are desperate for "good women", you should really watch other movies that may not belong to the sci-fi category.
