Let me give you a quick cinematic art: a rotten, rude child, called Max, gets onto a radio containing Kazama: a ghastly gene. Like all geniuses, he gives 3 desires, but because of his good character, he helps Max's personal life, because he has to deal with a father mixed with bullying and organized crime. All of this, the Kaza rape from time to time (including submitting Shaq's depressing rap skill). <br /> <br /> This movie proves what we all know: athletes must stick to sports. I admit that it has never been seen as an Oscar-worth movie, but ALL of this waste of movies is terrible. The characters are either unlikely or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, dialogue is a joke and Shaq is just a quarter of a problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazama, would still be a joke. I know that this movie only led this because Shaq was so big at that time (not intended). I cannot honestly think of one positive thing about wasting this time. Shaq should have used this time to practice free throwing to make this movie.
