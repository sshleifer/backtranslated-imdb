If the original casting idea had been retained (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this film would have worked. Unfortunately, racism had to come to the picture (literally) and confuse. The predominantly black workers did not get the antagonist black, so they changed the role of Rutger and Ice-T. It was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's newsroom approach to "leadership" only confirmed that it was another task of positive action. Master shot, shut, close. Gads, 'Who is it,' is even using more creative camera work. The rewriting of Eric from the most dangerous game is at least an attempt to modernize the classic story, but does not give us any reason why the characters do it. We are never given any reason, except "no one leaves these people", why does the driver (rewrite Rutgerina) do it. In addition to John McGinley's heartfelt result and the decent work of Charles Dutton, don't worry about it. One little bit of a trivia was a real drunken rush that caused injuries to Murray Abraham, which resulted in the death of the drunk driver who caused the accident.
