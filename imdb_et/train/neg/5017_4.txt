Just finished this movie ... I saw it on a video and I was a Nick Stahl fan, which I just had to rent. Frankly, it should probably stay on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were many pretty smart turns, but somehow I thought almost all of them before they came. And in my opinion, the film went a little too far ... if you have to suffer through watching it, you see what I mean! <br /> <br /> With a positive comment, Nick Stahl's behavior was great (especially considering what he was supposed to do). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but she always plays the same type of character ... too much of Paul Finch's "American Pie", which is pleasing to me. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this movie must be Jan Jones' emotional performance ... I think it's all about what's important in Hollywood.
