Misty Ayers was smoking, and it was all that movie. Clean exploitation. I started playing with myself, counting the number of times they have been exposed to orchestral music. And of course, the music is not completely related to the scenes. Example: Randomly walking in space and saying "Hello" was awarded the novel's tracing music. I'd like to know why this movie was sitting on the shelf 11 years before the shelf was released. What I learned from this film: that in 1954 there were low-rise women's panties. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver's original Alien movie panties. For at least 20 of the first 30 minutes, Misty is calmly taken off and dressed (except for the bra and panties unfortunately). Includes terrible duplication resulting in "Look out! Godzirra!" impact.
