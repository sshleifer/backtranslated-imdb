I have read some other comments and I have to agree with those that did not end. I thought it was going quite well. It keeps your mind rolling and then splat. I have no clue what happened in the last few minutes of the movie except for the complete confusion. It's like they run out of money to reach a good end so they improvised. First of all, they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear, then they were the man who spoke about area 51 (which makes you think aliens), then after they went. I thought the actors and the actors did well, it's just the script gone sour. Anyway, if you look at this movie ready to be disappointed.
