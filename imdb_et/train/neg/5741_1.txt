<br /> <br /> I am a horror / sci-fi fan for a long time, regardless of the budget, but after watching crazy movies and movies in the late evening, it must be the worst of all movies. With bloody special effects (which looked like roasted croissant or ketchup, which was shown again and again) and people running around shouting from the left, then right and then back. It should have stayed in the beginning shop and stopped there and was 15 minutes. Instead, it will be drawn for a very long time. This is a very, very x5 low budget. Many scenes were too long. The narrator sounded a very amateur, as a casual person speaks of a younger person. This is the only movie I think is lower than Manos, the Red Zone of Cuba, Benji and Godzilla. megalon despite their larger budgets. 10 repetitions, try to stay awake through the whole movie in one environment or better yet, avoid it as if you were a dead brain eating mob. Why-Me-Never-See-This-Piece-Of-Zombie-Dung-Blues. Inconsistently bad movies, etc. - infinity / 10
