The film has one naked scene: a man who sits on the bedside and where his exposed genitals smell in the middle of the screen. This is a pretty long scene. What was the point? I almost think it was supposed to be funny, but we looked at it with her mother and it wasn't funny that YOU look perfect when you look at us. <br /> <br /> The film is cold. No character is even pleasant. Audrey Tatou is, of course, cute, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I really don't recommend this movie. I was expecting it to be charming and fresh, but it was frustrating. I was wondering if the director came from the very upper crust, from the educated French family, and he looks at these signs. <br /> <br />
