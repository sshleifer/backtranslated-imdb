This movie is really bad. The actor is just terrible, except Michael Ironside. I can't get the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after the fight between two Mc-bands. He comes to town and suddenly he is chosen to fight bad people who want Indian land. Kaan was told that he was an Indian who had returned his home town, I didn't hear it in the movie, if so, it wasn't clear. bad actress. Strong and ugly. He also said his lines are. And we wouldn't talk about Sean Young, he wasn't my favorite actor, but in this movie he plays Indian women who fall in love with Bolt (Grieco). He's terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose it with Amanda Pays between that and Subterfuge. I chose it because Michael Ironside was cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. I have it at home. I wrote it down after seeing the movie.
