Restore today, this movie would be very horrible, very disturbing dark comedy. Stalking, obsession, and web lies and manipulations are given in 1948 with luster not-they-cute harmless. Drake plays a stalker, an indefatigably pathetic and manipulative user of unrest, Grant plays an angry and remarkable pursuit. <br /> <br /> Extremely disturbing; I have not been able to look at the classic romances with the same disbelief that has been since. <br /> <br />
