This movie is terrible. The story concerns a woman who is trying to find out what has happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, which rises from the Noir / thriller to erotic, where fear elements are thrown well. The film has a very confusing structure, for example, using frequent setbacks without linking the story. The plot is poorly developed and characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who and who played. There are some unreliability in many films, but the scene where the main protagonist wants to visit a virtual stranger agrees to go alone (where he says he finds the phone) minus the weapon he had brought, to call the police too hard to believe. Part of the cinematography is very bad: we looked at the 42-inch TV so that anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in almost complete dark scenes that are farther away from me.
