Because of the failed success of the "army of God", it seems that every Mormon that comes with the camera is now trying to make a movie. In the recent "second half of heaven", it was not at all bad. This film, though not great, was pretty good. However, "The Singles Ward" is not. <br /> <br /> Speaking of a young divorced Mormon man who retracts into one life, The Singles Ward is a style of writing and photographing in many ways very similar to the 80's comedy "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". However, similarities end. Although "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original and well-functioning (as far as stupid comedies like it is ever), "The Singles Ward" is the opposite. He's trying to be very funny. However, 90% of gags fall flat or there are clich√©s and jokes you've probably heard a million times before. The remaining 10% seems timed. And acting, though not terribly, is the best amateur. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are not Mormon or very familiar with Mormon cultures, you hardly have anything at all. If "the army of God" and "the other side of heaven" were inside and outside the Church of Mormon, many viewers attracted, this movie is certainly one big joke, and even if you get it, it's just not that funny.
