Watching more than 70 years of movies, this must be one of the worst comedies. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and some others have done very bad comedies, but this is the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, who I usually like, needs her pay badly. She desperately needs her crafts again. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I don't know who he is) needs a better director to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is not his task either. <br /> <br /> Mike White has to find another character, he has made the same type of person a couple of times too much. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard, who started a year ago as a first-rate actor, is also not as good as he used to be. <br /> <br /> Nothing to say about this comedy test of this movie. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (4hrs) 25 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
