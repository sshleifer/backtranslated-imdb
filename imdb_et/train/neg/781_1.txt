This show was absolutely terrible. Because one George is not funny and his children are little brothers. He also treats his mother with respect. Like a Spaniard, I am extremely offended by this exhibition and how the characters are depicted. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the family that causes the disturbance is fatal. Once I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other exhibitions have done it millions of times? I thought ABC would get in your mind and pull it out of the air, but unfortunately we have to hesitate to jump until they "shark". <br /> <br /> I think they already did.
