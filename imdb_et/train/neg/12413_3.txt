I'm not saying that this movie is terrible because I've seen it worse, but it's not even halfway. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I couldn't really understand what was going on and where things were going. When the film was over, I left my head scratched. I looked over the credit to see if they had anything after them that could make things clear, but when the credit was over, it was. I felt like I was cut from one weak plot of one movie to another, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> The character development is very low. I couldn't figure out if anyone was angry or against someone. I couldn't tell if half of the characters should have been drunk, stoned, with a mental challenge, or just had a bad actor to portray them. This film seems to be based on stereotypes (it is difficult to avoid them when you make a movie about a singer in a rock band), which should make the development of the label easier, because so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the heroin addicts trying to clean up. Stereotypes are easy to describe, explaining why so many bad films tend to use stereotypical signs. On the other hand, this film uses stereotypical signs left and right, but tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another sign with the characters is that they seemed to be without explanation. I think this is OK, because so little time was spent on developing the characters I really could not find out, so I never forgot about them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, Sadie's song. It's terrible. The music that supports him is not a winner of the prize, but it is usually killed by the scooters released from Sadie's vowels. I swear there is one point in the movie where he sings the song for at least 10 minutes. I thought seriously that I had to turn it off during the comfort. <br /> <br /> This movie is confusing. The characters are badly developed, Georgia's action is woody and rigid, Sadie's character has left one bad situation to another, no backtrack or explanation. Music was intolerable and I don't think of any good reasons to watch this movie unless you are thirsty for cinematic pain.
