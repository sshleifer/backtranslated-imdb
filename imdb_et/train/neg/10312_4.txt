As an impressive 10-year-old, I liked the "love conquers all" philosophy in the 1970s "Bridget Loves Bernie". I realized the contradiction between the romantic complications between the Jewish cab driver (David Birney) and the Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both parents (as parents of Harie J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald Bernie). and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with a young couple's interfaith marriage. <br /> <br /> Looking back on years of personal life experience, I am surprised that the show was even a successful, though highly respected, season. Created by author TV author Bernard Slade, who, a few years after the cancellation, writes for a successful game "At the same time, next year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light, superficial comedy that fell under his airy weight. br /> <br /> There was no real chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in later years, both parties have shown that they are better off in other projects (Birney in his short-term role as "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here they tried to breathe life at an exhibition that needed a much sharper comic edge that could have given deep reasons a deeply controversial topic. <br /> <br /> The show took place on Saturday night between two CBS power stations: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both exhibitions were intelligent, funny, and had enough edge (all the more so as the last one) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very intelligent and had only occasional smiles. <br /> <br /> This was another example of an exhibition that wasn't as good as I remembered.
