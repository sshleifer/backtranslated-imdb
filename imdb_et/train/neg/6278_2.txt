You have to think about how some fliks ever made ... it decided to skip why many other things and just mislead the disputed. <br /> <br /> And yet you have a number of decent players doing their best to pump the life story. The whole blue tone of the film moves again, again, which in itself would be frustrating, but here it is superfluous. The idea that this is not a medical condition, not a house or a gypsy, or a hungry curse, but just something that obviously won't happen to our main character and then everyone else around him, just hurts up, like taking big paws with an empty mug. Some doppelganger have superpower, but others don't know or know what they do? They seem to be just as unpleasant as we are. <br /> <br /> It is a poor man's "body-snatcher" invasion by Emperor Sutherland's "Mirror" and "Sixth Sense" that you had to put these three together seriously.
