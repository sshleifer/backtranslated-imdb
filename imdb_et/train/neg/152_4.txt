A few factual spoilers can be considered in the discussion. <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but Spielberg does not deserve to win any Oscar for this track, and I think the Academy was right to vote in this place. (The other Oscars are the best actors and the ones I don't know. But it would be difficult to justify what they were told and what you see in the final product.) How Spielberg drives it is so viable, so nervous. Looking at this film, I was shouted at the film made as a distinction made during the art course: "Sentiment is honest emotions. Sentimentity is sweet and unreal, false life view." This is superior to sentimentality. If in real life two people ever start to read out loud, like Celie and Shug Avery, when they sit on the bed that goes over the net letters they found? Examples of the behavior of this movie are: all the men who break around Miss Millie's car and then jumped together like the flocks that come out when he's driving; Harpo falls through the roofs of various buildings on which he works (cheap shocks); the whole career group who goes from Jog's mass to the chapel, as if magically choral singing ... ... and on. There's nothing to talk about. I even wondered if Harpo's name was chosen purposefully, because it is the real name of his wife, Sophia, "Oprah", back. Spielberg does not exceed such "brightness". <br /> <br /> Spielberg is incapable of honestly melting activities and emotions. Schindler's list was amazing for me, deeply touched, and I admire very much for keeping my privacy for my reality, even if the story is a bit busy.
