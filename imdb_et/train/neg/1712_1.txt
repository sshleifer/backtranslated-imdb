If Todd Sheets had to come out and admit that this movie was meant to break the zombie genre, I'd make my rating eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line, and even every working nuance is meant to be a parody. I can probably compile the alphabet, rewrite what was left of the letters, and I still have a better script. In this movie, I think primarily of two scenes. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's father and the other father walk, I repeat walking along a staircase full of zombies. It is a small staircase and even if they collide with a diving undead, nothing happens to them. When they get to the end, the former seas turn around, "God, you're a horny bastard," and only lets one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs with zombie mechanics and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around him for about forty seconds, while being surrounded by zombies at his fingertips. He then almost runs out of the people and joins other people. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be seen as credible. However, I enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so fucking funny. Knit it to Todd Sheets to get so many people in his movie and have the opportunity to do it, but nothing else.
