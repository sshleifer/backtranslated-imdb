Hip. Erotic. Wickedly sexy ... whatever. It's a "Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The police save the girl (waitress!) From the Big Monster and refers to her defender. Leading actor Ryan Alosio is doing a good job of emulating Kyle Reese ... in the police area is a massacre ... a bad man is muscled with red eyes ... and even includes a dialogue "You said he never finishes. The scary script comes from the scriptwriter for the first time who, thanks to God, has not sold anything since then, and all this has been put together by the famous bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The film opens on the strip bar (always a good sign) and the average-looking biker boy breaks without any apparent reason One is black and (shock horror!), who can kill in the first five minutes. The movie goes downhill in the next hour, then gets up with some of the decent sequences of action before it is rounded with an abysmal ending. <br /> <br /> In most cases cast as competent participants who do what they get with a bad script and a director who is less satisfied. they don't seem to learn how to act in this movie, Alosio shows signs of talent with some supportive pain. In the human form of DarkWolf, Gargantuan plays Kane Hodder, who is known for his numerous Jason Vorhees images on Friday 13th. He's decent enough, especially since he's not used to talking about roles. <br /> <br /> It has become famous among teenage boys' groups between the Lesbian Roof Scene and Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who get their set a few times with the great tradition of former Power Rangers actors. And it is convincingly clear that the editor spent too much time on this scene ... anyway, the main salvation function is that the natural werewolf effects are pretty good and the wolf design isn't bad at all. is bad. Just bad. I mean seriously if you don't reach the level of reality - why bother? Just throw a little extra money into a make-up! Apart from the terrible script, this movie has moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. It is a good laugh if you have nothing better to do, but just don't spend money on it. Please.
