Shecky, is a godly legend, don't make a mistake. Until recently, I worked at the UK HiFi & Video retail chain where their testing department was working. We would go through a lot of new starters, they should expect to learn how to find a bug in order to find a variety of detritus returning from shops in one way or another in a non-functional way. Now tortu ^^^^^ test these new employees' solution, we would give them a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this movie, because if someone who bought a particular Goodmans DVD player that had this movie as a free gift returned to their DVD player, they never went back to Shecky. Our new employees would only be forced to use Going Overboard to test these machines for errors until they found a disc or two to test them. <br /> <br /> Now, why is this movie so bad where I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who may be so funny, like Happy Gilmore or Pulmel, must be hell one day. The rest of the team bounces and what is it with Billy Zane? His name stays with the worst films of many times and he is a decent actor. Hull. Production quality is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would have been ready to give it to zero if I could, because they didn't even have the interior to call it the full name: 'release. Even so, it's worth seeing how far Sandler has come and how small he can go.
