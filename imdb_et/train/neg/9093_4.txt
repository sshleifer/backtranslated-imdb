I saw this movie for the first time today and I haven't heard it before, probably because of this bad message. First, the management itself is pretty good, the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is great. But this alone does not make a movie. There is no story at all, behind beautiful exploitable talents. <br /> <br /> Or do I have to remember people, the director's art is not only your vision, but also the story. And this is a 7-minute absence. <br /> <br /> There's a simple 4 rating.
