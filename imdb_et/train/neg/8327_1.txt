OKAY. So this is a low budget movie "(I used quotes because it was recorded on Hi-8 video.) Action is generally scary, makeup is ridiculous (blood looks like it was from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more bruises made from halloween ghouli sets) ) and lighting in general looks like they used someone's borrowed Toyota accelerator headlights for actors. <br /> <br /> If there had been any real content, maybe I could give them a low budget feature when the movie tried to tell the story. this set of video footage can be some kind of plot, no real signs and no breath. This is a self-evident confusion. <br /> <br /> And don't worry - there's no spoiler here because there's nothing to ruin.
