I was hoping that this movie was at least traceable. There was little to say about the plot. I had been waiting much more than considering a cast line (I don't know if any of them adds it to their CVs?). At least I didn't pay to rent it. The best part of the movie is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the movie is perfect and perfect.
