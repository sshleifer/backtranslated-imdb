Power Rangers, a totally awful show of the 1990s, still disturbs the joy and terrible settings of toddlers. <br /> <br /> This show was not an entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children about violence children fight with each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> Toys were further evidence of violent TV promotion and promotion. <br /> <br /> I've never been able to figure out what the purpose of this totally ridiculous exhibition is. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst-performing children's shows.
