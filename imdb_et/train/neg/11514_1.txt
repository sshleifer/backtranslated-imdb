There is no doubt that when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, it was that they both thought it would help their film career. Once you've reviewed "Swept Away," you know that this level was a game made in hell. After nearly 20 years trying to become a respected actor (or "mattress" because he could have declared it "at best"), he still can't get out long enough for anyone with a taste to even call decent. And this is the thing that makes people so much to the screen: this intestinal feeling that its ego is so pumped that it prevents it from just going and communicating with its audience. If there is justice in this universe, he just blew his last chance.
