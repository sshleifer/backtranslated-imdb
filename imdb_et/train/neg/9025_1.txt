Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV production. I saw a lot of material and wait for a professional movie like "Stormriders" - what I presented was a low budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. Not Atmosphere, Very Dull, More Than Worse Fight Scenes. Some good ideas - no more. I hope I will have the opportunity to make such a movie and then show you how to make this movie !!! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN Tips: "MUSA - WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
