Special Effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. No plot. No depth. Does not mean. This movie made Superman a meaningless hero, without an archetypal hero. In his original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here he represented not only Hull. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actors were fine. Among other things, Kevin Spacey was a good choice. <br /> <br /> It still does not solve the problem that this film had no depth. I don't see how anyone makes this movie meaningful when Superman was and is set up daily to be a meaningful hero not only in comics but also in people's minds. It was a real waste of money considering how much the film could have been. <br /> <br /> Just a few cases: Lex Luthor could have been a global corporation, political domination, totalitarianism, and seemingly and still. He was just another goofball incarnation of Hackman. <br /> <br /> And Superman? Why was he in this movie? Nothing but a hacker "rescuer". Wait until you see this dollar in the theater.
