Anyone who has said it is better than a hostel is talking about a complete mess, believe me I'm not a fan of the hostel, but it's just ridiculous. It's just another camera camera, right on DVD, a little waste of ideas, I can't believe how many of these movies are, and I still see decent. In the 1980s, video nasties, gore and horror films were made without budgets, but with a great story and new ideas, and most importantly, the director's heart and soul had something to say. Now they just seem to be pumped out to try to browse people in Blokster for renting a copy until people stop doing it, so I think these movies will continue to appear. This film is so low on ideas that it is just amazing how it ever was made, the operation is also terrible, the location is completely convincing and the soundtrack is so annoying that light faith. There's nothing to waste with this time, unless you've tried to make a list of the worst movies ever. My best / worst part is when a female character sees a weapon against someone and threatens to shoot them if they don't let it go. grip. Absolute joke.
