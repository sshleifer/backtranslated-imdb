In 1985 I caught this thing via cable (I can't even call it a movie). I was in college and was at a high school friend whose hormones were out of control. I thought it was hopeless. A stupid script (a number of old men hiring some young boys to show them how women score), bad behavior (one exception), and pathetic jokes. Rich female nakedness kept my friend happy for a while, but even she was bored after 30 minutes. Remember - it was HIGH SCHOOL! It was back before nudity was so easy on the Internet and such. We watched the hope of something interesting or funny, but it never happened. The most fun thing was the original advertising campaign where the studio admitted that this movie was nonsense! (One poster had a fictional review that said, "This is the best movie I've seen in the afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead gave any talents and has actually moved on to an entrepreneurial career. Lack of budget and boring R&D. Skip it.
