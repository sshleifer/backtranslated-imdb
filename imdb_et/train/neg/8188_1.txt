The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its idea that when a person becomes holy, he lives forever with his and his family and his other important life. Let us not forget that when the saint is sanctified, the saint must be dead and the saints have no other. This is the millennium Nick has been to Jolly Elf Fred Scroog, which is never even suggested! Go to Nick to learn how to make toys, and learn to control numbers; Nick gave the sick child a dolly, Fred, who took back the hosts, with the family farm! After some of the episodes that appear today in the ventilation of his spleen siblings by Fred, his companions lose empathy. Then I just wrote a more coherent story about idiot! <br /> <br /> This Santa Claus, one of the "ho, ho, ho, ho" massive coronaries, is a nervous nerve mixed with the Queen of Harp, an operation directly from Mega-Mall Hell and answers to the board (what?), which just gave Easter its pink egg. Oh, and his right-hand person is a funny blonde, a leather-resistant mini-dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me over the edge was Slam named # 1 on the Naughty list. Shouldn't the Naughty List be reserved for future Hitler and Stalinists? Children who are real realities of evil? Well, Old Storm-Fingers, a good guy who's lashed out because he's unwanted and unloved, is a Demon seed! <br /> <br /> The names behind Fred Claus should be boiled in his bottle! Bah!
