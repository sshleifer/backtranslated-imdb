The standard procedure for Swedish films seems to be starting today to throw credibility out of the window and continue this process for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a movie that makes little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm have been abducted by a very effective "military" robber. Two police officers are going to investigate a case that will soon become more complicated than it first appears. <br /> <br /> As usual in Swedish film, most of the same people you have ever seen have made up. Michael Persbrandt must be on every Swedish movie in recent years! But this is OK, I think, because Persbrandt is one of the few who will work here (as usual). The problems with this movie are mainly the story around the story. First of all, robberies usually feel the background. Rather, it is more of a film about a young policeman who is fighting to prove himself in the male world (as has been done thousands of times with a decent actress Sofia Helini). There is also an incredible plot near the end, which seems to be just as credible as landing aliens. But I still thought it was a pretty touch because I was sleeping halfway. This spiced things a bit (and actually saved the rating one more step). <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the main problem is the same as most other Swedish films of this type. Just that the act and the relationship do not conform to the standards we are accustomed to from other such films (mostly from Hollywood). In comparison, it looks cheap and quite weak. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on the plot and on action and forget about trying to "light the Hollywood action" as they are doing now. Because it will become another unforgettable effort by the Swedish film industry. I appreciate it 3/10.
