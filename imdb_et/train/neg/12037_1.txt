This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrible action, terrible effect, terrible writing, my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood that it is amazing. They just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract the audience. It could also be called Mr Bland's new adventures. <br /> <br /> Someone commented that if you had imagination, you would love this example. This is a terrible approach to the TV series. Such visual media should create your imagination, you should not do your imagination to make it good. It would be like the Simpson episode, where they try to wash Homer temporarily with a religious propaganda film and he talks about who killed who or whatever. "If the movie is boring, I'll just make my story." <br /> Finally: Absolute Human Waste.
