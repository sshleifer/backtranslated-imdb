Words can't simply describe how this movie is terrible. I watched it last night on the video and I just couldn't believe what I saw. Basically, the "Snake Theater" means the former military (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his abducted sister who has been detained by the Deliverance-style Rednecks. The operation, writing, directing, photography and editing of the film is unfortunate with the song "Soldier", which must be one of the worst song songs ever! <br /> <br /> "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) "Welcome Back Carter" is a film that plays a ridiculous bad guy. Otherwise, avoid this confusion ALL COSTS.
