It was by far the worst film I've ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar was an expression of empty fears and shocks in her old play letter. He could not sell his character or sell anyone on another picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought Grudge was "eternal," don't look at it if you can't enjoy your waste. time and your life saw. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for free, so I don't want it to meet like a man who lost eight dollars in a terrible movie. It was free, it was still sucked, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
