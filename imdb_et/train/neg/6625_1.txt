this is the first time I have commented on an IMDb movie. but I had to write it. 3-hour torture. Starting u get the idea that the movie is bad. acting is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (I loved her bhagat singh), but she's the worst in this movie. it seems that amitabh has worked hard for that, but there is no fear of it. prashant raj is a maker. and the most irritating part of the film is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director took this movie. the background is repeated. somehow I felt that ramu tried to repeat the sarcars, the color theme, the background point, the camera corner, but it didn't work. DO NOT REQUEST IT
