The film was so insecure that the creators hoped to produce the original film Noir classic title, "Farewell My Lovely," I thought it would be plausible to assume that this was a remake. The characters are so unpleasant and unpleasant that he deserved the cold reception for the first time. Time only adds to its absurdity. Because there is no cunning, cinematic, desperate or desperate in the classical dagger, he relied on a plot of twisted and meaningless crime that would easily have led to several hours of arrests. As if it were not enough, it was a totally sexless erotic experiment where at least one of the participants was not swimming for several days. It made it even more painful to see this confusion. Find a good classic forty or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours in the event of a breakdown.
