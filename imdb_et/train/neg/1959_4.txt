A tooth fairy is a ghost of an old deformed witch that attracts children to her house to receive a prize for their open tooth and then take her life. The first few minutes will introduce you to the fairy tale legend of the beginning of 1949 and now turn to this day. The worn horror is saved by quite solid actions. They could have done without Hammond's brothers and some other scenes, but generally the gore scenes were bloody, but fast, with minimal effect. Eyeballs are pretty good for both sexes. Camera work is good. The dialogue is fair, but cheesy. I was expecting the film to be empty bones, a low budget, with very few redemption factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
