I've leased and watched this movie for the first time on a DVD, reading any comments on it. So, after 15 minutes of viewing, I've noticed that there's something wrong with this movie; it's terrible! I mean, trailers seemed scary and serious! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So stupid, it's funny ...? ANSWER!) She should look and learn from better horror comedy, such as: "Fear of Night", "Lost Boys" and "Return of Living Dead"! These are funny! <br /> <br /> "Salon Fever" is why I signed up for www.IMDb.com so I could get rid of my thoughts. <br /> <br /> decided to watch the movie for the second time> AAARGH! <and take notes on my partial "review" to show how the movie is stupid. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, where's my car?" (comedy) I can watch and enjoy again and again! But that's ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can script and director be ??? This is bad. Here are the terrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In earlier scenes, we see Henry, who doesn't understand that his dog is lying on the ground with his tongues hanging out of his mouth and dead glass dead! <br /> <br /> The film does not explain anything about a blonde long-haired child who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong in the forest?") is "nothing." The script is that a bearded man warns them of forests just for a "temporary". <br /> <br /> Then the 5-pack, Bert's "smartest" gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He will now meet the infected Henry, who is asking for help and here the film wants to break when using the F-word. Bert starts to amaze, because Henry seems terribly ill. Bert: "Don't let me let you!" (he forgets to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert drives the cabin back, but how? She meets Marcy and Jeff, who had sex, but now they decide to walk! Marcy wisely removes the unattended camp that Bert had previously started (the moment of change was clear?) Bert does not mention any words about Henry because he feels he killed him with his BB weapon. <br /> <br /> Later, when the five estates sit around their campfire, one more weird will appear with their dog. (Maybe this is a warning about the forests? It's full of strange ... and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them just because he has a big cannon filled with cannabis. (Their brain is completely intoxicated! No wonder they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we see this unforgettable character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry will appear in his cabin, (NOTE: He lied a few meters away from their cabin !!!), which was worse, almost like a zombie that was covered! He says he needs a doctor. But the young Einsteins refuse to help poor mammals. He gets into his unlocked truck, which of course also has an ignition key. Henry seems almost clever enough to get away from hell, but starts to turn the blood on the dashboard, seats and windows. Fantastic Five Appears Rolling, Armed: BB Gun, Knife, Baseball bat (* huh? Ever tried baseball in the woods in the middle?), Poker and (Insecticides?) Ready to fight against one, unarmed and terribly ill person. (smart script!) Bert succeeds in killing a car with one BB weapon, which is only possible for director Eli Roth. "What else should I do?" Bert screams in his defense. Jeff and Paul are trying to hit Henry with his bats and poker, but forgot and crashes instead of windows. Henry walks to foolish girls who say, "He's coming to us!" (Thank you for the information, the dark ones, I see it! But I don't think she wants to do any harm to you!) Marcy sprays her eyes, making Henry yelp! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's hand with a burning log that they burned incredibly in the cabin. (Where's all this wisdom gone? I think cannabis started taking its toll! :-) Henry turns into a Human Torch and runs away, screams. <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff head to the mechanic. And Marcy decides to "get help himself" in the woods when Paul falls behind Karen ... Isn't that idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "helping!" How's he canoeing? Does he even know where he is going? Anyway, he goes by the river and finds a very large and seemingly deserted cabin and, like most horror films, walks inside the cab saying, "Hi? Is anyone there?" Bert suddenly jumps behind the furniture and scares him (and me first). And Jeff will come along. How did they get here? Did they swim across the river? Do you see how the script is meaningless? <br /> <br /> Winston's Deputy will meet in Paul's salon. He does not notice the blood on his truck. It takes about 35 minutes of viewing, and I've decided to torture and get the DVD out. (Before I take my eyes out! ... Now, it's funny!) "Return of the Living Dead". Then you will see that they are more entertaining than this ... thing. Even the "Toxic Avenger Part 2", which is also a sad film, is MORE funnier than "Cabin Fever".
