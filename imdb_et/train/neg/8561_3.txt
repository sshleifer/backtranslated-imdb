Cowboys could leave the saddle a little painful. Definitely not one of John's best movies. Don't make me wrong if any John Wayne moves, there are always some good places. And it has a fair share. But the whole picture is moving slowly and simply does not fulfill the aspirations it could have. Bruce Dern is once again making a remarkable piece of work. Roscoe Lee Brown is the second bright spot in the film. The children in the movie were average, but they could have been improved. This would be a good movie for eight to fifteen year old movie visitors. <br /> <br /> It would be a good family to move with your children to watch. Note that there are a couple of scenes you might want to watch before you let the youth see it. But most of the kids I know who have seen this movie. Perhaps this is because they see children at their age when they do all the adult work.
