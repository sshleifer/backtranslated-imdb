Young scientist Harry Harrison continues his recent father's scientific research on limb recovery with flying colors, but his interfering dominance is dominated by his mother and his doctor lover wanting to sell the serum. When he discovers, Harry loses his accident. So, he's trying the serum and what's the genetically corrupted hand that has his mind. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen it so many times before, but the one that raises this very bumpy and fairly rubberized shonky junk is a play by Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, this is not a bad flick of Fangoria films; just there are better ones that are vein-like. "Servers Ties" simply do not have their own peculiarity. The oddball style and the unpleasant splatter resembled the "Re-animator" and even a little stroke sticker like "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> Comics are really black humor, but it can become melodramatic and a little dry from a fun factor. Surprise, especially the end result of flick. What is well accepted, because I thought it could have been made more accessible. With low-budget production, FX makeup can be rigid and very silly, but there are some grotesque moments that make you smile than actually crumble. Even the sexual tension brush simplifies the story thanks to Elke Sommer's acute juiciness as a mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorous in the hostile sense of the devil and he pulls it out very well. They were both incredibly divergent, like the couple you hated. Billy Morrisette is amazing when Harry is insecure. Director Damon Santostefano pulls the film quickly and organizes some stylish scenes with a thrilling and frightening horror. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a minor and basically silly useless, but you have to give it to some unwanted entertainment.
