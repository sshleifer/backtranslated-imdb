On the way side, there is a soldier, making sure every1 is following the speed limit (when doing his job); then he pulls over a woman who seems to be a mother (the back seat has a child); then he tells him what's wrong and BAM ... they're killed. Okay, this is the beginning of what I personally thought was a good movie. When I saw this movie in the theater, I was with my friends. It was our first night after the summer that we wanted to go and watch a good movie. We all decided to see a temporary / thriller that seemed like a good group to everyone ... it was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Not only did he destroy the $ 7.oo movie on the ticket, but I have to sit in the brain through torture. This movie started with mystery and difference, and I was serious about "it can't be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it doesn't make sense; Even if you get against the bad behavior, "not so scary" storyline and all over the terrible confusion this movie was, then still puzzled. It is not because you are not smart enough to understand it, because no person with a brain understands what this stupid movie is. Now you can think of "Oh man! I have to watch this movie to see if it's as bad as this person says". HOW TO REMEMBER YOUR BIG NOW !!! I'm trying to save you from the trouble of watching this movie, saying it is so bad that there's no point in even seeing it. Please, people don't make the same mistake I thought this film has potential ... it's not. I'm going to give this movie from 1 to 10 (if I could give it to zero) and I don't recommend anyone to see this movie, you save yourself a lot of sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. this amazing movie is.
