Before this TV movie started, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the last episode of the series was transmitted and many of the series's originals were lost. President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta are not. If you remember, in the second to last episode of the series, all regulars, except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, left permanently B-5. Now this movie has brought back Garibaldi (who wasn't in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the captain and doctor make a short and irrelevant look. But since so much of the old chemistry has gone, this film is already seriously disabled. the souls that are hidden from the repository of the archaeologist (Ian McShane). There is a lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff, but frankly, it was pretty stupid and pointless. Yes, yes, the station almost blew, but it was saved and everything, but frankly I felt it was that it was "done - and it was done much better earlier". <br /> <br /> The secondary plot, which was offered for more comical relief, was much more interesting because the entrepreneur installed the holo-brothel and those who ordered it were not sure what to do with it, and when they tried to close them, they were punches with the case. It was fluffy, but it gave a couple of laughs - there was definitely no other terrible plot. By the way, Sheen did a good job at the beginning when he played with his Hunter. eyes and bizarre delivery. But repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character. It should have been noticed and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the ultimate decision is that it's just a hard hardness B-5 (like me). Others who see it can be assumed that the series is sucked - which is a great injustice. This is a great example of an exhibition that doesn't know when to give up.
