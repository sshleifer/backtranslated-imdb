This movie should have been called Need for Speed: The Movie. For those who haven't played games, Need For Speed ​​is mainly about hot cars and beautiful women, and almost no plot. This is great for Redline. The only thing about A-level movies was cars. The action seemed forced and written, the assumption was at best weak and the plot was almost non-existent. I was really watching this movie to see how bad it was and even though it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was fun. I just wish they had shown Eddie Griffin fell into Enos somewhere in the movie. All in all, don't pay for it, don't go your way to see it, but if it's in Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a good distraction.
