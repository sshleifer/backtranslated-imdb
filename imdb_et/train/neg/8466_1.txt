The word fails. <br /> <br /> And it's not normal. <br /> <br /> Properly, it could have been a great, funny B-movie sci-fi, but unfortunately it wasn't. There are so few competent players in the drama field who have so much won the script with such a dog-breakfast. I can only confirm the reviews of the previous reviewer - get clean in the bathroom. Actually, do something except watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Positive: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negative: everything else. <br /> <br /> The most suitable line: "It doesn't go anywhere". <br /> <br /> If only every plastic surgeon could meet this fate.
