I've seen about four other Japanese horror films and they were not too impressive. But I can feel that the way was led by a reasonable script. <br /> <br /> Not here, somehow. It's about a detective who is trying to tie up similar murders that have occurred. When he suspects a suspect, he suspects the freaks because they see the spirit. Then the ghost monitors the detective ONE REASON, THAT YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN VERIFIED AND MUST BE ALL BIRTHDAY. <br /> <br /> Enough bad? Oh no. The film continues to exchange perspectives with different characters who don't have a lot of story. I've seen it in other movies, where it shows a different perspective. That's not the case here. <br /> <br /> Also, what's happening on the screen is coming to an end, which is actually acceptable. For example, there are some scenes with a slight instrumental score that accumulates and ... then it just cuts to another scene. I know it can have a dramatic effect. This is definitely not the goal here. It's just bad editing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a "ghost" that just screams in a way that is neither scary nor inadvertently funny. It's annoying and it happens all over the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> All fears have been made in the past in better ways so you can see them all. Then after one of them, the movie is over. Then the audience was confused by the wave of confusion, because I felt we all felt we were wasting our time. Someone made a glimpse and laugh. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, OPEN.
