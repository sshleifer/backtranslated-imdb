Poor will begins to run in his grave if he can adapt to the classic game. It is obvious that very little money was spent on it. As a set, the staircase, the walkway and some randomly spaced columns leave. The movie was dubbed English in English, occasionally poisoned by English speakers. The whole production had a very dark and harsh feeling. And right where this film was Fonterbras? MST3K gave this regrettable treatment, which he did well. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I wish this film had never been the first.
