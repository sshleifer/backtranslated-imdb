This part of the horror masters was terrible. Obviously, Mr Carpenter has to learn from this or two temple and decent, plausible dialogues. There were times when I literally yelled at the TV to happen. Perhaps he thinks he is building a relationship, but Carpenter has to cut back on his (or his son's) music score and move on. How many times did the girl say, "Oh no, I can't get this baby!" and "Oh, here's not coming"? Carpenter takes many, much better films (Assault on Precinct 13 and Thing) and throws them here as we should recognize and appreciate their brand style. There is no real intercourse and energy here. It would be like he was dreaming about making a movie. <br /> <br /> For better Carpenter movies, try out the tried and true classics - thing, halloween and they live. For the best horror episodes, see my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer, and Dreams in the Soviet House.
