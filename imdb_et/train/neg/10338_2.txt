This movie is just plain. <br /> <br /> Casting Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer is the costly climax of the film's predictable wood. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put the pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer shatters things to get the truth. This film makes Hammer a boy, surrounded by bad guys who are ... well, too stupid to get something. One is so badly drawn that he is giving up the popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the movie are instantly played by three stooges. For example, Veldi's dance is a barril or a bad guy who accidentally behind his boss. And continuity interruptions are disgraceful: Frau Blucher runs down the middle of the road when the camera is stretched on its feet, but it is over half as the camera pulls the wider picture back. The worst fracture, however, is before the popcorn attack. A bad guy, who is pursuing Hammer, goes after our hero for a second, except the clock shows that he was behind the man in seven minutes. <br /> <br /> To be fair, some of the camera's corners and lighting were interesting, and the finals are so bad that it needs to be seen, which is the only reason he gets two points out of ten points.
