It is 1982, two years after the Iranian Embassy was restricted, which included Balconys' dramatic SAS rescue, and during the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, which is a better film than the Gung-Ho "SAS" movie, which is creating a siege of Iranian hostage using at the same time Britains' one-day hero, Lewis Collins. throw Edward Woodward and some other well-known actor and you have a winner in your hands? ... Maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the act is quite another. it is like a long episode of a "Professionals" movie, but without a formula. This movie is not going anywhere fast and is quite predictable. Perhaps Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to scrape Lewis Collins Touted James Bond as a substitute for Roger Moore. See if your Lewis Collins or SAS fan in general, if not, save your time.
