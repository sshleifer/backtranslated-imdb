In my goodness, this film is bad. I completely deceived my local movie review because it is a certified garbage. Yes, yes, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black ... and always good guys to win. Now go home and hug your children and feel how good Hollywood has known you. Blech! I can't believe that this brain dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I think he needed a little money to pay the mortgage, so he made that piece of coal. This is a kind of production that makes anyone who watches movies on a regular basis believe that they can do as good or better as an experienced director. <br /> <br /> You see, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves his father to do a bad thing about IL or he hurts him. But being a female neighbor, we know she'll save the day and beat the bad guys ... in the end. Girls power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Now, only the idiot finds this entertaining ... "skateboarder", let alone something fresh or new. All of the super-duper reviews you see on this site come from industry cages, who either make money for this flick, pay back or have sold their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful .... yes, that's it. Not a good result, not terrible ... he's just cute. He should have shown a lot of skin to record the whole movie. He's not tough enough to be a good female CEO. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was satisfactory for at least 28 days. But here he plays buggy who pretends to be smart. She gets her ass 5'5 '' McAdams because she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she has all the Tae Bo tapes. he should be able to hire an international terrorist. I don't trust him to steal a 7-11 rubber pack. <br /> <br /> You see, this movie was made earlier, except before they did it well. Go again to a Die Hard movie. You have dangerous loved ones, international terrorists, except the characters are more pleasant and credible, and the bad guys are more competent and interesting about WAY. I just don't understand how Hollywood can continue such a mess as if they were attentive to the models they could easily copy. No wonder the movie's revenue has fallen. <br /> <br /> Throw your 6 dollars in the toilet and save 2 hours of your life so you never get back. <br /> <br /> ciao, FreddyShoop
