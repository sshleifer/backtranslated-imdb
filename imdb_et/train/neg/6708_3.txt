Turn your backs off or go MY BOYFRIEND BACK! Only a happy ending can blossom your innocence, full of darkness and punishment at the moment you look at it. It's safe to say that the whole movie breaks down, the sarcastic approach and respect for the zombie shows that defy the mess that max. We get such a name as "Johnny" so often, and "Johnny" doesn't go anywhere. There is no specific reason why our "dead body" climbs out of the grave only to survive until the night, so it makes the film completely useless. Without sadness, her mother is convinced that she will tell the doctor that she is dead. Then Johnny bites out of Eddie's hand. The audience is asked a hard question: Why should this film be this cornball? The answer is there. All similarities with all living or dead persons are purely random. "Life" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the film. Show it to your girlfriend and leave her between the parents, making her life an abandoned ruin. Blah !!!
