Our group looked at this movie really disgusting. We were ready to forgive that our favorite character Jo wasn't (it doesn't like the writers / manufacturers to do something about it). Writing was bad, the script was sub-par. What really disturbed us: 1. If two men realized that they both got to know Natalie, they just did not leave it with this stupid (and ultimately humiliating) competition - just because they were macho-competing boys, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite the fact that Natalie cannot choose between two boys before the meeting, she suddenly decides she loves one man and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no prediction that he was really a better boy, as if the writers had resembled a coin and then he would just spit it in a suitable place in the movie). 3. Blair talks about how she does not want children and then suddenly when her husband says she wants to have children, she agrees with her happily.
