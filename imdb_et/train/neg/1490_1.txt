First, Jenna Jameson is the best actor in this movie and she is just terrible. This movie has all the horror in the imaginary clich√© and all badly played. Coed teenager couple. Comic (not) horny jock. An exciting cool chick. Terrible local color guy. Parent-type couple. A virgin chick, who is not going to die in these films. The dialogue is so painful and terrible that it is hidden in the depth of the pool. It's almost like you want them all to die earlier. I saw this movie some time ago, but somehow worsened. Of course, the most funny thing here is trying to eat Jameson's implants, but it hardly even appreciates renting this dog. Avoid at all costs.
