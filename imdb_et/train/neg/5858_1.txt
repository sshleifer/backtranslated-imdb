It was shared with fans because the "winner takes all" game took place between two separate "companies" (World Wrestling Federation and "Alliance": joining former WCW and ECW superstars. Was a tag-team game, wrestlers were limited to attacking opponents on either side, each wrestler concludes that it is necessary to interfernce to debit and intensify their opponents by hitting, performing a special move and tags with the partner. The event was previously hidden by Vince so that the alliance member would be fradulent and join the WWF in general: very innovative story but poor Filling, which is not a scarcity of wrestlers, because the game format is tag-team. The rest of the games are simply reluctant: <br /> <br /> Edge versus T est: The test is a strong "big boot", but it didn't show both letters real talent. <br /> <br /> Al Snow Versus Christian: A good match but superflous for a fee <br /> Taji versus William Regal: The worst match of the evening <br /> <br /> Battle of Immunity Royal: It was an extraordinarily fun game to watch, but since the main stars of both companies were the main event, only the wrestler, who typically appears in "Heat", is probably a lightweight heavy rejection of WCW (ie Hurricane, who is simply hired as an entertainer) < br /> <br /> Hardy Boyz versus Dudley Boyz: The Best Evening Evening: Jeff Hardy performed the Swanton Bomb at the top of the cage and through the wooden table, Matt was a wedge that seemed extremely painful. <br /> <br /> Since Stone Cold was a WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was Hardcore Champion and Kurt Angle was a mole in the Alliance. All the main alliances in the "Alliance" faction main event were awarded after the game, except Booker T., who recently attacked the "Raw" wrestler and inevitably works. Shane McMahon returns to the television somehow and everyone wanted to acknowledge the "alliance" fall and death to see the work of Stone Cold. WWF has done much better. A race where all the slopes were moved to one group would have been better and ever got Casket and Iron Man?
