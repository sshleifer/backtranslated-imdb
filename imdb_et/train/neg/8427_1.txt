Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a medieval man who seems to be able to fulfill his dreams for his overflowing, manipulative father, it was incredibly easy and fun to look into practice. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly one of the largest British presses of all time. In my TV series, 10 out of 10 ratings are not reserved. <br /> <br /> This movie spin-off on the other hand is a real tragedy in every sense. Hardly a television program is basically not delivered to the film successfully. This film has a very terrible, depressing tone that almost repeated me as tears. Seeing Harold beat in a pub (not in a comic way), it's not my idea of ​​comedy, but is definitely one of the reasons why fans of TV shows don't like it. The film was painfully uneven, except for the scene where Albert bathed the sink and sees the neighbor. <br /> <br /> The romance of Harold and Zita is totally shining and it makes me wonder if the producers of this film ever watched TV shows. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not removers. <br /> <br /> Albert responded to Harold's girlfriend's remarks against him in the television series with utter pride. In the film, Albert says practically anything, when such an opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> Most British sitcom movies are quite boring, except for the movies ON THE BUSES (in some respects, the respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But STEPTOE AND SON must be on the ground at the bottom, even GEORGE and MILDRED below. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip it and see another spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. This is a much brighter tone, more for the TV series and very funny.
