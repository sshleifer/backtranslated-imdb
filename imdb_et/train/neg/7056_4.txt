This movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go horribly wrong. I really expect at least something from this movie to have seen an add that was funny as hell, but the film wasn't half as good. <br /> <br /> The strange part is that jokes are actually funny, spoofs, smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc are really good jokes, but I don't know who to blame for the movie. <br /> <br /> The main candidates can be: - 1) hammers (actors) and hammeresses (actors) and not even funny type 2) Director 3) The man who put the actors and / or the director anyway if you are really bored and i really mean this movie, or else i can get a copy of any of this ad or teaser and laugh at your butt because they are a lot of funnier than a movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only rescue grace this movie is mahesh manjrekar and funny chappu bhai
