This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was terrible! I can't emphasize it enough! Action, leadership, story, characters and all that was bad! It was so horny and clich√©. Don't be fooled, or the label line "Texas Massacre" is nothing to laugh at. "Are you joking! That was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until it reaches the main character, Brendan, OK to turn it off. I got from the movie:" Ugly, annoying and immature people go to the forest In the middle of the cabin and the clown that sings the nursery rhymes, they kill in uneven and fake ways. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money, and also a waste of money and time! I hurry through most of the movie because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it was still not worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time. This is seriously the worst movie EVER! Rating: not worth it.
