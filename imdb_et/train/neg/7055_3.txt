lets start by saying "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic film. I agree with the last person who said, "I missed the joy". lol. <br /> <br /> The jokes were just terrible. The performances were average. Something went horribly wrong with the film. Emra deserves something better. All CELINA JAITLEY did the revelation. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. The emhra hashmi was also fine. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate man who wants to become famous. so he uses RADHA and pretends he loves him, just because his father is a music director and can help him become famous (because his father follows everything the daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to the GOA to have fun. There he meets with ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls completely behind his looks and tries to flirt with his BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then ROMA will not be able to open the door to her room and MANN will decide to help her. Seeing he can't, ROMA asks for help. When he's gone, MANN can open the door and decide to enter and sit in bed at BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes and they have one night. But the fact that one night stands still falls in love with her. This morning, they saw the underworld don (MAHESH) who sees it all. Don loves ROMA and couldn't stand what he saw. He tells them to marry and frighten that MANN follows the queue and Merry ROMA. Then the news of their marriage will arrive in the newspaper. MANN later learned that he loves ROMA after making a music video together. Now he is trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible. Songs "SINI NE SINI NE" is fantastic, remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title is also fantastic. GUYS OUT OF THIS MOVIE.
