I like Chris Rock, but I feel he's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​Heaven's Can Wait recovery is good, but the filmmakers followed this turquoise too close. When Eddie Murphy repaired Dr. Doolittle and Professor The Nutty, he made them completely, so they got Murphy's movies / vehicles, not just dull remakes. That's why they were successful. Had Chris done the same, it would have been a much better film. Few laughs that come are when she does her routine routine - so she can also have made a concert movie. It would also have been a lot of fun if the white man whose body he was living was a truck driver or a mountain rider. So, why does Hollywood continue to spam like that? Because people go see it - because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Don't make such movies that were not so good at first!
