Hiya people, <br /> <br /> This movie really sucks. Think Conversely, "Love Actually". Nothing fits right, nothing is cohesive, and certainly you don't laugh. Love is rare in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the whole flop. However, as shown, there are three redemption points for the film's mangled potential. <br /> <br /> A) Jennifer Love Hewitt's star-billing boys are there to show grace to just catch a glimpse of petite Hewitt's uniforms. To say now that boys .... have some promising scenes .... but it's really a weak eye candy. Here are the "options" immersed. Nonetheless, I watched the whole thing tempted by your next scene is ...... titling! That this is the opposite and "top" is relevant ... ... for me it was still a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a nice friendly man ........ THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worth 10 or more dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 on the way, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt became the legend of the next cushion. Although I will take it back ..... it depends largely on her next movie. Oh, and his sister is so stupid. Her husband is so stupid ... and what the hell, he's stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. can't wait for the next love with JLH!
