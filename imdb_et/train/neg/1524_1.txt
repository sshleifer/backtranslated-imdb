Words fail. It was very difficult to watch this movie and I wish I hadn't done it afterwards. While I tried to sit down to the final credit, I have to admit that I couldn't last longer than an hour so my opinion could be unfair. But this film would need the most impressive third in the history of filmmaking to give it an overview that is nothing more than annoying. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at any part of this movie.
