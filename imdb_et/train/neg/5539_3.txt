The Wimpy-stuffed shirt, Armand Louque (a rarely played veteran actor by Dean Jagger, in a rare leading role) joins a group of scientists who want to find and destroy the secret technique of zombies. Armand falls to the lovely Claire Duval (pulling blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses peaceful juice to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (hopelessly woody Robert Noland) to marry her. The tough Claire uses and invades, Armand uses voodoo knowledge to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well, it's not sure. For starters, Victor Halperin's static (non) direction allows meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod with excruciatingly slow pace. Worse still, Halperin is not able to bring tension, atmosphere and momentum to an extremely stubborn procedure. Most of the time, blah, who is in painful pain, does not help; only George Cleveland as the cheerful General Duval and E. Alyn Warren, as a terrible Dr Trevissant, can make their welcome and refreshing hammion. The Drippy stock movie library score, painfully obvious stages associated with sets and raw film art are also quite weak and unimpressive. In fact, this weak excuse for intimidation is so harsh that even the inconspicuous eyes of Bela Lugos do not relieve the anxiety of the brain. Complexly bored.
