T.Z. Post, a college professor, gets the wrong letter in which he has inherited $ 750,000. Now, with financial resources, he gives up $ 4,000 of his life savings and decides to finally live. After shipment of the luggage to Chicago, he meets the traveling Vaudeville troupe and decides there to be good enough to show in Broadway. At night, the poor Prof Post must hide from his creditors, solve the relationship between his girlfriend Pansy and & floozy diva Eleanor and make sure that the exhibition continues. After watching many Keaton silent gems, it hurts to sit down, but I felt it could have been a lot worse. Casting Durante, Todd and Selwyn is sometimes very annoying, but still pleasant. Pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as a disappointed show director. 90% of the script is poorly written because MGM tries to exclude it as a poor man's Marx Bros film, where many visual disturbances fall flat from the start. Produced with Keaton's drinking problems, this film is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating- 3.
