Not the best looking movies today. I read a lot of comments about Shining and waited for it to be very good. But this movie deceived me. Sound and environment were good, but there was no story here. There was no moment of fear. I was expecting it to be a horror thriller movie, but there was no thrill thriller. The only scene I was afraid of was changing the chapter during a scene that shows "Wednesday". There are many fragments in the movie. Most things are left inexplicable if nothing is associated. The story doesn't tell us about the women shown or other scenes. In the 80s there may be a good film, but not in the 21st century.
