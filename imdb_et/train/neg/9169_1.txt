It really gets bad. The only half-time quality of redemption is the effect of the effects of thousands of films on the film. There are contextual errors everywhere. Operation is terrible, except for Kirk. The story is the same as the grail, and the belief that the film is a video game kills the film if it wasn't already in the body. So all this is a waste of your life. I would have given it a zero rating rating.
