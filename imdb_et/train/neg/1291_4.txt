I'm sad that history, which is so exciting and so rich in material on film, can make a ho-hum event. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, probably the most intriguing figure in the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, Ditto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who caught their murdered sister every time he got into battle. Instead, we were forced to look at fictitious signs that never evolved into someone we care about. as sad. The costumes, however, were wonderful, as was the place in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another movie ever since and try again, or some other filmmaker will explore the huge amount of material to write on the screen.
