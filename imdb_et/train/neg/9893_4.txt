I only hope that no classic / ancient historian saw Cleopatra, or when they did, they laughed. The film is intimidatingly inaccurate, more ridiculous, even as a "Gladiator" (which is at least a well written script whose historical errors are clearly expressed and correspond well). The most blatant of the Caesar heir is Octavius, who is before the Emperor's murder in the Senate: at the mature age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition, the actor is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint to James Bond when he says "Caesar. Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a ridiculously tight Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela is trying his best to be a seductive pharaoh (who in real life was not at all good looking) but looks like incredible. <br /> <br /> This is a warning to all historians - this movie is not alive!
