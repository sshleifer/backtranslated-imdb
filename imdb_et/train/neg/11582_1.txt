I am pleased to see that most of the other people here do not think of this film either. It has big names cast, but that's it. Nothing to recommend other than the ogling's some pretty women you can do in thousands of movies. <br /> <br /> The story contains nothing more than unlikely, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters that national film critics seem to all like .... and most of the public can't stand. <br /> <br /> The Oklahoma Accents are so fake that they are ridiculous, the southern racist stereotypes are straight from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is frustrating.
