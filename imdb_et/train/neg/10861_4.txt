Maybe I'm missing something because I've read more positive things about a person who deceives me when I've read bad comments - and I just don't get it. I like my noirs to have a little style for those who speak, watch and act like Humphrey Bogart at Big Sleep or Gene Tierney Lauris. No characters in this movie contain that style or presence or what you want to name it. Take the lead actor Lee J. Cobb. His rumored, lined-up look is so far away as you can find in a plain, fluently-spoken genre. Or take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst disturbances I've seen for a while. He's not just convincing in his role. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it is tired and there is no real surprise or anything new to the genre. I could have predicted myself, which was cheated in about five minutes. And this final cat and mouse chase is normal, boring. Ten to fifteen minutes, if nothing happens, it really was destroyed if the movie's temple could have done it.
