But a scientist-working woman puts round metal balls into people's mouths, which allegedly changes their personality, but in reality makes them crazy, zombie-type killers. The "guinea pigs" experiment is a little stuck, young nubile women who are in dire need of action. This movie is terrible, cruel and amazingly bad. This is a little logic in the script or not. You really have problems with the following operation. It has no special effects. The computer screen, which allegedly represents a great scientific development, sees nothing more than the old Atari screen. And even worse, there is also a doll whose hair is felt (looks like a lone child in a summer camp) called George, which is like a personal servant / trustee Jessica (the leading "actor"). Throughout the film, this doll is subjected to idiotic, sophisticated sentences. But wait ... you'll get girls with some boy boys soft, unnatural, barely naked scenes. All at the same time is the most disturbing in the background of music like some spiritual discovery. No participant is good. Bad is very different. The gore and "horror" aspects are particularly badly filmed. The film really looks like a youngster. No chance Henry Sala, the director named but not with the trade, hasn't made another movie yet. I was just bored with a coma who fools it, stupid! And how does it end? What happened? If you know you're letting me secret, because for my life I can't think of it. All I know is that I lost the time I saw this garbage, which made my dream come true at the start of my weekend!
