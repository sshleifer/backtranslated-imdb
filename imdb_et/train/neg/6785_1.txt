> You are warned that this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. The directions were well thought out. the actors were very good, especially Richard pryor tho i would have wanted to see him more. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classic. Dudley More God bless him could have done better. John Ritter would have wanted to see him again. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the writer's failure. Perhaps the manufacturer could have pulled the plug when he saw what he was a creator. It is too bad that so much money went into this boiler if there is little change and I think it would be fixed. They have to pay the standard prices of writers. For a single blow.
