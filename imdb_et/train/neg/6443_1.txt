I was one of the few liberals who showed Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... making propaganda films and boredom. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the film could be the actual documentary film of the Michael Moore local school, the UVSC visit, but it turned out to be another liberal, cutting and burning activity for the conservatives and the local religious community. Certainly, the filmmaker himself seems to be making a documentary that reflects only his perceptions of the issues. <br /> <br /> It's even more surprising to see all the "10" voices posted by his homes here. Did they even see the video? Golly gee Batman, this must be with all the president's men! Their ratings are as obvious as the advantage of this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, just like stacking IMDb voices helps flat film. Maybe my voice will help to balance it.
