This movie, despite its "independent" status, is a foolish Hollywood version of the foolish mother-daughter relationship. it wasn't so bad at first, but somewhere in the movie - about the time the daughter goes out with this guy, I think it turns into a mother-daughter adhesive film. im sorry but i dont know any mom who has such a relationship ... it's probably better.
