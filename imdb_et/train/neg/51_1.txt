this film was a big lag. the relentless cruelty and violence of this film was very disturbing. some of the scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and avid. the main characters were not able to identify or even understand. The head of the protagonist was as slippery as they came. in a hospital / hothouse atmosphere, he gave himself a top theater. little or nothing was known about the Spanish war in this film. fortunately I have been in Spain and realized that it is not realistic! In addition, the use of same-sex attractions as a horrible "horror" was also very offensive and poorly treated, while the DVD was packaged and promoted to attract viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles because if they were trying to get away from this fair, I think that if you want to kill children and pets cruelly, this movie may be a pleasure to you.
