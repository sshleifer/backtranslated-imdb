Like someone who had split up with Hero's incredible vision, I wanted to see this movie that was billed by the same lines, but better. It also had an actor who likes: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed in both parts. I bought this movie DVD invisibly invisible and it was a mistake. It wasn't better. . Blind woman who won hundreds of opponents? Sorry, it goes a little far. Also, the main male "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, stupid to look at his face and stupid laugh that he also destroyed the film. amazing action scenes, this story - me - just had no complaint to make it a movie worth having. This movie is not a "hero" of mine!
