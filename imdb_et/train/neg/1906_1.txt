They played it on the 4th of July at the Twilight Zone Marathon, it's down, the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It is the rest of the sync with this tone. Even though the Twilight Zone is quite uneven and many episodes are finally predictable, it was completely unsuccessful. Compare it to legendary episodes like "A Stop Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize there's no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did it with such terrible material as, frankly, I am surprised that someone from his historical comedy would grow to the level of this episode. Even if he seemed to have given him some effort, he needed the money ... no other explanation.
