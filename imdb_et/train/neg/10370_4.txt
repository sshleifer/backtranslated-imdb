I'm sorry every second after I lost this movie. Fortunately, I always find it difficult to turn off the movie when I watch it. Especially when it's classic or what people use to call classics. I think this is one of the films that every movie lover should have watched at least once, so I watched it. Don't do it wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall as both a pair and an actor, but I think this movie was a big scam. There is really no good plot, no espionage shock or romantic love. Well, not even a convincing mix of both genres. The only thing that caused the tension was that it was not sure whether "Bogey" and Bacall would be completely or partially apart. I think "To Have and Have" is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films in the 1940s.
