I almost called HBO and demanded my money back for the month just because they were inciting this movie. I just see that the movie goes around, "Okay, we have to look like something like Home Alone, we just add a lot of cash to the baby, we hire salaried actresses and oh yeah, we make it a lot less funny!" /> <br /> Okay, maybe not the last part, but it's basically what you have here. Not even worth it if someone rents it. And how about the film for kids? Forget it. I won't let my kids see it, not necessarily because of the bad taste jokes, but because I don't want them to say, "What did you mean by showing us this flat piece of garbage, Dad?!?!"
