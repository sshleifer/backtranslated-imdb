Let me begin by saying that I fully agree with the main work of the film that apparently there was no historical Jesus, and Christianity is shameful. That said, this movie makes the proving of this statement pretty bad. It gives good arguments - a gap between Jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the gospels, which is only fulfilled by Paul's writings, which do not show the historical Jesus - and then cannot be convinced by them. It makes widespread statements without presenting the evidence on which the statements are based and strongly ignores the contradictions made by Christian apologists. Intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation and lack of serious arguments are obvious and stunning. Only the Christians we hear from the movie are the head of the film school's old school - who comes out as a sensible, rational person who is trying to deal with the delicate shoulder of his shoulder - and many Christians who apparently met at random. I am sorry, but revealing that middle Christians do not know much about their religion is not exactly the deception of Christian Christianity. You can also argue that Jay Leno has refuted Michael Dukakis in his Jay-Walking segment. Interviews with experts can be interesting, but the film is too much, let's face it, the filmmaker is just snarky. In the first five minutes, the film has already mixed Jerry Falwell with Charles Manson and left-side writers with Davidians. Finally, the film becomes so self-confident that there is no rational argument, but an angry ex-Christian who puts the people on and makes him blame for his confusion from childhood. You know, maybe this film could have been interesting, but it is wrongly placed in Jesus' historical documentary, and it is so self-replicating that any kind of compassion is canceled. This is Michael Moore's film without humor or filmmaking, combined with Richard Dawkins' book without spiritual or intellectual rigor. Skip it.
