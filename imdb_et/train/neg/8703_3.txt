Primary Species (1996, Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists will be surprised if their merchandise has living dinosaurs. The army command team must now think quickly if they want to prevent the extinction of human species instead of reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and get the first impressions of the movie. That's pretty much. Action is only acceptable for some of the labels. The story is bad, the whole film is based on the army and the navy who are trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film came out three years after Jurassic Park. Instead, this film seems to be 13 years before "Jurassic Park". Dinosaur costumes are so badly made and I mean costumes. There are obviously dressed people and this movie is not trying to hide it. The scene where the dinosaur runs down the corridor is created in a way that looks like someone is traveling with the creature. This is one good thing that comes out of this movie. Short working hours. Only 1 hour and 15 minutes will not waste too much on your life, but will try to avoid it at all. <br /> <br /> "It's like a Friday night 13." - Officer (Brian Currie)
