I can't believe I wasted my money on renting this money. I thought it started with a porn movie and it was never better. Actress, music drowned by actors. Terrible. Save Your Money! You have to read the movie when they knew that the music would overwhelm the lines. I never got a part of the slaughterhouse or need to continue showing cows and pigs. What is it about a "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors in this movie. The script would have turned me off on the first page of reading. You'd better dry the paint.
