Why me? Why should I turn to such a slaughter that could have made an interesting plot of land?! At least when I can warn other people, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this terrible movie for college. Otherwise, I would have seen a summary on the back of the thing and I was clear. The film was slow, there was little character and focused on the idea that a creepy little white person might get cool when he hangs in a LA style symbolic black. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience a stereotypical LA lesson on dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note that this movie does not lose what we have thought of as the "LA Lifestyle", it is a great example of the products that ARISE comes from.
