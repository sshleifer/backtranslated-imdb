Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror film I've ever seen and scared me. The action was not too bad and the "Cupid" killer was plausible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> Bad: The story and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There was simply nothing. How the killer killed his victims was very terrible and disgusting. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who can't handle gore. <br /> <br /> Generally: good intimidation but bad story. <br /> <br /> ** *****
