This adaptation shows that he did not. He not only left the plot but also himself! The things he decided to leave were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy that he decided to exclude some of the most important parts of the novel. To say the least, the plot was blurry, inconsistent and dirty. I don't want to say anything meaningful to the actors, but they can't act! Dickens is of course difficult, but it's pathetic! Micawber was nothing but Kramer in the mid-nineteenth century, and the less was said about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see a real Copperfield, check out the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the scriptwriter, I think he read Cliff's notes!
