SEX WISH was actually released in the UK in the early years of the video game (minus ten minutes more, ahem, "extreme" footage), and caused a tabloid storm in the teacup when it inspired the copycat murder case. Strangely enough, the papers were brushed under its highly disruptive flick, which was in their head to get relatively harmless DEMON's preserved FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT. As a result, the movie has been all forgotten. I jumped into the opportunity to watch it on DVD-RW and spent most of the movie on the floor with my jaws. It is not so much politically wrong, as is completely demented, triple X takes Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (made the title type gave the game as far as inspiration was?) With hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into the already seventies squirting. If you do not consider yourself uncomfortable, it may reconsider you. By the time SEX WISH is over, you want to clean your eyeballs with a disinfectant and take a long hot shower to clean yourself. If a movie really deserves a "movie only, movie only, movie only", that's one. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or lowlights) - A rapist who uses a victim's vibrator when he masturbates over him, Harry Reem's scene-steal mustache, a helpless young black couple who is forced to screw a sword killer to the killer (they could have won The Oscar for those absolutely credible performances that the Academy had gone mad) before the man castrates his worries and somewhat sliding direction, threatening to end the origins of these obvious grinding houses. Don't tell me I didn't warn you. If you thought the world was the innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH proves you very, very wrong.
