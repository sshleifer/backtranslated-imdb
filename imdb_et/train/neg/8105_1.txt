Harsh, yes, but I call it as I see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the late 80s and it was really one of the most horrible, boring movies I've ever been forced to see. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography is cute. Czech settings are really stunning. The political background is tempting, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (eg _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), this story could not be turned into politics or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. However, this film can even make "erotic" scenes even and slow. I am all romantic, but this movie was so boring, I started to hope that the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I am sure that reading a book would make the story a little more meaningful. But life is too short to spend more time.
