It was nice to see all the familiar characters, but the story disturbed me. We loved Ariel in the first movie - why is the other around her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I didn't like the plot. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes didn't come back as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop processing classic films with these dirty imitations.
