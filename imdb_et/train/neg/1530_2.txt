I wanted me to choose SELECTIONS in the election so I could look at it again. <br /> <br /> "What? You mean you really enjoyed Theo?" <br /> <br /> No, I mean I could look at it again to see if it was so slow, stupid and so embarrassing as I remember. <br /> <br /> Many people have claimed to have been made for children. Would I also recommend it for children? because the structure of the entire script lacks any discipline of manufacturers and writers, and many written pieces seem to be involved because it seemed like a good idea at that time. <br /> <br /> Don't help but I really started to apologize for them. To be honest, you might believe that filming the film had to lie to your families that they filmed a hard porn movie that was their embarrassment when it had to appear something uncomfortable. To give you an idea of ​​how bad every time BAYWATCH's baby Donna D'Ericco disappeared, I waited patiently for her to appear again, then for a second I forgot she was in the movie. I understood ? The letter from BAYWATCH is displayed and the seconds later you forget that they are in the movie. This will tell you everything you need to know about the SELECTION MENU standard. <br /> <br /> Fair enough to try to be like THE GOODIES in a live comic book (though DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie) although the film deserves some credit to never fall into toilet humor, but considering it that this is a children's film (it didn't stop the distribution of ITVs at 23:00), it should not be close to chewing gum under any circumstances.
