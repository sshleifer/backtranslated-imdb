I think this is probably one of the worst films I've been watching for a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get "the same characters" with different people is * such * a bad idea. If they didn't get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P., they would have just had to cut their losses and said they were hell. Instead, they get new players who are terrible what they did. I was serious about being in high school or in (bad) college play with their people's behavior. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people? Was it their first film? It certainly seemed like this. <br /> <br /> This movie is also equivalent to some original talk time. I had just done the first and jumped in # 2. I was all glad to see you and it was the worst show I've ever seen. I never bother EVER * EVER * turn off the movie, but it certainly took about 30-40 min.
