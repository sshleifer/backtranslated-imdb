Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me that it was the worst film she'd ever seen ... Since I thought it was very terrible, I got to think - what movie was the worst movie I ever saw and this was the only movie that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was a few years after I saw it, but I remember the terribly dirty Dean Cain as a military soldier (a pretty boy Cain doesn't do it very well). It would be strange to do a CGI helicopter if it would be cheaper to hire a chopper than to hire some CGI boys, but I think they found a chopper for a free CGI program or a producer's son. wanted to play with his new computer. And how did it look? Awful. And if the dragon pays through the sophisticated corridors, then reuse the same frames more and more - it seems very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really terrible ...
