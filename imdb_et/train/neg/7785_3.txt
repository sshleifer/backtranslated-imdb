I didn't know it was a silent film with narration. I don't care about silent movies - funny humor, flashing lighting and film, and so on. I'm sure it will attribute to this low score. It was about Chapter 8 before I found this story interesting and I would have had a popcorn that could have thrown it on the screen. Maybe it turns to a sci-fi crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the theater. Isabella Rosselinni talked about this film - an enjoyable aspect of the film. No one left to comment on how much they enjoyed it and did not appreciate the unusual approach to talking about this story. I can't recommend this movie.
