I am a big fan of warrior films. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, the last samurai and the Gladiator. And after looking at the Mongol, which is absolutely fantastic and I strongly recommend, I had great expectations of Sergei Bodrov's film. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic, in this case not a strong word. The whole movie I was expecting was exciting, but it wasn't, I was at least waiting for a great epic battle, but even it was a big disappointment, just a casual run, sword swords ... There are so many good warrior movies, it's not one of them.
