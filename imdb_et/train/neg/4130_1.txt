Highest winner for the worst movie. The character of Joanna Pakula seems to be I.Q. 3, which is just one less than the writer and director. The scenario would not have reached the high school writing class; jokes are minors; the concept is bright. These performers were probably desperate. I only ended up to see if it would get worse. It did. Life is too short to watch this movie.
