After watching it on Christmas DVD, I came here to put it - but after reading the other comments I have no heart. It is clear that this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age. Let me not be a complete Grinch; it may still work for some children - if they are not too media-rich and not visually complex, eg. watching all LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you are an adult, stay miles away; you don't enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Good Bits: Barbara Kellerman, as a witch, especially in her early scene with Edmund, creates the right mix of charismatic evil and restrained madness. (At the stone table he gets a little over the top.) Michael Aldridge, Professor and Jeffrey S. Perry, in a small role, when Mr. Tumnus is also a polished, skillful act, what we expect from the best BBC dramas. And Aslan's costume works very well, with amazingly good weight. They just got the right eyes. <br /> <br /> Bad bit: almost everything else but especially two. One, pain. There are good actors in England and there are tens of thousands of attractive British school students. How could they be the four rigid ones? They move like wooden soldiers and also speak. Peter has no gravity or charisma (and is visibly shorter than his allegedly younger siblings); Edmund is just bright; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatically, visibly, drastically for that part that I can't imagine how she got a job. <br /> <br /> Two, animal costumes. Again, they seem to have worked with some children. If children are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting, plausible characters, these films can visit this movie. But for a viewer who has, for example, a 12-year-old who has seen Azkaban in prison? When Mister Beaver leaves behind this tree, there are the hopes of cruel, devastating laughter. Costumes just don't work - I couldn't and I think some adult or modern teenager couldn't stop the disbelief despite Mister Beaver. Drawn animation later (gryphons, etc.) works better, it's easier to take. <br /> <br /> So: ten stars for a very young and gentle soul; everyone else read or read the book again and looked at a much better movie that unleashes your imagination.
