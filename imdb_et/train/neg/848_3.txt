OK, if you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, it's a totally wrong film. <br /> <br /> Turns around two brothers. Younger Max has a great cocaine addiction. The eldest elder Adam is a doctor. This film assumes that it shows the reality of falling into extreme low drugs. But that is not the case. This shows that cocaine can be fun, no matter what happens. Most of the film's focus is on Max and his way out. Finally, Adam can no longer take stress from his workplace and will also use (peaching drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't have almost any climax. Not subject to what cocaine really does to you is dull and low budget scenes, and the oldest brother Adam's behavior is terrible. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this movie has succeeded in passing prizes and accepting it, not a heartbreaker. If you want a clear and true story about the extreme world of film drugs, don't buy "Basketball Diaries". Note the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you enjoy it. Try and see for yourself ...
