Here's a movie that shows how money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director who is well-known for gangsters' genre processing, bites more than he can chew. <br /> <br /> Use her modern movie Noir to solve her free-person theme. swallowing your pride, being nice to your enemy and putting all your money on the face. If Jason Statham's character is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, it is probably too crazy for Liotta to hit his head. Why? Basically, you can't create the character of a mafiosi like Liotta who is probably in place in life, showing such ruthless behavior that is visible in the whole movie, only if it is directed to suicide if it is a bad smile. Statham's character's face. <br /> <br /> Before anyone says I'm not a point ... I'm not. Can I do it well? Give up searching for wealth and find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and confuse her with self-destruction. This seems to be the essence of the film, and it is not in itself a bad premise, though hardly an original. The problem is that Ritchie just doesn't have the skill of making a movie. Now, even if Guy Ritchie understands it, he seems to be bored with the story and begins to enter red herring: a scene Statham knocks by car - Why? Taking some scenes like Marvel comic animations ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many open topics and unanswered questions at the end of the movie that could all be about this 2001-ish and try to figure them out or just agree that there are no answers and every viewer interprets things in their own way. Me myself? I was so bored that the movie's amazing tone I just didn't care for. To be honest, the end could not end too soon, so I wouldn't have to go through the more psychobabulary that was being accused.
