I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. It's a mullet every 5 minutes. Indeed, this film is a living proof that the formula works. If it's not broken, it doesn't need fixation. A street-yet vulnerable heroine, a champion of tempered ex-policeman martial arts with a golden heart and seraphic killer "questions." Clean magic.
