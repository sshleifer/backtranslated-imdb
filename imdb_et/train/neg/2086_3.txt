Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tiring plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) live in their hands. Even his random flop (six days, seven nights) shows signs of life and humor that make it worth watching. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a rather original plot (a man dumpster, a superhero gets overpowered revenge) and makes it something enjoyable. "Girlfriend" is a useless exercise. One trick pony plot is a tooth after the first 20 minutes long. The film cannot decide whether to be a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is a film, between which there are valves, neither of which is very well done. Uma Thurman is the top, as usual, and Luke Wilson also draws his role, although his anti-slip items are quickly tired. What's even more amazing is that in certain scenes (for example, when a very difficult Uma hits the wall through the wall), you feel a nonsense, dirty Reitman's scream that screams out practically. But seconds later, magic has disappeared, gone as fast as superhero, whose films are almost disappointing.
