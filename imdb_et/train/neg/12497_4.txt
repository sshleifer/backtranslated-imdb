I'm sure people on the Texas / Louisiana border will have to be laughed or two if the Paramount B-picture unit has made it public during the war. Very simply the area on the Sabine River, where the film opens, is a cotton country like the rest of Deep South or at least Deep South was Civl War. There are no big cattle, they are farther from the west of Texas, farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could drive their own empire. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a two-partner riverboat and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services, if they don't pay for their livestock, they keep the cattle. And this is the beginning of the big Ponderosa like the ranch they start with. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster marries Dixi's sister Frances Gifford and feuds with her much smaller neighbors. They also have some additional games with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Anyway, our eastern neighbors, who love the West, don't usually worry about geographical trips, and it's still a good western Harry Sherman production plant that produced all these Hopalong Cassidy westerns for Paramount. The climax is blazing and I mean, literally, the battle of weapons that could have been used for A-production. <br /> <br /> But I would not only have western drivers.
