One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only idea was "How do I get my money back from Hollywood video". It is in no way worth four dollars or dollars. I think it was an attempt to remove Mexican or Vin Diesel movies, but it couldn't do it unhappy. <br /> <br /> The actor was terrible, I felt that the actors couldn't find anything better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We called the front lines of the actors, so predictable. The accent of the leading woman in Mexico was insultingly exaggerated, worse than the comic. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
