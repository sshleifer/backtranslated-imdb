This is by far the worst film I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say I've never seen this movie worse !!! <br /> <br /> AND NEVER !!!! <br /> <br /> A big fan of "B" horror movies. As you can imagine .... I have come across some of the worst things the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie by its title. I mean c'mon ... what a real horror fan wouldn't interest in the title like "Vampires vs Zombies" ??? "Undead" fighting "undead" pictures danced with my head. I thought to myself ... "I have to see it" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well .... sorry to say .... "I wish I wouldn't have seen" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading. Zombies didn't win the vampires. Actually, there is no plot !!!! If you had asked me what this film was about, I can honestly say I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't make any sense at all !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this attack ... I found myself in the bad spirits who had invested. money for this project because they definitely have no business sense !!!
