I'm not sure what. I just couldn't laugh at it. I had an open mind. I didn't want to be tense about it. But I couldn't laugh at this movie. It wasn't funny to me. Some parts seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together, that doesn't mean it's a great comedy. Some movies shouldn't be done. This is one of them. Because it makes a lot of old jokes and the actor was just stupid. I know, I know it's comedy. Sort at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can't get anything under two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
