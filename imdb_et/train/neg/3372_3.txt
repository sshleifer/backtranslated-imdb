The big shadow of the film, this film suffers from the fact that director Richard Attenborough misses the musical point completely, it opens unnecessarily and breaks the thrust of the games. The exhibition deals with a group of dancers who listen to the work of B'way's musical work and study their ride and desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding work. Attenborough gives us a fresh face with hopes, assuming they're trying to break their "big break" in the show, rather than presenting a mix of grittier mixes for the show "working Roma" to show up with a couple of newcomers. The film has one advantage over the game and it is a start-up scene that shows the size of the original performance and the true extent of shrinkage to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you read Cassie, who is stupidly detained) in the film). Anyone who can play a local citizen's lighting opera is a much richer experience than seeing this poorly designed movie.
