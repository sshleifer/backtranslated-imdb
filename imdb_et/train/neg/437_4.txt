(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie after hearing it was smart and witty. I had to stop halfway because I felt it was intolerable boredom. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between man and woman develops through all the problems and difficulties. two people living in a big city can experience it. What made me dislike the film was two things. <br /> <br /> First, the film was so underground that it seemed that describing the problems the couple had to solve during the day - it became common and boring. Second, the overall consolation of production, the dialogues that were barely understandable. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
