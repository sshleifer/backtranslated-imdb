This early Adam Sandler movie can be compared to his life as a 1989 comic. The constant recognition of his character in his hidden comic genius and the disappointing humorous material seems to be more about Sandler than a script. The film is not a feature film, such as Big Daddy or even corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to make this film, like his character, consistently, successfully and funnyly. Most of the "jokes" in the movie come from Sandler, who talks to himself, usually over his unknown comics, and beats himself because he is too ugly and does not get women. It's hard to watch a movie because it doesn't look like a real movie. Sandler speaks with the camera and viewers throughout the film, often referring to the low budget of the film or the questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to look at. I just wanted to forget right now that I saw this movie even after I was afraid that if you learned more about it, it would destroy Sandler's career. Forward it to the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
