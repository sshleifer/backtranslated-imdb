I just loved to watch it and have fun with the movie's total evilness. I saw this movie through the Mystery Science Theater 3000 useful sarcasm and I have a DVD. When you flip the DVD to the other side, the actual movie is displayed so I gave it a chance. Seriously, people this is grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> Functional, special effects and plots are generally fun and unrealistic. "Doesn't she need lungs," Crow said she could see how she was still talking when she had no body, and Tom Servo just said "No, she has neck juice!". The end is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved "cat clothes" between the two strippers. This "Meow" after a fight or scene, whatever, was classic. So, in a sense, it was a fun movie. I think it's probably enjoyable for horror fans. Good time to see the MSTK3 version, you can laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K Version: 10/10 Brain That Dies: 1/10
