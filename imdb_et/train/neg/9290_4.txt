STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Long-term prisoner Twitch (Kurupt) takes himself to a tougher prison than reopened Alcatraz . She says it is closer to her lady, but her real motives are a little bigger. There he crosses the road to Burke (Bill Goldberg) with big prisoners who can take care of themselves. Addressing, despite being less muscular, has the same mouth and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war between black and Spanish prisoners that explodes hostile hostile takeovers when the black gang leader is dead and fingertips at Burke. But the fan really strikes when the Spanish killer and leader Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal doesn't make offspring (supposedly very contrary to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do so, provided that the film company he was with was directing his movie, despite being a DVD Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in some movies from the first movie that comes to the end). But there is a reason why he hasn't done a lot of work for a universal soldier 2 and because he's not much of an actor and There is not a lot of action stars managing this character that starts with a very dark and clotting, but irreversibly becomes a normal hero who uncomfortably empties the eternal liner. The veterans of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, supported only the possibilities of additional work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that tried to copy the original style quite well. in low light, dark shadows and rap music played a lot. It does it quite well, unfortunately, it can't resist the relaxing hero, equally the cartoon offender and the apathetic story that the makers seem to have done when they went. **
