I saw this movie last year in Media Class and I have to say I really hated it. I was in 10 (and aged 15) so I have something to do with it. But in English this year, 11th year, we had to read animal husbandry, including George Orwell. In addition to the book's revolution, I think it's a terrible book and I hated it. <br /> <br /> But in 1984, I thought it was the most disturbing film I've ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the hardest people ever living on this planet. I'm sorry for anyone who loved their job, but unfortunately it wasn't. The themes of the film were well illustrated, but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place in it were not in line with my standards. It's just my opinion, and I'm sure many other people enjoyed this movie thoroughly.
