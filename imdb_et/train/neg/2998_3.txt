Only for fans of Judy Garland. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one where he makes a number with a parent cleaner (all you have seen) and a pretty good number. There are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny. Basically, the script is so bad and the movie is so dated that it's hard not to blur all the fear. But it's worth 2.50 to rent a movie - be prepared for that.
