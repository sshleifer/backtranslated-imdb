Another British movie flag. The real garbage is offered here again. I don't understand (and I'm British) why it's up, patriotic nonsense was ever done. For eight years, we are celebrating when World War II was actually over! Other commentators have noted the editing and obvious use of archive material. This is very badly observed. Archive material is abundant. Model aircraft moving from wiring to "action scenes" like so many kids' kites. The usual order of the card space tattooed the film in order to pull us into the whole Malta event. Guinness must have the worst ability to act. The shocking dog scene is ridiculous. Hawkins drills us all to death in the map area. Ealing made many great movies. This is clearly not one of them. They should have stayed away from such an insecure mountainous area!
