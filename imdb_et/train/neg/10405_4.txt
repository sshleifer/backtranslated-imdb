The fourth "tremor" function dates back to 1889. "The legend begins" a small "Perfection" town, which was then "rejection, Nevada". When the story begins, "graboids" kill seventeen miners. Some of the characters in today's Tremors films are both figurative and literally ancestors in the past. The most obvious is Michael Gross (Hiram Gummer), who is constantly returning. Unlike his successor, Mr. Gross is intuitive with firearms; So she hires Gunslinger Billy Drago ("Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> It takes some habits - as it happens in the distant past. It's like the west with the original version of the original "Graboids" movie. These "Dirt Dragons" obscures are almost "terrorizing" as "Tremors" (1990) colleagues. As a result, the characters in this film spend an awful lot of time, which wouldn't have happened in the original film. And it was strange if the citizens would quit the fight so quickly when Gross decided to leave the city temporarily. Why so helpless? Why does Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) immediately rally people to fight without a brut? Frustrations. <br /> <br /> **** Shakes 4: Legend Begins (2004) S.
