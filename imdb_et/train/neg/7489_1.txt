American movies about war and the Nazis cannot just be good. They cannot give up the idiot and follow the agenda. All the Nazis are bad, mad, too proud and the Americans are so modest, but so capable and reasonable and human. Come on, stop this shit. The protagonist says something like "this trial, we have to do aggressive war crime". Is America a peaceful nation with its # 1 $ 420 billion "defense" budget (# 2 in China only $ 51b)? Is it just spent without ... ROI? Why imagine America being peaceful, if not? I don't like movies on the agenda - they throw art into hell and try to convince us to believe something. Hollywood should tag the films, just as the record labels have this "parental advisory" label. Some films should have a so-called advisory, propaganda-advisory or politically correct advisory label. This is one of them.
