I bet no one knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary investigation into Mexico before taking the Aztecs. He did what he did because he would never have known of those T Rexs who settled in one particular valley where the locals honored them as gods. <br /> <br /> It was understandable. What was not with blue eyes Ian Ziering as Cortes casting. Even though blonde hair is colored black at Beverly Hills 90210, Ian seemed to be ridiculously ridiculous. At least he didn't catch a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> The actual Tyrannosaurus Azteca hero is Marco Sanchez, too late for the television series, which has a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Dallas Detective Sandoval. PD. He finds the true love of the Aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it was not for those irritating prehistoric animals worshiped by natives. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they were using the famous Sid & Marty Krofft series of extracts of lost land. All that was needed was the release of Sleestak. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this reconnoitering expedition that doesn't make history books in any way, check out the Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try and sit through the straight face.
