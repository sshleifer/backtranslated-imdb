Doppelganger has his moments, but they are little and far away. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a B-Class pop-psychological thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman haunted by her past demons (most of her family has been murdered and was at least in one case the main suspect), or does she just have a very bad multiple personality case disorder? George Newbern is his new spouse and most of his activities focus on him. <br /> <br /> Newbern's character is quite sympathetic and he and Barrymore are doing a decent job (though not quite well). A mediocre (uncommon) totally terrible script and unimpressive management seem to have combined the rest of the performances. Leslie Hope's character is memorable, but so irritating that you want to forget her. <br /> <br /> The plot will eventually be doubled (one story is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) an extreme climax that is so poorly prepared, acted and photographed that it effectively neutralizes most of what the film used to be reached. <br /> <br /> In general, the film has the feeling of being expected by M. Knight Shamalyan as the first undergraduate class. The operation of the two leaders and the script are just good enough to make them little care - at least until the film is fully and fully directed. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid the first staff meeting.
