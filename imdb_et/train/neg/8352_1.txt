I rented this movie because it belongs to the genres of "romance" and "west", throwing some of the Grand Canyon landscape. This movie is a clean trash! Romance is between younger men who have not even undergone puberty and a medieval man! The child is also for other busy men. This is bad. He tries to shoot him down first, but finally he gives it in and they fly like a happy, loving couple. It's reluctant. <br /> <br /> I don't see how this film could ask anyone other than pedophiles.
