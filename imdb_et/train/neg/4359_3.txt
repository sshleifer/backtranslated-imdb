Wow, after dragging Timo Roses' plate to "Rout City" in about 15 minutes (South Park is more than a pointless curse ... I think some people just don't get it) I was interested in this movie. I read quite positive things and the film's packaging and appearance seemed far from all the trash I was waiting for after "Rout city". <br /> <br /> Surprise: The movie is not a complete trash, but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to walk in the footsteps of the German Horror / Splatter Cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and others. This means that the "barricade" is partly highly detailed and detailed. Gore FX is not really plausible, but OK, operation is OK, but in some cases normal sucks. In the opening order, the mountain chick is ridiculous and will not heal until he has shot. <br /> <br /> So what is the problem ... the film is gory, it has a typical German underground vibe (including classic bleeding in the blood), OK FX and a modern feeling like the packaging already promised?! <br /> <br /> 1. The script is BS. You have a typical mountain / lost forest story where some boys + gal bears out and meet with a degenerate mountain family. Everything happens just in the direction of torture / distortion scenes and seems incredibly random and pointless. This is the first thing that makes "barricade" half-hearted. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also a perfect description for many camera works (I liked repeated cutting on tweezers in an extended rotation torture scene ... whether they had material or an editor in a hardware store). Even worse is editing ... surely, its modern and much better than many other movies in the genre, but its RANDOM. You have excessive use of this typical exposure effect everywhere and without meaning ... it's just there ... all the time. Then there is some grainy / noisy look of the movie, which is thrown away from it and out of it, I don't understand. <br /> <br /> 3. As with the above effects, there are many repetitive things here. For example, most killings have been edited by repeated and punching. It's OK, but here it is annoying and fake, especially at the end. The irritant also attributes "music" that is used continuously without any background changes. It won't take long until it makes the film hard to tolerate. <br /> <br /> 4. This is the biggest problem with this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you're making a movie in a trash that is clumsy, feel like your real idiot to polish it with special FX and new school editing. They seem to take it too seriously. It's not fun because a decent gore FX is common in this context. And if the classic gore FX is OK, the computer's FX scenes like mouth-blowing or end-searches are quite foolish (and the 3D splatter sucks me even on budget and decent 3D artists). <Br /> <br /> I have often wondered if the time for serious spraying is over and Barricade is just one example that it may be time to put it in the grave. It's not fun, it doesn't have a character and its look is too tricky. The script is a cheap trial for "wrong turn" and "TCM", which leads absolutely anywhere. You can get it literally ... ending right there and so casually as many other things here ("I love you" splatter ... come on!). "Barricade" is trying to add a lot and fails ... you can move forward through this movie to make some widespread disembowels, acid face melting, nipple squeezing, and classical Friday pairing with a couple of fingers (bloody boobies hooray!). But it's really hard to get through it. Complete failure especially because you see that it could have been something.
