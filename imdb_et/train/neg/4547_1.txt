The movie was TERRIBLE !!! Just the worst movie I've seen in recent years. One of the films I can tell people over the next three years is that it was the worst film I think. Thank you for giving me the answer to this burning question, "What is the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message, and was happy to see the movie, but then they treated the audience as we are r * tarded. There is no story and story that there is too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad that they have to specify nine prophecies and cannot simply tell them a story that is interesting to follow. They did not spend time on character development and were easy to care for when a character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who adhered to this incredibly boring movie. The book is also quite boring, but I enjoyed the parallels that can be seen in reading the book everyday. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would recommend not seeing it if you want to keep the words of the book close to the heart. DO NOT THIS MOVIE. Trust me.
