Well, thank you, DISTRIBUTED Disney, for the pleasant memories I used in my favorite film. I was about 5 when the original film came out and it was one of the first movies I saw. So, now that I'm 16 and I feel masochistic, I decided to rent this movie. So I was able to poison all the memories of the original film. This film takes everything that originally made love and wrecks, to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate her daughter Melody and show her all in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the end of the musical number, the sea witch Morgana appears in a few minutes and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. So he gives it without a fight. Eric stands where Ariel thinks how to use the sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the sea until Morgana is caught. Eric is full of fun. He can never do anything. Ariel has something. Melody can turn things around. In addition, animation is a new low point for Disney. Computer graphics finish the background collision. Any chance to develop character is wasted. The songs bite. Look, don't waste your time. I'm pretty sure even little kids miss out on their skulls because nothing happens far away. They don't want to sing songs. If you manage to get this copy, throw it into the ocean and hope nobody can find it. Never.
