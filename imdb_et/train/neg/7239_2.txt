This movie is advertised as a smart romantic comedy. It is neither smart nor romantic nor is it definitely an effective comedy. The very meaningful but pathetic character of "Tom" succeeds from a stranger to an extremely disaster. The only rescue work is Toni Collette's competence and Paltrow's pleasant face. In general, it must be avoided!
