This movie would have been so much better by rewriting the script. Not that I assume a lot of credibility in movies, but you think Jack Mason, even the homeless and urban dwellers, would ask why experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. When it comes to hunting areas, the bad Ice-T plays its part as he actually drives these men through the forests he has never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how Jack Mason found Thomas Burns in Seattle I assume that this movie is based on Richard Connell's shortest "The Most Dangerous Game". A couple of years ago I showed this film to ninth grade students after reading the story. I repeated the movie again, cutting out all the nonsense scenes and all the contempt. It was 43 minutes long.
