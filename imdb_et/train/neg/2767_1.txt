This movie is probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life - crossing the previous most adorable, most horrifying movie "Slithis Spang", which I saw when I was about 10. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, silly ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot, wrong cut scenes, even music was annoying. Did I leave something out? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI is not a decent film making. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I've spent money watching this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shimi (manager), send it to my username at "gmail" and contact him / her to personally request a refund.
