*** WARNING! SPOILERS COVERED! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what can happen to Madonna when she is ever left on an abandoned island. Madonna has no challenge in this role and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can't even get it right. I know what you're talking about, you say, "How do you know that this is what Madonna really likes, you've never met her!" Right, I'm not, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", isn't it? I know Kevin Costner does that. <br /> <br /> You think that in 2002, Madonna could have learned something like "crossover" from ladies who have also gone their way. silver screen. Hasn't Madonna seen "Glitter" for goodness? Mariah Carey showed HOW IT IS DONE !!! Mariah captures the beauty of Madonna trashy butt, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization. Everything we see from this glance to the Madonna world is his only one. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing Madonna has to say, she is consistent. When he was expensive at MTV, he returned to the women's fashion world for 20 years. Now, for 20 years, the film has played a female role in film AND society, by glamorizing all the most hateful, terrible, deplorable, terrible qualities. prove they really don't. <br /> <br /> *** THERE ARE SPOILERS !!! DON'T READ NOW THAT YOU ARE NOT KNOWING ... *** <br /> <br /> Here's one good thing I say about this movie, and it was really impressive. They didn't go "to end Hollywood" - Madonna's character. In a typical, happy Hollywood ending, Madonna's character on the island would have died and her long-standing, oppressed, whipped wife could eventually freely live with a good, decent wife, a woman who would be exactly the opposite of her dead husband and they both live happily. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, he is saved and this man is once again exhausted by his wife's demon, and his life is once again a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** BEFORE YOU END YOUR CLIENTS ***
