Who did this song back from Dr Tarr and Professor Feather? Was it Alan Parsons? You saw it on the Brentwood 10 package and the quality was anticipated, terrible. Full of stripes and stuff. The film was inconsistent. Goofy music and helpless characters. The main man should have known for the first minute that the doctor was a nuttier than the patients. I thought the "battle" scene leading doctor never finished. There were good looking babes. It seems that these foolish movies are always thrown naked chicks or two and it gets you hooked. I gave it to 2 women. This bird's people danced that I want to pull out my eyeballs. Probably, Poe made about 3,000 rps in his grave when it came because it was loosely his story.
