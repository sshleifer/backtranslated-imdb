First of all, the big name actors need money ... Surgical scenes were ridiculous .... and they must know that people with little knowledge of medicine find it completely absurd ...... Anesthesiologists don't leave room during heart transplant ... and don't do surgery in a small room with no instruments, heart lung, and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not focus on the storyline because of all the stupid surgical scenes ... no blood, staff, and hero who arrives and takes over ... this is not a movie-minded adult .... also the budget must be limited ... street images were OK but who was a technical advisor. It seems to have been guided by the whole idiot. Save your money and wait until it appears on the DVD and does not rent.
