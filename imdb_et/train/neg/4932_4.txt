Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the last of the series, and as part 4, it is not related to the first three numbers except for the title and the fact that it is a horror hit on Christmas. <br /> <br /> Except unforgettable, here are some obvious things ... Mickey Rooney plays Joe Petto and his creepy son is called Pino. Call the clock, anyone? Now, a little boy named Derek heard the knock at the door at night and opened it to find a gift at his fingertips. Even if he said "don't open until Christmas," he will still open it, but his father will stop shouting and sending him to bed and opening his own gift. There is a little red ball in the room that sprouts Christmas heads and head, and continues to kill his father. Sorry, maybe he should have left alone well enough. Of course, Derek traumatizes as a result of an incident because he looked at it out of the stairs, but he doesn't grow some killer holidays, he just doesn't talk. <br /> <br /> There's a mysterious stranger who lies in the looks of the toys Joe Petto does. We see him even when we buy a bunch of Derek's mother taking him to the shop to find him a gift to bring him out of his trauma. And what exactly does this man do? We are not sure, but it seems that he takes them on toys to see what makes them a sign. He keeps his landlord picking him up, letting him pay the next day in cash and "Larry Larvae" for his child, but of course "Larry" is not a good toy and eliminates this box in the car and, of course, things are not pretty beautiful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, what happens to Joe Petto and Pino has naturally appeared, and like the old story, Pino is not a "real boy". The stack is probably even more irritated and naughty because he has "Kenitalia" (a smooth plastic finger) so it could take into account his evil ways. There is also a strange foreign identity, and there is even a happy ending. Whee. <br /> <br /> Step 4 step up, but not one of them. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved and screaming at Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make it big. Some of the 4 parts left over are also around, such as Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but it's not really anything else. Anyway, I now see the entire system out of my system. Now that I could get it into my brain. 4 out of 5
