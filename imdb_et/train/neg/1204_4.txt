I remember Devil Dog, who plays TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watch it and smiled the next day. It is not as bad as a horror film made on television, but it is derived (mostly from exortions) and businesslike, because there is no better word. It doesn't let you get away with artistic cinematography or a big actor, but it's not a waste of time either. This is the kind of movie you look at to kill a couple of hours if you don't feel too heavy. <br /> <br /> But if you go to a movie that is looking for some smiles, you won. Don't be disappointed. Earlier scenes where Lucky Devil Dog is a cute little puppy who has been sleeping in the eyes of children is an unpleasantly threatening and gigantic black dog (with horns!) Weather conditions are quite lateral. And keep an eye on the hidden Satanist in the Maverick tones at the beginning. <br /> <br /> In no way is imagination a big horror film, but I want them to do this kind of television.
