The film industry is a complex business because decisions have to be made and everyone has privacy. This is the original dissertation in the weakened attempt to make the film "insightful". And indeed, there is no better evidence of the complexity of the industry when you see the trap of Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell in this injustice. The concept is made up of loudspeakers that robbing jokes like "should I make a movie in the studio that costs a lot or should I make an indie element and stay with my artistic self?" "The last, please." Or: "Our relationship is not only professional but also private. This is a rather difficult situation, is it?" "Yes, it's, my dear." Twilight dialogues look at palm trees, hotel lobbies and American movie posters (Croisette doesn't show any non-American films). Repeated sleep sessions are unavoidable, making the 100-minute film an age. Jenny Gabrielle is remarkably convincing to justify her presence in the frame.
