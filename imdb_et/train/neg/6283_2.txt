What an incredible drop is for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You are collecting your friends at home, all jumping on the follow-up of Sean Ellis. You have a vague idea of ​​a plot, not spoilers that could kill fun and very high expectations. <br /> <br /> This is the late night's perfect atmosphere for such a movie. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes pass and you start to say that it is required to pick up, after 25 minutes you start thinking about whether you should just go to sleep and save it for another time, if you can fully understand the expected non-existent fine touches. Over half an hour's mark you know that half of your raised audience has already slept and called it a day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when all the other materials you look at are back in the middle of the day this time, hoping your mood will keep you awake at that time. 10 minutes later, you get into incredible and unnecessarily long transitions and pictures. Other things I would have given up, but there is money back and legacy. But this legacy can only bring you so long, it is a new boring level of filmmaking, imagine a short story that extended to the novel with just descriptions, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> Decent casting is wasting, there is no cinematography that would leave you happy as a cashback. There are movies that annoy you, there are movies that don't have certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately it's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Final words, away.
