Even though 99.99% of people who have seen this movie are Brazilian, I speak English because it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This movie is cr * p. The worst thing I've seen hopelessly. Children are terrible. Specially for a boy. It was the first time I saw someone with fewer facial expressions than Arnold Schwarzenegger and one voice, like a 5-year-old child who read in front of the class. How can someone be so bad about the main actor of a movie? The story is so low that my daughter could have done it better (she is 3 years old). It's so easy to write on a napkin and say in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Nobody enjoys this movie in just three ways: 1) you are pre-teen; 2) Globo's stupidities are so brains that you think everything with a Globo seal is awesome; 3) You have severe brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! Shame on the Brazilian movie scene.
