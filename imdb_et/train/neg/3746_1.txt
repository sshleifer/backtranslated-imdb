As hard as I believe, all the terrible realities over there in recent years show that it has to take over the worst. I still wonder if it was just a SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was behind it. Can a rock band accumulate lower than INXS to do this shameful thing? The premise is simple and moral. Audition, where a number of karaoke pushes INXS as a new singer, instead of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years later, the band did not hit a very pathetic act, having tried out a number of talented wannabets to be the new singer of this band since the beginning of the 20 year period. So they ride all those terrible singers (I thought American Idol had a part of doozies) who make surprising calls to almost every classic (and predictable) rock song. And then they were cut to the members of the INXS band, who are serious about the benefits of each candidate. You can see better (and more original) rock performers in almost every nightclub in all cities of the world. Lame reality participants, flat interviews, flat host / emcee, flat "judge" performances, and lame booting one participant at the end of each show. Are these exhibitions more predictable? This is a clearly public part of the band; The last hope of hope is to restore your lost stardom before they are finally forgotten. Michael Hutchence, if he had a life of dignity, must run in his grave. Not that INXS was once a big band, but I had no idea it was pathetic. If INXS is at all represented in the rock and the role has changed, this exhibition would be the final proof that the stone and the roll are dead.
