WOW! I didn't know anyone made this movie! it's terrible! I've written 5 things that can tell me why u don't want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Number 1: "His greatest rave ever", where is this rave? I only saw a few people who danced around. <br /> <br /> 2. When they struggle, can they see blood everywhere, people, two destructive tents and one stage .. and what do they do? they drink! <br /> <br /> The 3rd Worst Actors I've ever seen! Captain and his team. <br /> <br /> 4. When one person fires a normal weapon, he hits almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that every person in the world could fight as a pro! must have a new thing .. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the manufacturer was thinking! "It's going to be a big hit, it's going to be classic" .. sure u dumbs never see this movie, with that belt. MY EYES ARE BIRTHS!
