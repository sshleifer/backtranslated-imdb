I'm not worried about the plot summary because you know what the film is and where there is almost no plot. I have seen that many reviewers call an ISOYG anti-rape film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to talk about the outstanding hypocrisy of these statements. <br /> <br /> First, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a formal woman is behind. Was it Zarch's attempt to make a rape statement - and I don't think it was - is completely set aside. The film markets sex, and the sexual assault and material titration is so graphic (all but real penetration is shown) that the NO ONE, but the hard core crowd enjoys it. <br /> <br /> Raps (s) in the movie are inconvenient, brutal and difficult to watch. There's something to say about filthy crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason to continue in this scene for 30 minutes. The victim also had little development of character and only one of the rapists was somewhat advanced (just moments before killing), so the scene is not at all emotional. Indeed, it is simply for the sake of the emergence of extreme sexual violence, and with the ISOYG films it can be said that it is related to IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it only attracts the crowd of exploitation. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers have recognized Zarch's lack of documentary style and soundtrack. But given that everything in the movie is different (exemplary, script, etc.), I suspect that these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because it literally placed the camera and let its porn caliber act. /> <br /> I'm not going to get all of my high horse that talks about ISOYG content. I'm all about exploit / horror and love for video. In fact, I only give this movie to three because it really pulls the envelope beyond some other movies. But it's also badly done and after rape, it's just boring for the rest of the movie because we're looking at heaps of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders, and we're waiting for the credit to roll. <br /> <br /> This is probably worth it once when you are a fan of hardcore 70s exploitation, but I tell you that the movie is pretty bad at all and is not really worthy of its famous reputation.
