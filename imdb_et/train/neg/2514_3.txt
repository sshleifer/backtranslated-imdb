I loved Dewaere's Noir series. His talent is "Waltzers" or "Going Places" trivialized. Okay, this is a couple of guys who are flirting in the most absurd and irrevocable ways of the convention; many people find this kind of behavior fun. It was a boring, pointless exercise aimed at shock. I find a smile on Bijer's face, behind the camera, annoying. The Noir series was the right expression of personal freedom and loyal behavior. From the first moment we see Patric Dewaere's abandoned abandoned batch, we get an idea of ​​the amazingly beautiful hero we will be spending in the next few hours. When we see him behind a hostile middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places", we have a fair warning that the two hours that take them apart is a soul drain. I have problems with extreme distraction even with "3".
