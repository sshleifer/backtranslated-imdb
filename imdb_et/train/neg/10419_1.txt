Probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed it: <br /> <br /> 1. They may not read the book. 2. They can enjoy gore and violence in the film. 3. They can be very young and therefore do not understand violence. 4. People may not understand how much more frightening and violent than the original book. 5. There are certainly many other reasons not covered here. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this movie is the song "Bright Eyes". <br /> <br /> You are one of those people who have read the book, enjoy peaceful and peaceful movies without violence, and are quite old and understand the fear and violence. Otherwise you will surely enjoy it. <br /> <br /> As in the book, a rabbit called Fiver's unscrupulous warriors warns of a terrible threat. Only a few rabbits - including his brother Hazel - believe in him and they are on a dangerous path to find a new place to live.
