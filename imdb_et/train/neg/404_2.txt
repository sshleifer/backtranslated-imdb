Shortly after seeing this film, I asked the intellectual competence of the actor and actor who took every role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actor, why would she have such an overpriced opportunity? However, I have to give credit when the credit is due. Some moments in the film were unpredictable and rather resurrected, but they hardly made the terrible perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I do not recommend this film to anyone, a man or a woman who has any self-respect.
