This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see it tonight. On the first day, when expectations and leaps were too much for me. But in the first half hour we knew it was a disaster. Not only is it a leap created, it is also offensive to the original blockade. There were gaps in the script, editing was correct several times. Mohanal, a great actor, did a good job. Amitabh was fine. The director wanted to imagine how bad his character was, but he went a little overboard, resulting in a strong one. Ajay, who is particularly fluent in such roles, was also disappointed. Lets won't even start with a new man, Prashant. One wouldn't be proud to start a career as it is. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown into a laugh, could not smile because of his smile and gentle voice because of his smile. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actors today. All in all, the RGV I thought was one of the most talented and talented directors from India has been ... failed. He took on such a great challenge and responsibility to do what was known as the best Hindi films and what became out of it.
