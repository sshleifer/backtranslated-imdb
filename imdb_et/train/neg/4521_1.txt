The entire Biker Movie genre must consist of the worst films. It offers a lot of struggle, between big blood vessels, cyclists fighting with Indians, and dirty cities that collide and break one tail at a time. Operation is terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr. At one point he was in a big studio production and he just disappeared. This movie really blows, but if you haven't seen the Biker movie for a long time, it's a good look. At the end of the movie you should feel that you have seen it!
