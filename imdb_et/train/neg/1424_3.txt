The film has a good start, representing an interesting and strong Shannon Lee, and introduces two very simple side signs during the first half of the year. But something will happen later, and suddenly Shannon will become such a straightforward, secondly used as a bad girl and the film will lose its own context. The other half has no charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad action, terrible plot and even worse coin coordination. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose the Chechen mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "The Death Game 2" was bad and clowned by Bruce, but his daughter brings with it more embarrassment than the double who played back to Bruce Lee. I really believe that he can do a lot better and I hope he will be better off next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a true fan of strong action and you don't care about quality, watch this movie. I was personally waiting for it, but I was just very disappointed.
