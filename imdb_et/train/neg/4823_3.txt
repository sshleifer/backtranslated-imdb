A flat piece and a two-dimensional script written in letters look like cardboard clippings. Needless to say, this made it harder for any person, especially the groom, to know empathy; He looked and dealt with more comic. All in all, I think it could be said to be the same as your TV drama. It uses almost every cliché in the book. Tortured classic musician who wants to break out and play salsa. A free spirited fiancé who does not love the "bean counter". I don't list them or else it would be a spoiler because I'd give the whole plot away. The dance was OK, but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Luckily I didn't pay good money to see it in the theater. I'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has decorated.
