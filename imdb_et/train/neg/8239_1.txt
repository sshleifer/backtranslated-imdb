It's really the most terrible movie I've ever seen. I just have no idea how anyone is obliged to release it. <br /> <br /> Production standards are cruel. There is no pretense here in cinematography. Camera work, scripting, operation and sound are incredibly crass. I think there's a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes to save time. Hysterical neurotic girls in the middle of this dance have no credibility. <br /> <br /> I would invite someone to spend any time or money on this section. It's really cruel. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
