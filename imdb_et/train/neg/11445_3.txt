I've seen a lot of nonsense a day, but goodness, Hot Rod takes a cake. I saw a free night the other night. I only hope that they will show a funny version to paying customers. The big laughs were small, the plot was uninteresting and the characters were at best one-dimensional. One highlight is a fun ballroom with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and was the only scene I really smiled happily. In addition, I can only recall randomness and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I was expecting more. But for this short, I definitely would not recommend participating in a free screening or paying to watch this movie.
