I do not understand the positive comments on this film. It's cheap and unpleasant at all levels and I don't understand how it has ever been. <br /> <br /> The classic characters are many - Sue's unpleasant mouth, alcoholic, buggy, Irish father is a great example. No character is far from being a fool - except for a brief, Sue Asian boyfriend, but even then he is capable of domestic violence! As desperately as they are, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue would throw themselves into a perfect slip like Bob - but since they do, why should I care what happens to them? So many reviews keep it "realistic". If this is true, it is a sad reflection of society, but there is no reason to put it on the film. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie.
