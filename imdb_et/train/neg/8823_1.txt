This is one of the worst B slashers I've seen in my life. The end is something you have to believe. He puts the gifts under the tree, eats cookies and milk, and then returns to the chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry arrives to find his father, dressed as Santa. Then Harry goes up the stairs, breaks the snowball, grabs the glass layer and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> Then you move on to this day. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps as Santa and watches with little children through a binocular. She has two books. One book for good children and another for bad children. He writes everything they do in these books. The boy is slipping. He also works at Jolly Dream Toy Factory. His brother, Phillip, has a family and two children and lives in a nice house. <br /> <br /> When Harry discovers that his boss only cares about profits, he enters and collects all the toys and transports them to a child. Then he drives to the church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts the gifts under the tree. The kids catch her, but they go to bed. So, Harry goes to the bedroom and kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> When he goes to the house, a bunch of kids will see him and run to him. The parent is nervous and tries to bring their children back to them so they do not get caught. How do they know that Harry is a killer? Of course, you have to be suspicious because you never know who it might be. Harry gives the children gifts and the father pulls the knife out of the switch, trying to pull him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs down, the townspeople will illuminate the torches and follow him to kill him. They don't even know he's a killer. When Harry reaches his brother's house, his brother and him have little talk and Phillip strangles him. He only loses consciousness. Phillip loads Harry into his van. When Harry wakes up, he takes it. <br /> <br /> The end is something I couldn't believe. Again, you must believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that broke me was black Santa. That's right, the man who had seen Santa was a white man. So why do they bring black men? <br /> <br /> Skip it and watch the Silent Night deadly night and kill Santa. You'll get your money to see these two movies. They are better than this garbage bunch! I give this movie a star of 10. I want to give it 0 stars, which is what this film deserves.
