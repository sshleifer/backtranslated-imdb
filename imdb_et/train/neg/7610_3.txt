In general, I don't like Sydney Pollack-directed movies ("The Firm" is somewhat exceptional) and I've never been a Robert Redford fan. However, I thought "three days from Condor" should be good because of the many commendable comments he has received. <br /> <br /> Although widescreen art is very pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow is doing a good job as an unhappy professional killer, I found the whole thing extremely disappointing. The film undoubtedly radiates a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is destroyed by a confused plot that doesn't seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> The film also includes one of the most unsatisfactory endings I've ever seen. the viewer hung in the air. And what about this absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I'd look at Hitchcock movies a lot more than five times in a row to sit on that waste again.
