I had great hopes for this movie. I thought the assumption was interesting. I got stuck with it, though I found the actor, except Helena Bonham Carter, unnoticeable. I was hoping my time would pay off, but finally I left to wonder why they even did that. Perhaps in George Orwell's version there is a message that is worth passing on. When this film has achieved something, it has inspired me to read Orwell's classics. I find it hard to believe that his story can be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the film's message is "daily living is worth living" then they have succeeded. I recommend this movie to no one; 101 minutes of my life was wasted.
