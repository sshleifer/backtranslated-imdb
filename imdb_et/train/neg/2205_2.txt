This type of plot really has a lot of potential, but it was polished here. Honestly, I felt cheese at the beginning of the item, but I thought it would improve after grotesque delivery. Oh, I was wrong! So a mad scientist makes a monster, wants to have his old sons before his killing, but of course they are fleeing. After that it is really bad. I should have counted when the rubber shark mask was hidden behind some foliage, but I would probably have lost the count. tell us how shark-man finds people. I hate that all aspects of the horror film are fed with a spoon. <br /> <br /> Oh, and after the mutated shark-man is almost killed and around the jungle-esque island, there's nothing more joyful than the middle-man in Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> This is where you find yourself at the bottom of the monster ... if you can look at this bad excuse for flick.
