I liked the trainee for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now in season 5? (or is it 6?) things just become too tiring. <br /> <br /> I liked the show, but the change is Donald Trumps' own ego fest. Promised your company that you work but come on! some things say "You are FIRED" is just offensive. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I wouldn't want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, terrible or such. It's just that the show is unrealistic and how it deals with things just makes me worship. Good entertainment? YES, but tiring, because looking back will become so tiring ... its not teamwork, not personal, but fair business. look at your back.
