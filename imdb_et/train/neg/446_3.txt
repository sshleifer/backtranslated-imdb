It was disappointing. It started well enough, but when it went away and lost all the opportunity to get up, it gradually fell. Maria Schrader's behavior is terrible, never means what she says, or even knowing what she says until she says it. He didn't show any real emotion, not the story of his beloved goy or mother. If Lena seems to be a little more than Lena's academic interest. There was never a real relationship between Lena and her mother, except that her mother seemed to have a good time at weddings, which is not much. The anticipated parallel between Hannah's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was so clich√©s as they came, and still failed unhappy. The wedding was absolutely convincing and dark. The protest climax was uninspiring, and regardless of what Lena had or had not done to influence the outcome, she would certainly have shown somewhat feelings, a haunting image, unexplained ambivalence at that time. In fact, no movie symbol had any depth or spark. Whichever, even Ruth, was very difficult. Everything with Luis was disturbing. (Why did he recapture it when he was on the phone in the hotel? There was no context or explanation about it.) If every reference to him was removed, it is not noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story that caused confusion with bad character development (who was mother, again?), weak acting, and leadership that made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear "silence"! "I started thinking that it was worth 7, but when the movie went down, it quickly fell to 4, then earned a fool of 3 after the wedding picture. It was about the same cold and sterile movie I've seen. terrible waste.
