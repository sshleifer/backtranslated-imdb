the lowest possible score is one star? it is a pity. really, i'm gonna talk about the "null stars" of IMDb. WAY gives too many stars to give this movie. I'm the only one who noticed that the microphones hanging over the hopper head are in the station? and act, or should I say its absence? apparently the talent was not a factor when the electorate reached the city. my little sister's primary school talent show offers a greater range and depth of emotion. and these fake Irish accents were like chalk board nails. the only thing that could have made this movie even worse would have been ... oo, wait, no, no, it's as bad as it gets.
