Really starts well, nice intro and accumulates with the main characters, but after about 5 minutes the charm is gone. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same form as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without supporting a cast or innovative story that made Pie's movie more commercial. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - Heder is pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels, and Faris did their best, but they didn't have a significant plot or script to get their teeth. In the film, there is no speed or clear logic that justifies its length. <br /> <br /> The end is as predictable as they come - so predictable that I've marked the spoiler box as this line. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid at all costs if you really have nothing to do / listen to or watch, and even then you feel that the producers beat you for only one and a half hours of your life.
