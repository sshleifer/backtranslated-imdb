I mean seriously what a group is singing from a crazy car? What if their ten, it's too immature for a little boy to sing "being my wives", I mean seriously! The name is also pretty horny, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants? HOW CREATIVE.I can't get why they need TV shows. I mean, most artists don't really need a television show themselves, especially the band of naked brothers. Heck how many of them are freaking in the group. And seriously, what about the movie? Jeez Nick uses my years as a highlander, but seriously a naked brother band? So many parents don't let their kids watch it, especially the Naked Brother's band, it's a stupid, creative show that shouldn't be promoted to the TV.
