Incredibly terrible movie. I recently looked at this part of T.V. My jaw dropped when I looked at the terribly perceived plot and listened to despair. No line from the captain of the single liner could almost capture anything that resembles. It was so bad that it made me run out of Rodney Dangerfield's body, beat her around and yell, "How could you?" I know many movies are hurried, hoping that they will give money to the popularity of a certain maker or topic. But please, Hollywood, show your audience a bit of respect. It's sad and scary that people are expected to see them see it. Baking bottom, even on Sunday afternoon with television standards.
