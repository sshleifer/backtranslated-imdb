Should every good story be "enhanced" by adding the Broadway music on the corridor? Apparently, those who can't get their plots think that classical literature is just a robbery. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, because it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you significantly behind, and that was a great example of ... So of course take this serious story and add nauseating music and camp it every characters from lady boys to chipping bobbies and maybe it's lifting? Argh. Bring me the pool. <br /> <br /> Four stars in my estimation come from casting, which I could compare to my fair lady. In each of these films, there was a game that the game version can be proud of, but then they have to go and sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, the singers could actually do it here, and they mercifully mercifully voiced the voice of Oliver Reed's song (grace, if I am wrong, it has been for some time). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint was noted. Why embarrass everyone, except for the truly shameless, making stupid songs a complete story? However, it has been done well. In general, this story destroys. It did it. The jury is still wondering if this story is worth recording, but it is impossible to say anything about it.
