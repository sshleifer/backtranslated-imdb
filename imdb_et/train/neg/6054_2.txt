I'm not sure if Carpenter wants to raise questions about abortion and make a really difficult hand and an obvious point that a woman should be given an abortion when Satan is a father, but it pulls on and on. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The child is really silly, basically a crab with a child's head. You can see pretty much Satan's costume material. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes and 55 minutes of tedium. Very, very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After his child has learned, has the devil destroyed the abortion clinic and kills everyone in the great, bloody, church, resurrection? NO! He just puts his head down and closes the room. Terrible.
