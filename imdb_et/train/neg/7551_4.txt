Well, finally, I was able to see a remake made last night in London, involuntarily fun, sexless and without any real sense of humor. I really don't know where to start, but when I took this strange respect for entertainment, I didn't really want to. The action is scary hammy, there is no original music, costumes are too "Disney" after Nic Cage burning ridiculous "six months" (which didn't come fast enough for me) with Cage in a bear suit was an audience suppression, like comedy, which strikes out of the many bad things on the island. This is such a strange remake that I quite believe I saw, reminding me of what Comic Strip presents in the eighties, just like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miners strike, very strange!
