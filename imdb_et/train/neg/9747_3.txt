First, this movie sucks. But let's investigate why. The claim that the machine is capable of converting, storing and then transporting and transporting material into energy is at least intriguing. But this is as much as they assume. Instead of getting into something that can happen when someone does such a machine, they break the damn thing. It could have been a good prerequisite. Living under the authority of such power and dealing with the constant temptation, ie the invisible man. But no .. they break the thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So your doctor will take the thing back and try to transport yourself. Just to make it beautiful but stupid secretary, (duh) finish. What wouldn't have happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave. Now he is traveling to the countryside, killing people because his little attempt failed and they didn't give him money. Wah. Then make the film even worse, throw a dry British relationship between two partially qualified professors who hired him to help. Between their loving sessions, they try to find him a few when he kills half of London. All of this could have happened if the fucking machine did not break, which would never have happened if Lembach hadn't left. This film tried to give him 2 stars, but it would have been better if they didn't break the fucking machine, so Lembach would leave, making him again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
