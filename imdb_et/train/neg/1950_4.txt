I grew up with scooby (a little where you are). I hate splitting, I love Daphne and I feel it is not complete with all my strength. But it is sad, scooby doo is a mystery to solve the comedy-not bad totally spy's jap anime. I like "whats new", they had to give a threat-prone Daphne makeover sometime :( and try to lose * sex * drug jokes for many generations, but this "get clue" is flat out of nonsense and shouldn't be Scooby's name added, they tried even make some lame punk that is now with his song. Now I watch my DVD from scooby doo where you want to wash this new series of slag from my eyes
