I have a terrible "Boom!" Video tag, and I want to see it all over my wide screen. So I voted "1" and hope too. Together, we can pull this movie into the cinematic film wells and hope that someone sees BIG as an opportunity for BIG MONEY. your director cut in an extended version. The film is one of my worshiping favorites, you just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the operator, and you say to yourself, "Yes, I think you can make a lot of time for some people." Note that everywhere this is shown, theaters have sold crowds. But it hasn't yet reached Frostbite Falls.
