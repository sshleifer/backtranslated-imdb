"Succubus", edited version of "Necronomicon Getr√§umte Synd", is a fight to sit, even after 76 minutes; more of this terribly boring and terrible Euroregion ride and we could be in the coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again offers a really terrific 60th garbage bin that seems to have been made for cast and A-grade hallucinogenic teams, because not one second of this confusion made no sense. Probably one of the best films of the 180s? it is hard to believe that there will be worse efforts. <br /> <br /> An unknown plot deals with Franco's usual gender, violence and lesbian issues and throws some of S & M's for a good action, but still manages to stay desperate. life is too short to watch this pill.
