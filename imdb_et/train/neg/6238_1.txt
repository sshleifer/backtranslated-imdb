Oh man, it's amazing how someone can demand global warming for science, well, I think this elitist crap will now replace the science of eugenics! Al Gore is trying to make this problem difficult, although he needs common sense that this whole thing is a big mess with a man who has his own moneymaking plan! <br /> <br /> How have scientists evaluated the historical temperature of this planet? Assessing the sun's on-site activity. Has anyone ever asked if this method is right? No, not even Gore himself! So how is it wrong to predict the future temperature of the future with solar radiation, if it is so accurate in the past? According to the on-site activities of the sun, today's temperature is perfectly in line with what should be. How has the temperature of the whole universe increased (relatively) as much as the earth? Do our SUVs cause Jupiter to rise? <br /> <br /> Make sense of common sense! You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that it can't be anything but HOAX. Please look into it yourself. What will Al Gore and his elite friends like Rothschild (a banking family who organized a living land event) benefit from? Well, the new world bank is based on carbon credits, that is, the tax that pays for everything that gives carbon emissions, and these taxes make it easier to get away if people are tempted to think that it is saving the world only if it is money, centralized control and more power for elite bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Isn't it noble to voluntarily pay for carbon credits to save the world, especially when it goes to its own company? <br /> <br /> I don't want you to believe me blindly, please do your research and use your common sense, and I'm sure you will come to the right conclusion!
