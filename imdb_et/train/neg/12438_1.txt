Beating the bad boys ... Again, this is the tagline of this movie, it has so much truth about it. <br /> <br /> Home alone and two, movie classic. Home Alone three and four, good movie, if you're three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as hard as he's trying to be funny, it's not. Culkini is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He's very happy actors with delicate performances, but it's not entirely his fault, writing required unique vocabulary and empty expressions. The worship is first copied differently from the first two, and you have to be blind to think that these chickenpox are real. A good choice if you are a pre-school teacher who shows this movie on a rainy day. And make things the worst, totally different pain, see if you don't believe me, but you will regret it.
