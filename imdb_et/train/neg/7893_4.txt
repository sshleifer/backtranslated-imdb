At first we see the beginning of some secret councils. It all looks very close. With some supernatural elements, the mystery is thrown away in a minute. The main character who seems to be happy is in trouble because he has the right to demand money (temptation) and other factors. You really know this guy and you want to know what's going on. Usually a person in his / her situation would have several options. Somehow he has no such options. There seems to be only one solution in this film, even if it is clear that it is not his fault. From blue, he encounters signs that speak of the church, prayer, and God. And they answer their problem. The film should be clear about this solution. Let me now say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Because it is always useful. But the message was hidden. This religious element destroyed the viewing experience for me. While the message is good, this simplicity does not mean that there is more to happen in real life to solve the problems in this life. The secret to us can never be solved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another topic that has nothing to do with the plot. Don't be fooled by Malcolm Mcdowell. Once a brilliant actor is enough, but if you look closely, you will see that he is not serious at all. He must really get the money. Otherwise, his caliber acted in such a film.
