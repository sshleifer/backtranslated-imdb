Never pour patterns and playboy bunnies into your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich had enough real estate to marry his SISTER after his murder for his small life, is zillion more interesting than Dorothy himself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not an actor either. I look forward to seeing some lost masterpiece instead of la Orson Welles, but instead Audrey Hepburn got jeans and godly "poodlesque" hair art .... Very disappointing. "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I got to watch over and over again. That clunker I can hardly sit down. This film was apparently not released because it was surrounded by the deadly death of Mrs Stratten; I think the real reason was that it was so bad!
