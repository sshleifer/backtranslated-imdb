The Borges story is deliberately an odd customization of Cox. His strong visual feel is as usual, most of the cast dreaded half-baked. The film is certainly in the surreal tradition of the Bunuel Mexican period, and occasionally, as a poor man, accepts the elements of the crime of Lars Von Ter. Cox's obvious preference for single, jumping and surrounding sound recording works against the film's effectiveness. It's worth a look, but finally a disappointment.
