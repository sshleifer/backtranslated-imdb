Oscar Wilde's comedy comedy, perhaps also the most written game, is all except for secondary casting. Sanders is, as one would expect, a random, indolently glorious role in Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain strives for a gradual emphasis on alternative sentences, and other cast members seem to think it is melodrama and not comedy; Indeed, the whole production has publications that reduce it to a tragedy - no doubt the Hays office demanded. Preminger's direction seems to be mainly to ensure that there are many servants there and even music seems banal. Paste visually the perfect silent carriage, led by Lubitsch or even the 2004 version of the screen with Helen Hunt, Mrs Erlyn; or try to read the words with joy. But skip this version.
