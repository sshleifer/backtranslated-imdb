This is the only question I will miss. Why did this movie suck so much when it was so big cast? Why was writing so bad that the audience was completely tied to characters? Why didn't it make sense at all? Why was the studio a completely good prerequisite and "Hollywood" from this hell when everything was good, intelligent story? Why? I never understand why movies with good movies are changing for the time they are released. I hope Spacey, Freeman, is the winner of the Oscar, that it will never be released on big American screens. <br /> <br /> Like someone with a Bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is just ridiculous. I just ... I think the script had potential, but the execution made it cliche and terrible. Just. No.
