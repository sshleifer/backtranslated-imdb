Not the worst movie I've seen, but certainly not very good. I myself am a paintball player who played a lot of balloon and is going to a big change from the forest to the balloon. The film is of similar quality First of all, the film begins with the team who will probably try this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and wear sweaters and shooting games, car dancers. One boy who was in the bush. Not much wrong with the movie, but the more it is perceived, it was very cheesy. A lot of kids who are good guys are wild ball players who don't seem to have much money and have dreams of getting "better weapons". The other team constantly chooses them and insults them because they play in the woods and blah blah blah. Phantom helps these wood-burning children out and wreak havoc on them and all this, he can play them with a balloon, and basically all teams, including "specialists", win. So, what exactly is wrong in the movie? Well, the budget is a big deal, the paintball movie isn't bad, but the budget is pretty low and the film looks like the amateur did. There are no big names in this movie and the actress is very fun. Paintball's perception is too bad. They seem to say that everyone is going for a quick ball and everything else. It was just an instant movie in my opinion, and it doesn't give a real idea of ​​what paintball is. Frankly, not a real paintball all buddy like a friend, it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not "respect" and playing rules. Don't look at this movie and then wait to go to the field where "4 is 1!"
