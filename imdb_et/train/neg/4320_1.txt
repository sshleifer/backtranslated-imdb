First of all, let me tell you that this is not a movie for people who want to see something wonderful and joyful during the holidays. This film is cold, brutal and just frustrating. Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mother who is left behind at Christmas because her husband has lost her job, loses her house, can't buy Christmas gifts for kids, and so on. You get the idea, happy things for the saints. That's how Harry Dean Stanton arrives at Gideon as a Christmas Catcher, who in his dark hat and long coat is more than a pedophile who hangs the kids all day, watching them. What better way to decorate the Christmas spirit with Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer to bring them back when she believes in Christmas again. Santa is a press officer and his Christmas shop looks like a refuge for Nazi refugees. The film makes everything so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it is because the rest of the movie is both bitter and incredible. I'm sure this movie wanted to be something like Capra, but it left out the joy and feelings about what the holiday movie should be.
