This film is like material S.E. Hinton wrote in the 1970s and Copola adapted the screen in the early 80s and, if Trueblood was actually the result, the results would have been much better (especially in the actress's section). Instead, we get a rather badly-funny piece of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street player, I think it's an accurate description. It was the days of the action film that used boys in their 40s and mid-30s and dressed them up in greader yarns or some more powerful choice from a gangster and they fought the 80s music work. Nevertheless, Ray is a lonely caregiver of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe, where he screams a lot), who is forced to leave the train station inexplicably when he is away from the police forces and forced to serve naval time. The flash before the present day and Ray are back in town and are looking for their brother, who has also become a gang of the street, although the gang that was Ray's and now the old scores must be violently resolved (and again, the police have to be away again and this time, the woman's honor defended in the sense of the action film) before Ray can live with his brother, Donny, at a normal pace. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. For me, most of it involves too much effort, though not Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn, who plays with the speaker with whom he interacts with friends. The guys in Gang and Lowe himself seem to be a little unnecessary exaggerated as tough on New York City. Although larger hanging is a recycled plot line and perhaps a film that was a very good 1989 product.
