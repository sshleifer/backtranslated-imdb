Michael Caine has always argued that Ashanti was "the only film (s) for money" and "the worst film he ever played". Hold on, Michael, aren't you on lap and speed? And were both movies not much worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers only too frighteningly that the physically punitive demands of filming at 130 degrees Fahrenheit's temperature (director Richard Fleischer was hospitalized as a result of sunburn firing). What Ashanti actually does, as is Michael Cain's career opportunity. Instead, it is a very average chase-thriller with talented cast, exotic places, boring stretches and extremely shapely. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a doctor of W.H.O. who has been devastated when his black wife, Anan (Beverly Johnson), disappears during a trip to the African tribal village. Linderby is gradually realizing that his wife has been hit by slave traders led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and he is giving up the whole continent, which will eventually lead to the Middle East. <br /> <br /> Along the way, the big letters pop up for inefficient and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a bad firefighter as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif has little of his usual charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks bored when he is in a helpful contact because of his brief role in helping Cain in his quest. The film is based on the best seller Ebano sold by the well-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the relationship that made the book so popular is mostly absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is a career as a slave (he seems to be able to perform bad performances in all his films) and Caine generates incredible anguish because a man who thinks he will never see his wife again. Sometimes there is momentum, but Ashanti is moving quite slowly. All in all, it is a resilient hockey - not any terrible, as Caine has often suggested, but not a very inspiring film, and certainly all talented talents.
