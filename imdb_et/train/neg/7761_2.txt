After a series of power transmissions at a remote island zoo, genetically modified sabotage tigers have been open and nursing for the island. Man, the sci-fi channel has made some bad "original" movies, but I think it may be their worst so far! This poorly written and directed "Jurassic Park" rip-off offers all the usual clich√©s (mad scientists who think that the people killed by the monsters are "wasting losses". The movie must die a terrible death, etc.) and surprisingly, there is no tension. The special effects are cruel, the pups of the close relatives of the title beasties are bad enough, looking like rigid soft dolls, but CGI, which makes computer-generated dinosaurs look like "dinosaurs walking". comparatively is just terrible. There are some gore, but most seem pretty convincing. Oh, and the scene of the scientist's death is finally one of the worst things I've seen for years. I couldn't even laugh to be so bad! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time, it's just totally bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting tricks for you? This movie lent music tips for the 2003 sci-fi movie "Alien Hunter", which was much better than this cute one.
