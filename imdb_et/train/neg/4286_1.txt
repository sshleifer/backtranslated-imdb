This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say quite a lot, because I have also seen a soldier where he plays a villain ... but what I have heard is not considered Jason Scott Lee's movie. It is. And if this is a sign of the quality of such films, I don't see any of them. Lee is basically satisfactory as a martial artist ... as a leader, he is terrible. Every few minutes, the film gets into a random no-name fight, probably because the scriptwriter couldn't figure out how otherwise the minimum time required to remove the movie. The offender is the only person who even has a hint of personality, and besides being really crazy, he hardly sees a villain at all. Most of the movie is basically Lee, who drives the cable through time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can definitely not say ... and I certainly wouldn't look at it again. Impacts are not completely terrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, this interesting idea is filming. The plot is too complicated for you. Stimulation is bad. I can't say anything positive about this movie ... I really can't. It's just too formal and pointless. If only I had the time machine so I could go back and stop making this movie ever ... no, never. I just hope that a few fragile senses will come into contact with it. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to Lee fans and someone else. If you are looking for a high quality movie ... this is not the case. It has been confirmed. 1/10
