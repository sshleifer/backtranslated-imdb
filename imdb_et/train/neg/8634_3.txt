Seeing the man who attacked the zombies saw the hope that Lucio's "Zombie" Fulci might be in front of his old tricks. Unfortunately, besides the close-ups of the rotten body, in this story, a small suggestion is made to find out the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter's attempts to kill him. No characters are tempting, and by the time you know how they did it (at least twisting was cool), you stop taking care. The only good thing I can say is that it was more meaningful than Nightmare Concert!
