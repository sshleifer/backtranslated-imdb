!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think that a story that includes Archie Gray Owl - English Red Indiana would have a huge amount of humor. In fact, I say the only way to treat such a film is when a remarkable person understands that the public is credible to treat it as a comedy. But Richard Attenborough does something like a crime, making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse still, he also made a very tough movie. Pierce Brosnan does not have the charisma required for the title role, and there is no screen chemistry between Gray Owl and Pony (played equally by wood Annie Gaupeau). But to be honest, they didn't help with a script that doesn't represent Archie as a blush, he's buggy all who believe he's a native American. Manufacturers and the scriptwriter have made a bigger mistake because the film center is around the English language of the Archie plot - that's why I wrote a "Possible spoiler" that hasn't really been revealed until the film's delay, the title is English, but it's clear that anyone who does it watching the movie, knew it wasn't a surprise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmental protector of the 20th century when the truth was said. It should also be borne in mind that, with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and perhaps two who want to classify it as a green message), there hasn't really been a big ecological film. In fact, the most environmentally friendly films, which include GRAY OWL, absorb the film, which was surprisingly a serious problem in finding a distributor.
