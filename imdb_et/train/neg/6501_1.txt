This movie is again one of those films that anyone thinks or tries to make others think they understand. Anyone trying to understand this idea is MORON! My advice would be to take two not one but two hits with very strong acid and at least you can visual excitement out! Although you can finally kill your waste of acid! Given that this comment needs 10 lines of information, let me write something for those trying to protect the film. Unknown. Garbage. Schitzoid. Waste of talent. The film is a paper with ice, a bright cloud, a puddle of diving in the sun .... Sounds like a lion in a red light and sees the hair. Now explain it to me !!!!
