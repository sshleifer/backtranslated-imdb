I'm a big fan of Batman comics and I was disappointed when I couldn't find Batman anymore: An animated series on television anymore. I was glad to find out that there is a new Batman comic on television. I looked at the first episode of the day when it premiered, and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, animation is very bad. It looks like it's a cheap and lovely Japanese anime. Again, almost every modern comic is like that. <br /> <br /> Character design is even worse. Batman looks like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks like Hull's red version, penguin is Kung-Fu champion, Mr. Freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg and Riddler is the look of Gothic Marilyn Manson (which is funny because I don't expect people who are obsessed with riddles and riddles to be gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character is Joker. They turned him into a monkey / demented Bob Marley / Kung-Fu fighter! Joker should be Batman's deadly enemy, but in this show he hardly poses any danger because his crimes are so stupid and pointless. In one episode, his plan was to put his Joker-poison dog on food! Oh, how evil! Batman is a fascinating and complicated character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents, so he is fighting crime. This Batman version does not seem to be haunted by his parents' deaths and is not at all interesting. He's not a detective, just a fighter. If the enemy fails to win, he will not teach the enemy to find their weak points like a detective, he will build a giant fight robot to win them. Many times, this show does not even show Batman's show, but another pointless anime that is nothing but a pointless fight. <br /> <br /> What I hate most about this show is what they did to hate. They have taken away everything that makes them pleasant and relative, making them stereotypical evil boys. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In comics, he is a tragic scientist studying bats to find his deafness. When you test yourself, he accidentally turns into a giant bat. In this exhibition, he is a crazy scientist who wants to turn himself into a huge bats for no apparent reason. Almost all the villains are such; none of them, except about one or two, is the real motive of their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst character is Mr. Freeze. In the comic, Freeze was just a crazy scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the "Ice of Ice" episode of BTAS, which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic, three-dimensional and pleasant villain. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as its true origin and were even used in comics as its origin. Even this beating movie, Batman & Robin, used it as its origin. In this show, he is a gemstone before he started to freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He's still a little gem of power! Great origin. No wonder they used it over one Din created. <br /> <br /> As a Batman fan, I don't like this exhibition just because it's not like comics, because I liked the BTAS, Batman cartoons that followed Tim Burton's Batman movies and probably the great Christopher Nolan Batman movies. None of them were 100% loyal to comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this exhibition is not that it is not exactly like comics or BTAS, that is, it has no depth that makes Batman's media so popular. <br /> <br /> I have shown so many options, but the more I look, the more I find it paralyzing. I miss the good old days when Batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy.
