A group of people looking for land to eat the land to eat the crash lands on the planet of prehistoric wild animals, where they all eat physique mushrooms and act slowed down. With a cushioned "Dinosaur Planet" and terrible jokes, this is definitely one of the most unforgettable. Action is also cruel and although it is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can be?) It is still a rather terrible reluctance. It's a 90-minute driving time that seems like eternal, and you're probably passionate about life, so you make a tremendous benefit and just move on, leave this funny movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers try to sell this snake as a MST3K style that makes it a fun movie they did a decade earlier, and it works to such an extent that it is still not something that could be seen, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a pretty unpleasant voice. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Joke Comment, 17 Behind the Scenes featurette; 7 minutes in black featuretti; Reporting by Jessica Mills; Stills Gallery; and original trailer
