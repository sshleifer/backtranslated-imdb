It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of waste! I swear the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. It's not wrong. Don't even rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was just too plausible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was OK. Just OK. I felt sorry for him (actress) when people remember this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as he always is. Charming and sweet, but without purpose. "Romance" with John was absolutely unbelievable.
