There is an interesting discussion in this film. Is a moral person good enough or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The movie is said to be a morally good person without God's guidance. At the beginning of the film, there is a line: "You and I can look at a person who is morally good, but both know he's going to hell." <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a Christian, the debate over the film was exciting, but not in the way the movie was designed. I left the film with a stronger feeling that morally good * is enough. The arguments and discussions presented were very biased, so they broke the weight of their ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially if it is unknown and uneducated. George Carlin's character Dogmas said, "Keep it when they are young". <br /> <br /> The basic assumption is also very interesting. The Bible researcher from the 1890s tries to publish a book that says that morality without God is OK, as long as morality makes sense. Are you just telling a child not to steal? Or do you tell him he won't steal because God says you're not going? (do not bother to tell the child not to steal, because well how he would feel when it was his marble that was stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants to help his school sell a book (spread the world). However, he needs unanimous consent and one of the scientists is against it. He raises the argument of morality and the words of God in a very interesting debate at the beginning of the film, in the interest of morality. In order to prove his point, he produces a time machine (the film is only put in place to do the plot work I've done well), and sends it to Carlisle in 2002 to see where moral without God is guiding us. /> <br /> As it should be obvious, he has his own opinion, and it changes what he sees, and he has changed himself by the time of his return (because he returns, it is not a spoiler, it is a bible after the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> As a movie as a movie, it's pretty slow and pretty bad. Something that wasn't on this movie * is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to try to find out who is Carlisle, even if he hasn't hurt anyone, a crime or something else. What's wrong with the movie that just shows Carlisle's opinion, showing her views on this "sinful world" and returning her a new perspective? There are also some points in the film that confirm to me that I'm happy that I am not a Christian or at least someone who says "It is God or nothing". Three close to the end of the movie rather bothered me ... first, when two "bad guys" in the corner of Carlisle just before jumping, Carlisle does * only * a truly despicable act. Jesus and making it so "bad" (who are also Christians, strangely enough), think they just left the attack. Secondly, after returning to Carlisle, he finds a boy who scared at the beginning of the film that he did not steal (but did not mention God, the boy kept the marble and ran away) and tells him the time when theft is wrong because God commands it. As mentioned in Carlin's quotation above, my book is intimidating children as religion. <br /> <br /> And finally, the epilogue. Another intimidation tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far they could go, and she says she doesn't know. The epilogue tells her she's trying the distant future of the Bible (starting from 2100) and it fails. years at the age of 10 and try again, and after leaving, it is similar to 2030. Throughout the film, Carlise mentions that she felt the end of the world because the world was full of sin and the disappearance of the name of God. The tactics of intimidation have been in use for thousands of years. In enlightened times, the church would have illuminated. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. Although I was pretty sure it was morally good, I know that fact. It is worth checking out if you are not a Christian to confirm how happy you are not to be as unknown to the people of this movie.
