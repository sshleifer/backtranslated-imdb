my friend bought it (very cheap) and decided to give it to me for a birthday. I thought I should never look at it because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover was pathetic, but then my friends got really bored and watched it. from the beginning to the end! I know quite a bit of accomplishment, but it's really a masterpiece. is hard to describe. you should see it, it is a real lesson of what people can do if they believe they are creative and intelligent and really are not. "Acting" is a sous-landscape (you can actually drive a "leading woman" laugh in some cases, she's definitely the worst). "story" is a stupid sum up and really all in this movie suck. please pay special attention to "sheriff". a man is an adult and therefore he has no excuse for participating. he is also very bad. Whatever it is, there are some fun moments. check it out, haha
