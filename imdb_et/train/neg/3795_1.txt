I really wanted to love this example. I really, honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers get their "bachelor" version. In his mandatory "action" by Andra, James, a good-looking, well-deserved, thirtieth person has the opportunity to fall in love with 15 smoke (or "companions") as they are shown. The only problem is half of them are straight and James doesn't know it. When James chooses a homosexual, he gets a trip to New Zealand and when he chooses a straight line, he gets a straight boy $ 25,000. How is it not fun?! Take my hand, let it walk: <br /> <br /> The most striking problem with this exhibition is the Bachelor's degree. James is your typical young and successful gay boy who has a nice smile and body before you go past a lot of pastures. Why did they choose to go out with James's leading man. God knows that there are so many other hottest and lively homosexual men who die to be on television. <br /> <br /> Apart from its fairly medium physical appearance, James is about as interesting and exciting as chalk. Even as such, he is surprising and terrible around the aura. But when James stood against an empty, white wall, he put it in there. I can't honestly recall an interesting or remarkable thing James showed at the show. He's bored and forgotten. In fact, one of the companions reported that he did not know the connection. I thought it was the best part of the show. James also speaks an annoying annoyance. Sound feminine or sound masculine, but don't **** give mixed signals to the middle of sentences ... so painful to sit. I hated him so much during the exhibition that I thought, "Please choose a straight boy and lower yourself and your unfortunate view" <br /> <br /> Then we have smoke. An extremely gentle bunch of men who don't seem to care about what's going on. Equally, the coats seem to be different from one man, except: "Hey, that boy is highlighting a blonde, or oh, that it has curly hair." While it may be busy writing cast roles, it would have been much more interesting to look at than those amorphous drives. But in all of their banals they still manage to build James (which is not so difficult to do), a little. You know you have a problem when some smokers are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man. And the fact that spectators seem to be more fun with the EACH than with the leading person? Very sad. <br /> <br /> I also thought that Id stands for something mentioned on message boards, which I felt it was true: straight men are hotter than gay guys. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring because I really found some of them very cute. It's just that, in general, they were just BLAH, compared to the men you see at exhibitions like Sila with the love of Tila Tequila or Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I moved quickly during this show. I can accept the intriguing character of both a leading and a cardboard box, I can accept a daily, apathetic defendant, but PLEASE that God's love attracts me a little. There is no such happiness. <br /> <br /> If you are waiting for drama, intrigue, sexuality or excitement, then you're SEXELY disappointed. The biggest "drama" stems from the fact that one of the smoke can still be in New York (like a scandal!). As you tighten that it can guarantee you, it is ONLY the thing that reminiscent of any contradiction at its exhibition. <br /> <br /> Of course there are twists, but if you have Gaydar, then you just perceive who is not at all difficult (I was just wrong once). that it doesn't get anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We, like James & Co plod, look at such exciting activities as learning western dance, buying gifts, visiting the zoo and gay karaoke. YAWN. Of course, you have occasional topless dancing, but who cares if everything is boring. This is one of the main problems with the example: NO ONE seems to be enjoying itself - they are just going through a movement that is trying hard to feel from time to time. And you really can't blame them because the events are all wildly unimaginable and flat. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no physical aspect. No vengeance, no pampering, no kissing (!), No sort of. It's just "Ok that it was a boring date, I'm going back to my ugly, sticky wanna-be Sydney Operahouse dwelling (fast peck lips) CYA." This exhibition is as nice as it is ridiculous. I understand that they do not want to play the perceived insecure nature of homosexual men, but come to ****. People who watch reality TV shows want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses. This exhibition refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if it was long-lasting, but I felt that these were problems that had to be addressed. I praised Bravot for the first time for this kind of exhibition, but the stunning incompetent way of this exhibition is desperate. To sum up my three points: boring + boring + boring - go for something else. You have more fun waiting for a doctor in the office, at least they have interesting magazines there.
