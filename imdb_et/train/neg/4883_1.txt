During the cheap movies filmed during the Crazy Fat Ethel II video games, I was wondering if it was the same film that was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is foolishly simple. Ethel, a murderous maniac with a eating disorder, is shot in half of the house because of hospital overcrowding. He is by far the most sensible resident to look at when one person puts a dead fly to another soup. Then Ethel pops one of the chocolate plates on one side of the house worker after he hits the cost of cutting down on the cost of feeding the dog's food. Ethel casts him down the stairs, and then .... well, you get that idea. If it all sounds like fun, it's not. This film was badly affected and cheaper. The characters are on the wood when they deliver their rows, which they have to stand out in front of the cigar shop. Even worse, half of the movie is made up of setbacks to the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is a bit better. VERY poor effort.
