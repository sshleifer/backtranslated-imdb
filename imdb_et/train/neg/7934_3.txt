A family who travels with her daughter's softball league decides to take a scenic road and reaches the center. Father is an avid photographer, and when he hears in an old abandoned side show in town, he decides to take another journey to take some photos. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side show is full of inbred freaks who abduct women quickly and leave the young son and father to take care of themselves. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this movie is how the family actually struggles with their sex prisoners. There's nothing worthwhile about the movie.
