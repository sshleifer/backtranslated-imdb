I remember watching this movie in the 86's when it first came out and what a terrible movie. The action was terrifying when the plot was as weak as it would have been or should have been pulling. I think it made me sleep more than once and I wasn't tired of remembering. Please avoid taking out all your teeth at any cost without an anesthetic that would be more fun. I'm sorry I couldn't give it to zero or a negative result. I wish I hadn't wasted my money by getting all that I can say from the video store that this tape was still brand new, hardly surprising, because the film was so bad. When I remember sitting and watching with the girl I really wanted to go out with and sitting next to me, it was still not enough to keep me awake, which was bad for the movie.
