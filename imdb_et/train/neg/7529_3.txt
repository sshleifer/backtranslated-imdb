Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this movie is still one of the worst films. This is due to Bruce Lee's death due to the fall of a helicopter after he has hit a ninja knife on the back of the neck, but it does not explain how he reached the helicopter because the previous scene is close to him but not on a helicopter already 200 feet in the air. Then it just becomes absurd, like a cheap comic book. Perhaps this idea is not so rotten, but it is not done to some extent from an artistic point of view. There are dozens of martial arts bombers that are usually made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre by adding credible stories to his movies and having filmmakers who can use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are better than 90 percent of the martial arts movies made in Hong Kong in the 1970s and early 1980s. "Game Death II", in my opinion, belongs to the category of junk, despite the fact that Bruce Lee is in it.
