You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I don't know why one of the worst movies should contain one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars should not only be victims of the violation, but also the only true actors and performers in it. So how on earth do you make Porsche, Lamborghini or any of these people contact their cars and destroy your reputation for the millions you give. It hurts those who love cars. It hurts those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
