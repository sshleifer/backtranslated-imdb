This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but I don't remember when I've seen worse. I thought it was about accident investigation. It was really a soap opera and bad. They outperformed the "conflict" card. The first hour seems like a screaming game with some incredible scenes. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 40-minute "monument" (with the necessary black umbrellas and rain) was flat for fictitious victims, and I thought it would never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs if you do not want 'conflict'. <br /> <br />
