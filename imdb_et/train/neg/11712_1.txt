The only reason I remember this movie is that it was (and still is) the biggest spending time and money. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18. We were at the age of the movies we enjoyed most (ok 2. most). We went out of such offended hours, we wanted our money back, but we could never get the time back. <br /> <br /> Editing is what killed this movie. Since the truck is attacking more and more vehicles with rocket launchers, the film is completely offended by the audience's intelligence by taking these rogue bad guys to 4x4 VW. Please, missiles on a truck that is known to be plutonium? Worse still, these VW can get 15-18 frames out of 4 rocket launchers. You would see four rocket fires in VW 2, cut around the truck last fixed, come back to the second two rockets, come in second, then drive in front of the truck and now it's back with a full 4 rocket sets. <br /> <br /> We punished it, hoping for a great finish that never happened. It seems they just ran out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
