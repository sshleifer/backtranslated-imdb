It's no worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on creating pleasant, intelligent characters. As for the attractions, the main characters of Say Yes are the odd couple. Nice done. Unfortunately, they are incredibly stupid. Let's count ways in which they terrorize wrongly. <br /> <br /> 1. After the attacker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him which hotel you are when you leave him. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat the hell out of the stalker with a wide range of daylight and dozens of witnesses, allowing him to blame for the attacks. <br /> <br /> 3. Don't worry about telling the police about the narrator, and just assume (without obviously good reason) that the police have bribed him. <br /> <br /> 4. In an attempt to escape, let your wife, as far as possible, ensure that the stalker kidnaps her. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone who found your spouse abducting after the stalker, be sure to send them as soon as possible so you can confront him. There's no point in being unfair, right? <br /> <br /> I never expect every person to be immune to making a mistake in their injuries, but the Say Yes characters are so tight and make so many incredible mistakes that it is impossible for the viewer to take care of their safety because they are their own victims. It kills the enjoyment of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> When you were thinking, the screenwriters didn't stop at twilight. Since they are definitely dumb to write this intimidation, they decided to do so absurdly unrealistic situations that the feeling of reality goes out of the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Does the Stalker kill the police at the police station? while the main character sleeps no more than ten feet. <br /> <br /> 2. Stalker deals with all kinds of suspicious activities in a wide range of daylight and around a ton of people, but anyone other than the couple seems to notice their strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. Stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed every human being. <br /> <br /> 4. "Crisis" scenes had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct blasts of American films. The only positive thing is ending the end near the end, which was a pretty brutal scene because it was caused to the woman. It is too bad that the filmmakers followed it very foolishly, coming out of the left. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the Koreans behind the creation of Say Yes should be ashamed. Better yet, they should just move to California and work with people who make films with similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
