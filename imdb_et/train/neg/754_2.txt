I have to admit that I smiled when I saw one observer compare it to LOTR. Well yes, if you miss the dwarf, thousands of cast, big special effects, big battles, strong character, decent plot, good actress, stylish direction and everything else. What leaves you walking. And boy, is this movie walking! If Mr. Piano was on his way, it would probably be an uninterrupted three-hour walk in the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes, these annoying marches appear for a few seconds to stop him before he goes a little. . You never walked so much in the movie. If it really had a $ 20 million budget, most of it would have to go to Mr Piano's shoes because he had to go through many pairs with all the walking. What explains why money is not the proper effect, a decent video camera, or the money for the right participants. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people who have to go for long walks in costumes. Even walking fast is a walk. <br /> <br /> As far as sci-fi stuff is concerned, I think it was a mistake to put Marques into the movie: they only get on the road that is obviously more interesting to the director than the story.
