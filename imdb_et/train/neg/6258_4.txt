Writer-director Tony Piccirillo adapted his game straight to person, recently widowed, in the last three weeks studying for HIV; he monitors a homosexual partner he once had, brings him to the apartment and binds him, forcing the guy to have a blood test and allowing bloody vengeance when the results come back. An intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays. James Marsden's captivity is realistic cynical and nervous, but the actor's own artificial motives are confusing - it's like seeing Tom Cruise's practice show. Scott Speedman has to work harder with more difficult tasks, but his personality, who turns to a shy boy-kidnapper, is not convincing, nor is there a conversation between two men. The Marsden geek boy is not, of course, apathetic, he is for a moment sympathetic to the Speedman situation, but he does not react or act in any way that any homosexual man would be in such a situation. The film is not exactly, but it is a scam that is further aggravated by poor editing, poorly designed backlash, low budget production and a big finale that smells of foolish bias and soap melodrama. * 1/2 from ****
