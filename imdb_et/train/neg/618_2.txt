Maybe one of the worst teenage movies I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad points in the film that cover the whole movie. First, something that nobody can avoid: TERRIBLE ACTING. I swear they took some random kids off the street. Secondly, BAD / UNCONVINCARCARCTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You don't even know half of the children killed here. All you think is that they deserve it in one way or another. The nature of the scarring was superfluous and the cheap blasting of other great fantasy killers, such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: The scarecrow was full of terrible liners that made you laugh, just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find some small animals for torture!" really just leaves you eyebrow raising. Last but not least: Next out: BAD CASTING. How old was the man who played Lester? Like 30? Behind him was a fever for God. There is much more to say about this movie, as it is a cheap special effect, it's a "high school film class" effort, but this point is understandable. It's just a bad movie. As for the "good" in the movie: - By offering those with low, low, low standards - I would help insomniacsid sleep. - Very cheap to laugh or even strangle.
