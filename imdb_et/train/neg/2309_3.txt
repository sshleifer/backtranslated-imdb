I am very strange, but to be honest, some movies are moving as far as weird - so much that they make your brain hurt. It's such a movie. Trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible, and I think the film is best understood when taking drugs - it's so incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The film starts with some very cute Japanese animation that includes bags. But blue, things get twisted and occasionally distracting, which makes me wonder if I lose anything in translation. But even if that is the case, why do we have to deal with magic tricks that involved removing smart, defecation, banging, fire animals, etc.? All this seemed to be casual and pretty terrible. Strange, and I don't know why, some see it as a genius. I just can't get it.
