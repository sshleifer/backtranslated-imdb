Okay, I have to say that before the "monster" unfolding. saying he really didn't fit into this category, but some strange things that had a tedious screech! And personally I think my grandmother could have gone out of this thing, but still. I really got into this movie, although the main character is drunk and the heroine's addict did not come as a complaint. However, scenes such as being away from the train and seeing the figure at the door were such horrible, even when the guard was just killed and "monster" put his hand on the screen. <br /> But the catastrophe remained for a moment when the monster found out that it was just your average horror, limited excitement or intimidation. Slowly I got bored and wanted to close this thing. I like the fact that most people have said it is homeless trying to do it, especially the boy, he gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie would have been something special, rather than now it's every other horror! Just bored and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for cheap intimidation here and there, or a meaningless gore fest (which is limited, hardly really), give it all, but all serious horror audiences are somewhere else, much better movies out there.
