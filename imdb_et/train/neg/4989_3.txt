Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval travelers, was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected turns, funny situations and, of course, a simple absurdity that would remind you a bit of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now, the same characters are in the queue, the same actors share a lot and the same time to travel. There is little change in the plot because the characters are nowadays experienced. So they jump up and down in history without paying attention to the fact that as he moves ahead of the film, he goes suddenly. Duke Jean Reno tries to keep the game together with his game, but his character is cleared so he can't do much to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Now the Duke is a slave / helper, he's really all the attention. The film is just about him and his clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. The fact is; this sign is trying to laugh at the audience, but it fails. Just as someone would really tell you a very bad joke, you already know, but he demands it to the end of fun, adding details to make your suffering a little longer. <br /> <br /> If you liked Les Visiteurs, don't ruin your mouth's taste with your offspring. If you didn't like Les Visiteurs, you should never look at the sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I think you have to watch a lot of movies.
