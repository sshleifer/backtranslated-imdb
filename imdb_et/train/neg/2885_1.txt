I can't really say what I mean about this movie, against the guidelines, I've been watching many movies and it must be the worst, extremely low budget, I think all the money went to the scenes of the slaughterhouse because I got a better job 8mm with a camera and a team of non-human primates. It was so bad that I just signed up for a comment, because I had to say that the movie rental location was not enough. But it's worth my 2 cents, I suggest you borrow it from some poor succulent who hired it and looks at it. Because I certainly don't waste that money myself. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope that you will not be doing the rental if they pay you back money .. =)
