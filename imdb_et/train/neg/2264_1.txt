To present this review, I have to say that I was a little curious about this movie. But I wouldn't have seen it if I didn't have a hand twisted. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film shows how one can be. In my eyes, the worst thing about this Springer phenomenon is that the "Jerry Springer Show" people act as they do (which in itself is highly misleading), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch and hear about their lives ( yes, i think it includes me.). If we do not glorify such behavior (as some may say), then we can at least delicate and / or desenstizing our minds to this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But quite a lot of soap (sort of). Here's a skinny thing: the film has an R-rating, and although it just deserves it (I looked at a scene so I'm not sure), I feel that NC-17 (the other reviewer of the captain) may be a little more fit for a huge sexual content (the cynic can comment that the film was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very odd, linking absolutely strange family stories and a group of stereotypical blacks that interfere with different Springer exhibitions. Finally, the film leaves with one exit and Springer rhetoric that we must see the real world (obviously at his show). I agree with him - it is important to know how the world really is so that we can achieve positive changes. Having said that, let me just say that this is a rather bad look at the world on new paper or news to see it, but don't waste good money to support the sensational and perhaps formal title that Springer is trying to give us.
