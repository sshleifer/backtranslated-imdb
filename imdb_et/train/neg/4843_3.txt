I had also heard read all the breathtaking comments and comments about how this film deserves the best picture for the Oscar, so I went to see it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read other comments, you can learn from US military members who served in Iraq, how unlikely the events of this film are. They reflected my own thoughts; When I was playing the movie I - a complete civilian - I thought to myself, "tell WHAT ??? It is not so to happen." 2) There's very little that actually happens on the plot. A new man of bomb disposal appears to a dead person (death, which is not really clearly explained). The new man gets adrenaline from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. That's it! 3) This movie is by no means as suspicious as claimed. If you want tension, try some Bourne movie. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally powerful, try to rent Go Tell Spartans that are in the Vietnam War, and the stars Burt Lancaster (who told me in the PERSONAL serendipitous supermarket that it was a movie that was very proud and one whom he saw The best works and what he is still upset, were largely ignored after the excessive apocalypse race), or the old WWII black-and-white classic Sink Bismark, especially the English film, is incredibly heartbreaking. DO NOT FULL TIME TO Hurt Locker.
