It was a great idea and the landscape was beautiful, but it ends. It looks like buggy Set It Off meets the West. The plot barely made sense. There were so many signs and not enough time to develop their personalities. There may also be unnecessary things that did not touch the plot and did not contribute to the development of this story. There were also empty empty moments where the plot could have been explored, but it was used for silent or unnecessary conversations. The script should have been both meaningful and referral. When I was watching this movie, I had the main character. But I think the casting was great. If you only look at eye candy, it's a movie for you.
