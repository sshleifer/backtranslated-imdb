Sith's revenge begins with a long sequel of action that is impressive, without being terribly exciting, it really gets boring within the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and boring mechanisms that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the procedure is slow - and I mean slowly - what we know is the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally arrives, it's okay. Not great. Not even good. But pretty well. This film is highly praised because it does not admire the high sky as it did before. Instead, it's just marketable, boring and routine. But you have to say that these CGI environments are sometimes impressive. Is light protection fighting? They are all cloudy confusion. I think that Lucas was on the dark side when he started these pretenses and no one noticed. It makes a ton of money, but thanks to God it is over, this once worshiped franchise is beaten. I saw an exhibition at 12:01 and after that I heard a group of very young children that it was fantastic! But everyone who is older than eight spoke the same thing: I slept in the middle. It was kind of boring. I thought Darth Vader's birth would be better. So we all said.
