After reading the book, I loved this story. When I was watching the film, I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies are different, but it was two different stories, only the names and the story of the book. Read the book and get to know the movie better. The book gives you signs of better development. These signs are very interesting and take care of them. The locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters are not included. Television has so many great books and stories that are a perfect example of it. The author's input does not always guarantee a good movie, but it can sometimes help.
