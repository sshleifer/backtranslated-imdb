Thank you to Hollywood. Another classic film that was destroyed by cheap, low, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original "monkey planet" was a smart and thought-provoking film with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost entirely on dialogue that sounds very boring but was actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie, on the other hand, seems to have lost a lot of all the dialogues. Instead of a good movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour chase movie. Dialogue is reduced to a minimal level, there is no interaction between character and development, and it is often very difficult to understand what is happening. Instead, we get a lot of useless scenes, somewhat funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. Apes make-up is great and the kits and backgrounds are beautiful. But it does not draw attention to the fact that "Apeside Planet (2001)" is a very low and simplified film, full of paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and almost non-existent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop destroying great movies, making them a meaningless blocker. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the end did NOT MAKE SENSE WHATSOEVER. <br /> <br /> * **** - mainly visual. <br /> <br />
