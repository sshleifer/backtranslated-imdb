They put me in school and it was terrible. The movie is out of date. Episodes become confusing because the fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. Teachers talked about this as a cure, but in fact it was a painfully boring experience. of them they do what they do in real life in the movie. It very often gives cheese. Very often, this story is a bit terrible and far-fetched. I don't like how some lines are written and want them to have more meaning for them. Although it was written for educational, funny, tense and hip, it was boring, dry, far drawn and old. I hope no one will spend time watching this movie because you would not have seen it.
