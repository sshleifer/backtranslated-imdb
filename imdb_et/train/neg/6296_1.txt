This movie seemed interesting; I read the book several years ago and he told me that this feature was quite close to the plot sketch. <br /> <br /> I started looking at it and, almost from the beginning, he couldn't meet expectations. In fact, I didn't bother watching the whole thing ... proclaim - bad performances, bad behavior, and terribly unpleasant signs - that was the idea of ​​the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in the mouth and put me down for the rest of the weekend. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this feature.
