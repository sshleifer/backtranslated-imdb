STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (playing Gary Busey before the name became synonymous with symbols) is (typically) an unusual policeman who gets results, but he drives his bosses something rotten. Avoiding his partner's clich√© to be killed at the beginning of the movie, the plot turns into a different turn instead, and sees him in a designated Mexico, where a highly secret super-super tank in America has been smuggled and has incredible firepower and imaging ability. imprisoned with a team of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This cheap looking (even according to the 80s standards), boring little action movie was a strange career move for Gary Busey after impressing the flame of the furry villain Mr Joshua into a deadly weapon. Here he travels through his cardboard movements, nervousness and zeal as ever ("butthorn" is his trademarks for bad boys), but without restoring the material. Henry Silval has a scarecrow on the screen, but he is here as a completely Arabic leader (in red beret!) And the terrible script gives him a really outrageous foolish conversation that makes his appearance ridiculously made of wood. She is just one of many feature films, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who open up, but do not mix. After a cumbersome first hand without much exciting action, things start to rise a bit at the end, but it's too little too late and none of them is running any fun. *
