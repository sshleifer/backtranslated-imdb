I saw this movie for the first time in MST3K. And although I laughed at my back with jokes, I don't think that this movie was so bad. Of course, it was somewhat difficult to realize that this was a pretty small budget, but it was a very Hitchcock-like plot and I can honestly say that when I didn't see the MST3K version, I was really entertained. This film cries out of Hollywood remake.
