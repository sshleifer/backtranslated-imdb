which sh * t is this? Power Separators vs. Freddy? It was traceable and as good as the first film at the beginning, but from the part where the protagonists gain superpower in their dreams, it became a child. This would have to be appreciated instead of PG or PG-13 R. I thought I could see very mature things, but it was only 1/3 of the movie. The rest are for small children. In addition, it has focused too much on Christianity. I know Freddy is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why must there always be Christianity? It is complete orientalism and full of white men / western boss. Don't look at it, show it to little kids who love power.
