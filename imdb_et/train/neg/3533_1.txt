Let this film act as a death penalty for "big twist" films from the 1990s. In some circles it is known as Klaus Soze syndrome, this little hand of cinematography has now been made by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used variation A BEAUTIFUL MIND. But in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (in some circles "under the name of Mr. Madonna") uses the motif of Soze in a much more limited way. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (very questionable hairhead) stars like Jack Green (all known as "Mr. Green"). Or maybe Mr. Gold is an irritating spirit who can have the representatives of the branch. I'm not quite sure, but I certainly don't care. REVOLVER is one of the examples of cinematic redundant examples that I have had with discontent for quite some time. Recognize a broken time structure, painful jumps, incessant internal-monologue, and painfully pretentious animated sequences. This "all-in-the-kitchen sink" style makes Quentin Tarantino oeuvre calm. Cinematic smoke and mirrors only make me believe that Ritchie was bored to tell this story when I watched it. <br /> <br /> The film is full of a revelation that is supposed to shock, but they only come to news for Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green because I always enjoy Stratham as a character that is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he fights in the university's English literary class as a remedial reader. His mental deficiency is only suited to the fact that his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta), showed that it was not limited. A delicious landscape like the hungry man in the smorgasbord, spits Liotta, shouts and smokes through the film with an embarrassing screen and leopard print speed. <br /> <br /> REVOLVER has no redemption features. This is another cinematic artwork from Ritchie and may even surpass her bad SWEPT AWAY remake as her worst movie.
