I remember when this trash came out, all the newspapers went over how he took Barbra Streisand's year to film. Well, it could not have taken so many years; The game was only opened in 1975, eight years earlier. This made Broadway's star actor Tovah Feldshuh, who would probably have had to go to the film, but NOOOOO ... A big STAR BARBRA, WHO WILL BE ATTENTION. AND NOT WITH MUSIC! This movie is a complete disaster from start to finish. First, Barbra was fifty years old when she did it, and she looked at it every minute. There was no chance that someone could swallow him as a young girl who longed to learn Torah. And when she dresses like a boy, she gets campy. I have the impression that Streisand couldn't be unpleasant, so she played with the make-up; she's a boy more beautiful than a girl. And if it is not bad enough, he will participate with his schoolmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is his naked back shot) as well as his groom (Amy Irving, who does his usual dream routine, a little schtick, a poor woman always rests, if the director ignores him and he doesn't know what he is doing). Yentl goes so far as to marry a girl; I don't even want to say a "wedding night" scene. <br /> <br /> Then there is music. Nine absolutely unforgettable songs that everyone sang through Streisand's voice command (probably as he looked) and everyone seemingly and irritating his fingers on the board. <br /> <br /> I do not say that Streisand does not see the promise as a director here; some visuals are beautiful (especially on the back of Patinkin) and he is in balance. The problem with this movie is that he can't get out of his way. I didn't believe him for one second as a title; he should never ever add songs, and then all the mess will continue for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was sick for the whole forty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> Awful, terrible, terrible.
