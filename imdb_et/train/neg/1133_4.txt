I've seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts. Many scenes work in a plug-and-play manner that is strictly set according to the romantic comedy genre. Usually it is okay because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge is generally its original, new and inventive creation. This movie can't do that. <br /> <br /> There is no point in having these characters except Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional cliche and they do not change into simple dolls that serve a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> Boosting a movie can become annoying, there is no rhythm, and editing is done with unnecessary close-ups. I also need to mention overly stylized decorations that make some scenes naturally or probably obviously too obvious. Of course, along with it, you also have the right-handed lovely music, which unfortunately often sounds inappropriate. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this film, which is obvious about Woody Allen's clues, is deceptive. If you expect good spiritual romantic comedy, this is not the case. Or rather it is a bad test. You're just leaving the theater for why this movie has given such praise when the cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are much better Quebecois directors doing better shots. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie that's what it is. But it is bad if you treat cinema as an art and a leader as an author.
