I'm a big 1930s film fan and I look at something I see in Turner's classic movies, which is new to me. So I gave it down, after all, it's a great Harold Lloyd who won Chaplin as a great silent movie comedy. I looked much less at Lloyd's silent movies then at Chaplins, but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway, this movie fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I understand why his good career was so limited that he didn't get very good material. After seeing Chaplin, Abbot and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, Marx's brothers and Laurel and Hardy make boxing distortions (or violence in general), it's very forgotten. I was also interested in seeing Adolphe Menjou because I really enjoyed her on the roads of glory, but her role here did nothing special. Maybe they should have gone to the box before, because at least half of the movie (at least it seemed so) is before the round. I can say that there are many Lloyd fans here and this is not a popular review, but I have to evaluate it compared to what was there at other times out of 4 out of 10. get like old movies because they may not look at you again, very flat. As an alternative to anyone who really liked it or are generally looking for lesser-known comedies, I recommend "Kelly The Second", made a few years earlier, and no one turns into Patsy Kelly's boxer comedy and Charles Chase's supporting role. They are both shown on the Turner Classic Film Channel.
