OK maybe 13 years old like me was a little old for this movie. Its about this pampered rat who lives in the palace. Then the sewer rinses him to the toilet! He reaches this rat town and meets the girl with a rat with a pearl greedy frog. He does something for this jewel that he sends to the whole army after these two rats. He is going to take a pearl and a rat flood! The cool part of this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make the noise, its awesome, and quite funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7-year-olds. Other smart, great movie to see a younger family member. I didn't think animation was a true dream art, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think they're little of it. The film was just decent, but it didn't cost $ 9.50.
