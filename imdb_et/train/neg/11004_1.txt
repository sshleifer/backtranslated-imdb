I really have the impression that this has been done. The director / writer / actor must be truly charismatic in reality. I don't think in any other way about the script stage. What I want it to be ... watching movies, I felt sorry for the actors. You seem to have been standing in a comedy club where a man dies on his feet and in your sitting, not enjoying it, just feeling that he has a very bad try. Id really like to know what the budget is, I think it must be low because the film quality is very bad. I want to write: "I didn't like jokes." but the reality is that they turn to you, you have to be the man who wrote them. or slowed down. So imagine that in the form of a script ... and this man got this green light. It's impressive, isn't it?
