This remake of the 1973 Billy Wilder classic television is lower than the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First of all, good things. Lee J. Cobb is a terrible Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, but he's the only reason to watch it. This reprocessing is the only improvement compared to the original because it reduces the role of the girl of Lola Dietrichson, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's for good things. <br /> There are many bad things. The director saves everything indifferently: if you watched the movie with silent sound, there would hardly be any impression that something very interesting happened. Because of today's bad taste, the film must be black instead of black and white. After the 1970s there is a bad taste, all kits are annoyingly ugly. Especially Walter Neff's expensive apartment is ugly. <br /> <br /> The modern environment is painful in many small ways. Train travel was somewhat unusual in the 1970s as in the 40s, so Mr Dietrichson's decision to take the train seems to be a race. Men finished wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering his brown hair with Dietrichson's white hair. The mourning women ended up wearing the veil, which predestines Samantha Eggar to use Barbara Stanwyck in a great key. (Oddly enough, Lolal is still on the line where she finds that her stepmother tried a black hat and veil before she needed it.) Stephen Bochco keeps a lot of Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler's script the same. But he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes in the dialogue that leave the script a little loose if it was lean and muscular. Amazingly, the famous motorcycle policeman who has gone, but look closely and see what looks like a post-production, where these lines should have been. Bochco may not be guilty. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is satisfactory by Walter Neff. What could have allowed this version is really great Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we get Samantha Eggari, who comes out as "Barnaby Jones" standard debt. But who can blame Eggar? What director, who hardly seems to be interested in what's going on in front of the camera, how can Barbara Stanwyck himself come down well?
