OK this movie was a terrible assumption. Be serious about the movie they were through through the apocalyptic war, but they have the money to buy huge robots and shoot them against each other. Instead of investing in building their own country, each country would struggle with robots that no one can afford. Here's a better idea, let us base our battles on our most intuitive resource. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what a director is with him. He's making a good movie, he's making a bad movie. There is no reason to give this film any credit just for the director, maybe he was asleep? I enjoyed this movie thoroughly because it was so fun and ridiculous that I had to laugh. I was really looking at it, except for the cowboy mentor who turned out to be an assassin (trust me, someone who doesn't see this man as an assassin, so it's a surprise but flat) What kind of training is the jungle jim anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k hadn't done that. However, I give a two-star rating because nothing can be as bad as "attachment hands". <br /> <br /> Budget is not important, I've also seen a lot of sensible movies that didn't have any budgets like a cube. The story was not even plausible and I have seen better action in school games. Certainly, they could have given eleven years of any high school game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, pick it up, it's a fun movie to watch.
