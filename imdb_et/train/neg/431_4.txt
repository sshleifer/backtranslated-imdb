Of course, I find Al Pacino guilty. She was a beautiful actor up to the smell of a woman, where she probably overdosed irreversibly. I was hoping that this movie, which I almost didn't grow, would be a nice little pearl. A remarkable, uncommon, intelligent and inclusive urban policy thriller. It is not like that. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a film that blurs so many signs, names and "realistic" urban problems on your plot that for some time you think its plot is so broad and meaningful. that if you know the truth, it will hit your mind. Indeed, these subplots and digressions ultimately lead to a rather tedious and very familiar urban story of a trademark such as power corruption, two-face politicians, mafia police ties, and so on. And theoretically, this setting allows some exciting tension, I'm afraid no characters are safe and everything can happen! But again, it really is not. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only thing that happens is quite predictable, and we have a number of "confessions" monologues designed as a modern a. sort, lesson the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports, and the web of lies and spiders, the audience is usually treated with a somewhat satisfactory revelation. I don't think we're going to stay in the town hall, and though it's a very full movie, I don't find it completely rich.
