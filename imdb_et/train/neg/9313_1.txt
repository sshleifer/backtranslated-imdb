It was the worst low budget horror I've ever seen. I'm an open minded man and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I rent a movie, I'm looking for particularly badly-awaited horror films. They always have a good laugh, I believe I know, I've seen a lot. But this movie was just so terrible that it wasn't worth crying. In the first five minutes, I was thinking of turning it off ... which I probably should have. There's nothing good about this, first of all the camera team suck3d A $$. The introduction was stupid as the end. Action and special effects were terrible. Please, I ask you, DO NOT look at this movie, I hate it.
