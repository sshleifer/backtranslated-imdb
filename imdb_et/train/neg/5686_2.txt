Hi, this is my first review of each movie I have seen. I went through this problem to tell everyone that this is literally the most disgusting film I've ever seen. I feel that the film's production took place, which I give some clarity because of budget constraints. I felt like watching a very bad remake of seeing the movie. I agree, I also saw it is very graphic, but I did as I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The scene in which he drives the leader of the victim at the head is the most disturbing scene I've ever seen. The scene lasted almost forever, actually it was about 5 min, but still. I want to note that I like some horror movies and I give credit when they are good. this director uwe boll and his group who made this movie should think about it before this one resembles it. one last comment haha! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO SHOULD LOOK FOR ANIMALS, HOW TO WANT, WOMEN AND THE CHILD SYSTEM AND LAST MINUTE WITH ALL BIRTHS, HOW TO DRAW YOUR DOG, Enjoy this movie, if not, and you like Fear Go with a higher budget movie like I saw. I don't think people actually do such movies. In any case, excuse everyone who loves uwe boll and took this heart, this is just my opinion of the movie.
