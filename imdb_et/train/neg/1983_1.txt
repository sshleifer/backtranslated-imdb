Oh, come people give a break to this movie. One thing I liked was ......... Sorry, I was still thinking. Oh yes! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys up. Sorry, the wrong movie, I was thinking of a better quality movie. Let me look now, I'm still trying to protect it. Oh yes, the chick who was from Clueless was there. Don't put Stacy Dash down. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you did dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that has never been done in western, even in all female casts, they hung from the woman's gnomes. It may be the first West. Even if his neck had to be broken and he survived the challenge, you had to give the director some effort to try Western. I have never seen any western lynched woman, though it didn't happen in this movie, I just thought I'd give the director another idea about Gang Of Roses # 2 to be done right after Ed Wood's bride 2. Maybe it was this filmmakers. Organism, especially with all African women and oriental cowgirls. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if Gang Of Roses's creators want to continue this mess, you might have a slang, "Hey, don't you talk about my home troops, and talk with your hand, baby, talk with your hand." there may also be a surfer guy-type deputy who says that such things are: "This weapon fight was totally RAD man." You know such things.
