The Dragstrip Hollow ghost is a typical 1950s teenager in an unstable movie. It's not horror or fiction. The plot touches a group of teenagers who start to throw out their "hot rod" club because they can't rent. When they came out, they decided to try the old Haunted House. The only saving grace of the film is that the "ghost" (in Paul Blaisdell She Creature suit) turns out to be a monster of the film played by Blaisdell.
