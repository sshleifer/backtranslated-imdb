I wasted 5.75 to see this filthy movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the fact that the dog was split in half at the beginning of the film had nothing to do with the disease. <br /> <br /> What was the idea of ​​blocking Karen, she was already completely infected with her room, they could just have locked her where she would have been safer. <br /> <br /> Why should a political party run around the forest asking strangers to help him if he could just ask his relatives, a horse lady to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why not? t any character who is bothering to enter the city to get help when things get bad, are they all really lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul was threatened by a man whose shotgun was a woman on her, Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert a house to ask for help. the girl she loves worsens. <br /> <br /> What was the box point? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff go back when he left, when everyone else was infected when he was so big a jerk to leave first, wasn't he just home? <br /> <br /> When the police went to all the difficulties to collect and burn the children, why were they thrown to the Paul River, not even for the plot, because the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> Who makes lemonade in the river, this dust is dirty and defects in it. Why two children just couldn't use tap water, it was also contaminated so that the fool would end up still.
