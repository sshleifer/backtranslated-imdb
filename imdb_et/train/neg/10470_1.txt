What else to say? <br /> <br /> I have read all the reviews here and most of them are correct. . However, one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and Satan destroyed it (or something on that line). Evil! Oh, what a shocker. . I mean, TBN made this movie basically. Open your eyes please. <br /> <br /> It was a very low grade propoghanda nonsense that has come over the years. <br /> <br /> The most terrible thing about the Omega Code is how much money they spent on doing it. If this movie can be done, there are no restrictions and therefore we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest loses omega codes." <br /> <br /> For you, those who are biblical stories are a new movie Dogma, where the Omega code never starts.
