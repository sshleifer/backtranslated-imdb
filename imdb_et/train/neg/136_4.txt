*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do all teenagers wear originality? It looks so awful. First, it is a noble assumption that could have been well used. Abandoned young lady who grows up, hides and murders all the girls who tortured her very younger than her? Can't say you have nothing to do. However, this film passes the same movements as all other recent slashers. Everything from scoring to camera corners allows us to accurately predict when false alarms are coming and when exactly the killer will hit. We now know the pattern. These foolish movies are pushing the credibility envelope more and more minutes. Let me ask you: Who, with the right mind, surprises his friend in his dark, harsh nightmare and surprises him when he is alone and surrounded by corpses? Does it make any sense at all? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only occasionally innovative. One good hit is the crushing of Denise Richards' character. He gets trapped inside the pool and the killer puts him in a chainsaw. There are some good songs on the soundtrack, including a cool Orgy journey. The music video is included in the special features of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the actor is at best mediocre. All participants sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even when depicted as "Angel". Denise Richards is a good actor, and she keeps a stone surface throughout the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is just as you expect: pretentious, unlikely, forgettable, cheesy and intimidating. Don't even bother. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
