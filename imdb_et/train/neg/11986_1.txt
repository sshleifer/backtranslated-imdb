With terrible writing and acting. No person. What, you can't make a good movie with one character? Hmm, it was done with Castaway's independent dialogue. <br /> <br /> So this baby goes on a trip to see his father. The child, Jason, takes the plane and the pilot has a heart attack and he dies in the middle of the flight. So the boy falls into the lake and stays alive. Then he runs around, lives in the desert until he is rescued. <br /> <br /> During this time he will fight the bear twice. For the first time, he fights by the lake. The second time he makes a branch of the branch and tells the bear. Two shots of counterfeit bleeding from the bear's head reminded me of Monty Python's "Holy Grail". <br /> <br /> The child also decides to predict the carcass with the results. <br /> <br /> Gag.
