I could never look at Happy Days after Chachi joined the pain, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scenes in this movie were Scott Baio (skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in his first "adult" role turns to his usual professional performance, but it's not an excuse for this boring confusion. Two hours of my life so I never get back! Not remarkable signs, incredible events, questionable editing, and terrible cinematography, but worst of all, I couldn't care less. In the 1970s, where children live an unhappy life and all their parents are idiots, California teenagers are mentioned. Don't waste your time watching this ugly apology for the movie.
