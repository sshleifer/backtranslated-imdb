This film started with a lot of similarity to the plot, then abandoned an endless number of random signs and meetings that have nothing to do with moving the story. It was impossible to deal with this film. This film is a very cynical garbage created by some people with animation skills, but with no creativity or storytelling. It's a shockingly bad effort in a big studio. It is clear that Disney has moral and motivational problems, not to mention the complete lack of supervision and quality control. This management allowed the film to see daylight that talks about their incompetence and despair. This movie adds to my very short list of "the worst movies of all time".
