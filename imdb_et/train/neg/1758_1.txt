If you haven't seen it yet, I'll just say move, walk in the park, don't waste your time. Neither the scenario nor the operation is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can't decide what was worse: the film itself or the Baldwin hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very questionable, I hope she can improve it over time. The story is simply incredible. A loose cannon a American policeman fighting with independent European criminals? The infamous Slavic mafiosi, protected by just two pieces ?? An Emotional Art Teacher Leading a Ruthless Gang? Spanish police executive dumber as a hammer bag ??? Leave me alone. However, there is only one good thing about this film: at least the production costs must be lower than the "ocean 12", which was as pointless and as high as it was.
