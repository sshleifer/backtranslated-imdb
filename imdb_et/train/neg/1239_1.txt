Being a big fan of "APES" other films on PLANET, I rented this DVD, despite my reluctance to all Tim Burton. He will not lose his despicable direction again. Even monkey makeup looks like a second rate that is unforgivable given its monster budget monster. Mark Wahlberg proves at the same time that he is not an actor (like BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough evidence). I was embarrassed by true talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. They were undoubtedly motivated by wage control, as it would not have been a revised scenario of clich√©s. I rented this DVD on a special $ 1 night and I still feel like it.
