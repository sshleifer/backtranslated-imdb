Although it is usually a cheesy jungle adventure movie, it has some highlights - the settings are pretty nice and the adventure is good. You won't forget to look at it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as light as possible, playing his name, undashle chief Shanghai rich boy Van Hoffman and his gorgeous wife in the shower. expedition in cannibal. He never takes things seriously. The shower is where decorating and Keith uses her extensively - she doesn't really have to do much. She is not the only woman who looks like her body and the main sides of the film make it about half-T / A. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is nothing special to draw attention to or away from it. Created to be lockable, it succeeds without excessive noise. Good 2 AM Cable Programmer.
