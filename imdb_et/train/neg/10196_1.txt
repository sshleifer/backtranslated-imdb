Like a poker enthusiast, I was expecting this movie - especially when he was Scotty Nyugen. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugens' short films in this movie have everything he has. <Br / Characters are unlikely and tedious, the soundtrack is terrible and the plot, well, no. <br /> <br /> I have a headache and found that I read the barcode number Twenty minutes after the DVD I was bored. It's actually that Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I wouldn't have bought $ 16 from eBay. <br /> <br /> Get it from me - OFF, like 7 2 offsuits !!! Dire. (
