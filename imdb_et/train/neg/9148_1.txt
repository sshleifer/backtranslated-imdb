I looked at the bottom 100 of Imdbs because I thought id never saw anything as bad as the 9 out of space or the Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur have both beaten. <br /> <br /> This is a myriad of movies I've seen, the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad leadership, bad characters, terrible action, terrible story No one has a reason, but Sam never says something positive about this movie. Sam was a terrible annoying actor, but his leadership was so bad that he could just drop Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should shame his job, unfortunately I have to give him at least 1 star, but it deserves - watch out for the stars.
