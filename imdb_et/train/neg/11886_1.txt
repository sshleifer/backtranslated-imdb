Looking at Josh Kornbluth's "act" in this film reminds me of his new class of television production, where "not funny" was an opportunity to prove how dishonest they really were! <br /> <br /> ATTENTION is a word that needs to be remembered when I try to sync this wannabe comedy. Jokes are sophomorphic and telegraphs. Delivery is painfully bad. OUCH !!!!!!! Writing is just dorkish. It's like Bob Saget's show. Watching this movie is as painful as watching a one-and-a-half-hour live Saturday night (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and want my money back !!!
