This is one of the worst movies. I like cheesy movies, but it's just terrible. Where are the pictures on the film in the box? I think more money was spent on the illustrations in the DVD box than on the entire film. <br /> <br /> Why should a company issue a DVD with a cover that is so misleading? I know such an idiot for renting this movie strictly in the box. As far as I was investigating IMDb, I should have done some research and compiled a list before recording a local video field. I have no one to blame, except me. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVI. <br /> <br /> Even if the curiosity motivates you, stick your eye on a cocktail umbrella. It's much more enjoyable. You have been warned!
