"What happens if you give a homeless person $ 100,000?" As if asking this question, they are somehow released morally from what is finally happening. The creators of "Fortune Reversal" are trying to get their voyeurist strangers hiding their antics as a responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They take Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he turns his life around. Then they promised to go further with the most bold instructions and advice. <br /> <br /> What are they trying to say? "Money can't buy you luck?" "Homeless are homeless because they deserve to be?" Or how, "Raise a man - it's more fun to see how he falls from a higher height." They took a man who had nothing to lose, gave him something to lose and looked at him all down the drain. It should be entertainment? They dress it up with damp music and dramatic camera images, but in the end it has all the moral heights of car accident videos - only then did they build a car accident and said, "What happens if you stop at the sign?"
