I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally, I saw him as a star of a recent movie, not just a little bit, making me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in college, I appreciated the film and the only thing I can say is that I didn't like the film being made in an abandoned neighborhood and lacking background traffic or look. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the actor leaves something unwanted, but Arnold is a great actor, I have to make it critical and supportive casting leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Voslo and he made the film visible. Otherwise, I would have written it as another tough film. <br /> <br /> I found the rape table brutally and unnecessarily, but the actors at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of shooting were pretty bad. There are some bugs in the movie (continuity), but they are remarkable given the low caliber of the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, I enjoyed this movie because Arnold Vosloo was there. Jackie
