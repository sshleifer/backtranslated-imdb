My main comment about this movie is how did Zwick get reliable participants on this movie? Impressive Cast? even supportive characters, none of which really help the movie. However, I have to admit that Tom Hank's bile was almost worth it? what was it about Tom? Did you lose the bet? The best movie of the movie was Joe Isuzu - classic! The assumption is good. Basing's character, struggling with Pink Lady, makes his way to the motel in Vegas, a brilliant pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens when a Corbett character is on his way to Vegas to offer Elvis suit to his soon-to-be-married wife, who is motivated by ... what else? Because they both do their way, they have many invasions with Elvis impersonators who are on their way to the Elvis Congress in Vegan. The FBI will soon be participating and will watch what they think is the serial killer of the Elvis impersonator. Unfortunately, the assumption that the film was good does not mean. <br /> <br /> When watching a movie, imagine you're back in the first grade? if story and continuity are not really important. It's much more enjoyable to look at Basinger in your Pink Lady dress nicely if you don't know why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The film is trying hard, but eventually the path is short. Ultimately, it is full of ideas that might have been funny in theory, but in practice it wasn't that funny. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst, but you may feel that you want to leave this building aside ???? Don't tell me I didn't warn you!
