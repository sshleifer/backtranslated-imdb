I was p *** ed when I didn't see it when it was Philly Film Fest screening last year, so when I saw it was going to be a cable today, I remembered it as soon as I could. So is it worth the wait? Well, let's go upside down as I haven't given you a plot yet. Sean Crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his life is like. Enter the Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his superior Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray asked to blame Sean for being around Sea. And it goes on from there. What brings me back to the question. Is it worth the wait? Yes and no, the accumulation was pretty good and George Wendt stole my movie. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it is not nearly as violent as I had believed, and somewhere along the movies, the time runs for the ball not only to fall but to collide and towards the other side. I know where this point happened exactly, but I can't say the movie is corrupted. But there is no need to say it happened. The movie will not be recorded at the end. Poor Stuart Gordon can't be good at "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My class: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows his reward in one fantasy and then in the next ta-tas-s and it puts down and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
