how to get this movie to 5.5 this movie was a piece of skunk s ** t. First, the actors were very bad, I think the chainsaw Charlie was so slow. because at the beginning, when he started firing in his head with wood (it was about 1/4 inch thick (it was really cheap than pure wood), and he didn't even think he could cut it) to another person who did it, sucks * to offer them building things. the only good thing about this movie is its t.v. to show. bottom line DO NOT waste your hard earned money on the threshold that they call film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0.3
