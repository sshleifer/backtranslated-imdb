Let me start with this review by saying: I love vampire movies. They can suck (har har punää) and I still love them because vampires have just cooled in the movies. Van Helsing, which many considered a steaming heap, was a pleasure to me because there were vampires. You may ask, "What is it about this movie?" The answer is that I am going to tell you how terrible this movie really is, that even my vampire sucker (harharhar) may consider such a movie so bad. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Van Helsing, a college professor who is not at all convincing. He's a terrible actor like everyone else in this movie, and he wrote to add salt to the wound. I honestly say that I don't want to offend him and I'm sure everyone had fun making this movie, but looking at it was really painful. I'm not sure why I looked at the whole thing; maybe it was a sick charm, like looking at the upcoming train accident: it's terrible, but you can't force yourself. Its main fault is that it is just so boring, and its plot is so funny, even for a science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> But I'm going. By the way, Van Helsing is having sex with her mother. Of course, he doesn't know he's with him; she just thinks it's one of her students (which is still illegal and all but not so nasty and horrible). <br /> <br /> If I were Van Helsing, I would at least pull Oedipus myself when I found out I had done so hard. It would have made one entertaining thing if he just commented on it, but no. The point is not even raised by any character. It would be like a writer didn't even think. I would have laughed at him at least and said, "Ha ha, you had sex with your mother," which would be slightly humorous (though blatant). I'm probably running out of space, so there are a few more words that will keep you from seeing this movie: the vampire ninja fights against the old man. It would be funny, but filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. Watching a movie is not even worth seeing how bad it is. Stay away from it when you appreciate your time at all. <br /> <br /> I say one thing about the film as positive: The man who plays Van Helsinki is pretty crazy about this knife. Here's like a long minute segment where she swings around her knife and actually does pretty nice tricks. Any other movie would be boring, but unfortunately it was highlighted.
