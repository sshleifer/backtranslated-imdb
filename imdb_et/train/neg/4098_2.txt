Although it is "better" than the first Mulva (which can't say anyway, I'd rather look at the color dry), it still sucks. Take advantage of and avoid these low budget pictures. I was suckered to buy some DVDs to support some indy filmmakers and boy I regret it. Some are not yet officially "released" (the filmmakers have not bought it themselves) and I can't even list how bad they are all. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack because they will appear in other small movies with which they are together. If you are the friends of these boys, you are likely to be in their movies and have fun doing them. But for those who had to watch them? Not possible. Bad video, bad sound, bad display, bad piece etc etc. They are not even funny. I gave it to 2 just because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's it. Maybe it's not even worth 2. About 1 1 / 16th letter was a little better than the first (which I would like in negative ratings). If you want a decent budget movie, go over LBP "friends" to Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising Stakes. These are actually decent.
