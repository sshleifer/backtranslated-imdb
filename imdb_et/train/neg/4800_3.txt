When you made a genre at the end of the 80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance of being underwater or in prison (unfortunately we never got an underwater prison). Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole), designed by Mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), comes to the death penalty, in parallel with the mob boss brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Derek's problems, such as the rogue government agent (and mob stoolie) Colonel Burgess (John Saxon, who also leads), using the prison as a test facility for the new supervisory authority. This is the only German-speaking performance directed at his storey career. For a man who has worked for tons of directors, the only one who he picked up any tips was cheap-to-go. Of course, this is a small budget, but it can't excuse you for stylish productions, shooting devices, or clumsy exposures in the first 15 minutes. Saxon made it a little nervous for his credit and works in fun-filled scenes (our lead sleeps during prison term to just imagine a female scientist). Cole, who looks like tougher Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as stoic lead and Franciosa - which is really a bad carpet - gives her everything like a clich√© mob boss. The end will be at Marty McKee's favorite place, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE on this DVD.
