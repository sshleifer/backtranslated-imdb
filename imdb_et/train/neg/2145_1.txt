I have a question for those who thought this idea. Why? What made them think about making this second movie. If the memory works, does the Cinderella stop "They all lived happily ever after"? I'm pretty sure it happened or it was indirect. Wait a moment if they all live happily ever after that could be a sequel? If they did not try to make the most boring story in history, it would not be possible to continue. I think they have two hours of Cinderella song, but why? There can be no sequel in a film that ends "happily ever after"; if he doesn't, they will not live happily! Something goes wrong that causes problems with the first completion! Why? It's not right, it's bad. This is my last word on this issue.
