**** WARNING: Here are spoilers **** Why am I wasting my fast-running years looking at such rubbish? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, poor writing, inferior leadership, and then we have not even reached the actors. <br /> <br /> And of course you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. The Hero expert fights fools, corrupt and incompetent henchmen. One avalanche goes out and all heroes are able to survive alive, even though they go through all kinds of threats. A corrupt partner, who caused the whole thing, is baked alive with his cashout. Another avalanche heroically refuted by the adventurous experiment of the renegade expert. Ultimately, the evil henchmen also turn to the heart. After he's saved, a troubled teenager gets into trouble-free teenager. Etc, etc. etc. etc. In fact, there is no reason to warn spoilers. You could work out the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least I wasn't too broad about the brand, assuming what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we haven't discussed the real mistakes. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous commentator that although there are usually some redeeming qualities of a bad movie. you would find it difficult to find in this situation. I think I gave it to 2 out of 10 for some nice landscapes, but that's it. <br /> <br /> It has been a while since the film made me strange, but it certainly did.
