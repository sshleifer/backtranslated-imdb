"The Crush" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick the first two-thirds or so as it tries to be Brit "Sex and City". <br /> <br /> I especially liked the trophy that a young hunk, whose character is not well-formed (think about not seeing all of his physical flesh, and Kenny Doughty is worth more). <br /> <br /> They're doing a lot more deals for a young man / older woman than in the "Sabrina" (not a pleasant movie) or Douglas / Zeta. -Jones or Dion / Svengal Weddings. Surrounding the ex pat by Andie MacDowell is welcome in British dramas and comedies, such as the Chancellor Anna Dance. <br /> <br /> The plot's end to end look very deus ex machina. But only when the credit came to an end, I realized what could really be wrong. Like "Sex and the City", the writer / director is also a male, here for the first time in Scandinavia, John McKay, and I think he really wanted to make a three-man scenario, probably for those who come out of their lovers and at work (the characters are the director of the school , a policeman and a doctor) that would have been a better and more interesting film. The title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which would have made parallels with the gay "Broken Hearts Club" even more apparent. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 6.6.2002)
