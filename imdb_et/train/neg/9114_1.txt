Because "cruel" would be the only word that would describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you even start? At the end of B * tchines, I'll start with almost all the terrible acts of this movie. Scratch it. Almost this sentence does not belong. I can't even think of one character who was well represented. While in all justice, zero-dimensional signs would be almost impossible to imagine successfully. However, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I do not deliberately contain - I pretend she does not exist) still remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only what Sebastian played the man. The story was terrible for God. He tried to reflect the shine that was first but failed in so many ways. Quite a lot of every part of it was pointless - though I admit (harshly) that the plot's twisting was pretty good as a surprise. And the end was at least a little humorous. But this movie has seen the worst in it. Don't look at it. Just no. There is no value for viewing it. Missing. It only takes the first enjoyment.
