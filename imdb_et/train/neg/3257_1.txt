After seeing the film, I thought the first question was: should it be irony or not? After reading some of the comments, Doc Savage and the comic book knew that the film was not meant to be ironic. So this story tells us about a US-American super-document that will save the South American Republic from evil. It looks like a typical story. But it is so unrealistic that it becomes ridiculous. Compulsory final combat shows the worst presentation of martial arts I've ever seen. Film can be a bad example for low budget filmmakers.
