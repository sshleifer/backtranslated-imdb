I testify that I liked the first, and I was really looking forward to the sequel. <br /> <br /> I was shot down. Of course, the special effects were technically amazing - but they were not plausible. It seemed like a comic. Okay, I admit that you like 80% of the chase scene - but fighting with all Mr. Smiths? It was too obviously animated. <br /> <br /> I can take it all. I can't agree that the inoperative parts were nonsense. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was for a speech that lasted forever and didn't mean anything. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the small plot that existed. This movie had told us that the first film was not true (except for the existence of a matrix). This film was a bit like seeing DALLAS episode, where you knew the whole previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want my $ 7.00 back!
