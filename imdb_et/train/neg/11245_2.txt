I went to the theater to Sky Captain in 2004, waiting for a good movie. Almost every review of this movie was positive, the effects looked attractive, the previews convincing. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to say that disappointment does not really describe this film. It was a rage. <br /> <br /> Apart from being a boring and badly written film, this is why the film has 10 stars, because all the assets on the film are stolen from another source. I understand the difference between respect and theft: it was stealing. More importantly, the filmmakers did not steal the point to move forward or move the plot. They just stole it to show they could. There's no point in showing the movie The Wizard of Oz at the beginning of the movie, except to create another scene (which I don't specify) that steals the same movie. Needless to say, the concept of each movie was not an original or even an old concept spin: it was literally just something I had already seen, from the old Superman cartoons and the massive moments of the latest films. Iron Giant ", a quiet martial artist who has used countless films that have been most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul" Star Wars: Phantom Menace ". <br /> <br /> The real film, most of the performances were entirely wood. -Of this is because the whole movie was made with a blue screen, the computer images are filled by everyone who saves the actors, and frankly, this is not an excuse for bad actions. If a person was a child, they realize that the lack of a visual reference is not an excuse for not Try it out. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this movie. Characters are the only real person here. Almost all antagonists are robots, and on the one hand, the number of friendly characters shown during the movie can be read. Should Sub-Parameters of the Main Characters Really Prevent You From Contacting Here \ t em movie, so I didn't give it to it 1 Rather, the film was an example of everything that is wrong with contemporary action films: filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects, but without artistic vision or some originality, it falls on the film.
