It was a better idea of ​​the average movie because it was a cable. I had waited for something like melodrama and special special effects, such as the Christmas or the first daughter / Target / Shot, and so on. <br /> <br /> The cast was well chosen ... especially enjoyed by Ron Livingston as the hard-pressed SWAT commander. It is good to see that he is reviewing the material he had so much succeeded in the Brothers band. Manufacturers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day in 1997. <br /> <br /> So if you have the chance to see this movie and I'm sure that since FX starts doing everything 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy it.
