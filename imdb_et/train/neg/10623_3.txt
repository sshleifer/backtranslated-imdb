"The Three Brave Girls" is a sick sweet, pinkish color that deals with divorce, remarriage, and one parent. Obviously, in a picture of social issues and economic difficulties, the perfect life for a single parent who feels exhaustive, takes a cruise and then drives and marries a band leader. Even if the phrase "just his movie" apologizes to the script for solving real problems, "Girls" suffers too many inconsistent high songs, children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader Hose Iturb. Isn't it odd that every real person marks a movie where their supposed real self marries? <br /> <br /> Indeed, this movie appeared in the nineteenth forty. Only love for the old style of Hollywood romance and comedy could make "Girls" an acceptable movie.
