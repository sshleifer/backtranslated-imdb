Cavemen was overwhelmingly the biggest load I've been looking at. The Geico ad-based exhibition is less entertaining than the actual 30-second ad for Geico. The makeup was, to say the least, half-ass, hard to imagine a cave man who also had white teeth after going to dental care. This exhibition could have had a funny series of potentials if they had been cast in the ads, that in itself would make a terrible show. Perhaps, if the writers were the same as Geico's ads, it was an opportunity, but the pilot didn't have a good story. I'll give this exhibition from 1 to 10, I'd like to reset from 10, but it wasn't an option. I pray with this exhibition for a quick death before it dies worthy of death.
