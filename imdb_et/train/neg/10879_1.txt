Flat, flat, flat !!! 90-minute cringe-fest, which is 89 minutes too long. A script filled with eco-friendly and meaningless dialogue is frightened by the setting that has been baked with an amazing atmosphere and an opportunity (abandoned monastery). Mostly it is just embarrassing and attempts to fall into the gonzo horror (an example of this film's dialogue: after demonstrating his artillery, the fast dolly Barbeau vigilante was close to the character: "all the questions?" Bad acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes and appraisal of creature effects seems to have looked too much "The Evil Dead." <br /> <br /> For a long time, I have been letting my friends rent this turkey and subjugate ninety minutes that they will never come back to.
