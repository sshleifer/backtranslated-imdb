I've never found Charley Chase very funny, even though her on-screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find very funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon on the Scottish Sunday Post comic book page.) In Chase's best films, I tend to admire her professionalism rather than laugh at her. I give Chase credit for her best films - like "Mighty Like a Moose" and "Her Wooden Wedding" - that inspired a fandom who is very loyal to her ... but I'm positive that even the most die-hard Chase The fan agrees that a very early and very "Married Order" crude is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - an avid, uncomfortable, gormless, naff - is a young swain hoping to meet Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best result in this film as his father, who is amazed by Chase as "mollycoddle". Leo White, who made Essanay's work on Chaplin's foil more prominent, is a rival here. <br /> <br /> Ingersoll's watch has some action. I was intrigued by the name of the trademark in the titles of the dialogue: is it an early example of product placement? Unfortunately, there is a big mistake in casting a "Married Order" Rosemary Theby as Rose: it is meant to be a meeting with standard issues, but Theby - lame-chested, Hawk-faced - is physically wrong for this role. Theby (the husband of Harry Myers) was a successful career as an actor on the screen but was never credible. The film's historian William K Everson was very modest about him in one movie. <br /> <br /> I value "Married with a Order" from just 3 out of 10 and I'm charitable ... because I suspect that Charley Chase has got something everyone else gets, but I won't lose.
