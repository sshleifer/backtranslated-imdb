Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein wrote a zombie film by the story of Roth.this, which owes much to George Romero and his earlier living dead films, and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacren to mention Sam Ramie's 'Evil Dead'. There's nothing original here, and the story isn't convincing. This action is similar to this genre, it's just that the story failed. Heard that after this film has achieved commercial, if not artistic, success, Roth decided that he was a director and came out with an abysmally frightening, meaningful, meaningless (though much more ambitious) crap fest host. would have to give up when he was behind. The cab fever is not a good film, but compared to the host it is a work of art. I hope that someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this man that making movies is the wrong career choice. Salon fever, weak 3/10, not to be aby smal as Hostel.
