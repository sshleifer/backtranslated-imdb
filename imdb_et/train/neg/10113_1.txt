I discovered that this movie can be rented out of the package. The zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. you will get a movie and this is a women's raccoon mask. zero-special effects ... and even fighting scenes will see these 2-foot strokes. the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the film briefly and is worse than the rest of the filmmakers. the only thing I think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people copy it to a "cult class" ... but I can't imagine anyone thinking it's something other than one of the worst movies ever done. The real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed when I rented it, and I promise I won't see another Lommel movie again!
