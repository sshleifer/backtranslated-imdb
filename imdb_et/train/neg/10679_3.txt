I did not expect the film as good as the "In the Fire of Fire" or "24" episode, but it seemed that this movie was made for television and at best made a mediocre job. The (good) cast could not hide the fact that the plot was too predictable and the actors had to fight (they really try their best, I think) through their bad script lines, giving their fairly flat characters to all the extras. When I watched the film, I felt like I had seen it mostly in other (better) movies. There were car rides, big shootouts, romance, twist on the plot, etc. There is no one in this movie. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking to Cuba, you know who is behind it and all the hints you are given ("you are too close to the president, look at it from my perspective .. ") sounds silly. <br /> <br /> If it were for me (and maybe it's good that it's not), I'd write it down as follows: <br /> <br /> The first lady commands her husband for murder because she is sick and tired of Cuba all the time checking.
