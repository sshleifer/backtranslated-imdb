Don't be fooled, as I was in the “box” of “glowing” comments on the DVD box. "Wildly Entertaining.", "Seriously scary freakout." And worst, "PAR AND JAWS." This movie is not one of the above. <br /> <br /> I usually don't bother writing movies about bad comments, but I can't believe it's comfortable with IMDbis at 7. It doesn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> After so much light coming out of the attack created by the monster, what else, the lazy scientists are pouring chemicals, this film goes completely and goes sloooowly. Basically and incredibly, the girl grabs a monster (I give them points about the creature's design, but it's not the creation of WETA) and her semi-comic family spends half an hour in the sewer around the Han River. There was no tension in their quest, someone called it equal to Jaws, and by the time they find him, you realize that it was pretty much meaningless. In addition, a large part of the film is dedicated to the quarantine of the government, culminating in a funny scene with a bunched man overcrowded in front of a bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. It was bad. I'm not kidding. You want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you can save your life for 30 minutes.
