This is a wonderfully cozy example of a self-produced, written and directed vanity project ... when I worked as a team member, John Carradine commented on me (before burning in a pile order): "This is the worst piece I've never worked ... and I've worked a lot including * It was also an interesting moment before Jim Mitchum had problems with his lines and began to be in the church of Santuario (a religious shrine in Chimayos), where one of the local "vato loco" was worried by the lower spectators. ..show a somewhat respectful man that probably reminded Jim of where he was, because he then made a very deep and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior. In any case, the team did the job during the postponement and was never paid in full - but many strange stories came out - as we did at night, we were trying to entertain the 10-year-old son of the producer / director by building miniature Burmese tiger traps for us to break our feet. As they say, "Ya must love Bizi ..."
