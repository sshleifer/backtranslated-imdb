The months before the release of this movie you saw that it was advertised in all kinds of print media so I waited patiently to release my video to see what all the hype was. After that, I had to apologize to my roommates for having taken the VCR in the last half and a half to see such a terrible movie. This is basically a failure because it is a label-based film that deals with irrevocable characters. A possible exception, with the exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet), cannot bear them. The film is based on its dialogue, which is sophomorphic, moronic and crude. The only kind of amusing character is Eric, whose depiction of a group of friends in the only married member is dead. The last twist that aims to make you laugh at the three main characters, inspires only the same resentment against Beet. All in all, only rent if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
