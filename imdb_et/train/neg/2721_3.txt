I'm a big 50's sci-fi fan, but it's not one of my favorites. Although the film's concept was a natural vehicle for the classic tiny bipper sci-fi flick, the director thought too much to wear the film. It is clear that he worked without money because the whole film is full of swollen dialogue that continues and continues forever. I've never seen so much time in the movie to kill. <br /> <br /> "Blob footage" is probably less than 60 seconds in the entire movie, and most other people are involved in many poorly written dialogs. It was nice to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good in the sky ... how could the pain be thought that someone in their right sense believed them as teenagers?
