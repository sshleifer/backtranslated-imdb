Frankly, it seemed like seven hours of boredom. What is this? What is Will Smith that I just can't keep up with? I think he just seems too hellbent to take him seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how it is biased, but if he doesn't make new edits, I can never see him. He's a big name and that's why it's confused with talented and diverse actors. He's not just. I give him credit for trying so hard and being able to cry on the droplets of the hat. It's about that. <br /> <br /> The seven pounds were as yellow to me, right from the start. The suicide 911 call didn't intrigue me. I was not curious to know why he called his suicide. There was no surprise. The best thing I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent chemistry on the screen. I also don't know her name, but the Spanish woman did a great job in her scared and beaten woman. Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time, but I would say he always stole the show when he was. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was just an extreme test house. I couldn't ask myself why I took care of these people. Never did Tim / Been ever feel sorry for it. He killed himself with jellyfish? Was the 8-year-old accident the only survivor? Geewiz didn't see any such coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
