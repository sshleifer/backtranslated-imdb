(From 278 to 48 found this comment useful and counting ...) <br /> <br /> People are such mammals for image and appearance - both intellectually hollow "idealism" that is behind communism. Che's charisma and appearance are just as much related to his iconic character as the misinformation about his left-wing propaganda (like this film). <br /> <br /> I don't know what's worse: caught from one of Che's murder units or sit down within 4 hours of this typical Soderberghia garbage. The question is not why this pet project was made, but that took them for so long. "By", of course, I refer to the left Hollywood and its "secret" love for Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... take your choice). I am fascinated by the fact that one of the least talented liberal directors of Tinseltown took decades of such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where were those years Oliver Stone? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these overrated "artists" have often attracted themselves in similar, politically unilateral projects, but somehow Che Guevara, who is undoubtedly the most popular and well-known Communist, is not the subject of his films. <Br>> <br /> "Gerilla" has all the features of the epic scale American truth-bending story; there are so many factual details here, like here in the bios of other similar Hollywood high budget political fairy tales, such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", i.e. almost none. The movie stars are Del Toro's famous Argentina Revolution. However, the controversial and criminal of this man's actions could have been one thing no one could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - that's why Del Toro's bill is only visual. Del Toro can be an interesting, charismatic actor and he can physically resemble Guevara, but he does not have any intellectual qualities, so he makes Guevara too primitive. The casting of environments such as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetents only emphasizes the absence of a reliable assessment by the director. <br /> <br /> The movie is largely very slow (no surprise) and visually uninteresting. Even if the director were as brilliant as Kubrick, he would have carefully considered the release of a film over a 3-hour mark, so it is quite clear that Soderbergh, who has only made one or two strong films and already has a career, would think that Oceanic Grandness was a task. If you think the length of the movie shows that much of Che's life is shown here - think again. Soderbergh focuses on Che's last phase and many movies are annoying jungle crap, full of Guevara's alleged idealism. (Psychopaths have no ideals.) I don't know what kind of mind this high-valued director really has to choose for some of Che's earlier life. Did he find it too uninteresting? 600 people's massacre is not in the interest of the viewer, huh? Amazing. Some of the much better leaders than the overly praised charlatan would easily match not one but two full biographies to a 4-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in some ways, becomes a accomplice if he has never turned to the negative. on the dark side - over 90% - of Guevara. By spreading such historical inaccuracy by deliberately ignoring the foolish truth (God must not deceive Che's holy picture), Soderbergh proves not to be a humanist - a fake image that most Hollywood and pop music personalities struggle hard in all their careers, on the contrary: that he cares only for ideas, never people who are testing these ideas (like guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are the worst elitists; such people often have a disguised contempt for "proletera" (what is a stupid concept) that they are supposed to be contiguous. <br /> <br /> Half of all students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts, but without knowing why. She has become an iconic image of helpless, uninformed, very often young people who think that on the chest of this man's face they somehow make them "nervous", intellectual, hip or interesting. In fact, wearing a Che-Shirt only emphasizes its general lowness and full desire for self-education. (Wouldn't you like to know more before you start advertising your face to the world?) From now on, wearing a clich√© image has become as common as Bart Simpson's coffee cup. All these "Che-wearers" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they ever read from Fidel Castro's dead ally. <br /> <br /> After all that was done in the name of Marx, one would think that these "mongrel" ideals would eventually rest. Humanity never seems to learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, Iron Curtain, one hundred million dead, more than a billion destroyed through this system physically and / or mentally ... so none of this matters, huh? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won the Cannes Prize should surprise only those who are absolutely absolute, how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote. Hint: Sean Penn led the jury a long time ago. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/ for music-related wrinkles
