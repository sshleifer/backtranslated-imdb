"When a small Bavarian village is equipped with mysterious deaths, local (judge) answers (sic) calls for attacks, while the police detective refuses to believe in the futility of vampires returning to the village, the local doctor treats the victims to suspect the truth about the crimes," according to a summary of DVD sleeves . <br /> <br /> Inappropriate title, dramatically unsatisfactory, vampire secret. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the second level of the movie is just through the weak stars of the movie: Stylish Lionel Atwill (like Otto von Niemann), skeptical Melvyn Douglas (Karl Brettschneider) and pretty Fay Wray (like Ruth Bertin). A much more enjoyable supporting cast is bat-crazy Dwight Frye (like Herman), hypochondriac Maude Eburne (aunt Gussie Schnappmann) and suspicious George E. Stone (like Kringen). Mr Frye, Mrs Eburne and Mr Stone are excellent. Is there another movie that ends in a crazy speed in the bathroom? Magnesium Sulphate ?? Epsom salts? it's laxative! <br /> <br /> **** Vampire Ship (1933) Frank Strayer ~ Dwight Frye, Melvyn Douglas, Maude Eburne
