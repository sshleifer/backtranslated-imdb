The fact that the film is right for the most successful film in the history of Swiss film makes me shake my head! This is true, but at the same time bad. The Swiss army's slip may be much better. <br /> <br /> The story sounds interesting, at first: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to release his military training by the army when he is a church, his love for Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). <br /> <br /> There's really no difference in the way you work, from some recruiting and stone engagement. Melanie Winiger plays her strong Michelle Bluntsch mediocre, personally I found her quite annoying. <br /> <br /> The story includes comedy with romance that doesn't work as expected. The romance part is too trashy and the comedy section isn't funny at all, it's just a cheap try and doesn't change throughout the film. It's funny for 12-13-year-olds but not for those looking for fun comedy. Humor is weak except for some pictures. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! Stealing? Cool! If you want a good comedy for a Swiss RS, make sure you don't release your military training, and then don't wait too much! <br /> <br /> I give him 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is pretty funny on his screen. There is not much screen time
