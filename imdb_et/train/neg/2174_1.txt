It is hard to believe that people were actually beaten! I think the kids can enjoy it, but for me the parents of the child's movies don't sit on it. Predictable plot, boring Belushi and perhaps the slowest boy actor. I give the director responsibility for the child, but he was really painful to look at. I feel he is now ashamed because people know it was him. When he sang the Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound - then I came here and discovered that they did it because he got Star Search. I have always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed of his wonderful, unfortunate brother's name, and this mess shows why. Zero stars.
