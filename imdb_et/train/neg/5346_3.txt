I had to watch this movie because the plot was so cruel and the film lived up to expectations. In fact, it makes it somewhat uncomfortable at times. Unlike other Meyer films, sexual means are minimal. Some scenes of violence are unnecessarily free and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some work and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> Film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy with a window of brutality and immorality of slavery and fails in all censuses. It would be like Meyer tried to make up for sex plotting / blackploitation with a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a little guilty about getting into the early scene with the blatant domination that shows that Lady Susan is holding a whip with provocative equipment. He then tries to go back on the right track, making it a movie that touches good over evil. But because they cancel each other out, you get nothing. <br /> <br /> Because it's so bad in so many ways, it's really worth it if you appreciate the art that makes a terrible movie a terrifying film. possible taste. Perhaps, because it is so bad, we promised Meyer almost unacceptable access.
