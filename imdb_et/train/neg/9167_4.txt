"The Leap Years" is a film tailored by e-novel by Catherine Lim, a Singapore writer, which became the first Singapore novel / short story to be sold online. The film had an embarrassing post-production plan: it was shot at the beginning of 2005, it was released at the end of 2005, but finally it only appeared three years later, on 29 February 2008, for the year of the leap. <br /> <br /> Before I say anything, I must first admit that I am not a fan of the romance genre, so I can be a bit biased about this movie - I just looked at it because it was Singapore production and that it is available for lending to my neighborhood library. Here's my two cents from the movie. Let's just start by saying that everything except Qi Yu-wu KS and Wong Li-Lin are all Eurasia that you see here. The interest of love is Eurasia (Ananda Everingham) and the Wong friends trio is all, er, Eurasian. Does this film remain a stereotype that love and communication with the Eurasian people is more than a regular Chinese (or any Asian competition)? I don't know, it looks like that. Also, everyone in the film speaks of a mysterious "shifted" accent that is not anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. This is the "semi-perfect English" that the authorities would like us to talk about, but that doesn't exist anywhere, for example on the MTV channel. The result is that the film's dialogue sounds forcibly and not, but it is not helped by the lack of true blue Singapore people in the cast. with one liner. After twenty minutes, the "spirit" of the film begins to work and the film begins to serve the ordinary clich√© plate. <br /> <br /> I think I didn't enjoy the movie because the whole premise of keeping love for 16 years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other beliefs in the movie. I can't believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall into one Wong girlfriend. And the scene where the groom says, "Go before I think," has been used in 100 East Asian (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc.) TV series ... <br /> <br /> So this movie is 4 stars. The production value is fair and Wong Li-lin tries to do it the best, but the script doesn't help him. Joan Chen has a 15-minute-old elder Wong in the movie, and maybe the best actor for this party, but hey, his role is just a hangman. <br /> <br /> If you come across a loose year in a "rental or library", you may want to pop-up this DVD player for curiosity, but otherwise, for people who don't love romance, you can decide whether to give failing him.
