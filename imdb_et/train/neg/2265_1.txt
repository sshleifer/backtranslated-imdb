I love Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this bad excuse for a soft core clip is unnecessarily offensive, lacks something that resembles, and only serves Springer's self-promotion tool. Though it runs fast in 90 minutes, it pulls the movie terribly, and I should have had common sense. Just cruel.
