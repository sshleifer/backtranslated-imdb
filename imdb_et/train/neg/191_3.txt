... not to live in Montana and not to live there in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> "The river passes through it" is definitely a well-filmed movie spot. Good landscapes, Redford work well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all). <br /> <br /> For the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded as his father, the preacher. Having been driving, not driving his own life, he is left to look at his brother, who has been drilled in a small town environment, losing his life. The author is never even close to his brother's motivation, but at least he understands that he has no homor / fun. Everything is there, flying fishing, where he follows his father's style even as his old father. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it's predictable from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Definitely NOT a must-have (3/10) <br /> <br />
