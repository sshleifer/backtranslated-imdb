This film promotes the improvement of the mind. Read the book! It's incredible that someone thinks this film deserves time and investment. I've seen "B" movies before, but the "C" movie has just been invented. I didn't think I'd ever enjoy Power Rangers because my kids stopped watching, but I found myself in the videos for fifteen minutes. High school productions are better, and the actors involved should delete it again. Embarrassment is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate who loves this type of film even turned it off. Now it has to tell you something. When you watch this movie and I like it, I pray for you.
