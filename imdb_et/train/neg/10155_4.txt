I've read a number of good comments that have defended and criticized various aspects of this film. One thing I can see again and again is Megan, an idealistic politician who is trying to change the world. I loved her. Maybe because I am a 23-year-old politician and I think I'm changing the world so I'm tied to Megan. Besides, she is cute. He's not a supermodel, but a more ridiculous girl. <br /> <br /> OK so he shouted and shouted a lot. It is very dramatic and seems superfluous, but does it not fit his character? He continues this exhibition with a view to sacrificing his point of life. He thinks that people who enjoy such an exhibition are sick. I think he did his job very well. Of course, his young naive girl is scared of what he has anticipated. I think his vision exactly represents a young girl who shows her moral courage despite being afraid. In addition, I think he maintained the dignity of the film, despite the fact that he was desperate. <br /> <br /> As for the movie in general, with the exception of Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. It was very good gore scenes according to micro-budget standards. The plot might have taken a quick thought, hardly a reflection. Basically, it's just a nonsense movie of a sense of humor that the name refers to. I love doctor sadism. He kept Megan's shirt off, not only to hit (albeit greatly), but also tortured him before he killed him. Chainsaw hick was fun. He was probably the best character for Sloher film students. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 10. It was a good, almost no plot, and a mixture of a good and terrible exhibition. I would recommend it for cheap excitement, but it is hardly a diamond that is a micro-budget horror.
