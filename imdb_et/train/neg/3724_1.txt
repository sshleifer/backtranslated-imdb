I saw this movie twice through the Pentecostal Church, where my family attended Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother 4, then again when I was an 8-year-old brother 6. This film frightened my brother and me and shaped how we looked at the disbelief of the world. It was not just a film, it was also a philosophy that involved so many "Christians" about the "beast sign" and the momentum. This film, the church, and unstable negligence, cause serious paranoia for the future. For years I lived under the delusional effects of the church and the fear of forgetting Christ. I'm 40 years old now. I went through years of counseling. I explained to the psychiatrist this system of film and church and family beliefs. I was involved in a delusional disorder. I actually started to believe it, it was my brother's mind that this cult philosophy really happened. I'm no longer afraid of the future, I have come to an agreement with the fear the church has injected for its members. I've taken this experience to the goal, I'm going to be my licensed psychologist who specializes in childhood trauma.
