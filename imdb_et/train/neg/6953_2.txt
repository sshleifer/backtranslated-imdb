Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Since this mini-series is approaching and we were well aware of it in the last six months because Sci-Fi Channel continued pipetting with BG ads, I admit I was feeling more and more uneasy when I learned more. <br /> <br /> As with all cinematographic works that have been experimenting for some time, people are moving to see different things. In this respect, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, there are chrome warriors with viscous red light. For others, it is a affection that they kept special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time. Many forget the situation of special effects in the late 1970s, especially on television. For some, the memories are a story around the stage. Others still remember the relationship between how the relationships themselves helped solve the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I come from the last group. The core of Battlestar Galactica was the people who pulled together to save each other from the evil empire. Yes, bad. Cylons had nothing to do, but the destruction of humanity, but they did. Although the base stars turned around, men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow managed to survive until the next example. They didn't survive because they had better technology or more fire. They survived because they took care and trusted each other to pass the next exhibition. <br /> <br /> The show had its drawbacks and sometimes they were happy, but they were the people you were interested in. <Br>> <br /> The writers of this current rendition never knew it. In some ways, he took up the least important part of the original show, the names of the character and the arch of the story, and designed what they called less than the revival of television science literature. Because it was their purpose, they could be judged by how well they achieved: failure. It was far from being a renewal. In fact, in many ways, it was a fiction for a long time in scientific literature. He borrows freely from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. I find this regrettable. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has contributed to popular science fiction for over a decade and has contributed to some of the most popular television films you might see. One of the difficulties he seemed to have was that there was no conflict in the D & E bridge team. It was the intact rule of Roddenberry ST: TNG. Like many others who have lived under this rule by others who then use all the possibilities to break the rules when they are no longer under that power, it seems that Ron Moore has forgotten some of the lessons learned by renowned scientific writer Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best story possible, he has created dysfunctional casting, as I have ever seen with the intention of creating as many cast conflicts as possible. In addition to some being not functional, some were not the least credible. Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone who surprisingly surprises a senior officer would not be able to "hack" for a couple of days, they could be filled, and they would never have come out the next day. This would not have happened, especially during the war. <br /> <br /> The thing I remembered about most of Ron Moore's earlier works was that he killed Captain James Kirki. He killed Kirki's captain and unfortunately for me killed Battlestar Galactica.
