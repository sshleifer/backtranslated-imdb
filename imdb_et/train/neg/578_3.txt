It's not a good movie. The actor is remarkably rigid and convincing. The film does not seem to know whether it is going to the real horror or to go to the camp and go for a goat. I never saw the first movie, but it doesn't stand up to my own, there are several unbelievable plot twists and the viewer is never aware of the importance of a leading female vampire. Not worth watching
