Another movie tortured by self-centered, arrogant, unknown anger, self-destructive cord, which we should take care of. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong with wallpapers that have a heavily destructive character. What I dispute against this is that this man has so little background. Why did this man hate himself and the world? Had the script dealt with it more, they could have given him sympathy. As he simply comes out of the unpleasant horrors, not tragically, he just hates. it is possible that the writer has a nerve to make a happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's where there's a good fight! Man! Don't waste your time.
