It's just amazing because it's terrible - you really have to see it! <br /> <br /> Depending on your point of view, Dylan Walsh is either a savior or a problem here: because he is the only one on the screen who actually gets something similar to natural cadence and slipping, he will destroy the film, proving the mistakes of all others, or it saves it by offering some context to their horror. <br /> <br /> I tend to look later - thanks to it, it works as a high comedy. He is a 7-foot walk in a dwarf basketball game, his skill set in this context just doesn't apply and his inconvenience is delicious. <br /> <br /> True treatment, however, is Mrs Eastwood, whose inability to speak simple English is so widespread that I actually hoped she was Russian beauty, who phonetically pronounced her lines without realizing their meaning. But no: he is just a talented American who leaves you laughing with every line he falls. Whether he knew what these lines mean, he must remain an open question.
