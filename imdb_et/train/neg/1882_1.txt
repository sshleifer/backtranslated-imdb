What a terrible piece of garbage !!! Who are all the people who talk about how good it is? Yes, it's "artistic"; and yes, it's a "stranger", but ... that's not enough. The plot is boring and divorced, like a reality exhibition, but not so slipperyly. <br /> <br /> People are inherently uninteresting; but as characters, they do not have enough depth to feel empathy with them. If they are based on real people, I feel great about them, very sorry. <br /> <br /> Violence (and some of it being very violent) seems quite convincing and free. It's like a manufacturer's vision for Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think about him too. <br /> <br /> And yes yes: if I had such neighbors, I'd move!
