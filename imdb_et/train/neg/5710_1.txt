Well, it seemed good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer rejoined, this time combining Heist's movie, Da Vinci's code, American history 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, it's to Indiana Jones what Speed ​​2 speed is. Reasonable (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fight against the child's script and lose it badly. The film is a little more than the expanded advertisements of freelancers. But these freelancers are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these free sellers are the natural descendants of Templar's knights (and no one mentions "Hell" or Jack Ripper.) they are not. In fact, there is no relationship, surprises, and no climax - it just stops. The national treasure is directed at Dan Brown, but it has the same intellectual level as the Scooby Doo episode that captures humor.
