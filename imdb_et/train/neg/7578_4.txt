The "Superchick" (1973) is nothing more than the "hit, American style" of the 1970s, with the appearance of a flash of nudity, "Superchick" (1973) is a light face that can somehow entertain. Tara B. True, there really is some super language. This stewardess (not a flight crew) who looks so good that even his plane's autopilot has passed his (!), And every port's hunky boy, this wing, "swingin gal" puts "put" "installation". With her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude L.A, Tara certainly wasn't busy. And if he doesn't carry these men for the masculine energies that the spectator is learning, he will be able to take the karate class, the mile-high club, fight off lightning and rapists, take part in the groovy pot parties and stop the hijacking attempt. As I said, a fun and cheerful night when you feel somewhat brain-dead and just want to tube in front of the tube. The future astrologer Joyce Jillson will play Tara's role, but the film looks pretty beautiful. Amazingly, the 70s faves of Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still can do what they do best - show off their crusts! Although the picture is never funny and does not have much thoughts in the metaphoric head, he is able to be consistently amusing and I think it is something. Strangely enough, the final credits should pay attention to Mrs Jillson's body twice; don't think I've ever seen it!
