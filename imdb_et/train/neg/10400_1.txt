Enough ... sometimes they just have to stop making movies based on a long dead concept. The first Tremors movie was great. The second was ridiculous. The third was nausea. The TV series was depressingly depressing. And this movie just makes a contribution deeper. <br /> <br /> There is basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and a puppet theater, now we have a series set in the Wild West in the 19th century and fighting graboids. Like the first rehash, they have to learn how to win them all again. Little entertaining I think. Otherwise, it is a direct video broadcast, such as Tremors 2 and 3, just too far. Oh and I still don't know how these events were ever registered ... did they just forget to register this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be historic, so the guys in our first movie wouldn't be so ready. Movies that destroy the original make me crazy. Avoid this garbage.
