"Arahan" adds something positive to Kung Fu genre. The clutter and quality inspired by Stephen Chow's films is a mistake for comparing these cluttered films. <br /> <br /> First, combat scenes are nothing new. All that is presented here has been done earlier and better, such as Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting logic in intelligent moving movies. There seems to be no point in earning punches that do not have adverse effects like "Matrix" after-effects. <br /> <br /> The attractive female leader So-Yi Yoon had captured the screen, but she has never convincingly conquered the physical demands of this role as Ziyi Zhang had made her "Flying Daggers House" so easy. In the background of martial arts, Kung Fu films are fine. The inexperience of the spectators in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto's "Asum") if you are not a very talented director, "Arahan" proving that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
