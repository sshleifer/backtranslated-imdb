I'm not wasting my time writing an essay and wasting my time. However, I would like to say that all those who are good at this film are completely ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can't play this card and I mean a nationalism patriotic card so people don't watch this movie. this is a film that expresses its free will in this country (oh yes, I played this card), although the director is German and deserves an attack every time he arrives at the camera, but the world is full of controversy and that's the same thing you have previously heard, such as GTA contradiction. It's comedy, laughing and being disgusting, not all, not dark humor, and probably you don't have to take the heart, the past is the past, so people remember those who were lost, but time to go was !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. In addition, I'm crazy and who needs a soul?
