I didn't really have great expectations and I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed. This movie is so terrible that I felt obliged to register an account in IMDb to warn others that they didn't waste their time. The style is terrible and you ask yourself during the movie "can it get worse?" YES, it can! somehow they manage to do the worst of every minute and you finally think, "I want my 1 hour 35 minutes ago!". Someone had to pay for it! <br /> <br /> I dare to find the film that is the worst than it was ...
