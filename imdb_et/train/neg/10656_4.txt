What can I say. Kamal Hassan's movie is terrible. He works very well, but it is a terrible story with a terrible direction. In my opinion, the director must give up Gautham Menon's management. There are many tragedies throughout the film. Moreover, one cannot simply believe how true these terrible crimes were. There was no practicality in the film. Gautham is just the end of the story. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika are doing really well. Roisto looks too ugly, though their performance was not bad. I don't think it's a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa you see with your family. You can't see this movie! But Harris Jayaraj did a great job again and that's why I've given this movie out of 10. His song "Partha Modail Nallae" is spiritual and soothing. There is also a great cinematic art. All in all, it's just a bad and bad movie. Kamal Hassan should have rejected this movie.
