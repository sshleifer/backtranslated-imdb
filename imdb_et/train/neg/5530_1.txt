Many of the problems associated with this film are the worst consistency; and editing it in VHS for college cable TV several years ago, I tried to find out exactly what went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually built a much longer movie and then started watching it for a normal theater look. How much longer? to fill all the holes in the plot, because we would need about three more hours of narration and character development - especially considering the fact that the film we have is just so slow and takes it so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's amazing; What could Halperin try here? Their previous film "White Zombie" was a successful low-budget attempt to duplicate early Universal Studios monster movies (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and as such remained close to the zombie mythology people in North America would know from popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Rebellion, on the contrary, seems to be an allegory to today's war policy. This would not only explain the opening and transformation of Dean Jagger's character into megalomania, but would also explain why zombies do not really do much in the movie, but stand around, see scary and waiting for orders - they are just allegorical soldiers, not the drunken cannibals we all have in love and scared zombie films. <br /> <br /> I'm the same thing I don't like about today's war and this policy - but I think the movie should be fun first and only later, maybe education. And certainly - the zombies movie should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> Really one of the most strange films in Hollywood history, but not whatever I want, even for historical value.
