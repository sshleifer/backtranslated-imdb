My first clue about how bad it was was when the video case said that it was the people who brought us the Blair Witch Project that was a masterpiece compared to this trash. The action was on the 6th grade production caliber of Oklahoma, such as a plot predictable, boring and ugly. 85% of the script has the words and four variations of the four letters. Mother F seems to be a "writer" favorite because it is used constantly. It must be 10 minutes to write this script in the last speech. Thank you to God for letting it out and jumping on most of it fast. Don't waste your time or money with it.
