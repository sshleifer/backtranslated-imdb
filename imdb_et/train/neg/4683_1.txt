As a former submarine, it was one of the worst submarines I've ever seen. First of all, somewhat of the US Navy, especially the Trident submarine with nuclear power, is unthinkable. These men are the best and committed to their mission. The responsibility they carry is fantastic and they take it very seriously from the captain to the youngest crew member. I could never see a crew on a ship that would share its interface between the captain and the chief executive. The executive officer, acting as a character played by Denzel Washington, was released from his duties and was judged by Martialed, then drummer in the Navy. Not surprisingly, the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to this film. Finally, if any submarine crew member made noise on this ship, they would be seriously robbed. Submariners learn as early as possible in their early career to avoid detection. They don't let the doors go in and even talk quietly and wear soft footwear. I was surprised when they portrayed the team while driving. Loud music is never tolerated. I know that portraying the life of a submarine does not actually sell movie tickets, but it is up until it is ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
