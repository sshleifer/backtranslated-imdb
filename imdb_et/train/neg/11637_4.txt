Uwe Boll has made it impossible: to create a customization of the game, which remains at least somewhat true to the game; he has transformed anti-social and offensive games into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So, when it comes to adaptation, it's successful. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is still Uwe Boll we are dealing with so don't wait for the movie to be really good. "Post" carries your greeting very quickly and becomes a pain to sit down. <br /> <br /> My post has a post in the United States, as a twelve-year-old child does. Boll seems to think that insult is linearly proportional to the comical value: the more offensive, the funny and the more funny. This results in a film that sets a new level of flavor while being extremely hit and lost. Yes, some gags are working, but it seems to be pure happiness. High points are the manager who recruits himself, and the people who hit trucks and other vehicles very much. The low points include ... much more. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise wear, the post will simply change to view. Yes, every ten minutes there is a good joke, but everything else lies in the horrors of annoying characters that shoot and run one after another, which seems to be eternal. <br /> <br /> It would probably have worked as a short film, but it's not just enough content that lasts over 90 minutes (although it seems twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice events, but they lose hopelessly endless and pointless action scene and content that is offensive just for that 4/10
