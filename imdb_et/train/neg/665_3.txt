The teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) of the school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) speaks at Bridgeport; he feels that he is killing his family to stay with him, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison. Three years later, the traumatized Donna feeling is better, but is still under psychological treatment and pills. In the evening, he will go with his boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two friends to the Pacific Grad hotel. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is housed on the same floor in a hotel behind Donna, beating his friends and hotel staff who cross his path. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable slash "Prom Night" is a cliché collection that lacks full originality. The stupid story is low and stupid, Johnathon Schaech's bad behavior as a mad killer. The predicted scenario is amazing because it is possible to predict what will happen in the following scenes. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("Death Calls Dance")
