Nu Image, UFO and others produce movies on SCI FI, with a budget of about $ 2 million. Some have extensive effects, other features are recognizable and other features are both $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that it was probably produced for $ 750,000, if not significantly less. Used in little sets, plenty of scenes are taken in multiple scenes and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish. <br /> <br /> It's a painful look. Not so much that it is badly managed, poorly executed, and erroneous, but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for some time now and have great hopes of a relatively modest budget for this film. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in the original announcement of this movie have joined PT talks with Barnum.
