Very "straight" nice old lady who is desperate for money to save her house and property, grows "pot" in her house, smokes it with some old friends and then sells it. This is the story of this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some humor that the contradiction brings. Much of the movie works. Humor is not ridiculous, but it keeps you for an hour and a half so I think it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments and Brenda Blethyn has fun watching the lead. But the ending really ended up with the "cute" offensive-bad messages of the movie that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to see it. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but it shouldn't be all warm and foggy for those who break the blatant law. Here, too, typical (1) children out of wedlock, but this is not a problem and is considered right; (2) clergy depicted as morally weak; and (3) a doctor who will also be stoned with stones! <br /> <br /> Hello? And the reviewers here in Hollywood are blasting? This shows how secular society has generally lowered standards in the UK and Europe. Hey, people: at least a moral trail, nothing more than a message from Timothy Leary "If that looks good, do it".
