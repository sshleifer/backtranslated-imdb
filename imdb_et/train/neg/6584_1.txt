Being the only film I saw at LÃ¼beck's Nordische Filmtage this year, this year's festival is remembered for the lowest ever. <br /> <br /> This movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece! Sorry, but there are no proper words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First, participants are not the best. But even better actors wouldn't have saved the movie. For example, the plot: after the first 15 minutes, it was quite clear that John was sick, the neighboring girls were not real, and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing more than a disgusting (beating each other until my blood flow is at all related to sexuality), but unfortunately these were not the only nasty images to show. All others have copied other drivers, eg. Lynch, but of course without their genius. <br /> <br /> So to make the entire movie summary and save the time and money of other viewers: the man loses his girlfriend, the girlfriend turns home, the boy kills the girlfriend and gets mad, the man is the hot but mad neighbor's girl, the guy is great Nasty sex with one of them (or she thinks), finally she realizes she is crazy and her girlfriend and her new mistress put her flat all the time. bad story, bad actors, pictures that make you vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for understanding Norwegian as you have learned Swedish) - at least one evening benefit - and you can't pick 0 points here.
