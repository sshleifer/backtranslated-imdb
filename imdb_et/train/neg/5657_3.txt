I'm a great fan of Lon Chaney, but writing this movie just didn't work for me. The story jumps strange (I have learned since then that the film has no part) and the characters appear and disappear with an irritating surprise. Some intertexts are too clear (eg "why, you're no longer a child!" - a picture of a long, slow blow - "you're a woman!" Yes, we got it for the first time), but there are some talking sequences that require clarification never appears. (Let's hear Luigi and his blonde girlfriend's argument, please!) A plot that includes intuitive desires (figuratively, if not technically), disturbed that it was hard to see. In the case of the writer's credit, this problem was treated as a problem, and in May-December the better and inevitable inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (eg "Daddy-Long-Legs") is not considered. Chaney normally does a good job, but I think she's better targeted in the past - she did it a few times, IMHO. I enjoyed clown sequences and I was very impressed by the tricks. Loretta Young was charming, though amazingly young. The film has moments, but so far this is my least favorite Chaney picture.
