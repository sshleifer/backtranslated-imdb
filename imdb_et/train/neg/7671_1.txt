The film starts with some scrolling text that takes almost five minutes. This gives a summary of what is happening. It could have worked easily, but instead you can scroll through the text. Shortly after you have bombarded the characters you start learning a little, remember that this is all you know about them. The beginning of the plot begins to fall out of the ground and then runs through the film. Changing a plot doesn't just change, but you can even ask yourself if you're watching the same movie. I've never played a video game, but I know people who have. From my understanding of whether you played or not, this film is not better. Save your money if you don't want to sleep in theaters.
