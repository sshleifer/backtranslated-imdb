Dane Youssef. <br /> <br /> Christmas Gang. The perfect plan. Everything goes wrong. They are in trouble. The police are out. They're at an angle. What are they doing now? <br /> <br /> Well-known acquaintances? <br /> <br /> The film seems to have tried to be a combination of a working workshop, an indie movie, and a theater. <br /> <br /> This is something that actors love - it's like a workshop or a game, because it mainly consists of a tense focus on actors acting ... angry, tense, scared, chatting, schematic, planning - giving a lot of free choices for the performers to really grow pigs. <br /> <br /> The trio of crocuses, one leader, one goon, one brother, comes out with a great hoist scheme. .. and processing the monkey key. The top things are a little "fender-bender" and one of the shocks on the back of the windscreen. <br /> <br /> Police officers have their tail and they stumble upon a bar called poetically (and randomly) "Dino's last chance." <br /> <br/> Spacey as a director tries to focus on actors' performances and dialoug. He puts a smoky and glowing Bogart's passionate-red cigarette ad. And he keeps all the violence in the screen field, really. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on intensity and terrible violent scenes would have given the film some edge. <br /> <br /> The movie's problem is that it moves too slowly and suffers in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. Together with their boys and Joe Mantaga, the traditional routine outrageous mad dog police lieutenant who has all the thumbs, but hasn't been given anything to actually do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter An actor who is believable in his own brain, who wants to have blood. <br /> <br /> And the scammers are in a tense situation where they go to jail or try to figure out some space. Characters are mostly away, trying to think about the plan ... and they must calm down and too articulate. There's even a scene where attacks are playing in the pool, where there are a number of armed police officers ready to strike. At one point, one of the faults even calls the police, who is out of the bar. Oh brother. Oh barely. <br /> <br /> These police officers will kill them or plan to lock them. Wouldn't it be a little frightened, a little uneasy? In the meantime, all real activities take place. <br /> <br /> Someone throws out a gun, baseball that brings a stupid crash screen and there's another accident that happens ... well, kinda sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway would have had to spend more time with the break trainer, improving her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is good in small parts. <br /> <br /> The police, who listen to the power to achieve the absolute worst time of the packages, have a nice look. So is the scene where someone goes through the rear windscreen. <br /> <br /> Dialogue apparently tries to go to David Mamet's approach and it's just as silly, but never as realistic or insightful. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be too much of what really is ... a really low budget movie that the actor is behind the camera for the first time directing other participants from the script, which is not "bad but needs some rewriting." Spacey shows that he is not a terrible director, but he does not have a sense of "film making" and it seems he is just filming the participants. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and can work with the material, but they all feel inappropriate. As I said before, the film's failure suffers. <br /> <br /> I don't mean the wrong actors are cast. I think they just found the right cast, but put all of them in the wrong roles. I think switching some roles would have contributed enormously. his troops, holding Fischter on his "blood-thirsty" and Matt Dillion as a sacrifice. This would have been a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some participants directly act, it works. They can even win the Oscar for it. But for a long time, when the actors are direct, they tend to focus only on performances. Just let the actors act. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good presentation for it. Sorry for that. <br /> <br /> Overdue events in real life are pretty much the same as the age, so it's natural that the movies that go with them go from A to B as well. <br /> <br /> There are some very big entries in this genre. Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie hostage situation: "Negotiator." <br /> <br /> It's definitely not going to become a cult class, let alone one of the AFI 100's. and a personal touch, but in the end it is an instantly forgotten and kind of movie that would be the best on conventional television. It's not just worth seeing your way. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Spacey's other "Beyond the Sea" management credit was said to be a better effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. Before you succeed, you must fail. <br /> <br /> Dane Youssef
