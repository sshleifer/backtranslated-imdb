Geez! This is one of the movies you think you've reviewed before, but you didn't. I didn't say you didn't give it, but somehow you thought it was. <br /> <br /> Be honest and short; it is one of the worst, boring and stupid slashers ever made. I can't say anything good about this crap because there are barely proper sequences that could say that by professional filmmakers. The plot is somehow good, since he copied "Popcorn" since 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, it's not such a bad movie that it's good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do her best, but it wasn't enough.
