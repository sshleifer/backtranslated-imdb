Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother had one policy that the film voter should pay. And although I never pay to see some of the crap they took me, I couldn't resist free movies! That's how I came to see the mess like another movie from Conan and NEVER HAVE BEEN! Now, despite being a sad film, it's in fun places - the dead way of the brain. And technically the tricks and camera work are good, so it will raise my rating to 2! Why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, there is practically no plot, Rambo himself says only about 3 words (except the ground and cries), is unnecessary and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the film is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what the special effects of STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL. 12383499143743701 The ball and rockets were shot at Rambo, but none of them affects him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots his mark! And while the bad guys use AK-47, helicopters and rockets, some scenes had all the Rambo bow and arrows that seem to be tips on nuclear power! The scene where one bad boy strikes him when he slowly and peacefully launches one of these explosive arrows is especially for foolish viewers! It was in admiration for UHF, which provided Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just that stupid scene. <br /> <br /> An all-in-one movie that's so stupid and pointless, it's almost like an independent parody!
