This film concerns a very young girl, Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), who leaves her family and leads the college refresher. One evening, Cassie and her friends decide to visit plenty of drinking and dancing, and Cassie rides with her boyfriend she likes, but she didn't tell her she loved her. As Cassie drove, the car was stopped on the road in the middle of the car and he was unable to avoid the accident and as a result, his boyfriend lost his blood. Cassie becomes very emotionally irritated and has a nightmare that causes her to have hallucinations about reviving her boyfriend and meeting men who are trying to murder her, and she is trying to find out who her true friends are, who wants her to die and he wants to die for him and whether he wants to die for him in the horror test. Cassie dreams that her boyfriend loves her after her death and finds another boy in her bed and is told she asked her to love her. This is the exit film, not good at all.
