I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 movie "Criss Cross". I found the latter to be disappointing, but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a "neo-noir" because it is modern and color, two things purists would do to disable the status of a movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest negative, however, was not cinematography (it was good), but a confusing story. Hey, some of the 40's Dashiell Hammetti stories were similar, but I didn't care about them either. The filmmakers here didn't help the situation by placing a story that seemed every three minutes. No wonder it was following this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that there is so much confusion with the 45-minute mark that nobody cares anymore. I know I didn't.
