Frankly, I'm not even kidding when I say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! In this film, there is no single drowning in its slim dialogue or its blatant plagiarism story. I can't even count the number of things in this movie that are obviously hanging from "Apples" and other such movies. For example, in this film, "Lucy", a nanny, is actually one of the fucking minions who were sent to lead and defend Satan's spawn ..... does it sound like someone else's Baylock. Another thing is that the orphanage was first given to the child for a few months after it was accepted, as was the "Omen". Fortunately, a priest managed to survive and fled with his burns throughout his body .... another coincidence ?????? And the top-burned priest is in the hospital room, where all the pictures of Jesus are all over the wall, similar to the priest "The Omen", which has walls that are plastered on walls, such as wall paper. Please don't even compare me to the end of this movie and the "The Omen" because I mentioned too much here as I mentioned above.
