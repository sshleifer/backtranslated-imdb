With the release of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry has indeed hit the bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived a peaceful life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund) in recent years. One day Stefan's old friend arrives to ask him. Stefan does a small messenger job. He should bring a hero-filled suitcase through the Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately, things are not working in Germany as planned, and Stefan is now in trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish movie that violates the traditional family drama pattern. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how the film should be written, filmed or cut, the result can only be disastrous. Content can be concluded with: poor-performing, inconsistent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight of the film is the unprecedented sexual field induced by the beautiful Regina Lund. It only takes a few seconds, leaving about 90 minutes to clean, say what it really is, crap.
