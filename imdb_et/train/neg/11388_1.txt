This story speaks of a romantic triangle n. African male prostitute, French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and Russian waiter who doesn't speak French and never seem to shave. <br /> <br /> Under the movie is boring, harsh and depressing, shooting in foggy, cloudy winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everything is swimming in strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know it is because the white balance was out. Everyone is pale and fallen and looks haggard, dirty and dirty. The bodies are bones and let in such a neighborhood that they look rather ugly and unpleasant. Moles, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three characters go back to Stephanie's homeland, where we see a little Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre when he has destroyed rural areas and unpredictably strange interiors. Mother dies. Well ... and that's really. Character formation is minimal, as is the story. <br /> <br /> I think the story is not linear (it would explain a lot of non-followers), but really, after paying seven euros, I don't feel like I should build the movie myself: that's what the director takes for my money. I look forward to sharing the story with the talking process and I have to get my hands dirty so I ask too much. <br /> <br /> This movie is a conscientious garbage made primarily from the desire of the epater les bourgeois (ie the shocks straight). I see it was amazing for the Berlin Film Festival, and I understand why it was nowhere.
