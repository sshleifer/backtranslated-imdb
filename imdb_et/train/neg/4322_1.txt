Read on and take note - you can save 88 minutes of your life (that's it!). <br /> <br /> This movie provides American Christmas for a modern small town. Capra style. If it fails .... completely and absolutely fails. I'm trying to think of one good thing and can't. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People don't die, they can spend eternity as immigrant workers at Santa's factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys who are sitting on trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I don't break it for you, but the movies must have light if it's just dark with contrast, but there's no one. Even photography is dark snow, shown at the end of freezing, everywhere cold, humid and unhappy. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the film has a happy (schmaltzy) end. What a relief!
