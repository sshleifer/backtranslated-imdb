This is an exciting terrible movie. It makes so little sense that it will kind of make a strange internal logic. Well, that would be if it didn't leave the dragging of the remaining legs before it finally despised its weightlessness. The film can't remember whether it's a straightforward "Man Turns Into Monster" (like all those 1960s ING MAN movies) or a strangely big business conspiracy theory or a mysterious story of life or ... or what? Make your choice. It's just a mess. Groteski over the top and burn in all directions, leaving open ends all over the place. Just like Tobe Hooper would have taken David Lynch's tablets. Unfortunately he didn't take enough.
