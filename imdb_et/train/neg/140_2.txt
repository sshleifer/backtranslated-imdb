Valentine is a terrible movie. That's what I thought about it: <br /> <br /> Acting: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can't act. Others were not much better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was okay, but it could have been more advanced. This movie was a great movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name "Paige Prescott" recognizes Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don't see Valentine. This is really a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
