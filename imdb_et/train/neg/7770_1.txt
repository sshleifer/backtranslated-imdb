Bill Rebane, who was partly responsible for the really notorious anti-classical Monster a-Go Go, was in complete confusion of the film. As I was at the end of the cold, I came to the incredible conclusion that this film was actually even worse than the 60-year-old shock. Story ?? as it is? There are about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people into their distant mansion to play a number of horrible games. Whoever is able to survive and survive will win $ 1,000,000. This is a very simple plot, but Rebane will nevertheless become somewhat incomprehensible. Things happen. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes much sense. And then it ends. Weird. I mean, what the hell is that going to end? I think you would stick to your conclusions. Product values ​​and action are not a pornographic standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) isn't even that good. He is so incredibly horrible that he is convincing. Unfortunately, it cannot be said that the same crap-fest is a whole, but it is just a favorable basement rotor.
