All David Prior's films are in all cases terrible: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, lack of budget (the director's brother is mostly a male leader). But they all have an incredible value for entertainment because they are unintentionally fun. Almost every plot of David Priori's film (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. A crew of all over the American commercial community to incite Communist evil. But unlike other Cold War wastes, such as Red Dawn, Prior's movies are really funny because they're in place and act. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene where Becker (or another guy?) Is called by General Mitchell for a secret mission in South America. The more fun the line is, if it is "it's my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. Did you train your roommate? And, apparently, it's their solution to prevent eviction. <br /> <br /> If you find these gems on everywhere you use your video, buy them. They are all funny and even funny with some beer. See them with your group of friends for a true MST3K-style experience. So far, I have my friends and I managed to get Night Wars and Aerobics aka "Killer Workout". But what I most recommend about them is the Final Sanction, with the Frenchman Robert Z'dar.
