This is the kind of movie you regret when you put on your VCR. The version of Stephen's kings' movie "Misery (1990)" is somewhat strange. I do not understand how this film got a score of 5.2 because it has no story that was ever so, and it ended easier for me when the movie ended. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been a short film instead of spending a lot of time on the same thing. As with any bad movie, everything happens at the end of the movie in 10-15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries on your remote control because you are going to do a lot of speed Don't worry, you won't miss anything important.
