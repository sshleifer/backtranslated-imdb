Looking at Hulu (too many ads!), So it cut off the pace, but even it was like watching a bad friend from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both parts play Jerry Lewis. When I was an Indian, I protest the depiction of all men as a vein and depict all women as hairs. They cheated on Western music videos and used many western models so men could touch them. I usually enjoy a lot of Indian movies, but it was a big disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story doesn't happen in India (uncle refers to when Mac returns to India), but I can't find out where it should be.
