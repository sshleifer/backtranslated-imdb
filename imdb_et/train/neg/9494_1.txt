The only thing that surprises me more than the one who liked this movie is that it was headed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I wonder enormously. Leaders had no chemistry. Secondly, I could believe there was something deeper than it was between them. The story was simply not true. Add tons of stereotypes to this brutal conversation and an incredibly slow plot that basically doesn't go anywhere, and you have a real stinker. Kay Lenz's naked scenes can be useful for those who are looking for a nice fare, but otherwise it is a huge waste of time. My thoughts when I watched the movie was that it would have been better labeled "Cheesy".
