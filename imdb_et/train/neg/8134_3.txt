A man wakes up from a bat spider. He and his wife are going to their honeymoon for a picnic in the desert. He seems to hear strange noises and is disturbed by the sight of bats that crawl their picnic tables. She wants to go to a cave where she has something to do with what she does, but she wants to enjoy her honeymoon. She apologizes. They go on a tour but leave the group out. He falls down on a slope where he is disturbed by insects. She follows her. He hears a strange noise again and seems to know that the bat is approaching; one does and gets into the hair. She is fighting against it and attacking her, biting her forehead. <br /> <br /> They will get out of the cave, but when they are in the gondola at the ski resort, it will start to gain momentum with hallucinations or bats' visions that attack people. He gets angry when it happens. He can't drink alcohol without forcing it. His wife worries about rabies and he starts treatment with Pasteur, but reacts violently to the injection. And then some people are killed. We see a part of human transformation into a bat. It looks like it's not just her mind. Whether a bite of bats causes these changes is not clear, as it had some symptoms before biting. Although the title seems to be inappropriate, the end result is that the same thing happens to the Second Person. Not a very good movie, but I liked the diversity of places and scenes of deserts, caves and ski slopes. I didn't think it was as bad as other people, and I didn't think the 1999 Bats movie was as bad as others think (I rated it 5/10).
