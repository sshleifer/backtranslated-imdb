They say nymphomania leaves you dissatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies for clinical nymphomania, but she's definitely in a sexual relationship with men. She is still studying for "more data" to see what she wants from her life and men, although her age is now a very good idea. (However, I cannot agree that anyone who says Young is too old for a role. If he is, we should all be so old at the age.) Mostly, this film was cold, although it is by no means the worst kind of you will ever see. And unlike the last Eyes Wide Shut, at least one happens.
