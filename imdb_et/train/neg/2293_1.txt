If this series is better than Batman - animated series, then I think it failed. The drawing of the characters is sad ... (For example, Catwoman looks awful ...) But what is very disturbing to me is that Batman looked like a wimp who can't take care of the battle, without two, even three sidekicks. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know comic books, I know Nightwing and Batgirl should be Batman's allies alongside Robman, but still ... making Batman say he needs help from them. In BTAS, he can face seven opponents without problems ... He is aging? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing: I really don't think Batman would allow Tim Drake like a child soon without battles, without decades of hard training. One, it is irresponsible (and Batman is everything but irresponsible), and two, this is not what happened in comics if we wanted to remain loyal to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The animated series made history, its animation, stories and characters ... It was really Batman's legend. The New Adventures series made the legend another Batman tremble.
