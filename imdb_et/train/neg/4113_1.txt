I have to stop watching the movie when I start, no matter how bad it is. This movie was embarrassing to sit down. "Ninja" like "sparkling wines", such as "movements", how the bad guys come in hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seemingly innocent bystanders, the predictable outcome and all the bad deeds were just terrible. Like a girl who finds a reporter in her friends' apartment and goes "about what you're doing here (holding your skin)", "hey, you're cute, you want @ # $%! ???" like 1.2 seconds .... Just bad .... Save yourself for an hour and forty minutes and go with your kids (or dog)!
