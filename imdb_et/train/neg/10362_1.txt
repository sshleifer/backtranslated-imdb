Disney? What happened? I really want the film to be set in the 60s as it was. And I could have been dealing with cheap special effects to save the budget for more accurate customization ..... I'm happy that maybe someone can read books ..... but Man can be replaced with red eyes like IT? And what is the volcanic upheaval? Where was this book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there is a European version of this movie. I wish I could recognize it. I can only imagine that it may be closer to the true creation than this poor adaptation. This movie must be X'd.
