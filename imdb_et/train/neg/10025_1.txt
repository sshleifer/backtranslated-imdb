If this is the 2008 product from one of the largest production facilities in the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), then I am afraid we will have the right standards right before. <br /> <br /> With such a length, Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena go wrong with such an enormous constellation, making it much harder to study the film. The film lacks almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. He has few good dialogues to do, but alone can not delight you with immense expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene where the mountain river reaches is very cheap graphics like cartoon. It was also a clear indicator of the director's vision. Any actor who is otherwise an asset of the film is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's good English-language trick is in most cases flat. And Saif hits herself thinking about why she signed this movie. <br /> <br /> IN BRIEF, RESOURCES ARE POSSIBLE AFTER JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM. I would say that even "Time Nachle" was a more enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> Don't understand how and why this script was written and approved. The most undesirable was the backlash of Akshay's love story. After a faulty script, the weakest point of the movie is your music. Vishal Shekhar has given only a few fillers to each song. The songs start very well and suddenly the songs fall sharply. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is good. The opportunity Vishal Shekhar wastes. <br /> <br /> With regard to the intelligence of creator continuity, just try it: Akshay and Saif are on the road in a mountainous area in a foreign country (probably Ladakh). In the next scene, they search for Kareena in Haridwar and then return to Kareena in their car. I still wonder who wrote it. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit down until recently, the climax will be too long, with stupid and unnecessary tricks. You see that all the heroes who walk through the bullet storm are not as painful as God. Are we still seeing the 2008 movie with all these technical heights? So there is no longer a word about this pathetic and humiliating film, but a sincere desire for the higher actors from their fan. <br /> <br /> Dear Mr Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, if possible, ask for your films after the first copy. is off. As an artist of such a reputation, you have a certain responsibility towards your fans and viewers. People are still stuck when you enter your first scene on the screen. I think that such a film should not see the light of day, as it prevents all the image associated with the film, the actors and the production house.
