Back when I was a child and I lived with my sister, she bought every horror film she found, and that was one of them. Video recorders had just become household and we only had about 150 movies and we watched them all in hell. <br /> <br /> I was in the yard the other day and I saw this copy of VHS BLOOD LEGACY and I buy some horror film that I don't have, and I knew this movie seemed familiar. I thought of you and realized that it was what my sister had bought. He had sold it for years in the outdoor sales, which I think - who knows. <br /> <br /> I didn't remember anything about it and I looked at it when I bought it, and it refreshed my memory because it was refreshed in my memory because of some scenes. I'm not sure how I felt it as a child, but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I'd look and enjoy something like that. <br /> <br /> I am a spooky freak, but there are certain requirements that I can consider "good" and that was very short. It was one of those talking talks and carried me to death types. What kind of deaths you see in the scenes, using the shadow of the wall, followed by the blood splatter, and that's when you're lucky to get so much. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I've seen some similar plots so I think it should be buried and forgotten. Don't look at this person if you are not up.
