Celia Johnson is a good sister. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet, although it is his usual ridiculous and glowing and not a patch of his king Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence, although he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good at Tybalt, first in his "yuk" role, making him famous. Christopher Strauli Benvolio is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Sets are beautiful, if not stunning, like some other BBC Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is weak and terrible. Rebecca Saire turned to production at the age of 15 and she has no idea how Juliet works - she opens her eyes wide and spreads every line exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly matched to him and his self-esteem is unexplained. The balcony scene flows smoothly and unententfully with zero emotional or erotic effects. Their death will be a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered them a lesson. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is unthinkable as Mercutio, a big shock when you remember his good work "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks into the mirror image of a Shakespeare verse into a thousand two-or three-word fragments, and then the fragments cry out as loose and unclear as possible. Queen Mab is giving up this production. Awful. <br /> <br /> Director Alvin Rakoff only shows an alternating gift from placing a camera, where it shows us what we want to see. Open hitting is particularly inconsistent. But in a later struggle with humor, Rome is probably kneeling with Tybalt. Then Tybalt grabs the offended area. But did it get through? <br /> <br /> R&J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom or much more.
