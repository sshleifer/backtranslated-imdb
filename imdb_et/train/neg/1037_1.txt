The fact that this bad excuse for an amateur-lesson was announced at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most Indie filmmakers these days. . Just picking up a 16-meter camera and providing it with a line doesn't make a real movie. Second, indie movies should be real people. There's nothing real in this movie. No character touches a person far beyond. <br /> <br /> What they are facing is a writer's imagination, trying to impress their friends by showing them how cool it is and <br /> <br /> Sorry, but that's not good writing or good management. <br /> <br /> What's left is the bad film bark that somehow went to Sundance. It is hard to believe that this was one of the best filmed movies ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it made me loose what remained against the Sundance brand.
