The movie had a lovely opening, I really believed that I was one of the best romantic comedies I've seen for a while ... the way the movie was created, real, but somewhat abstract in the abstract. and mystical. But then the story began to become more unrealistic. Say that the end was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost inaccurate ... The most typical romantic end, where everything goes great for every "pleasant" character. A scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and pursues his "wife of dreams" only to testify to his love for him before a sympathetic crowd. Come on. Finally, "good guys", "bad guys" win ... You get a picture. Potentially interesting movie waste.
