I couldn't believe it. I had a few times rubbing my eyes. Was that true? Yes, there was Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all have some talent, but here were all that basically add Cinemax-style skin flick to the spaceship! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Alien Intruder" is trying to be a unique computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever you want to call him Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrates this type of high-tech virtual reality station on a spacecraft a man is allowed to live his fantasies because the captain of the system (Williams) is reviewing it. <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but here it all looks like a well-cushioned episode of "red shoes diaries". Williams moves everything to the right and left and looks like he'd do something else. Ah, the things people make for money ... <br /> <br /> FX is quite static, maybe even smaller than what you expect from a direct video reader. Unfortunately, even female nakedness is less than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is a real star here, and of course it gets all the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie that is awkward and has no brain, check out "Alien Intruder". Of course, you probably have to look at Cinemax in the morning at 2 or 3. <br /> <br /> No letters, not even for the power of the star that this flick can collect. <br /> <br /> Leave it in the room.
