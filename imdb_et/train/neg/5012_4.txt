I watched this movie because Amber Benson's rocks and Nick Stahl are generally pretty cool - I thought all the films with two actors and I wouldn't all be bad. And in this sense, I was right - given that they gave a worrying dialogue, both work relatively well. Not well enough to stop the film from sucking the film, but well enough that I was able to make the movie in 75-minute minutes (and that is the main sign of the terrible movie if after 40 minutes you have already prayed for its ending). <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start with "Taboo". The dialogue, as mentioned, is terrible; wood and completely unnatural. January's Jones behavior is incredibly bad, and because he's the character we spend most of the time around the house, it's an unforgivable mistake. The plot succeeds to be so complicated that it makes no sense at the same time to have a clich√© to be completely predictable (literally, no one in this film will surprise anyone except a toddler). Some interesting shots are left aside, the director tries too little success, uncomfortable tracking shots and nervous camera work that disturbs what is a bit of a story. <br /> <br /> Three movie stars have three for Amber Benson, and the latter is thrown out because one of the jokes made me a little sniper. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, ever, in any case. Avoid at all costs.
