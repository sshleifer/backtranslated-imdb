Jim Belush has a life crisis in the middle, nothing goes right when his car goes out with him ... goes to an empty bar where Michael Caine shows him what life would have been if one high school event had come out differently. Good assumption in a few moments, but mostly flat and uninteresting. on a scale from 1 to 10..3
