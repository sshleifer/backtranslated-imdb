Having heard so many people robbing about this movie, I thought I'd give it up. In addition to an incredibly slow situation, which I do not mind if you expect it to be worth it, but it just isn't. As many others have said, there are so many contradictions and so much of this movie just isn't talking. The reaction of the four men responds to shock, horror, to find the body in complete indifference when they try. Certainly, if they were the type of men who would try to catch happily, they would have just announced their body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip. and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days earlier? It's so hard to watch the movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the city people, you think at least one of them can show curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked, except knives, what scenario will it bring? If he was raped then why are they still knickers? If he was raped with clothes, why then remove them? If he is not raped, why not take all the clothes off the buttons, leaving himself proof? I really don't think of some realistic scenarios that would make someone kill their clothes so you can fill your jumble sales kiosk! Oh well traced, but only fair, and only because of the bad script, it is strong.
