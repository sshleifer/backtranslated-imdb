The fan of Buster Keaton is that your heart breaks down regularly. For the first time, most of us meet Keaton with their excellent independent production, which is great: "The General", "Navigator", "Sherlock Jnr". We know him as the greatest figure in the history of comedy film and we want to see more of his films. Here begins a heartache. After "Steamboat Bill Jnr", Keaton's brother-in-law Joseph Schenck forced him to sign a treaty that brought Keaton under control of MGM. Keaton became another tenant for the tenant who executes scripts. Then his alcoholism worsened. After "Steamboat Bill Jnr", Keaton never produced a truly premium film. A couple of sources describe one masterpiece of comedy that Keaton claimed to have almost finished MGM's "Grand Hotel" parody. Biographer Tom Dardis has provided convincing evidence that Keaton made this story. <br /> <br /> Heartache increases as Keaton's many years of continuous downfall just went out of time for a good movie ... his short comedy "Grand Slam Opera". I am still looking for a lost scene from Keaton's dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy, "It's Mad Mad World", a series where the shrunken policeman Tracy calls the old retired devil (Keaton) and tries to refresh his aid by stealing Smiler Grogan cash. This footage is almost certainly gone forever, but I still look. <br /> <br /> "Talk Easy" is unfortunately one of Keaton's films since the beginning of his fall. MGM tried to build Jimmy Durante (who accidentally played Smiler Grogan three years later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to build Durante by connecting him to Keaton, whose comedy style was simply incompatible with Durante. (I'm a fan of both.) Throughout his career, Durante was a ruthless scene-stealer: he was proud to know he was built at Keaton's expense, and Keaton was the only co-star with whom Durante never tried <br /> > Keaton was often the victim of extremely cruel machinations. In 'Speak Easily' he plays a didactic and humorous Midwestern College professor named Post (because he is both wooden and one) who receives a letter informing him that he has inherited $ 750,000 he has to claim in New York. Does he call for confirmation? Does he even check the postage stamp? No; he takes his life savings out of the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he has gone out, the Post's servant admits that he wrote (fake) a letter out of his routine to Professor Post! <br /> <br /> The postman, who thinks he is a 3/4 millionaire, crosses Jimmyga Dodge (Durante), who is trying to produce a musical revue but has no money. The characters that these two brilliant comedians play on the screen cannot touch each other. Keaton plays one of those egg tips (like Mister Logic 'Viz') who does everything intellectually. Durante plays one of these irritating hepativities who are unable to make direct statements because the script always requires him to speak in slang. There's a painfully failed dialogue where Durante tries to talk to Keaton with money, but instead of getting out straight, Durante needs to use increasingly prominent slang terms like "kale", "cartwheels" and so on ... Keaton has no idea what Durante is. I give Keaton credit: her own dry and dusty prairie voice, her flat Kansas accent, is absolutely perfect for the character she plays here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, looking much simpler and more beautiful than her only a year later, is impressive as the inspiring leader who is supervised by Professor Post (on the cross). Henry Armetta, who I have never been funny, is less funny here than usual, offering a running fool. Thelma Todd put me here in an impressive role in the impressive role he played in horse feathers (a much more fun film). One of my favorite actresses, Edward Brophy, is wasted. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem with 'Speak Easily' is that supportive characters behave in a totally inappropriate way. Keaton's lawyer will appear at the Durante Theater in Keaton with an urgent message ... but he is not there, so the lawyer will continue to disclose Keaton's personal business to the first, all of his strangers. (Shoot this lawyer, Buster!) In the second scene, Professor Post, a man who is perceived as bankrupt by this music, picks up the choir's girls' locker room, and all the girls in the choir immediately get up and cover themselves. I know that * contemporary * choir girls would not respond in this way, and I seriously doubt that the choir girls in 1932 behaved so ... definitely not in response to the "angel" who controlled the eruption of these exhibitions. <Br>> <br /> SPOILERS. About half an hour of endless "Speak Easily", big Jimmy Durante will sit on the piano, step into the camera and make a special small shake with his head as he starts to ring. This is the moment when I thought that finally this movie finally started to entertain our entertaining purpose. Down, no. The most annoying is the end of the film that uses one of the toughest and most unlikely clich√©s in all comedy: the one where a totally incompetent dimwit becomes a star comic through its own intuition. (Keaton would be forced to play this clip again in the 1955 "Screen Director Playhouse" episode, Chaplin had already used it in "Circus".) <br /> <br /> I almost cried - anger and sadness - "Tell me just" wasted opportunities. For the most part, respecting the work Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere, I appreciate this movie in 2 out of 10 points. <br /> <br />
