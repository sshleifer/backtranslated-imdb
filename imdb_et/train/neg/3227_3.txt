It has turned out to be the notorious Guinea pig series. A short-lived Japanese TV show that was canceled after the psychopath acknowledged it was inspired by the killing of a young schoolgirl. Such a short series, like all the other films in the series, is practically without a story. A group of boys have tried a young woman. They bind her down and continue her death with torture. They beat him, poured boiling oil on him, used him with tongs and finally, in the "loving" close, push the needle through his eye. It's the easiest of all Guinea pig movies and one of the first. It was probably this movie, more than any other that gave the guinea pig a rumor about sniffing. They inspired Nicolas Cage's film "8mm." These films have become quite popular in horror circles. They have evolved into more polished but equally graphic films like "Naked Blood". They are likely to fill the gap left by Mondo's films, which has been slightly cleaned up and became a reality TV. Not recommended, but apparently tempting those who see something once, and do not know why after that I know.
