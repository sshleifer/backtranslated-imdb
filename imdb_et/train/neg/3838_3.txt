Terry West had a good idea about this movie. He just didn't go through it. There are endless shots of the exterior surfaces of a scary school that will continue forever and probably the driving time of the film. There are only 2 students in this school. Misty Mundae is good as usual, but this film always belongs to Ruby LaRocca (the only reason to watch the movie at the beginning). If the script focuses on its interesting character, we would be watching the movie. He's so GORGEOUS! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and better) movie "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie seems to be someone who is not good when the punch line is at the end of a long joke, because the end feeling is the same. Again, look at Ruby LaRocca.
