The original "les visiteurs" was original, fun, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "The really bad stage in a really good movie". In LV2 everyone screams if the gag doesn't work first, it is repeated 5 more times with some vague hope that it will finally become funny. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except, of course, that the parody should be inventive. If you love LV1 just don't see this movie, check out LV1 again!
