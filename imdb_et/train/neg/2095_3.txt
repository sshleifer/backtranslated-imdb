Battlestar Gallactica was so big because she had tight writing, great looks, great actors and interesting stories ... AND yes, they had hot men and women running and even out. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. Smokers with a storm show them "character". External sequences that destroy the feeling somewhere else (yes, this is the Ford Focus that sits in the background). A lot and lots of teens. A lot of naked women (but in the background. What's definitely cut for the series) and a symbolic view of some towel men. Except for Polly Walker, no actress took any attention at all. One and a half hours I was still thinking about going over. <br /> <br /> What exactly should this bring me back? Scientific literature? It is terribly easy. Actors? Polly Walker's fine move is not very interesting here. The cast is not even "hotties", except maybe Esai, although for the younger he is quite old as he is over 25. <br /> <br /> I loved the BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica and unfortunately I think I'm right. I predict this is a very short time when they really focus their pencils on SciF and can do the job by doing more than the OC on the other planet.
