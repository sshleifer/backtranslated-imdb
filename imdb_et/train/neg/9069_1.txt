(David H. Steinberg's) script initially seemed to be some real smart points that could have made a good romantic comedy, but HOW, but, dear! What ever happened ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened. Originally (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it was a long time ago, but they are pioneers, the godfather of the new genre: raw teen comedy. Then came the 1990s. Following the important cases that became a repulsive (I add), such as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996), and (There's something Mary - 1998), what I think slackers are influenced by the peak of the era and the prophet of the next era, the only one: (American Pie - 1999), which is undoubtedly an icon of the genre. After that, I think every such comedy got so dirty, cum laude from the nonsense that the young people would admire it, otherwise it could be out of fashion! <br /> <br /> I believe that (Slacker) was a smart plot first as a script, but its creators were able to add a real big amount: rude, dirty, strangely shameless sex - these days - as easy as pie! As they had to fill each scene freely with an element like: masturbation, oral sex, urination, etc. They are elements of the story that are totally unnecessary, but they are certainly so useful to make a profit and catch the latest fashionable teen comedies. The problem is how it all has replaced a possible comedy in it. <br /> <br /> Some of its moments were literally horrible and, as you can see, is a point. All of this is (Jason Schwartzman's) appearance and performance; unforgettably awkward. So, the ambition that changed from this romantic comedy, changing what was not done before the pictures of pure skinning. To be more like a horror where you always ask; what nastier would it be? (vomiting, folding, etc ..); they are the easiest combination to create contemporary comedy. <br /> <br /> Even though you hated it, you have to love something (mostly bold), but for me it was just Gina Gershon's heady scene. In any case, they shaped it as a whole to get angry, like the naughty dream of adolescents. Although most of it was near someone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What made me sad was that it was his real potential job and not another cheap, another stupid comedy because it finally succeeded. Also remember the details of the exam stealing (the first 2 minutes), so the main plot of the movie (weird who is trying to get the girl out, the boy loves the girl and the girl loves the other boy) because it's recorded, it's nothing but honest. It dealt with the sticky way of this material, how nothing would be done, but who did nothing but doing something delicious. It ended, and I'm sorry to say this, smiling sh * t! <br /> <br /> Finally, he said something (can you imagine) about how it is time and place for an impostor or victory to win, like this comedy itself. It sounds good to the end for another better movie; which could confirm my opinion that it is smart. And that doesn't make much sense that the makers of this movie were real blasters! Perhaps it is stupid to be wise in Hollywood, but even when ... The end result here was not at all meaningful in terms of the word. <br /> <br /> PS: His scriptwriter (David H. Steinberg), who also wrote (American Pie 2), is also on IMDb's main page for more information. his usual "Plot Keywords" that are: Sex / Vulgarity / Crude Humor / ... They just forgot to write urination in the shower or Baring for 70-year-old women!
