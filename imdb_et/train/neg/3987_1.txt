I've walked out of very few movies before they ended, but I couldn't finish this garbage. It was the greatest burden of racism, which tried to be transferred from legal birth to a legal film. The characters were a little more than cut out of cardboard. I don't see how any participant wants to associate their name with this movie. Lee must have better things that put out such garbage. I know that I and everyone with the brain have better things .... like drying the color. I want someone to make a movie about interactive relationships that dealt with the topic in real terms. It's a lot deeper than the bitter director like Lee.
