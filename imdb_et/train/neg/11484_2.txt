Is it just me or is this boy really annoying? <br /> <br /> Sister Hideos spend most of her time with little and so on disobedient. As for her, I know she's a boy, but her ability to act is the same as a dead tree. So far I am just half way and the story is fascinating, but the people in it are letting it go, I hope it will finally get better because I don't know what it is all about. While some supposedly encrypted messages on the wall and laptop indicate that everything is upside down, that is, the dog is God, there is evil in life, and so on. It just seems a little obvious at the moment, but nobody mentions its obvious meaning, but while my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I update this post, but if you read it, well ...... See the statement above.
