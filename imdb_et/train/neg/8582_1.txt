This film is a plenary plenary for Sheffield's unemployed men who is fake. <br /> <br /> As someone born in Sheffield and still linked to the city, I was very disappointed. this movie. Someone said it could have been in Oklahoma and that almost that amount is for me. It seemed like a romantic view of the UK market in North England. Probably many Americans - and many people in southern England - do not feel that Sheffield is a big city with about half a million inhabitants, with a complex urban culture. The giants depicted it as a terrible semi-rural area where all the Sheffield people seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub and where the idea of ​​a party from the party danced in a village hall. It was a small, close community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> Sheffield men were completely different from their real counterparts, who are generally silent and interacting with each other in the ground and briefly making dry remarks. They do not speak and they certainly do not sing in choirs. <br /> <br /> Even rural areas, allegedly in the Peak region, saw strangers for me. I felt a couple of places where I watched the hike, but some balloons from the pilot that stretched over the dark landscape reminded me more of Wales. Finally, in the credits at the end, I pointed to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is in the summer with cyclists and tourists in the car. It lies between two big cities. It's not a kind of desert. <br /> <br /> With regard to the idea that a young woman may fall in love and lust, Pete Postlethwaite, which was ridiculous, could have been just a men's dream. His reasons for becoming his lover were never obvious. None of the men showed that he had a partner or family; they were in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a movie about the unemployed Sheffielder would be wrong. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of his middle-class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a giant fake! <br /> <br />
