Really. In any week, does Oprah remind us that he was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> He puts himself in the focus of every interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can't comment on the answer to any question he asks. He often interrupts visitors before the answer is complete to leave him or an anecdote. Directors are obviously advised to focus on their neighborhood, not on the visitor's face, because that is what Oprah reads Oprah says. Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says - Excuse me, I was so poor. Know your battle pain with my weight. Know your hurt when I have already put it out of a closed shop. You feel good about buying your magazines and books. Feel good for your success. Feel good when you give me a charity to look good. Feel good to make me incredibly enriched. <br /> <br /> My understanding of his point of view: You see that you are all heartbreaking and you have my daily advice. I have all the answers to your life, although I have nothing to do with you plebes. I've never been married or want to be. I've never had to raise a family - but I know all this. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer others, like myself, others - witness "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend but we are not gay. <br /> <br /> Since 7.31.2006, his website's title is actually as follows: "Oprah.com is your leading source of information on love, life, yourself, relationships, food, home, spirit and health." How is it expected and unpleasant ? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, he collapsed two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to collect material for his September 2006 exhibition. He promises to give up the TV, but his yapfest pulls out of sight. <br /> <br /> Unlike what he thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess, nor a personal mission of God. She is just one very happy, overweight, black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it herself. She happened in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck into the right demographic. <br /> <br /> Oprah is P.T. This age Barnum and it amazes me that people don't see through their facade. So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you also Oprah, if you can install this pumped ego through the door - this is the way to a great exit ...
