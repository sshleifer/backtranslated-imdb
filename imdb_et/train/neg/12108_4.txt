Just had to write that one lining, but it's really. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry in recent years. I have praise for all the participants except the most important, script. This is a weak criminal story. No amount of fine-acting or black-and-white films can compensate for the complete lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he makes another movie overall. My advice is not to waste your time.
