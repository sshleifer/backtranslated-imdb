As much as I don't like to say "too much to me" in response to other comments - it's absolutely true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have nothing to do with an endless end that includes the following 90. <br /> <br /> It's forbidden to watch a movie anywhere . Just because it is not similar to a Hollywood product, it does not make it reliable. <br /> <br /> Even worse, besides not having a noticeable plot (except in Russia and many people even have a muddy place, even very old women, drinking a lot of vodka), several visuals are so unnecessarily naive that I am my own to another Rolaid package. <br /> <br /> As with spoilers, the movie is not a narrative thread I couldn't write when I tried. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money and don't mix it against a good Russian cinema.
