a movie that tries to be much smarter than its makers are capable of producing. The movie's twists and turns "surprises" in a desperate attempt to put the audience into the mind of an offshore "plot" of steaming scenes they thought it would help. <br /> <br /> This pseudo-intellectual experiment and just sleep walks through the movie. the same applies to other "participants". The plot is pretty stupid and sticky. If this is not such a crime in itself, but ultimately, huge plots get very tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> The film still has some interest in the middle. worth the lazy clock really boring day, but don't worry if you forget it. <br /> <br /> Pretty Flat 4!
