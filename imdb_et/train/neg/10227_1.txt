This is a well-worn story of a man who marries out of a nickel's arrow, and then puts his disgusting bride into a "tame". At the same time, he succeeds in being sexist and racist. We will never know, for example, why a woman who won respect for an Indian warrior cannot fully fight her former husband. Or why his team members are so eager to get a "real man" into the saddle when he seems to have taken care of things. It was only reasonable in the fifties of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There's a really silly scene where she hugs her, and she's really trying to whip - second time - and then she shifts her horse. Do not forget that for the first time it would probably have lost its eye, which would be hard to grasp with this whip! Then he reigns against his Indian bodyguard, where he spends the first two thirds of being beaten. This is the second wind. Later he successfully negotiated with some bloodthirsty Indians (because they are all in these clips) after they have rejected him. Don't forget that he has zero diplomatic skills and has been negotiating with them for years. And how he rejects his attempts to attract him just to keep him enthusiastic and to keep him from holding him - yes, right. Like women, they just throw themselves down all the way. <br /> <br /> Finally, neither of them is convincing in their roles. Madison is just a jerk who is unreally happy. Fleming pulls her hair and strokes a lot but is absolutely convincing as a fiery tomboy. The only reason you drunk for him is that you want to see that Madison is tied to a runaway horse and dragged on the rock before the end of the movie. The way Madison dances with Fleming is so predictable and there are so few obstacles that it irritates the devil when you see women as something other than breaking necks. Even if you see them as dolls, you are suffering from a lack of full load. <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Even the landscape is boring. Give it one big drawback.
