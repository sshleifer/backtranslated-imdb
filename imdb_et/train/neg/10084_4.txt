This movie was okay, but it certainly loses the claim that homosexuals are "so born", especially if a woman can get out of the marriage and just fall into the hands of another woman. It almost seems that Kate's gender preferences are turned on and off like a switch, so this movie seems a bit simplified. <br /> <br /> As is common with films that try to put on the agenda, it was regrettable that the characters of the film that had questions or condemned the gay lifestyle were labeled "bigots". And there was no happy media there. It was either Kate's friends and relatives who totally embraced him or they shouted him completely. This is not typical of interactions between gays and non-gay relatives and friends. Usually it is a mixture of emotions and values ​​that play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect but not necessarily the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film did not show this type of interaction. A movie that tries to portray tolerance and acceptance has hit me a very intolerable movie! Finally, after all these years, Kate decides to want to be a Mac and everything is hunky dory - is that really gay? Come on!
