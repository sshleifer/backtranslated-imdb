Well, let me start by saying how HILARIOUS this movie is completely, I just couldn't laugh at this smile. Don't do it wrong, it has worked well especially for Bassinger, but the script is fair, glad to break really. <br /> <br /> The assumption is good and until Della actually knows the murder he is doing, but after that it goes down. On the side of the movie, the protagonist pulls out his toolbox and, of course, instead of letting the boy head on, he decides to pull a screwdriver, a car socket and finally a burn (like a sinking boat) to kill his victims <br /> <br /> Then there is the last line what I promise, if you don't have seams, then I eat my left leg. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those who just want to laugh with some good old-fashioned and terrible movies. Maybe I would advise you to look at the scene in the mine yard, where a man falls from a high-pitched wooden table, every time I get it.
