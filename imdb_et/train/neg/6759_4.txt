Another decent DVD cover that bets on the quality of movie footage. <br /> <br /> It wasn't so bad. Rochon works and fucking! cast is good looking. I've never seen many muscle dogs guys together on a regular basis. This movie really wanted you to think Rochon was a killer, but it wasn't. My biggest problem with the film was that at last I didn't care about who was the killer, and the real killer didn't think because it was out of blue and the filmmakers thought, "ha, butcha wasn't seeing one coming, sucker!" , there were errors of continuity (mostly with Ms. Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but it is not so bad for the indian. I was pretty sure at first that the girls had just a thin veiled apology to go topless, but that was just a trick. was sometimes too thoughtful and painful. <br /> <br /> Just here, there is no big expectation and it is not so bad, and Lloyd Kaufman's home is remarkably undervalued.
