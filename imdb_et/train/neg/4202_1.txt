... I've lost something here ??? "unexpected plot development"? "Plot Wrong with Hollow Hell"? are these viewers looking at the same Arquette vehicle I just got myself (now obviously a sub-un) conscious BDO ... ... just joined this site just to make sure no one else is renting this stinker. .. this movie was embarrassing for every person involved ... a quick question: did Sir Stevie read the script before giving thumbs to Kate C? if so, it must be the same as Spielberg, who "howard the duck" to green light ... does not give me this, "it was a hit game" nonsense - I think Mssr. Reddin is not too happy ... The DVD cover promised a "surprising angle" and a "twisted story ..." story! This is such a mess that old Bobby McKee and his exclusive structural bands like genius ... Sundance ?? I have a home video of folding my cat, which is more of an interest than Arquette's imaginary loss of a negative dimension ... and talk of deux ex machin to Mr. Stanley T; Thank God, just when he thought he had Dave to call the police! and thank you shiva that the police had just hit a real killer ... what !!! up to the credit I was still expecting to have some sort of grift against Arquette, and his "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs Spielberg, you can't get unharmed: what the hell was the kitchen where "athlete's foot on my foot "gag ??? are you in this or worse situation? I dunno ... hey movie lovers: why don't you make it a blocking night and rent it with "jersey girl" and "white chicks" and then smith (or seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you.
