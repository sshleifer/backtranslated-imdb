I like British humor, I believe it is one of the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some jokes were big, but some of them didn't understand.) But this gentleman is good to get you sick. This exhibition was in some way good; it helped me lose some weight because I look at this garbage so I feel like I'm no longer hungry. It's really just a nasty, sick and not even funny TV show and I don't know who actually laughs. I looked at it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so nasty looking at the men dressed with a woman with yellow teeth and urinating in the car ... I mean ... what's so funny? It makes me want. No humor, just pictures and cheap, toilet laughs ... I don't know ... if you like this stuff ... you go ahead ... look at it ... but honestly, people watch and enjoy it must have some emotional problems. Garbage.
