It must be one of the worst directions I've seen. A close-up may be a very powerful shot, but if each scene is made up of close-ups, it will lose its full effect. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some very beautiful landscapes to work with Mexican backgrounds, cantinates, the beautiful place where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty cities Costner roll out for revenge. Unfortunately, we only caught these places quickly before the camera cuts the image of a large, giant head. Even the transition scenes where Costner is flying all over Mexico are fast approaching. <br /> <br /> The result is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been much better. Among other things, too many people come out to help Costner - it's just a bad writing. <br /> <br /> This is a typical thriller story, but many others have made the same assumptions and made outstanding things. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar story, but it was a much better film. The end result was completely anti-cyclical and suffers from the most melodic score of the film. This film was never great, but if we saw more Mexican and less gigantic heads, this film would have been traceable.
