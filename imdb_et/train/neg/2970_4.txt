I'm back to Batman's movie and TV fan. I loved this example (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this film is not as big as some people hoped for. In my opinion, this is a great suppression. I think the problem was that he had no drama. Batman: The Phantasm Mask and Batman Beyond: The joker's return was a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had a drama. I also think this film comes to Batman. The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane at the end. Anyway, this is the branch of Batman's movie. But I just rent it.
