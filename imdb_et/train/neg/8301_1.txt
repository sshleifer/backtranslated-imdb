Really bad. Why does anyone think this is a good movie, let alone a funny secret. I like comedies as much as the next man and I loved the "Christmas story". The fact that he has the same director, based on the same writer's memories, is completely puzzled by why this film is a complete failure. Charles Grodin has been disgracefully unsuccessful for his beginners. On the other hand, it doesn't look the same - it just doesn't flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that passed through the first movie is completely missing here - you just want to finish the movie. I don't even recommend this film to the curiosity of those who enjoyed the "Christmas story". It's so bad. 1/10.
