Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have deeply influenced my life as a Christian, and I was looking forward to seeing this film and learning more about my life. Words can't barely express. This film was divorced ... it didn't give any background to his life, not to the historical context, nor to any of his great writings (except for the brief pass by a colleague at the beginning of the film). Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (probably in the countries) and cooling down with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany. Obviously show your human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. Part of where he stands for his faith. Instead of emphasizing this, we get very poorly with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether it really happened or not, it shouldn't be a big part of the movie. Now ... is still waiting for a dramatic part or story that explains what his writings were ... or SOMETHING to tell us about the size of this man. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. It's a movie that gives a bad name to Christian movies. All they had to do was build up the film's structure so that it could follow, with some backgrounds ... even some voice commands or setbacks to her preaching her works ... some narrative about who she was and where she was. But no ... it's what we got. Faith hero hardly fits.
