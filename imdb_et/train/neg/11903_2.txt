Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel. I don't know how he came with this movie! The idea of ​​giving a situation after spt11 and the view of the American Society is promising, making it 2 out of 10. But this is not a movie. It is that the best one can make a great idea (a western clash) in the Middle East, there are important things and it is just released on a MAC * screen with fingers of an American girl who is actually stupid (because he is unaware of the facts). is not well formed.And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.At the end of the scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.And the background music says, "... I pray." . But it comes to it. How do you see the truth when you just close your eyes and pray. The lights already seem to be the truth. It's just that no one wants to see it. ps: "My home is not a place. It's people" The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is this sentence. (by the way, as "someone" mentioned below, America's best youngsters are not the best, they are just "poor" and "hopeless" individuals signing up for an army that needs good fees not offered by the government!)
