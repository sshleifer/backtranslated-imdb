This is a bad B movie that masks the mockumentary. The film's filmmaker has almost the same amount of screen time and dialogue as any other character. It completely destroyed all the "documentary feelings" they could create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the movie is not really a mockumentary is the least problem. The movie is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film has nothing to understand about pornography. It is not even particularly pleasant. Although there is a simulated gender, the amount of nudity in a film R is light. <br /> <br /> One day, someone makes a good industrial design for the porn industry. That's not the case.
