I have to say that the first thing I was watching this movie about 6 years ago, and I really enjoyed it. I bought a DVD recently and when I was second I was wondering why I liked it. The action was terrible and, as usual, their fake costumes are stereo-typical clans. Action was at best terrible. Tim Roth did OK work like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> The plot line was good but filling was poor. I'm tired of seeing such movies in Scotland. However, Braveheart was even worse, which is only the films that save grace. But seriously, people didn't talk on such days, why do all actors have Glaswegian accents? Just another movie that tries to catch already tired and annoying stereotypes. I note that the only people living here who say that this movie is good are Americans and, frankly, I see why they want it, I know they have a fervent man in Kilts. However, if you think about buying a DVD, I would say that I spend my money on another, for example, a better film.
