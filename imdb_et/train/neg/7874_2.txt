In some ways, time corridors are a success story because the film achieves its goal: it is seen by thousands. But it doesn't make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs has been a success because the subject was the original way of weighing pastimes: forget Zemeckis back In the future, the old France, the medieval knight and its almost barbaric way of life will come here. Perfect pride, funny thanks to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel. <br /> <br /> Nobody had anticipated the great success of Les Visiteurs. As a film expert, one cannot understand that time corridors are made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs and immediately attempts to justify the follow-up paradox that would have needed the other. Explanation: the jewelry that Jacquouille has stolen; don't you remember the nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Jewelery ... And this is just one of many holes that Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the characters: Montmirail doesn't change, it's a bit more boring. About Frenegonde ... this is another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to continue in this aftermath to avoid encouraging Bourgeoise. And Muriel Robin was trying to imitate him so I found it so pathetic that I felt pain. And Poiré doesn't understand that humorous pain is not enough to make good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget the time-lapse, digital effects, focus on the story and see it The postage stamp has enough space to write it down 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest in this film is landscapes. Movie for young people, say up to 13 years old.
