I'm still trying to figure out if there is a point on this film. <br /> <br /> For content that should be "rebellious" and "controversial", things shared by Maddox students are terribly flat. Pupils seem to be easily afflicted with vague authoritarian feelings and sections of words that are illegally scanned on leaflets. Rebel, all. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been too much to ask us to have a teen rebellion film where the school's fire alarm does not go down. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the "big fight on football pitches" is a fight that consists of two people. <br /> <br /> Character personalities appear randomly special. The football player who fought against Maddox (and who later got on the face) is smiling the next day and apologizes. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is not the end of the actual result makes me feel that the whole thing could have been installed half an hour after the special school. If they had cut most of the pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
