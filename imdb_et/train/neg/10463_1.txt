This film had so many promises. I was very excited about this movie. Eventually, it was ridiculous, at worst, painful. Real styles really did run, flat (angels, wife and daughter) over animation (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was simply an attempt to convey information to the audience, not to the real people who tried to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the scene of "error". It's pretty much offensive to the audience's abilities to think things out. Protecting this scene, she got the biggest laugh of the film. I had read that they spent a lot of money to travel to different overseas countries. Too bad they didn't use it. I didn't feel like I was taken to exotic places. Anyone can add a Colosseum to Rome. To finish the positive note, I thought the kits were pretty good. I really liked the graphics displayed on the decoding computers. This is my opinion (and all this is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor had been much smaller and the ACTION factor had increased significantly, this film would have been good.
