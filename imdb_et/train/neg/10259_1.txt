I saw it in a movie theater when I was a kid, and I always remember it as my first experience when I got a terrifying movie of good trade. The advertising was great, but later I learned that he had all the explosions or "special effects" on the film (about 4) and even some that were not in the movie. There was a plot of land with foreigners, but foreigners were never shown in the movie as far as I can remember. It was obviously a case where someone made a cheap movie for people who scam. I think the world of my innocence ended that day when I found out there were bad people doing bad bad movies.
