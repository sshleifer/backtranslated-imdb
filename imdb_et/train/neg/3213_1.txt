Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time I have seen a film that did not have literally meat or potatoes. The whole movie seemed like it was just a secret without the core. The story was flawless and ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out of the window and the animation was made for four-year-olds. Does it cover? I have never been tortured for the rest of my life. I've never read a comic book or seen other programs of its nature, but I've not started looking at other reviews. <br /> <br /> To get started, the track too fast. Someone who is new to this character and situations needed more solutions to create the causes. I've seen other Anime (if you could call it Anime), doing great things with your characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing for Lady Death to do. For some short scenes, we can see his train with Cremator, and it will immediately become the aggressive beast of hell. It was hard for me to swallow in the moments before she was a weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly he is hated and able to make the battle with millions of years of existence. It was absurd. Lady Death's presentation was a little poor. I felt like she was more than an animated character instead of a desperate desperate woman. For me it just doesn't work. He was more than eye candy for predisposed boys who suddenly wanted to increase the amount of skin he suddenly grew on his chest when he practiced with Cremator. Oh, I just felt sick looking at her. The same applies to the nature of the Kremator. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough and instead I was confused rather than real development. It is a very sad day in hell when we give up the signs to show more violence and action, especially in the animated function. <br /> <br /> Then Lucifer was himself. Let me just say that I think I can fight against the king of hell and live. She was weak, her voice was ridiculous, and she just didn't represent the image I had. Just like Disney was in control and wanted to put him on a computer. He had no darkness and no corrupt character that Lucifer embodied. He was not the ruler of hell but simply a shortage that had a greater place to live. Speaking of living or death, how do you die in hell again? It was a concept that definitely needs more explanation. Most of the characters were worried about death if they didn't even consider the possibility that they were already dead. So they went to hell. I think this was the level of thinking that destroyed my movie. I didn't think quite well that your soul was still in a strong body in hell, but it may be just me? or maybe it was because there was no development in this story. Nothing was built but prepared. <br /> <br /> Battle sequences were hysterically bad. This cartoon animation seemed to have been done in the early 90s. This movie was not impressive. Why are we behind America's animation? In Asia, it is huge, and here it is hard, because we continue to make films like Lady Death that do not dispute or use any imagination. We are cheap and this movie shows it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad. Animation with a terrifying voice was cheap. I had a head somewhere to make this movie as a production for a long time, which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this movie on my credit card. Production was both terrible and a story. Nothing was developed, leaving tremendous open plot holes that almost all fell. The strength of the characters was missing and nothing was explained. I wasted my time with this time and would like to warn others that if death does not come, you will not find my country and regret the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this garbage. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off *****
