but Thomas Ian Griffith just doesn't have the bolt that the big bucks actor has given, it was done 5+ years ago. Some humorous features could have been timed to make it not just for action, but for comedy. And how do you get KC Katia from Koslovsk? Plummer's character was so funny, he would be better adapted to the bull. Personally, if incandescent lamps show skin - I would have liked to see a woman / male equal time, otherwise they will not be shown.
