I watched this movie in the morning at 3 o'clock, which is the time when I'm usually very open for movies. But still I think it wasn't good, this movie wasn't good at all. Reasons why there are many. <br /> <br /> Action is not so good and occasionally reminiscent of the 90's poor Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come on, like the situation with handcuffs and the situation of poker among servants ... This movie was so obviously very first and it's OK. But if I hadn't seen it before I saw it, it would be even worse. Like the end, it came very suddenly, and I felt that you didn't have any closure that ever was ... Sebastian changed very suddenly and this movie seems to have been made just to explain no. 1, and as no time or effort. something else is good. The result is the same as the first, and it didn't feel the movie at all ... <br /> <br /> They should have dealt with situations more in style and class, but they weren't, and therefore this movie showed bad ...
