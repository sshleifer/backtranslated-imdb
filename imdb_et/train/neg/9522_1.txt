Wow! I remember so many terrible films that turned from the early 1980s around high school. Usually they had a somewhat tight plot and many 27-year-old actresses who made the students. While watching this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia in the 1980s. But do I know that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends there, it's just bad. There is a city on the plot that is preparing to close high school and threatens all students in the high school high school. What is strange because the students in this school are both rich and wealthy. In fact, the main character lives in the manor. Thinking about how they can't keep this school alive, have they ever heard of real estate taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they keep the school alive when students can raise $ 200,000. So retirees will do so. Hmmm, you brought $ 200,000, but instead of saving it for college, you put it to a high school to be older? And why would they precisely close the overcrowded school before the end of the year? And ... forget about it, this movie was stupid and done in 1989!
