I saw this movie in Flix after timer recording. I grew up looking at F Troop and I had a hard time for Wrangler Jane, so I was shocked, literally shocked to find out after that movie that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson, who looks pretty good, but also looks quite good different and completely different. poorly photographed. I would never have thought it was his million years. What the hell is he doing in such a picture? I agree with the boys here that the film lacks what it pushes. No sex, no gore, no bullying. It is also a remake of Atomic Brain or Monstrosity (1964). Most activities are annoying; The main character spends a huge amount of time running around the house and basement of a crazy doctor and generally in the neighborhood, or tightened by the police, it's all boring and time-consuming. Now that the Italians would have done this, half of the film would have been a bunch of unconscious naked girls from Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam. But you get it for just 20 seconds.
