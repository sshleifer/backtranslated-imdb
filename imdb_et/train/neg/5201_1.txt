The story has been seen before, but it doesn't matter if you understand the right scenario. It is clear that the director has not used his work in the writing block. In addition, the cameraman spent too much time on angles that did not match the film's message. More fun, however, when you watch a movie website, you can read that the director has decided to make a movie with bad angles. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I've never heard of a bad camera corner hunting ;-) It has 1 star because the story is OK. I'm sorry Ti Ti didn't look through her story. Just as the film would be more important than planning. Because you have a camera, it doesn't mean you should make a movie right now ... come on. Everyone can make a movie, but not everyone is as good. So the advisory word for Ti West is to stop and mark what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down to the storyboard. You definitely have the ability and desire - so don't abuse your talent.
