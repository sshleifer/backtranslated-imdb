Del - "You are the most stupid person I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it by rewriting." <br /> <br /> I think that Asimov's work on this bastard is that Susan Calvin's character is depicted. In books, he was actually one of the first strong female protagonists to think through the problem. Here he is just in trouble, waiting for Wil Smith to be rescued. <br /> <br /> There are references to Asimov's robotics laws, but they are descendants of CGI and action stages. <br /> <br /> Smith is pleasant because she is in most of her movies, but to be honest, this story is not so good. You'll get it a long time before making these geniuses.
