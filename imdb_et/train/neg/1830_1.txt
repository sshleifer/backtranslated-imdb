this is the worst film I've ever seen. I'm not kidding. the next time it is turned on, I keep running my head wall. I'd be more enjoyable to sit in the emergency room, trying to explain to the doctor why my brain is swollen when trying to re-conduct this movie. this project again bad. they are both good comedies, so I was shocked that it was so uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> If they had to do it again, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't. the people who foretold the money must have lost a ton. not really - because special effects (all 2 of them) were terrible.
