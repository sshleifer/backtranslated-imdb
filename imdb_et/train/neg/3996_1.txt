I don't see what everyone liked about this movie. The setting was too long and conversational, and when it was done, the main character remained as flat and opaque as it was in the first scene. After the movie finally arrived in a hotel room called Cusack, I wondered what would happen here next hour or so that I would be captured. Answer: Not much, just John Cusack, who has a long, drawn, mental failure. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Cusack's character was deeper. . maybe if his surprise would be a more thorough reprocessing of his daily life. . . maybe, if the film had either better developed its half-burned themes of loss and faith, or wouldn't have met them first. . . Perhaps, if the film had chosen both psychological horror and excitement and horror, it would have embraced one of these styles. . . I do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror providers and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Except an alarming episode at the hotel, a worrying crazy lady with a hammer and so dumb-it-was-fun cryptic holder in the air channel, all three of which are up to five minutes of screen time, this movie was drilled. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal The Shining's ideas and use them much less powerful here. Has Stephen King now stolen his ideas?
