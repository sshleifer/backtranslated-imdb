This film is probably the cheapest, the poorest and the poorest ever made. This is a group of short stories that seem to be bad fans. Then three new losers decide to fast things, giving Belle a forgiveness message. Partly through this little episode, Belle has the eyes of the wall that made my sisters and brothers so hard. Then he and the beast fight over the letter ... and learn the meaning of forgiveness later. How old are they ??? Definitely old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then there's the story that Lumiere is the world's largest rope in terms of romance. It comes from a man who could chew something about a woman. And they make FiF a psychotic affliction who is trying to kill Belle and finish off at the end. What message does the children send? <br /> <br /> The next is everything that Mrs. Potts has. And the next is after it is all about the beast becoming overwhelming, to the point where it just looks pretty stupid. There are at least 100 errors that you can probably see ... and the color is terrible. Plus, he's small and very different from the usual Belle. And the side signs are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere are fighting almost all the time. But it was superfluous in that.) <br /> <br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. He's been destroyed. I can't even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give it 1/10 of the juice, but I give it a comedy 10/10.
