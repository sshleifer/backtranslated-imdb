this movie was a fantastic great movie through fear. and i mean it was both pulse and IT, and elsewhere, and so on. BETTER! this film was pathetic at the end. I mean, the ghost turned back to the chick's house and thinks I'm done now that it means I can call her and that's the right time she thinks it is. right? wrong. my ass! I don't care if the ghost is Satan, it just won't happen. this movie yes, but most evil movies or such acclaimed movies are meant to be reasonable but not. it showed us what I just said, and people don't think about it. Can someone please tell me why you have not noticed this pathetic part. my movie ended up in the hospital and that's all. check number 3 for your much more kick ass
