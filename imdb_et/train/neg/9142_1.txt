I looked at it only after hearing how bad it was and wanted to see myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you are hardly able to understand how terrible this movie really is, even though it must be one of the most fun things I've ever seen! Never bother to comment here, but that justifies it. First, the whole plot is ridiculous and pointless. Brother of the leading brother (either Ben or Arthur, forget what is, and frankly, it's never very clear) wants to stop some gay marriage, killing everyone on the horizon - homosexuality is scary for Christians, but apparently there's no mass murder. Then another mess has been thrown to some of the gay couple's ex-husband who is trying to marry him again. This brings something, but gives us a more fun dialogue with the film - "I don't understand? You don't make sense! That's the one who makes sense!". Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there is something that is just cruel. It must be seen as believing. My personal favorite is probably a woman of lawyers with stony citizenship, who reads her lines clearly, but is able to confuse them. That's enough. The gay couple couldn't be less convincing. There's a vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy and his boyfriend who looks like a little band mixer. Only thicker. And less talented. <br /> <br /> "Movie" has also been filmed by someone who can't even remotely control the camera, and the number of errors is amazing. The whole thing starts with a greasy head in bed with a pair of boots. Anyway, but we all know how terrible this thing is, so I'd like to highlight some of the invaluable moments of comedy that "film" offers. <br /> <br /> - When a fat boy puts the church on fire and then French like a six-year-old girl over the parking lot to escape. Funny. <br /> <br /> - Easy! No idea what his relationship with the main characters is - sometimes they know him, sometimes they are not, but he still appears in a few scenes. Funny. <br /> <br /> - Stoned Lawyer. She already mentioned her, but she's so funny she deserves to be mentioned. <br /> <br /> - The evil brothers for dinner, which he puts to his guests. <br /> <br /> - The bad brother was given a gay drink. <br /> <br /> - Cats of the Evil Brother. <br /> <br /> - The end I don't give because it must be believed. I warn you, however, make sure you don't eat at the same time !!!! The lard head / director / producer bath can be naked. This is a mistake. Basically, Ben and Arthur are inexplicably bad, but inadvertently the most comical thing you've seen for a long time. In the literal sense of the word there is no such excuse for the film, the director's gon can even open the credit joke by writing his name about 15 times.
