One two three four four six seven eight and back, haha. It must first be seen to see the work. There's a lot of work shown, see these close-ups, the man who likes it. A few years ago, this film was certainly based on this film. It's slasher, but without intercourse. The end is funny and the clothes that he wears in the wood that touches the copper, Jesus, looks like a clown. The killings are mostly on the screen, the blood flows, but never too. There are also many fighting scenes and hey, nobody hurt. And how to kill a gun, never seen a big one, don't break it, you have to see it. And being a slasher, there is also a lot of R&D. Guess who the killer will be trapped a few times and this is the best part, but what is the story of copper in the forest, ah! But thanks to its joy, it is one more that many would like. I'm glad I have my copy, one of those slipping. But the man, these clothes and not the hairstyles! If you are in your 40s, this is one of the memory cards.
