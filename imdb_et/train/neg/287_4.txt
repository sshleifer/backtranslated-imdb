As a fan of Altman, I was looking for this film for years, thinking that with such great pain it should be at least somewhat brilliant. <br /> <br /> Great mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's magnificent mishmashs, which was thrown accidentally and improvisatively (or so it seems) in the hope that it would all happen in the editing room. That's not the case. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey can only be seen for Alfre Woodard's debut performances that surround all vets. But, besides, avoid at all costs. (What's pretty easy to do - never published through video - to my knowledge - and the incidence of this cable is Halley Comet.)
