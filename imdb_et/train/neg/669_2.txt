I am a man who usually keeps himself, but I just returned this movie and felt I had to express my opinion. Let me start by saying that I am a big horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I also like to see a little bit of a good script and character. I know they often have no horror movies, but Prom Night saw that it wouldn't have made any effort in this regard. Next, we all love tension. It's surprising surprises at the edge of your seat. Yes, Prom Night had nothing like that! Of course we like a terrible killer. Prom Night has it? No, it's a pretty boy with a lovely lil. And if everything else fails ... at least the horror is guilty to rejoice that it would be enjoyable like a gore gore gore and a casual naked scene! Yes, well, if you have a horror movie PG-13 like Prom Night, they will leave it out. So all these elements are missing, I ask .... is it still a movie? No. I'd call it more comedy. In my theater, people laughed more than they saw "Semi-Pro", which was supposed to be a comedy (which is also a miracle, but it's another story). I think I just have to give up new horrors. All the good nightmares of good evening days have been rebuilt into garbage so that film studios can make money. The people I went to see it didn't even know it was a remake! What made me crazy! I don't know what happens if there are no more movies to do? Where's going on?
