Schizophrenia has escaped from a psychiatric hospital in NYC and teachers will soon be leaving the University of the Holy Trinity. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with red herring. In spite of 78-minute working hours, this cheap-o slasher pulls in and out until the flat finish, where the person you suspect is killing a killer, appears as such. Directed by Richard Haines, barely sweaty, with some flat stalk-n-slash productions, is probably a craving for the 80's audience. For all of our amateur trophologists, it was filmed in New Yawk in the early 80s so you can see the culture, beliefs, and practices of all those living in this distant place. The film gives no credit for "Final Girl". You rarely see it. It is also always nice to see a horror movie where the priest is a killer. Don't you trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? Fortunately, this is just a fake priest and he gets stuck. He is still working at a high moral ground angle.
