OK, there is nudity, but hey, there is free porn on the internet that likes it. And it's just stupid how they forced the tits into each frame. I mean, I was embarrassed, not nudity, but the far-fetching of those fucking producers / writers. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny at all, it's just predictable all the time. There is no plot, no dramatic content. It's as inferior to other pies and they're not so big :) If you're really drunk or maybe a 13-year-old buyer who's really obsessed with tits, it might be acceptable, or not. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is forever the same size of crap as the Erik search engine flash MC
