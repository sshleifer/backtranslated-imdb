Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a jet that causes him to be a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after being attacked by his deceptive husband and his lover, and later revived by female scientist Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses her in the control tests. Later, Daninsky discovers a physician's unsuccessful attempts at an underground shelter on topics. <br /> <br /> When I heard Naschy's death colleague Jon Kitley, I heard through my collection to watch a suitable movie. In my scramble I found that I didn't have one, but three (!) Copies of "Fury of the Wolfman". The quality of the film is questionable, the sound is mediocre dubbed, cinema is a kind of style from time to time. And the American versions have two love scene removed. Frankly, without a remastered, uncut copy, I couldn't get a real movie in all my glory. <br /> <br /> This movie claims to be the fourth long-term werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect this is true, but you don't know this movie yourself. The plot is sometimes confusing and there is really no sign that it is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries in Wikipedia and compare them with the data printed with the box, you will see that I am not confused by myself. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film's defects can be forgiven if we understand the hell of production that it went through. After years of swimming, it was only in 1973 that it was only due to problems with finding a distributor. And in his autobiography, Naschy said that director Zabalza was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him. These really are not easy accusations and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say in his own name. <br /> <br /> You may sooner or later reach "Fury Wolfman". It appears in different packages and cartons, so you can accidentally acquire it and not even know it. What really needs to happen is an un-cut version of America with a decent mix of sound and video and beloved scenes that have been thrown back. As far as I know, it does not exist. Let us respect Paul Naschy's legacy and get his films to a wider audience that he deserves.
