I rented this DVD after seeing it when I was looking for something else. When I saw the jacket headline, I couldn't believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and loved it, really admired Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I watched this movie for 30 minutes and I had to turn it off. I'm not sure if I can take much more. On a superficial level, faux accents, like others have commented, simply at best distract and irritate and evaporate at worst. Action is boring if it should be passionate and comic if it should be serious. The portrayal of Lou Salome is simply sliding and the brilliant Freud comes as little as a schoolboy. I see very little of the spirit of the book that has been delivered so far. I was hoping I could recommend this film to my students. Instead, I refer them to the book. Imagine.
