I was happy to see my choir line when it arrived in my city. I was younger than .. but it was a great game .. so someone please tell me why they had to make a movie in the name of heaven and why Michael Douglas ?? He didn't fit his role .. this movie really sucks BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> My recommendation is not to rent this movie .. save your money for something better than "Cats".
