I hate this program: not only is the term ridiculous, it is trying to be so difficult that it is feasible (something that was left of similar "I admit" programs like Muder: She Wrote). <br /> <br /> Sigh. Why is it that writers never get enough intelligent evidence in this program that would go to court and win this decision? <br /> <br /> Come on: after the X-year years, things have not been resolved, why should you kill every time that all the police want the criminals to be the good athletes every time it all goes unresolved? , officer, you are bright - I think if you have discovered enough to convince yourself, I can admit it and simplify it in court. "A fair cop." Absolute dog ** and insulting them with enough brain to even hear IQ
