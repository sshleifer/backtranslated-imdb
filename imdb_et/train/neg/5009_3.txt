It was probably the worst film I've ever seen. The plot didn't make much sense and the action was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think he's usually a great actor, I can't imagine why he decided to make this movie. His character Piper is drunk for almost the whole movie, except for the opening. On the plus side there were several points in the film where the actor was so bad, I laughed out loud. But nevertheless, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but it's 80 minutes of your life that you are completely wasting.
