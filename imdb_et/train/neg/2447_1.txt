After watching KHAKEE, I felt that I was watching another good movie, but unfortunately the movie is funny and actually trying to introduce Aryeman Afterall when his father Keshu is a producer. <br /> <br /> RKS spoke so much about the film during the campaigns, saying that the film has meat, unlike the films that appeared at that time, I mean, what films he is talking about. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a typical Masala movie with comedy, romance, action that is all blatant. /> <br /> Children who kidnap children are one of the most fun parts. Imagine children kidnapping the Dawood family <br /> <br /> The end is a complete mumble that characterizes a sudden change in character <br /> <br /> RKS gives its weakest film except for some Bachchan scenes that The movie is drilled <br /> <br /> The music is boring <br /> <br /> Amitabh is trying to give his role to all, he does his part well, though not his best, even though he fights his face too much when pulling and draws a strange gaze when smoking a cigar. also dubbing is not suitable at times in time <br /> <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his actions and gifts <br /> <br /> Aryeman seems unexpressed, trying too hard, but moving over some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika appears to be the best in the lot <br /> <br /> The rest is okay
