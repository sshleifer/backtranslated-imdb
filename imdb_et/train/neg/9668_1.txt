1940 - Visit of the Nazi occupied Poland Lodz ghetto, registered by the German cameraman with the na√Øve collaboration of the Jewish community, is combined with archival materials, international newspaper clips and extracts of cultural films to portray the Jews of the World as scammers and parasites. This documentary interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A sincere, kinematically unique expression of racial hatred. Personally, I think this film is scary and very offensive. It may be hoped that such images will never reach the screen.
