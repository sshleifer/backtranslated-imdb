Pathetic is the word. Bad behavior, pathetic script, cheezy dialogue and hip-hop music and fashion ... what the hell was with it? The director of this movie acts as badly as his film. Had anyone worked the whole thing, he would have had the opportunity. Contribute to the fact that the studios are still trying to figure out how to turn them so badly. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... The Asian chick wasn't too bad. They also made the whole movie. If it weren't for them, I would have destroyed a copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If any of those who have not seen it yet and who have the idea, don't waste your time ... you can regret it later.
