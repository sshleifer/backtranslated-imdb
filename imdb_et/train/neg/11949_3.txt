This stupid comedy really does a good job of wasting comedy talents. Particularly bad here was Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman. Perhaps I would have smiled once or twice during this film, but in general it is a boring film where somewhat stupidity is thrown off in a good mind. The assumption, though routine, was still not bad, but when the plot was set, the film went somewhere. Don't waste your time because of this failure.
