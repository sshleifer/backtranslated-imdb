Absolutely the most boring film I've ever spent on my money. It was the wrong choice when all these great stars were wasting their reputation. Bored! boring! boring! Each character was depicted less inspirationally. There was no talent but part reading. Alec can normally play realistic characters, Gwynyth saw himself ruthlessly, Annette needs advice on how to choose the movies she decides to play, as well as all those big stars who have been disappointed with how they are all allowed talents to be attracted to entertain plan. "Running the Scissors" leads the public into a high-performance film that refers to the emergence of tensions and deep emotions. No moment when the majority was able to display any interpretation on the screen. Maybe it was the director's fault ----.
