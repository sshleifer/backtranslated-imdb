Somewhere, there, there must be a list of all the worst films ever made. It is the one who has long shots of frames that sit and vigorously look into space or where they concentrate intolerably on eating spaghetti for a long time. This illness is a story about a boy and a boy and they live and love and float and stick to the grotto, and one of them is a depressed mother and the other has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then disintegrate and go to hospital for eight days and then it goes out and there is a lot of fast back and forth and there are long nice pictures that one of them looks into space or just sits and does nothing. I think this is some sort of trick to making a movie or maybe it's so bad that they have to fill it with a long, wasted picture, otherwise it would be a movie or story to count for about 14 minutes. Don't do me wrong, it's a 30-year-old gay movie I've watched in the last 6 months, and some of them (most of them) have been very wordable, predictable, and boring, but that's one that's really terrible "Beautiful thing", so I looked at it and after the first opening that stayed and stayed open, I thought, "Oh, no, it's going to be a creative sinny mah" But I gave it a chance and watched it and when it ended, I threw it DVD to Trash. Sorry it didn't like it and when you did, sorry if I offend.
