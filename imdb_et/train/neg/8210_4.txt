OK, here is: "Nazi climber with friends against the Dalai Lama." What we do is we first get a big star who has no idea how to make a Germanic accent, and we'll let him flounder over French, German, American and British for over 2 hours. Then we make a wide range of extremely unlikely events and space so the plot length is almost overlooked. But to make sure that the viewer does not sleep, we throw in details that are shockingly absurd, like our hero who smokes a cigarette at 22,000 feet. Of course, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowest peasant banned in closed Lhasa town in 1943, speaks perfect English, including suspicious accents. Of course, the most difficult part is how to deal with the mental and political aspects of the story, so what we do is: we have a Dalai Lama friendly now with reformed Nazis, because the latter is so good for movie projectors, radios with antique cars and everything other devices representing the freedom of the capitalist west. In return, our hero learns his young protegee from a sort of vague, undefined Buddhism that has never really been outlined or seriously addressed. We also have many scenes with a hero who captures all the respects and protocols shared by the rest of Tibetan society with the Dalai Lama, even if we pretend that the hero is a deep and profound respect for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we are just waiting for the audience to believe that this guy is now Buddhist, somehow, although we don't know what his transformation means or how far we want to go. And last but not least, at the end of the film we hang up statistics about how amazingly the Chinese have been conquered by the Tibetans (which is certainly true), opening up the charges that we have made for the "political" film, although this is not the case. So, zat is my idea. You are? Can I do a zis movie?
