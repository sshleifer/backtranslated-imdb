First of all, I want to say that this movie is worth more than the four stars I appreciated. I gave her four letters because for me, this 86-minute movie always looks like 2 and a half hours and doesn't take enough time to sit through it. But "The Big Alligator River" (the title of my DVD called it) is better than your average nature hitting the movie back. <br /> <br /> The Southeast Asian jungle tourist center is just opening up and using natives trying to manipulate nature. Looking for Mother Nature to Revenge is the giant Kroona, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing that tourists and key figures (photographer and resort staff) have to worry about, the native people are rubbing wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pretty well-made adventure / horror story with a good musical score and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is probably fake. Some close-ups of this jaw are good, but it should be all we need. Some underwater distant shots make it painfully clear that what we are actually doing is an alligator who may play a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are credible, if not authentic. And like many creature films, it ends with an extremely large body number. It also has many good jungles. Acting below is par., But who was expecting it to be better, right? Much, much better than his recent American colleague, Primeival, but nothing comparable to "jaws". But remember that it may not be at some point.
