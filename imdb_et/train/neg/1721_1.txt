The meteor crater lake (hence our title), awakening Plesiosauri, who continues to snack on the hick population (California, which attracts the world's capital). <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and then "Crater Lake Monster" that somehow escaped from MST3K. This is a grate action, a decent stop-motion beast, and it is a terrifying piece of the low-budget / monster movie of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Although the film is guilty of many crimes, the biggest one is Arnie and Mitch, two unpleasant rednecks who are our comics. They worship, fight "banjo music", women and act like pathetic apologies to humanity. The characters are so bad that they should be considered a crime against humanity.
