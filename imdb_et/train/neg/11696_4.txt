I started watching this movie with low expectations because I noticed it just because it was S.K. novel (a novel I've ever read). <br /> <br /> I am glad that my expectations were small, because the film was not good, but it can interest you. What this story really draws is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is too long, there are no "nice" frames and no fears, dialogs are stupid and special effects are nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only thing is that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I think the book must be good) without using a lot of horror clich√©s. <br /> <br /> My Voice 4/10.
