I rented it wrong. I thought after a box-through investigation that it was a time-travel / sci-fi story. Instead, it is a "Christian" story and I think this is a fairly typical example. If you sell this message, you probably forget the inconvenience of the plot / actors, but I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I am bothered to rewrite this history. It paints the paradise of family values ​​and morals of the 1890s (the figure is that 5% of marriages end with divorce!), But the very rigid aspects of a very "very moral" society are forgotten (rigid racial, sexual and social discrimination was widespread). And at one point, the hero complains to the clothing store owner about things that do not fit anything other than the Iranian leaders' complaints about women's clothing styles (as reported in the recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought I thought this was something you like, if you like this thing, and it's definitely healthy ...
