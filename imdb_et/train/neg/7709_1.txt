Never see this movie. <br /> <br /> He's trying to be a sci-fi / thriller movie in the 1950s and 1960s, but all he does is really want to look at one of them and not that. lame. Fraud must have some aspects that have some better quality. This film has no such aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but just don't look at it.
