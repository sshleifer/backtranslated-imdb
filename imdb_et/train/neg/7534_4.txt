Mummy talks about vignette men, women and the sex between them. Ah? At first, the mummy asks the viewer randomly: "Imagine having sex with this girl. Imagine you were having sex with this boy" about 37 times while blinking images of half-naked mod youth. Later, the mods guys said mod to the girls ... with vegetables? If you forget (or fast forward) mummy rambling, the shorts are not in themselves bad. I found some of them pretty funny. My personal favorite is one where a sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with her while her pet litter is sitting in bed. This is one, well, odd movie.
