Two years before he wrote and directed Arthur, Steve Gordon had a small hit with his scenario for Henry Winkler, then TV for The Fonz. The College of the 1950s (and everywhere) pulls together and marries without employment prospects; Eventually, he turns to an appealing wrestling world, eventually becoming a "Gorgeous George" celebrity. Making the probable Winkler an unpleasant census seemed to be an interesting idea at that time (and a sure way to separate him from his television from the ego), but jokes and situations are often wrong and mean, staged quite rarely by director Carl Reiner. Crude oil is especially an enthusiastic bit of Herv√© Villechaize ("Fantasy Island"), which puts moves on Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). Like Henry's beloved, Kim Darby looks a bit out of her element - especially if it is surrounded by all these TV channels - making the script more romantic. * 1/2 from ****
