I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. It was a really terrible movie. The scenario, management and action were equally bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could have made a smart and thoughtful film, but he didn't. I reached for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus of the film? Where was something in this movie? Christians should promote this movie instead. It was deliberately done and a waste of my money. Don't look at this movie.
