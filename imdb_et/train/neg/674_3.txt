I'm known to sleep during movies, but this is usually due to a combination of things, including really tired, warm and comfortable sediment and just eating. In that case, however, I fell asleep because the film was a garbage. The plot development was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen but didn't explain what caused them or why. I testify that I may have forgotten some of the film, but I looked at most of it and it just seemed that it would happen by itself without any other worries. I don't recommend this movie at all.
