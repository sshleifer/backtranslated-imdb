This movie is hard to describe and one wants to hardly shoot it too fast, because you feel it may be just a 12-year-old girl's perfect movie ... <br /> <br /> The movie has a nice concept - Sleeping Beauty i modern version with twist. It has some pretty dreamy shots and some nice schemes for a young boy's relationship with one of his working mothers and his schoolmates ... a nice start that could be said, but then it got a bit greedy, very greedy, trying to be a science fiction, drama, thriller, possible romantic love story, fairy tale, comedy and all under the sun. The result was rather inadequate for the audience. For example, a scene where a girl (played by Risa Goto) finally woke up with her (Yuki Kohara) kiss instead of being romantic, trying to scare us later ... this is a cheap trick because it destroys all expectations and emotions what he tried to build on the right side of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story that the film is based on (this is a well-known work by comic artist Osamu Tezuka is famous for his intriguing and complicated tide) I don't know if all the problems exist in the original story or did it appear in the adaptation ? This is quite illogical even for the person who is accustomed to the "strange logic" of their Japanese comic books. For example, how Yuki Kohara's character managed to get to the hospital immediately (if she thinks this is a long bus ride), so that Risa Goto would act in front of the television cameras immediately after seeing her live conversation on television, with some scenes copied directly from other movies ( very creative!) and everyone seems quite pointlessly annoying, ie. famous "Lion's mouth is my hand" scene from "Rome vacation" <br /> <br /> The film is trying to be everything but it comes to nothing ... it's not a fairy tale and it wasn't enough fun to be comedy ... and, strangely enough, there are some scenes that seem even involuntarily "ghost" as a movie, but still should give him a testimony that he has been able to bring some Japanese teenager mood into watching this movie, I have the feeling that there may be some movies that would have come together a warning label saying that "this film is only suitable for people under the age of 18". , it would definitely be on the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
