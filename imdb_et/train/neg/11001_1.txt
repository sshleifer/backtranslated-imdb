I've never seen comedy that was so much of a harvest to sit ... no laugh. Okay, maybe one little click for Michael Clarke Duncan as big, black and bald gay. But the rest of it was shockingly funny. "Skits" seem to be ridiculous forever! Watch it when you value your time and money. ATTENTION! Worst !!!
