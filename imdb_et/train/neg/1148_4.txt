Pedantic, long-term production that seeks to crown the birth of a federal investigation office. Starts quite promising that an appropriate probe is still in the airplane explosion, but the melodrama involving James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles is just on the road (Miles had a habit of playing soft women, and his nervous nerves arrive here on schedule). Dear director Mervyn LeRoy went to the adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the fact that talent is involved, the picture does not make a big impression. The best performance is by Murray Hamilton as a Stewart partner, but most of the dialogue is ridiculous and the reverse pace causes the film to be twice as long as it is. * 1/2 from ****
