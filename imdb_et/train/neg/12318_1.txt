I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people are sitting and watching this garbage? OK, my dad and mom love it, but I'm sure I've come out of the room. It is so depressing and harsh, but the worst thing is when it is not possible because all detective programs are so, because the detectives are both wood and heartless. What happened to detective programs with a real puzzle? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictional characters, something we don't know about that died more than 20 years ago? I want bbc to put more comedy on bbc1 cos now that the dibley prince ended up having more space.
