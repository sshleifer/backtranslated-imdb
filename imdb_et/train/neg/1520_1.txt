Why did I waste time with this movie? There were no funny jokes or lines. Dirty was not even a little funny. I mean really, controlling the vacuum sucking tube? Why is the National Lamp name added to this movie? Even the Christmas holiday was better (I thought the movie was very funny). <br /> <br /> DON'T TAKE PLAY!
