This film was badly written, malfunctioning and very predictable. It was a very small budget and I understand why it was never released and went straight to the video. It wasn't even fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I got 1 to 1/2 hours ago! The colors were terrible with a plot with such large holes that you could drive the truck through them. <br /> <br /> The country itself was a young man who did things he couldn't physically do - what to stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the fear genre. Almost every movie comes to mind, which is better. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
