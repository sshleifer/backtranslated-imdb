AntiTrust could have been a great tool for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out his best scenes. In scenes he is just a zombie. He has been involved in a subkey that is simulating with the Get Carter sub-block, but he will start a better plot in "Get Carter". (I blame the director) The director's respect for Hitchcock was horrible. (This is a scene where Ryan Philippe's symbolist realizes he can't trust the character of Tim Robbin, at least I think it's a respect for Hitchcock. DVD shows scenes that were cut out. I think the director should have trusted his instincts and not to listen to the test group.
