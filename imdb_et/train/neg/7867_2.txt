Okay, I've tried and I've tried, but I can't get it for Guy Maddin. Fairy tales from Gimli Hospital left me cold, this film about the villagers of Austria and the one who spoke about Ice Nymph were pretty beautiful, but they're not in the storyboard ... and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring. I'm glad Maddin appreciates the silent movie, but I don't like her movies for the same reason, because I don't like Quentin Tarantino's films: they are empty respects for better, more creative films - movies that are advanced art form or break new ground - and this has all the style and content. No amount of jumps and odd camera corners can conceal the fact that Maddin is unique to David Lynch wannabe, although he has one advantage over Tarantino: he usually doesn't write an embarrassing dialogue because most of his films are based on the Internet. The bottom line is that Maddin's schtick is making smart movies for clever filmmakers.
