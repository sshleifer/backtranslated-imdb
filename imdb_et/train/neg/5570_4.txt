appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: A trashy script written to typewriters over thousands of times for seemingly unfaithful people. a pathetic act that strikes a story ... OK product value, including good set / location and gorgeous girl .. -rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the film has no social message. it is thought free ... but when I did that I was 10, and my IQ was 70. I feel the message is: don't you be afraid to love? -rating 0/10 <br /> <br /> unpleasant things: something special, just a light Jewish hedonic and arrogant attitude written by a writer / director. overall, good, nothing degenerate -8/10 <br /> <br /> Overall rating is 4/10
