Another intense action / adventure comes from the Quinn Martin Productions factory. Roy Thinnes plays a secret representative of Diamond Head (Mr. Head), who works for his G-Man handler, "Aunt Mary", looking for "Tree" on the mission ... well, just look at the movie. <br /> <br /> It served and became a complete MST3K sending. As the boys and the various reviewers have pointed out, "Fargo" had more films than Hawaii. Apparently, it was shot with an evil budget, highlighting Hawaii's diving centers, gas stations and cheap hotels. Zulu - later in Hawaii-Five-O Kono - Thinnes' lumpy, inept sidekick appears, while French Nguyen models Jenny Craig's diet went terribly wrong. Others who share the blinking screen are drunk Richard Harris, the George Takai imitator, not as smart a striker with Sansabelt sprays, and a "Tree", a sporty British accent. You can quite understand the opening of the plot, but relax - just enjoy the 70's movie in the middle of the environment. <br /> <br /> When I think of this movie (and I think this movie is often), I try to worship on the flute and the tube ... no one knows why. <br /> <br /> Trivia's Note - Diamond Head was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, one of the three contractual directors at Universalis, who continued to make much larger films, Jaws 2. Others were John Badham (War Games) and a young companion named Steven Spielberg. .
