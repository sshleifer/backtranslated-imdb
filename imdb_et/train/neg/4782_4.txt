1 review 12/24/2009? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): An emotional Christmas bath that is not really specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this fact-based incident that has been wrongly imprisoned. his family makes them for Christmas. Three children from the family fled home to Washington, D.C., to receive US President Herbert Hoover. This trek offers some side stories, like their positive encounters with a hobby and a puppy maker, that makes the story sort of like Disney's "running animals" and doesn't fit here. Finally, there is no detail as to how the President helped the family and this is, in my opinion, another film down. Ultimately, the movie brings tears, but it takes too long. The movie shouldn't have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but it has obvious fade-outs that make it look like? so i'm not sure their information is correct. All in all, it is a simple film (which could have been more complicated) with a happy Christmas-like story, but played gently and without much content.
