The Carlito Way, the original, is a brilliant story about a former drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and thus invests in the club and deals with the problems it entails. <br /> <br /> This movie I saw a trailer and immediately knew it was going to be bad. But after release and identification of the movie (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). ..You gave it down and it failed in the first five minutes ... <br /> <br /> The script is something that a teenager should take out when preparing him for five minutes ... It was weak, with a weaker dialogue . There seems to be an immediate need for romance in the gangster movie. So Brigante decides to beat the girl ... and she says it's "yes!" And if you need to act badly, throw racism away ... As we learn from "Italian mobiles" ... <br /> <br /> Acting was terrible, saying at least ... I found Hollywood Nicky, fun. br /> <br /> I hate all those musicians who turn to movies Lets this is the only reason why P Diddy made this movie to play gangsters ... The actor playing Leticia was weak but beautiful. but we saw him .. what was okay ... <br /> <br /> But in general I expected it to illuminate the way Carito came to prison and the love of his life ... And the assassin finished the whole terrible movie that is ... <br /> <br /> Carlito Tea: Get Powered.
