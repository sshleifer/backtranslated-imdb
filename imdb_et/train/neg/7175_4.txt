It may have been based on historical events, and we know that the makers of this TV documentary drama took the liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was just so bad! I was surprised when the middle of the air crisis came out, how calm everyone seemed to be, surely someone would panic and what a smooth flight, the discomfort of passengers would not come! Not sure about the regulations, nowadays it seems that some airline security issues are meaningless for OTS, but why take your shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me it's not a good idea! The images of this massive airplane coming to this far away were convincing and fake. In reality, it would have been a fantastic sight from a nearby country, it was disproportionate in this film and looked like the model that probably was. The front panels appeared in the front and center emergency doors, but no one seemed out of the front, although the fall was much smaller. The captain went back to the plane after landing - why? it was never explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to the removal of the fuel, but even if there was to be fuel at the bottom of the tanks, and the danger of the explosion must have been a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost peaceful and everyone was at the foot of the escape slides, instead of getting as possible far as I am sure I would have done. There were too many contradictions, mistakes and counterfeit measures. I would have preferred to see the drama image in real time and depict a realistic motion of the image. It had the potential to be quite exciting, but it was undoubtedly a failure due to budget constraints and felt that all the engines that lost the engines were not really a big deal, and you would slip safely off a bit of a hard landing, but not a real danger! - The reality is, of course, somewhat different!
