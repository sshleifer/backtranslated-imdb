I was forced to look at this whole movie series as a small child and told me they were real! Talk about child abuse. I would be less frightened of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only suitable for people who believe in ridicule and want to indoctrinate their children in the same faith. In addition to the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also poor functioning, poor writing and special effects of BAD. They are just around terrible, terrible films. Yes, a plausible (and terrible) child, but I can't imagine an adult purchase in that lock. Although I have to say that I would like to see them as adults today. They may have a certain midnight / cult film.
