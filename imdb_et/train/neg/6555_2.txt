So on the second night I decided to watch the Tales of the Hollywood Mountains: Natica Jackson. Or power, passion, murder, as it is called in the Netherlands. When I bought the movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in this and I thought it had to say something about quality. Unfortunately, this was not the case. <br /> <br /> 1) The movie plot is really confusing. Two stories work at the same time. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the film, I was expecting these two stories to come together so the plot would be clear to me. But it's still not. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie's title says the movie is from Natica Jackson. Well, this is sometimes. As the film said, the film includes two different stories, and part of Natica Jackson is the shortest. So this title of this movie would not be the wrong choice. that. By doing this you will not waste 90 minutes of your life as I did.
