The snow white that just appeared in Locarno, where I was able to see it, naturally refers to the world-famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. Finally, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays a role. <br /> <br /> Thus, this film discusses all three aspects of the title. The scene has a lot of relaxation and is also a pale, dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all the trouble to come to her rescue. <br /> <br /> But it's not a fairy tale. It should be a realistic drama based in Switzerland (Tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is almost perfect. Unfortunately, to create authenticity, unfortunately, it is a weak plot, predictable dialogues, mostly unrealistic terrain and mixed. Like the spectator, I stayed untouched. <br /> <br /> And then there were clich√©s that drove me crazy: Snow White is a rich and spoiled daughter of the upper class - of course, her parents are divorced and she never got enough of them because they were so busy all the time. But her best friend is loving and caring parents. They (steel worker and housewife) live in a small apartment, in a poor and happy - and desperate situation where their daughter is in the introduction. A good man (= prince) is a musician (!) From the French part of Switzerland (which is considered to be a less economically successful but emotionally installer of the country). She has problems with her parents. They are immigrants from Spain who do not seem to appreciate their natural way of life until the father becomes seriously ill and admits his wonderful admiration for his son's hospitalization. <br /> <br /> And so it is: Of course, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is the playboy and the photographer, although the woman (!) has her career in mind when she exposes snow-white in artistic pornographic images. <br /> <br /> This survey does not require a spoiler so you can add these pieces to the obvious plot. As I like other Samir films, eg. "Forget about Baghdad," I was quite disappointed. Let's hope the next.
