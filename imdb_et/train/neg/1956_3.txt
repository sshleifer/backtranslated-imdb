This film has one redemption function. At one point, after the ax attacks the ax drivers, his brother asks him, "Why is your dick there, Chuck?" After almost one hour of suffering a movie, it almost changed my drink's nose. <br /> <br /> Some actors are not too bad, but kids are all stinking and PJ Soles should be ashamed of making this movie. The story is weak and no one does what you think (or common sense). <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many stories that don't add. For example, in one scene, the spirits of young children must focus on moving the physical object so that they can prove that they exist, a difficult object, because they probably cannot communicate with the physical thing. A few minutes later, however, they all pulled out of the ground and won their teeth. Obviously they can sometimes move things and sometimes they can't. Go to the drawing. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and courage, though ... some nice boobs. But it does not compensate for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie tooth fairy, rent a "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, though many other reviewers don't share my opinion. At least it sets the mood.
