I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing to do on Friday night. All I can say to describe this precious movie is "TRASH". The actors have done so badly that I saw kids in the high school at the right place. According to another note, the special effects were unpleasantly cheesy and the whole thing looked like it was photographed with the camera. Anyone can buy a radio set. <br /> <br /> The clown itself does not see anything that is on the video gas. Heck that he doesn't even see the end of the movie and everything he does is singing songs and going through a couple of characters. There is no real murder shown, so it's not a real movie, because I've seen that I've asked for some things. clowns? 2. If your friend goes missing, why are you going to the woods to have sex, not to look for him? Sad really. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is the only REAL running abruptly endlessly? Did the majority finally decide to show their works? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid letting you waste more than an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
