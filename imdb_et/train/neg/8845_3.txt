I looked at it almost nothing without knowing this, except for the brief description I read here. After looking at it, I started to say that the director is showing a promise, but it looks kind of amateur, then I looked at the other things he did to see if it was his first or second film, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He missed both films and it was the same. <br /> <br /> The story was quite terrible, did anyone just fall in love with a girl because she is beautiful, but has a sense of a child? I gave it to 3 because there were some visual features that I enjoyed at the end, but the whole movie is pretty terrible.
