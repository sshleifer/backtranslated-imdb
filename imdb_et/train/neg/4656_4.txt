An obvious and remarkable remake of the old English movie that is celebrated. Although it may be highly corrupted as a complete disaster (which is not the case), it never builds any tension or gives its TV its origin. Richard Burton's dreams through his role and Sophia Loren's closed (in this film) face do not reflect the great passion. (**)
