I liked the first film, but this is a sequel to the textbook that would have been on the right. The general idea of ​​the first film was, if not large, at least very interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and the characters of the first film, and while Christopher Walken is still good than Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly gets a little ridiculous. If you haven't seen these movies, get the first movie and forget about the results, they can take away all the original joy.
