This movie is so bad, it made me vomit. Poorly produced, complete, ridiculous zone. Why, in the name of God, would you violate a film that to some extent is foolish (and funny if it is)? Sets are ridiculous, the consequences are so bad that they are not even ridiculous and act like a carnival. It's a complete secret why you would even consider collecting this garbage. The National Lampoon ever made Animal House, which people still find fun. Now they are placed on TV to make movies like this one-time ****. Identify your story and use it to describe this movie accurately.
