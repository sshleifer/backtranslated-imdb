When you make a thriller about witchcraft, I believe you should do everything possible to help the public stop their disbelief to make the film work. Some pictures (such as "Rosemary Baby") have achieved this; Others (like "Necromancy") are not and potentially frightening material has come across and buggy. This film has some atmospheric moments, but about half of the dialogue is hard to come up with (sometimes it is badly recorded, otherwise incomprehensible), and Orson Welles, who has the top settlement, has a role that is so BENEATH that you assume that he was desperate. Or maybe he was just fun ..... (* 1/2)
