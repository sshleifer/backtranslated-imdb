This move reminded me of the story of Crypt Keeper. It has the same idea that people get what they deserve. I think it's always a Crypt story. The same goes for bad behavior. Very bad behavior. I liked the movie knowing that most people didn't like it and I didn't expect much. When I look at Stephen King's movie, I don't expect much because all of his films are terrible compared to his novel gene. I've read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie played, as it was a real story, and the whole book is a series of reports and theories. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels are not like movies. The endings were very different from movie versions. I assume these two novels show that all of his novels have changed a lot and the endings are always cheesy. Worse is Thinner's termination. So Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the real end. I recommend to anyone who is going to read Stephen King's novels to watch their films before hand so you can compare. And so you're very happy with the book. I'm going to do this with all the novels made with my movies. I'm sure if they were made into movies, they were real good books ... and the scenario went awfully wrong.
