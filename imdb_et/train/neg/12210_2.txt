This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst films in Stallone. This is a typical 80's film with one person destroying the entire army itself. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there is Arnold, who kills a terrorist, while there is a specific nation shown to be bad. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, it was the peak of the Cold War, but I'm sick of communists or Nazis always having an enemy. There are so many American movies that have this common thing. Why not get a movie that would show Americans as enemies? Who believes that a single soldier destroys the entire army? Do you really think something like that would have happened? According to this vision, the average brain would have been washed by the American viewer.
