Before the release of the live dead night of George Romero, the zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better board games in the old days. But the social label aside from the excitement these early zombies offered to the film to the public? There's nothing at all to judge this movie. <br /> <br /> The story speaks of an expedition to Cambodia to find and destroy the secret of zombie propagation. One party discovers its secrets and builds its own zombie army. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a zombie love corner. But if you see that this is a 30-year-old movie, these zombies are rather somnambulists than the sort of meat that we think today. They seem to respond to mind control, not to unsatisfied fathers. And frankly, "riot" is too little. The whole thing is really very dull. In addition to the lack of horror, there is no overall melodramatic theater that keeps us entertained. It seems unlikely that it would have been a lot of fun 70 years ago. Look at this when you have to see everything called "zombie", but I would recommend skipping it.
