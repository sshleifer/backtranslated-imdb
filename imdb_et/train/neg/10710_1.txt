Dolph Lundgren marks the temple that arrives in New York when the archaeologist discovers a key that opens anti-Christ. Of course, the demon is just a few miles behind Dolphi and it won't be killed as easily as the body goes over. (Like Fenseen without a break) Of course, Lundgren is out of his element and the film is completely unobtrusive. I admit that I'm a Dolph Lundgren fan, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I'm trying to watch his movies whenever they're on TV. I tried Minion and the boy I was never disappointed with. This movie is absolutely terrible. If the sequences of activities are so poorly staged and poorly edited, you can barely understand the arena. The worst thing is that Lundgren is strangely convincing as a tough male priest (!), What all made it worse that the film was such a fall (which was good) and the end of the Days (which was bad but better than that). this movie is the worst film I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. There is nothing to suggest in this literal sense. It is terrible and it is the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Universe Masters. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of four (terrible)
