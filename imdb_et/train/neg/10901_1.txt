And yet "no" is on it. The Voodoo Academy is undoubtedly the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is he trying to do? Tell a story? Probably not; as has been said, most are just barely legal men rubbing themselves. Could this be a fragmentary homoerotic then? Well, maybe, if not because it never goes beyond the safest and most unsafe men's contact form. (What is, not for any joy, repeats about eighty thousand times.) Well, it's a kind of horror film; is it trying to scare us? Not only when the director wanted to do it through the full tidium and emptiness of his "work". <br /> <br /> Never in my life have I ever enjoyed a lesser movie. It's the most boring and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's like the Voodoo Academy takes the genres of fear, zombie, and gay movies, puts them in a grinder, then runs through a coffee filter - just instead of being a coffee filter that filters coffee beans, that's what it takes all vital, nervous or somehow interesting . The result is a 74-minute film as exciting as a warm-water glass - only without the power of you after a 10-day gin, which inevitably happens to you, hydrate when you look at this embarrassment of human activity.
