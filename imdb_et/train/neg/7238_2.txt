The interaction of characters is a moral disaster. Finally, you don't like most characters and you don't like any of them. <br /> <br /> Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really don't care about one of them. The film has no plot, no direction or purpose. One of the qualities of the redemption of the film was to treat it as a glimpse into the confused life of some loser - and it is hardly stimulating even in the afternoon.
