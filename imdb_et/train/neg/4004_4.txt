As a big fan or Cracker series, I've been waiting for 7 years for the next addition. This episode I am afraid does not correspond to the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz will return to Manchester after 7 years of his daughters wedding and will be involved in a murder investigation as a soldier, tempted by a flash in his northern Ireland to kill him. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it was created and how the Fitz was murdered. That's all the fat is far removed. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland flash, however, has some good scenes that have been filmed.
