I can't explain to my life what the popularity of children's TV shows, the power migrants. <br /> <br /> I've never understood why unheard of children first enjoyed this exhibition because the characters seem so idiotic and despite it. <br /> <br /> Costumes look absolutely cruel, like the multi-colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is its purpose to show anyway, but for kids, how to learn to solve their problems? What is it about terrible haircuts and clothes at this show? Not to mention this performance, there is still cable television to make money to teach children how to fight each other when they disagree with a particular problem. <br /> <br /> Today's kids have much better entertainment, hopefully they are not as light as the kids of the 1990s who looked at this example. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what's just between the gay erotic tension between red and green rings?
