I rarely move the movie to comment online. But I don't understand how it's done. Who did it? How could they think they were capable of making a feature film? Did they make a weekend course in a film school, got a nice big control of their father and kidnap David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed? Or was he in any case a long-standing family friend / distant relationship, which makes it a failed, wrong place? I don't care, don't want to know. Even she looks totally embarrassed by knocking her lines and hiding her face from the camera. At the same time, the DOP had to be ridiculous from the neighbors, there seemed to be some sound, the script, the direction and the editing were all poor, and frankly, apathy, which surprises me now, means that I can't bother spending more of my life thinking about this film.
