I saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and surprised how bad this version was. Don't do me wrong, George C. Scott was terrible, like Scrooge, but the rest of the cast is very bad. Sometimes I couldn't laugh by fooling and repeating: "Merry Christmas for everyone!" At other times I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on Charles Dickens' story of a rich boy who does not believe that Christmas is anything but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich man will visit three ghosts to convince him to celebrate Christmas. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how this movie is so bad a script that is written in five minutes can be so well rated. Instead of this garbage, I recommend you to Bill Murray's comedy Scrooged. It was at least funny ...
