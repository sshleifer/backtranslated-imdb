A stupid, often ridiculous romp that includes the landing of a spaceship and the resulting devastation to Tim (Jeff Daniels) and people in his orbit. <br /> <br /> Daniels is always surprised. He showed such depth and promised in 1983, "Under the conditions" as Shirley MacLaine's affiliate son. When years have passed, Daniels has not been able to put his hands on good muscles. Instead, he is a naughty comedy like "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> With this picture, it fails because of the subject. Different situations were shown at least on television. In the film, we have a constant blow and people who become monsters because the government is against rebellious Martin. <br /> <br /> Ms. Brown's part is a great example of a movie. On television, Pamela Britton was a ditsy person who was caught in situations where Martian was amazing. In the version of the film, with brown brown bombshell, romantic entanglement is trying. <br /> <br /> Television star Ray Walston has a small role as a government representative or is it really so? <br /> <br /> Very disappointing for those who enjoyed TV shows so much.
