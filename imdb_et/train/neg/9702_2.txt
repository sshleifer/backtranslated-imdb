I don't think this movie was properly rated. I took my copy and darkened the PG rating and wrote down R. I don't recommend it to anyone under the age of 17 or 18, regardless of the R border. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I don't know about you, but it's not something that little kids would look at. True, it may be African (?) Indian traditional "clothing style", but ... I think partial nudity should be given by the film's R-rating. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a movie recently, but I think it's okay.
