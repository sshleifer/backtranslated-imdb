Good light and they do their best, but the story doesn't make sense, the action of the characters is inexplicable and too many moments with involuntary humor, like when a person is killed by breaking through a phonograph record, or when they get drunk into a hiphop hit and then he hit the bottle over his head and grabbed his hostage and stabbed him. A scene where two witches and his victim (played by the same actor) are in the house together, like the 3 Stooges routine, and a question arises for the plot: if the witch wants it to have another woman's soul, then why not? t he just does it instead of directing these people in this difficult pursuit? One should not forget that Christopher Walkin's glasses and the explanation of his car industry about his successor (parafrased): "Ancient Egypt - they live materialists. They knew you couldn't ride in the afternoon. You had to go out and walk." Ah? The end is completely unclear. It seems they just ran out of the movie.
