Listening to such praise for such a game, I decided to watch it when I stumbled through this cable. I don't see how it "eliminates" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the subject. I think if you have an interest in the private life of women and how it affects their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise it will be quite boring and boring. When I found something, I found it a little humiliating. So, it's not just a man who can't.
