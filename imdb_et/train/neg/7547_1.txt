Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Dear, like a bee? This is called meaningless prediction. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the Road) Basket: Here's your doll, little girl. You shouldn't take care of your stuff. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Whoosh! Crackle ?? Basket: I think something bad happens. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What ?? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! My former girl's handwriting has really improved. And, behold, his missing daughter looks like a girl with whom I am accidentally responsible for killing. And he has such a hairline. I don't know if I should torture myself and find him? Let's see what my friends think of a fellowship. <br /> <br /> Basketball: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad happens. <br /> <br /> Basket: What's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> A tree called crown: it's not her daughter. <br /> <br /> Basket: Can you do that? Big boned, a tree called a tavern: Huh? Basket: (breaks the bee). Everything is fine. <br /> <br /> A sensual beautiful, previously promising actor who plays a passionate girlfriend: It's good. Honey is not a plant, though. <br /> <br /> Willow: Oh, yes, and I forgot that you are my child, Conan, I, I mean Rowen. (Yawns.) I could have stayed and live with you. But I didn't. I wanted to be the princess of a beehive instead. I mean, never. (Nods off, jerks awake, extending eyes to anime proportions). Mwah, Kiss Kiss. Love you! What did we talk about? Basket: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Sniff. Flashes. Why. Is. You. Screaming. At. Me? Is it because I threw my Vicodini? Sniff. Snore. What did we talk about? Basket: I think something bad happens. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips wounds. <br /> <br /> Rose: What is a man? Unpaealling twins, unison: phalic symbol, phalic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: away from the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm a good twin. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad happens. <br /> (for bees) Basket: Hmmm. Hallo? Ow, ow, ow, oh trouble. Stupid old bear. Snore. <br /> <br /> Queen Bee Manor Sister Summersisle: You have so many options. What are you doing here? Haven't you seen Moonstruck face you shirts Cher? Basket: I asked you the same thing. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How are you going? Let's talk about the importance of my excess s. Basket: Look at this semi-trailer! Aaaaah! Oh. Do not mind. God! (Pops another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back in the tavern) Big boned, overwhelming pubic ripe: I've tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I went to the size of a bear suit last year. <br /> <br /> A tree named Crown: HAHAHA. Better to fry this tough policeman, my dear. <br /> <br /> Great Boneless Chicken: Absolutely. <br /> <br /> Basket: This was the last shoulder that broke Basket Case! Take it away! (Slug him.) (Edward Basket is attacking from behind in mystery) Amazing tavern wench: EEEE! Get over! Leave the island down and take me with you! Do I have to deal with you or what? I'll say it out! EEEE! Basket: Get it off! (Boldly strikes his face. His eyes roll back to his head and become a comic in Xs.) Charming yacht: Snore ?? (By Nicolas Cage roasting) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where the Basket mobile phone rings in the middle of its bear and then the call goes down. It's like a wireless ad: help me! Do you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And remember when I was hoping for a Basket weapon? She seemed so surprised. You should be more careful with your stuff, Nick. Hahaha. And your movie choices. <br /> <br /> All: Drone must die! Basket: (shouts) Oh, yes, legs? Well, roasting me doesn't help your fucking honey! Aaah. My feet! Dear, (honey, take it?) Put this flashlight off and step out of the basket body. Dear! Smokey bear says he doesn't play games. Hahaha. What ??? Watch out for the semitrailer! Ahh! Oh. Goddammit, these drug-experimental setbacks in the seventies are getting older! Where's my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. I think something bad happens. Do you hear me now? I'm ready to close it. God! (Six months later) A charming hunt in today's slutty clothing: I said this name is Basket Case to take with her. <br /> <br /> Innocent Young Drone: I like to help people. <br /> <br /> Volptuous wench: Then take me out of the descendant! I think something bad happens. EEEEE!
