Really sad is that it was supposedly the highest budget "Halestorm Entertainment" was supposed to work. All involved should be fined for garbage, because all the celluloids they are wasting are nothing more than filling the trash. Not only is writing brutal and the jokes terrible, but camera work and film quality are the best amateurs. Sound track sounds like some laptops. The worst thing is that I sat through the whole thing. I think just because I couldn't believe I actually paid for the ticket and that the theater I was watching was willing to show the movie.
