This is perhaps one of the worst giant killer movies I've ever seen. It follows that the failure of laboratory tests is typical, and there is a huge crocodile with a fast growth chemical. The monster looks like a dinosaur with large Tyranosaurous-like hind legs, if it should just look like a big crocodile. All this film is unoriginal and it is constantly going on "clich√©" in a minute. Why, after the blind, have two drunkards ever separated? In addition, there is always a man and a girl who share a flat, obvious interest in love when they are in life-threatening situations. Much has already been said to me and I feel like I'm wasting this time writing it ...
