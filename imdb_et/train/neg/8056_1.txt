Inept, boring and inconsistent supernatural "thriller", where college student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is a constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident, says her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck) lives. <br /> <br /> I can't tell you how bad it is ... nothing important ever happens and never has any real value for entertainment. I didn't like it cast in this particular movie - they are all unfortunately convincing (then their roles are not good again). Promoting it as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the fears? There's no point or intercourse - there are some good songs, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> How did this project get green on the ground? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no noticeable vision or talent. The worst thing is that the conclusion really makes the whole movie meaningless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "killer cut" I was looking at is 86 minutes of pure tedium. <br /> <br /> 1/10
