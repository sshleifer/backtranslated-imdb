Well, EYEboy, I have to say that I don't like any end when someone puts me out and tries to make me joke, especially if it's someone who looks as intelligent as you. My favorite part of your post was "But here wasn't a big boy bang a good guy, kimosabe. I recommend you take a lotsa bang with a movie." <br /> <br /> Well said! I like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that don't have much action when they're done well. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies don't fit in this category and are just a very bad movie. I really don't see a lot of non-American movies, so maybe I was spoiled and wondered if bad foreign movies really were when I saw the secrets and flames. Perhaps, when I meet a different standard for foreign films, I could see for a few days how mysteries and steaks could be one of IMDB's highest films. Hmm ... If that's true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
