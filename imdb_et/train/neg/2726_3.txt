Given this genealogy, it should be a much more enjoyable film than it is. Even if the lip gloss has been gathered by eccentrics, which affinity does not want, is there a film that combines Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovac and Gingold? The whole event is cumbersome, stubborn and more often uncomfortable. James Stewart was a good comedian because he really proved films from the Philadelphia story of Harveys. I think he will get out of this confusion better than anyone else. Except maybe a cat.
