I'm still trembling for the idea that EVER will see this movie again. <br /> <br /> I've seen action movies, I've even liked them very much, but it's over. <br /> <br /> This is not only the worst male (Sly Stallone) who plays a leading role, but the plot plot is so stupid from the start (why not rob money when the plane is on the ground, would it be much easier hell that it requires less than IQ from her shoenumber to believe it. In addition, there is no real twist on the plot, a three year old boy might think what is next. This is a clich√© collection (genre of deeds) where Sly is even worse as his other films (he was even better at Rambo III when you watch this movie comedy instead of an animated film.) Now there is an actor who can't surprise B) sad C) anything other than his main face. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to point out that this film has two factors that may appeal to some people. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then ... you will see better on July 4th. LANDSCAPID is great, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better sights instead of wasting time with this flick. <br /> <br /> Go see some other movie, there are hundreds, even thousands, of better action movies.
