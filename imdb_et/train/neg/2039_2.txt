This film was almost inappropriate. I get beyond that, it looks like it was made with a camcorder and that movie should last over a week, but the characters will never change the stock, but the actress broke my fourth wall for me. . I've seen better action in the 4th grade game. In addition, the plot is unrealistic. If a man suspects he would have turned him on. I was also very disappointed that all the killings took place with a weapon like that. It is not a copy that Zodiac did not kill with just one weapon that the authorities would have known it was not his. Another thing that bothered me was that they called Dassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4, if it's the name of a book used to diagnose a mental disorder, not the name of the disorder. In general, I think this film is not a movie that could be done with a small budget, at least not as little as they would have been, or they could have ensured that they had better actors or more. A lot of people have gone to a low-budget route where it is necessary to use terrible actors looking for Easy Rider with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and low budget.
