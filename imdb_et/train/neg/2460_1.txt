I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. Basically, it's meant to be a spinal tap hip theme, but it's not unhappy. It is a constant feeling as it is written and acted by high school kids on some school project, and that is also the level of humor it seems to be targeting. Fineness is not, and somewhat more harmful than ever, a documentary. And even though the lines are not funny at first, they would have tried to help the delivery of the cages - definitely there would be something better than what was overflowing. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to people who like "comedies" "Big Momma House" or "Norbit" convinced; people who think the words "butt" are hysterically funny in nature. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.
