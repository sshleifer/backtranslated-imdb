This film was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. Although Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as a perfect fair and just prosecutor (not to mention a leading producer), the film never showed defense defenders and did not attempt to challenge the public with a real meaningful debate on how a country could lead such a terrible way. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody wants to protect the Nazis, but it was the Nuremberg trail! Four hours just on Nazi Nazis ... c'mon! It's already done! <br /> <br /> I think Alec Baldwin should just stick to Kim Bassinger's wife. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the end of the movie, TNT showed the 1959 film Trail at Nuremberg. This movie is a better FAR.
