I saw mommy ... well, she wasn't exactly capable of Santa Claus; He has his hand in his thighs and minds. <br /> <br /> It was enough to emotionally love a young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up as a bitter man who was upset by the quality of toys he made and the lack of Christmas power. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for a real slip, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people died and nudity was not at all. What a beater. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this flick, but it was just too slow and really wasn't a good script. I didn't expect much action, but I definitely wanted to do something. There was nothing there.
