I do not know why, but after all the NPR hype thought it was a new movie ..... all the best film footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects you've seen if you're interested in nature programs. .. it is repackaged with cute story and over-dramatic music Disney used Earth day-there are great moments, and it's always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, .. ........ James Earl Jones speaks, but I was hoping for a terrestrial movie, given the new camera technology used to make this movie ...... it has been disinfected for the child's audience, so you can actually see better material for free on youtube .... I feel we have due to something like breaking like Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is definitely not it
