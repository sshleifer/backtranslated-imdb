Certainly, Zu Warriors should be an animated series because it is like an anime on the film as it looks on the film. The movie just starts somewhere and people just fly against metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices her lover on the cloud or something. Is this princess god or an angel away from me, but soon she will be enough to kill and kill her, Racer Winger Fighting with some other mystical god / demon / wizard The plot line is either not or it is very difficult to follow. To get this movie you need to be extremely intelligent. The plot will soon be followed by the Chinese mortal who this god has called to fight evil riding, prince killing, and soon we will have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll as a fighting scene with terrible martial arts on the mountain or something. If visuals are strange, they can be said to be stunning and Colored, but I say they are foggy and acidic journey (yes, that's the word!). I looked at it both dubbed and subtitled, and both were equally bad and difficult to understand .... who I am, which I didn't understand at all. I watched the episode of the 1980s 30 and completely disappeared, how the story started or as I started reading from the 5 comic series 4, because I had no idea how it started where it went or how it would end I can honestly say that it was one of the worst movie experiences ever when it was like watching the Inu-Yasha in the drunk of episode 134 ... yeah, that's right you don't know what the hell is going on. the brain is trying to figure it out.
