For years, I remember reading the TV Guide about reading this Tracy Problem. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6.00! I lived about two hours drive from Toronto and we didn't get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can't. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to see was "Tracy Tracy". Did she have a beautiful girl starring? Was there nudity there? Was there a relationship? Was it a comedy? It would have been good if the exhibition was somewhat promoted. At least I could have known what I was missing. But not! The mystery drove me bonkers, until the CTV branch of CKCO rebuilt the transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and began broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" while CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6am! One Saturday morning I got up and turned the TV 5:59 and finally got to know what "Tracy" was. Yes, "Troacy with Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and was harmless after 6 hours, so no one would ever see how terrible it was. Later on, but many say he "died" when he first appeared at this show. When I first saw this cold Saturday morning and fell back in bed, some of me died.
