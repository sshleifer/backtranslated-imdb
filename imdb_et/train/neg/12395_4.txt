When I got this movie out of my job, with three other similar movies. I looked at it with very low expectations. Now this film is not bad in itself. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in the movie. This is certainly not a Hollywood band, but it is not so bad for cheap excitement. I'll probably never see this movie. In a nutshell, this is a movie you would see at a very late night on local television, which only wants to take a few moments, or see it on Sunday afternoon on local television, which is trying to take time. Despite bad actions, clich√© lines, and sub-camera work. I didn't want to turn off the movie and pretend it never came in my DVD player. The story has been repeatedly made in many films. It's not different, not better, not worse. <br /> <br /> Just your average movie.
