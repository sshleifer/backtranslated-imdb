It sounded like a really interesting movie. Nazis, hidden, government conspiracy. I had been waiting for the DaVinci code for a low budget Nazi version or for boys or even shockwave from Brazil. Instead, you get something quite different, more psychological, from David Lynch. It was actually a plus. But the way the story is spoken is just terrible. <br /> <br /> Some of the problems are pouring. Andrienne Barbeau's character starts moving somewhat scary and fearful. He just doesn't do it at his age, though he certainly tried. Actress as son probably thought it was a comedy. Most other participants seemed to think it was a creepy film, or at least acted like it, not just peculiar. The only thing I thought was daughter Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another big part is the pace. It starts very slowly. So slowly you may be tempted to turn it off. But then it will take some time for you to get into the daughter's suicide and the consequences. But soon after, it will all become a mess. Some of this was expedient, but much of it was just unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and badly focused. The real problem is that it's not just a pleasant movie. It's slow, boring, no character is pleasant. Excessive use of pictures and kits. Some of the movies you see in the characters are tortured. This is the viewer. It has some horrible moments, especially horrible Nazi paintings and credit, but the rest of the movie is mostly tiring.
