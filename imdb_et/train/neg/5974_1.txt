Let me start by saying it doesn't look like a movie. Just another TV show about popular girls and boys who don't have a real movie language seems to be backed up. <br /> <br /> Camera corners are so straight that the story is said to be the easiest way to keep the public from joining it. This film takes us to a place where we have never seen a movie: a field where a movie theater becomes a warm medium that gives the public an element of interpretation. Too obvious. The big movie is only used as an expanded TV, where we see all the attributes of these women alive in larger ways. <br /> <br /> Recently, it seems that young directors are threatening to sell the art of making a film. It's very scary. The industry is breaking the film in movies. We need to educate ourselves and our children about cinematography and its language. Not only sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch platform for young people and jockeys.
