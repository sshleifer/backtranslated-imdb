This movie is a pure mistake. I'm a fan of Steve Martin, but even he doesn't save tired ideas and a Swiss cheese script. Think of "Police Academy 7" and use it for a military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I don't feel that other user comments reflect that this movie is badly rated (and rightly served!). This is extremely misleading. I've often seen this movie at $ 3.00 in a grocery store and now I know why. <br /> <br /> If I could get my 90 minutes back ...
