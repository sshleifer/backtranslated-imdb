Interestingly, it works; was not bad, just not enough. It was quite flat, special effects and lines were not the only culprit for this failure. Standing alone, they were not terribly bad, but a tragic movement put together. The show seemed long and slow with special effects that were obviously meant to speed up the movie, but it failed completely. <br /> <br /> Much of this disaster was accused of special effects. they were cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. Although he might have chosen everything they had, they had some fan certificate. An experienced actor would have brought something like Appleby did. Scfi puts out some very good original films, it's just too bad that it failed so drastically.
