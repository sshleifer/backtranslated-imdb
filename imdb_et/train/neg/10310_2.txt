Lorenzo Lamas stands for certain types of CIA agents who capture some exotic beauty called Alexa, robbing her daughter and forcing her to fight former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to provide the performance of non-talented bands. I have to admit that I'm not Lorenzo Lamas or his films. She stinks. But compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas's comedian Kinmont, Lamas seems to be, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA, because O.J Simpson's trial is again interesting, you see, because if your parents had a cable and additional channels, you couldn't escape this movie. In 1994, you could go to the Amish community and enjoy it on your portable TV. The film is a collection of flat action sequences and would be intrigue, although O.J Simpson's shocking value that jumped after the change and replacement of the fireballs would be one liner that gives inadvertent humor. Where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make it a perfect camp class? <br /> <br /> * 4- (bad)
