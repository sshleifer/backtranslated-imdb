I was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not survive the plaster leap across the box. Having said that the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a unique room and the house was pretty spooky, but it just stayed with me. Waiting for this great AHHHHH or BOO! But it never came. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was plagued by poor filming of bad special effects. So it shows a lot of bad and not using the atmosphere and the imagination of the viewer to create horror and intercourse. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube if you're looking for a low-budget but well-designed horror movie.
