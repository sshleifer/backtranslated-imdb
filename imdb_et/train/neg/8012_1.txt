Like lesbian, I always watch movies related to gays and lesbians. With such a mess - it is enough to discourage the audience. <br /> <br /> I was expecting something to happen - something! make no sense. Did not happen. It was just pointless scenes that were in no way connected in any way. The film did not convey any story or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After hours or more of this mess I just turned it off. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time in this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 Star - and it doesn't even deserve it.
