Spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, nothing in this movie happened to an unexplained bleeding woman. Secondly, it was not scary. Third, it was the worst sound of any movie. Let me clarify. Sound edited by either Beavis or Butthead ?? I'm not sure what, then we just go with Beavis. The film gradually becomes increasingly silent and the people mumble and moles, forcing you to show the volume (I looked at it at home). Then Beavis captures some really loud sounds with allegedly scary / shocking images, forcing you to reduce the volume again. This happens many times until the movie ends. I can laugh at Beaver ridiculously behind the two-way mirror and see that the test group reaches the remote control each time. If you have children and you prefer watching movies after going to bed, this is a big mistake. But then it is still a big mistake. Here's the idea? if you intend to make a horror film, add at least a vineyard, a 19-year-old blonde girl screaming at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater, someone's wall shadow camera is eating alive only from the camera type, the camera is thrown into the camera to scare the audience, somewhat weird, with a manic laugh, or a monster who looks like an aluminum foil-covered stage (la TV's Lost in Space). These people didn't try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
