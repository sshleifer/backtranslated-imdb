Medellin is a great place to live, work and study. I've been there twice and I never heard anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitaries, hostages, or something. There is an "invisible police" but it is not * a big brother. The police are just about to be visible in everyday life, but they don't bother anyone without good reasons. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting documentary that young people in the film are essentially characters. The film directors carefully look at the plot features between the daily activities of the residents of La Sierra, and if the "character" dies, there is a true sin. However, it is hard to imagine that all three youngsters are all members of Bloque Subway, which has previously been terrorized by Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is not an exact description of Colombian life; Of course, such things as small crime, are cautious, but if you remember that pocketing takes place in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia doesn't seem so different. The Colombians are eagerly awaiting their opportunity to show the world that once the war-attacked state is booming more than ever.
