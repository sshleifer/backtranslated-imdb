I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juha Chawla is in it, he's a great actor. <br /> <br /> This movie contains six tracks. This is a new concept that flew from Hollywood. So this is not a new point. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. He wants to become famous and make a boyfriend to keep the news journalists interested. But then, Rahul (Salman Khan) will appear and he claims to be his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actor. If he screams, I get angry. Salman khan can't play comics. But in his serious parts he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seem (Juhi Chawla). He gets in the middle of a crisis of life and attracts him to a much younger woman, forgetting what he really is in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil Capor en The driver is a natural born actor / actress. They're great. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) marries Gia (Ayesha Takia), but she gets a cold leg and blows a wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). He gets an accident and has a memory loss. Now she doesn't know she loves her man anymore. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is the driver of the cab. She meets Stephen (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman in love with an Indian man, but she plans to marry an Indian woman. Raju must bring Staphan to this person, but he loves him. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda movies. He's very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I liked it very much, as it has grown in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! It's Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who is just married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to do a serious job with him, but every time his family arrives. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a beautiful actress, but she is funny! I like her movies. <br /> <br /> It's a problem now. Not all of these stories are interesting. One story of six interesting nature doesn't make the whole movie interesting! Here and there, the stories touch each other, but are not important for the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can't act! Free this woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies, this role was too small for him. Salman Khan can't play a comic role but real serious movies. It's written as an actor of his life. This film sucks and has good actors and actors such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's like you have a chance to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing lullaby.
