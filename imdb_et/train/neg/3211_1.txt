And it falls exactly into the "awesomely bad" category - ie the drunken students of the movie would rent to get an extract. I was at the sci fi film festival and everything I remember is a hysterical laughter wave after that movie premiere. Other criticisms better describe the feces of this film, and I felt that it was a bad man from a manufacturing company that had grown up, apparently to assess the audience's reaction. What he got was a sci fi equivalent to a student's drunken audience, and after a "serious" anime movie, it was in my opinion "heavenly blue", the audience was in the mood, and then the movie opened and after a few seconds all the rooms ran on the islands. Describe the worst parts: <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie, it lies along a linear and predictable path with a randomly thought-out side. Garbage but extremely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Animation: Poorly made and assembled when you get heroes with heroic and gradual heroic costumes (I know I can!), then look at the assembly where he "trasforms" the Swedish peasant LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: So one-dimensional painful, has a short background (with side-sharing dialogs) and little light is reflected by the actual motivation behind some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, briefly, do you have a closed audience and some drinks around you (try and make sure they're back in alcohol to relieve the pain), then slide this movie into a DVD and enter. " Mystery Theater Theater 3000 ". There is no other motivation to watch this movie laugh, and it is not meant for comedy. DO NOT KNOW THIS MOVIE ONE. With Colin Farrell, as a "New World", the solo can be even more boring because you can't laugh at ridicule with a friend or two people.
