Some of the filmmakers involved in this series have made some really great movies, but they certainly don't see much in this series. Especially in writing. OK, the first season was somewhat better, but the new episodes they create just stink. I'm a big fan of horror and I think the vast majority of these episodes are garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just a typical made of Hollywood crap, uninteresting, childish, poorly designed and in some cases ridiculous. Like Crypt Tales, the only good one in this series is the great nudity! Other then this series blows hard. Sometimes it seems to me that they hired the eighth grade to write episodes. Maybe they did.
