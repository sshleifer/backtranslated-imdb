This is one very bad movie. I've racked my brain and I can't make a positive comment. Operation is cruel. I've seen more plausible actions on a cable connection. The plot is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, the President's secret recordings, and the shark that attacks something that goes close to it should have been the worst thing to do. Sharks' night is not so bad that it is good. The dialog sounds and is given as if it were written in seconds before filming it. And when it's over, the sharks at night are the worst sound I've ever heard. I'm surprised that my ears didn't start to bleed in the 80s. Synthesized sounds that someone really bothered with. <br /> <br /> What I read was the Italian film industry dead in 1987. sharks are the coffin's final pound.
