Interestingly, the novel of the two films has developed without a plot. While The Heiress was good, if not completely accurate, the Washington Square was difficult and tangible, except for the part of Dr Sloper that could have been so much better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to make "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I really cut. It has no underestimated and simple beauty that a film that has no plot, such as Onegin. I agree with other remarks about depicting Leighi Catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy; he made me despise him not to know him. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from childish confidence to adult cynicism, the whole story point, was entered as it was in the novel. But we don't have a narrative voice to tell us about it in the movie! I think somebody left an adaptation class in a film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's efforts to make a moving and beautiful movie out of heavy text, but it just doesn't work.
