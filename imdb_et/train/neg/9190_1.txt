This is still a sight I have ever watched. I've seen some pretty terrible movie, but it takes a cake, no, wait, I mean the whole fucking bakery. It is so bad that I believe in the word to describe how you feel after this fear has been created. Please do yourself a favor if you ever want to watch it and watch thirty minutes of this annoying purple dinosaur from Barney, then multiply it three times and you will only get a small portion of the horror you would save for. All in all, I think you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you are ready to be worst in business and a totally pointless story meaningless. <br /> <br /> Real Rating, -10 Nasty
