If you look back at another bad nightmare, like Freddy's revenge, you must at least give him a try. And while The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it offers something new to the series. Yes, there are creative deaths as usual, like a child who is part of a comic book and faced with "Super Freddy", but even scenes that are not accustomed to their full potential and parts without Freddiv are just bored. <br /> This marked the official death of a series of indignity. Freddy seems to be a comic relief ... but what? <br /> <br /> My Rating: 4/10
