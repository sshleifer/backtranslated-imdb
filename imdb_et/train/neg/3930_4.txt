The Second Renaissance, Part 1, shows us how the machines rebelled against people for the first time. Everything starts with one case where machines claim to have the right to live, while people claim that the robot has something they own and that is why they can do something they want. <br /> <br /> Although this is an interesting assumption, it becomes very foolish between robots and humanity ever since. Somehow it doesn't seem right, because another reviewer points to it, it's all too crazy. <br /> <br /> Animatrix stories that are closer to the core of the matrix (especially Osiris). In the second part of the second Renaissance, I would say it is too violent and too silly. 4/10.
