A wig woman who "dyes" her hair in the middle of a movie (= takes a wig) probably won't see what the viewers see miles away: <br /> <br /> *** start a spoiler announcement * ** that her husband interacts with her best girlfriend and they both try to get rid of him. *** End of spoiler warning *** <br /> <br /> And what spoiler was: the title already gives it, isn't it? Bad operation, bad script: waste of time Oh yes: finally he lives happily ever after ... <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, you really love love "Cannibal Women Avocado Deathle of Death."
