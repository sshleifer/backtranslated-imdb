No, just joking. It was pious. <br /> <br /> I watched my local Sci-fi station last night, which plays films every night for a month. This month it's "Space Turkeys, or: how did I learn to stop worrying and loving bombs"? Movies are so bad that they never need to be done. It was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is terribly terrible with two exceptions, gore make-up (which showed potential) and editing (which is a bit of a movie other than terrible). The procedure is terrible, dialogue is terrible, script, direction. It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two special effect forms, space and stock. I'm focusing on gore. Looking at this movie, I thought, "What was the motivation for making this movie?" People like to do things, but I was hesitant to think anyone could have benefited from it. I came to the conclusion that this film was made to enlarge the man's demo track of makeup effects. He (Rick Baker) actually went to a pretty good career, he has worked with STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), GAMES (1996) and even POSSIBLE USE WOMAN (1981), as well as many other noticeable tabs. Besides, I can't say that I've ever seen a real, lively mating man - incredible or otherwise - but I have to say that it seemed to be a fair representation. <br /> <br /> Now that I think bad editing, I usually mean a scene where someone is talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps on its shoulder or something. This movie really highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms. Specifically, scenes that are too long and completely useless. For almost every scene that was longer than it should have, a bit of a dead air in this crazy long screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. And this split head in the river, the head is thrown into the river (slowly), the film continues for a few minutes and then we cut down to floating on and see how it falls down the waterfall. Although I'm sure they were all proud of their proud head, WHAT IS HELL? <br /> <br /> Finally, I mention the running fat lady / slowed scene right from the start. Jerky's slow motion tells me they didn't let the scene move slowly, but later decided it was "not working" and then slowed it down. Oy vey. In any case, if you ever see another movie where a hysterical greasy woman runs down in the hall and then directly closed, with a glass door - all slowly, remember - remember the POSSIBLE USE because * it * is all where it all started. <br /> <br /> Such movies can best be viewed at home with friends. It is usually slow slowly, but it is even more time to come out with one single liner. It's not the worst of the worst, but it's pretty bad.
