<br /> <br /> Take out your brewskies and enjoy this bad action. Speakman's remarkable camping skill (nice spin kicks, decent sticks - bad couch!) Is the only redeeming quality film that just cries out of bad behavior. The plot is not half bad; just badly executed. But if you see something other than martial arts, you won't lose the ship completely. And for a movie that should be held in Koreatown, there are too few Korean actors (even extras).
