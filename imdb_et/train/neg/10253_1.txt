Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to look at his whole work. He is known to have recorded movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers from a low budget and its production values ​​are disturbing. Please ... for Christopher's love .... avoid this movie!
