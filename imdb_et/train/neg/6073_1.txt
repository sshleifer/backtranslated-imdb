* Many many spoilers in this review * This movie was terrible. I'm a big baseball fan so I thought I'd look at it and I was very disappointed. It started okay .. When I saw the bad effect of DeNirot on his young son, I hoped he would get the whole movie or something better. Anyway, it seemed at first that DeNiro should have been the main character. He was the only one who believed Bobby, and had his divine son who had lost custody, which gave me a reason to feel bad. He wanted to help Bobby talk to Primo if he absolutely did not kill Primo's death ... Let's talk about this sketching song "I WANT TO **** YOU !!!!" Later, when DeNiro rescued Bobby's son from sinking, I hoped the film could redeem itself. He can forgive himself for killing Primo when he saved Bobby's son. Of course it is far from the depth of the movie, because everything he cares about gets CREDIT for murder and steals Bobby's son, car and dog and keeping them hostage Bobby just has to go home and report that DeNiro is a "real fan" when he shows a picture of how he bites the knife. <br /> <br /> Now we finally end up with a totally unrealistic scene ... It pours like hell and we're supposed to be not called. Then DeNiro somehow appears in a magical place for the judge and calls Bobby out at home, pulling his knife out and starting for anyone running out. Apparently there are no officials in the field (but the police are on the way), so DeNiro is on the hill and prepares the cord to throw Bobby when he dies. But don't worry, this cheerful and pleasant movie is happy because Bobby finds his son. <br /> <br /> This is not a sports movie. It's not about a fan. I know that fans are not rabies who threaten, rob and throw knives in their admiration. This is probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The plot was low, the soundtrack was sucked, the film had no purpose. I warn you that you won't waste your time on this nasty apology to the film.
