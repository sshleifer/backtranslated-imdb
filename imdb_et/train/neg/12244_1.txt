This movie is terrible. CGI is a very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray gray. The worst thing is that there is no effort at all to walk or look. This is mostly a CGI with photo editing that you almost need to see that the CGI movement is moving on the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. <br /> <br /> Apart from the terrible lack of special effects, typical inexpensive actors are likely to work as local eateries / waiters when they wait for their big breaks. Perhaps the ridiculous scene of this film is when one of the bad guys trying to sexually attack Kate and the giant crocodile jumps directly from the water to the second floor of the Villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad boy away from Kate instead of crashing directly through the building (and crushing it) Kate), Croc just flies back at the same angle with water. The laws of physics cannot be applied to this film or to the special effects. There is at least honor among the crocodiles.
