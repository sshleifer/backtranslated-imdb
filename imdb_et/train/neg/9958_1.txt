If you have an extremely light, regressive, self-conscious, anti-civilization, anti-civilization juvenile, then this is the perfect film. A very poorly written, often unheard of dialogue and an unpleasantly tiring hand-held camera collection, this is a film that introduces the world in an appealingly simplified, maniacal way: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests, and doctors) are unreliable and tempt the best and worst-case predators. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is the abundance of primary yelling (astonishment) and adoptive regression (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the woods, where utopia is in the form of a carving side. forests (of course ...). Shows all the weaknesses of the first movie and more.
