The plot is a plausible but banal, i.e. beautiful and neglected wealthy and powerful person with a psychotic hunk, trying to cover it as psychological sleeves. But evolving from there is unpleasantly illogical. Despite the resources at the disposal of the ordinary pair, who have money and influence, it seems that our privileged hero and heroine see only one domestic, their lawyer and local police (who say they can't do anything) when they alternate and arrest. terror. They do not have private security personnel (only the misused security system they fail), housekeepers or employees, drivers, etc. Even, apparently, there are no tools to hire private-minded nurses who take care of the hero when he suffers from life-threatening injuries, leaving a man and a woman alone and vulnerable in his own house. Our heroine is the brain of the doorstep and our hero, the tycoon, behaves unlikely and irrationally. Production is offensive to spectators who wasted their time and criminals because they have destroyed the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what they thought). And the shame on the Lifetime TV, which offends the intelligence of this audience for its embarrassing offer.
