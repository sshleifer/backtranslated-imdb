I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another movie, so when I saw $ 5.50 for Walmart, I bought it. Though the film is lightly amusing, it didn't really hit the pace. Some scenes, such as the party scene at the bar, continue for too long and do not really have any purpose. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, there is a preaching scene at the end of the movie that gives the whole movie a bad taste when I'm worried. I don't think this scene was added to the movie at all. I don't like foolish comedies that try to teach me a lesson written by some 60-year-olds especially! <br /> <br /> Finally, although I'm happy to have another Hawni movie, I'm not sure that the money I paid for it was really worth it!
