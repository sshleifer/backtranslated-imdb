The film is bad. There is no other way to say that. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a "walker" really cares about. I felt like I was watching the movie from the 70s. The subject was simply not credible for 2007, even if it is set in DC. I think it was true for everyone else who was watching it, because applause was small and fast at the end. Most of them did not stay with Q&A. Many scenes seemed to be short if they were never ready or he just didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try and think about what was going on. I also couldn't become a Woody (Carter) privacy or boyfriend. What were all the "artistic" male and torture (from Iraqi prisons)? What did he mean? I think it was his very bad attempt to create this dark private subculture for the character of Woody (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. You really felt that a "walker" might be similar (say 20 years ago). He was great and probably would never understand it. <br /> <br /> Like Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Bored. <br /> <br /> Don't see it! It's painful! If you are not a true Harrelson fan.
