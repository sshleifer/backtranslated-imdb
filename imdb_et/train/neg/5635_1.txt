I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I'm wasting a few hours of my life watching this movie, I still don't think I managed to watch it all. Was there really a point about the movie, and the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this terrible pointless movie merciless apology! but is Dafoe married or seen in this movie a terrible actor in real life, if so, was it an attempt to start his own career? if so I'm afraid it must have failed .. <br /> <br /> I'll post it I hope I can actually put someone out of watching this movie, even if one person follows my comments and decides that they would rather look for color drying, I feel I have done good in the world if I had the same advice ...
