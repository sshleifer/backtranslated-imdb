Somehow they total 60, ten years that radically changed our country in four hours. And what was painful for four hours. They trivialized the main events and events and "claimed" that it was about two families, but you hardly saw an African-American family. If I were NBC, I would be ashamed and embarrassed to incite such a trash. It was funny that the happy happy family you saw at the beginning were tortured in so many ways, but managed to participate in every big 60th event across the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They dedicated five or six scenes to this family. This poor son ... Please NBC, don't make any movies from other ages .... leave it on the PBS and the history channel
