I watched the whole movie through the shameful end, even though I felt so angry that I saw. I felt that the director screamed for attention and the only way he could achieve it was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I have lived in the UK, I have loved this country, but this film represents the worst imagined British youth. There is nothing to say, but to prevent it, it makes you angry and sick. Involved people should be ashamed.
