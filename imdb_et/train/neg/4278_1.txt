Just picked this movie to hit National Wholesale Liquidators and after that, I feel I have been ripped. <br /> <br /> I don't know I've seen a worse movie than this. Honestly. And I will never write a negative review of the film if I didn't have such a great respect for the theme, Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? This is a musical biography? Yes, there are a lot of Foster stories here, and here are the pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that more than miss the Mississippi delta. I mean, somebody got MIS to write this generation? Second, Foster's real story is exciting. Why not even close to it? Third, what did they have on the big Ray Middleton to make this movie? Pictures of her little boys? Communists? What a waste of great talents. <br /> <br /> So Foster's friends and truth and good entertainment are afraid ... to be very, very scared.
