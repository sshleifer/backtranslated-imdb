I bought this DVD set without seeing it and wish I wasn't. The script needed serious rewriting because it seems to be completely unlikely and seems like a book. Lighting is terrible, very polished, but if it were just to forget it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly any introduction to the various characters, making it difficult to distinguish who is (especially on airplanes - not sure who dies). <br /> <br /> I have long felt that the key to a good movie is that the audience takes care of the characters; if you don't have that, you have nothing. No attention to the characters at all - you never knew them - who they were, what they liked. What made them do what they do. The series is 5 hours long and divided into 6 parts ... I bet you don't know what they were doing all the time they didn't fill the characters --- they put it in a lot of filler. I say that it takes at least the whole hour to watch them land and take off on their planes (I mean we have to see it again and again?). I would have given it a much higher rating if they simply improved our knowledge of characters.
