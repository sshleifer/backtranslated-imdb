Williamson's accent is tough to overcome. He speaks incredibly fast as he is on fast lines. During solo cars, he acts as if he were talking to someone if he had to talk to himself. All this and his bald on the ground just disturbed me. He was too old for this role. Perhaps, when reading other Williamson accounts, he was given this role because he was crazy and the director decided to do a bit of a life-imitating art or compulsion. When actors announce Hamlet crazy, believe it! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and can get into the role of Ophelia and still get a passport. The set is dark and predictive, but it looks like a real castle, especially the scenes of tunnels / corridors, where the dead king shines in the light of heaven.
