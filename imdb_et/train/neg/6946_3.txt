I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years) and then enjoyed it. I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. The second time was not pleasant. Operation is "so, so", the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Actors ... I'm sure these characters couldn't play these characters. The plot ... in hell is not such that these women would be much less likely to be abducted. (Note: Why TT didn't think that even if he had collected money for his trial, they would ask where he got it, and he would not have a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a cramp!). It is terribly stereotyped by black women, basically saying that the only way black women can "win" the system or get a lot of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. He plays too much sympathy for b / c, all of them die eventually (bar Jada), but it's not sad (you mean they were so stupid they deserve to die). You just don't care about the characters if you're not a low person. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie will appreciate over 5.
