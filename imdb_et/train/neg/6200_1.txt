This is the most disturbing film I've ever seen. This makes "Requiem for a Dream" a Disney movie. Although technically well done, acting, cinematography, music, management, etc. are good. At the same time, the gang rape scene is the most terrible and violent thing I've ever seen, and I really wouldn't have seen it. I'm afraid it will haunt me for the rest of my life. While I think someone finds the movie extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were sacrificed in a very similar way and I didn't need a clear reminder of the horror they experienced. I saw a movie at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX and no majority or team was present. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to defend violence in my film, which I felt excessive, free and unnecessary. The earlier scene successfully delivered the mood they were trying to catch, but without rubbing their face in extreme and explicit sexual violence. This film should have a large warning sign. For these reasons, I would not recommend seeing anyone. You have been warned.
