A film about small cities with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. The new family is moving, writing overwritten dialogue, mediocre action, green salad with carrots, and every other Mormon joke known inside. Anyone outside of the Mormon culture is hard to bother with this film. Anyone in the culture of Mormon is a little funny here and there. You're much better off watching Hessa's other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.), if you're trying to sit through it. Action is mediocre. Jared Hess has hands on high quality films such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleonic Dynamite". I would recommend both films for this rage.
