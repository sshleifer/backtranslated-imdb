I am very surprised to see this film on a high level and a few reviews that have to be positive. I saw the movie and I was pretty broken. I didn't find it very enjoyable. It was slow and had no entertaining value. Even the scenes of murder are weak, real close-ups of general buttons that don't look good at all. And the supposed big twist is not really much, I saw it coming in and then ended up just looked like a cliche. This movie may not mention much, but the little he gets is overpriced. I don't recommend this movie.
