I went to see this film with the most positive expectations. I had seen Jacquet's previous movie (Penguin March) and heard a very positive view of the radio. But I was seriously disappointed. Most importantly, this movie is terribly boring. The word literally does NOT happen. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both smiled, because I can only do things like he has, and then in the spring, and then there is an eagle and a river, and once it is dark and the girl goes to the cave, and the second time the fox children and so on. After about half an hour, I started sighing, waking up, rolling my eyes, relaying the church to the church, and hoping it was about to end. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended, I was so deep in my chair that I had to be a bit like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the film are (a) The girl who is obviously to give the children to whom it is known. She wears the same clothes throughout the film (one year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: joy and seriousness. She's cute, there's nothing about it. But such a film about the beauty of nature would have been better without its all-human presence. I found myself constantly hoping that he could eat the bear, sink into the river, or something terrible. (b) A commentary on a girl's adult voice that does not tell us anything but is void, obvious, boring and redundant. (c) Music that is desperately lacking. When the girl jumps happily, the music jumps too. When the fox threatens the eagle, the music becomes threatening. It reminded me of the very early days of filmmaking and was just too predictable. It is true that many children who saw the movie with me probably liked it, at least they somehow participated. So my warning is only for adults: if you are over ten years old, don't avoid this movie. In most places you can sleep better (and cheaper).
