=== Small Spoilers === <br /> <br /> I'm like many other big Jerry Bruckheimer fans. So when I saw all the beautiful posters that were ahead and the trailer came before MI: 2, expectations increased. Production by Jerry Bruckheimer. Large cars. Nic Cage and fresh from Oscar-Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? Much. <br /> <br /> The script is not funny (what it is really hard to do) or exciting. You put a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh! Do You Have Comedy? I do not belive. The excitement is completely out of the picture. First of all (and it has probably been said several times) there are no sympathetic signs of caring about who is being killed? If you can expect the stomach to kill a Nico brother if he steals 50 days in 4 days, then the next thing you know is that Kip (brother) is walking on the streets of Nice. Is that a thrill? Think not. Then comes the best bit - romance between Nic and Angelina. He seems bored that he has to keep all these foolish lines to tell Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone?" "What went wrong?" etc. <br /> <br /> Then there's another spark of hope: the car runs. At least they are disappointing because the trailer saw it as it was full, and only one. Very long, caught in irritating passionate camera movement. I really had problems with the following. <br /> <br /> So is this a feature film? a thriller? romantic comedy? There is no need to decide, just avoid this terrible mess. I give 3 out of 10 stars and I feel I am generous.
