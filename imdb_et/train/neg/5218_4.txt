All movies are elements of bad evening: dialogue with biological techno-babbles, wrinkles, balsa-wood, the terrifying Casio score of the 80s and the overall look that refers to the Sci-Fi programming schedule, about 1993. Although "Metamorphosis "Begins a lot of promise, leaves the film an uncomfortable idiot and MST3K-style cheese, as Clark Kent wannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is putting pressure on his secret projects. But if he tests his vague test of himself, he becomes a vaguely defined being (which carries more than a passing similarity to "Dr. Freudstein" from "House by Cemetery"). The work of FX is quite good for this apparently low budget production (although I suspect that most of it is being kept in the shade for the reason), but in general, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro aftertaste on its guts, in spite of its hopes of otherwise sinking. I can't help but agree with one final character: "(It was) a nightmare ... from the past!"
