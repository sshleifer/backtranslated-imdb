I loved this movie as a child, but I saw it again 20 years later. Top Academy can be before 1980, but today there is almost nothing to offer! Movies, such as Caddyshack and Stripes, are much better off today than this steaming dog. Lack of R&D. No big jokes, except for one liner we've heard about a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought a DVD in the hope that it would be a pearl I remember. Well, I was away! There were only 2-3 widely recognized hits on the sound track (not the other smash compilation) and frequent voice calls were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was to predict what the character's characters were before they told them. Yeah, I watched this movie so much back! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give two cents why this film should be forgotten. (
