I had no huge expectations for this movie when renting it for $ 1 in a video store, but the box showed at least a small promise with a "killer cut" more gore! Can't go wrong there! Well ... it goes without saying that the box is a scam. How did the actors and actors of this caliber make this crap for such a low film? <br /> <br /> It all opens up with a drunken college girl who is walking in a frat house or some other building and says some of her boyfriend (?) is useless if her camera is following her bad status. Then he gets some dude in a transparent plastic mask and the other grabs. They split his wrist for no real reason and see when they "cut" him, that someone pulled out the cut that looks like a pencil. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same topic as the girl starts chasing / two friends immortally for about 84 minutes. Add one title image. This is Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have posed a problem with this movie if the box wasn't disappointed when I rented it. When I rent a bad movie that says we have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! One inflatable picture in 85 minutes, when the chick is clearly androgenic and gore, which does not scare the child, does not cut it. If this is Killer Cut, what is the theater cut? Of course, I doubt that this garbage was actually placed in theaters. Shame on the actors in this movie. I saw they make their screen debut here because they haven't done anything before, but they all were created before it was released. I don't know if it was filmed before they were all created and the studio sat on the film until they were half-big names or not. But what do I want to know is .... they actually spent $ 14 million on this movie!
