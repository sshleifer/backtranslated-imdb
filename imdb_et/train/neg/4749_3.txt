This movie was so badly written and directed that I slept through the film for 30 minutes. The jokes in the movie are funny and although the plot is interesting in some sense, it is too far drawn and in some cases ridiculous. If you are 11 years old or older, you will forget about writing a movie and you are disappointed, but if you are 10 years old or younger, this is a film that captures your attention and is surprised by all the stunts (which I can add badly) and wish to be some warriors. Choosing this movie was not very good and the music was very disappointing because it was like they tried to build up the tension, but it didn't fit at all. 1-10 on a graduated scale (10 is great, 1 is terrible) is in the movie 4. Brenda Song is a talented comedy, but with this type of film, in some more serious scenes, her acting was ridiculous. When he did some of his "struggle", I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely leadership, for example, the part where his enemy is the person who has the evil villain, how his voice becomes dark and evil, I think it was incredibly stupid and how Wendy (Brenda Song) the teachers were all his teachers in the school who were in the possession of the monks, which was quite ridiculous. So suppress all this, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or under.
