Whether it is a remake and a thing (1982/1951), I think it is that there are so many factors in previous films that deny it. <br /> <br /> So the actor is bad, James Spader makes the superlow Stargate restart himself, his cafe and his somewhat strange thinking / movement, but that's not what other actors did not notice. You don't know someone from the main characters. And the plot is slow, boring, and I know what's going on in 30 minutes. The result / music is highly evolving, there are many people who offer coke and credit, but it's a lot. Some of the special effects are beautiful when they were made in the early 90s. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and excitement, don't wear this movie. Its dull combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay output is really very bad. Now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they were doing, and the only one who knew it was no one. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen much worse, I wouldn't recommend this movie. but if you are one cold night and you just want to complain, the time goes on slowly.
