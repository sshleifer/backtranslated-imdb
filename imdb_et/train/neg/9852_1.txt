Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed. This fantasy is modeled after the "Walking with Dinosuars" series. Although it is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological sense. Even mixing fantasy dragons with T-rex and dinoside extinction. Adding Sci-Fi to an educational institution, which shows that it shows that this exhibition is genuine. <br /> <br /> There are about 7.5 / 10 entertainment in your presentation. But I have to give it a way to present it. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any fantasy problems, but they do it wrong. I really see that young children and slow adults believe they found a dragon and that it is real. <br /> <br /> I also think it will weaken the great "Walking with dinosuars" series, because now you have to look at how much of this mini-series fantasy is.
