Yes, talk about the bad results. Rick Moranis once again marks the funny and fun "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" in this terrible third order. Basically, the concept plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults, not with the shrinking of the children, and with the courtyard instead of the garden to study the universe. If you think it sounds interesting, think again. The film is boring, at best embarrassing at worst. <br /> <br /> First of all, the series's consistency is completely rinsed out of the toilet. The only remaining actor in the first movie is probably Rick Moran. The actor who plays his wife has changed, the children play the actors have changed, the people playing the neighbors have changed ... you call it. They are trying to believe that this is the same family, but the results are puzzling to say at least. All the little jokes (and hardly there) and the dangerous situations in the movie are copied directly from Honey I Shrunk the Kids. <br /> <br /> Third problem, special effects. I'm sure it's done in a smaller budget, but they're pathetic, as much worse than the rest of the series. You should admire the small examples that explore a large domestic area, but you will probably be getting the most out of time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem to find inside the house is just boring. Only a few things happen and when they happen, they are not at all exciting. The first film was fun, because the kids were dealing with nature, grass and the errors that lived there. It is about dealing with the trap of dust, bangs and cockroaches (adults who come rather bored with children). Nasty. <br /> <br /> I don't know why the idea of ​​unlocking such a tragedy for already fatal series was appealed by Disney's leaders, maybe because they had to cash in without spending five minutes. I warn you: leave this tasteless cash waste where it should stay: getting dust on the shelves of the store.
