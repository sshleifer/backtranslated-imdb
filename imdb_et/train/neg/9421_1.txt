If you like watching Mel Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel, you might want to enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another movie that is so bad that it can never be distributed. I can only confirm the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is better quality, but the movies at night and in the dark have been so badly made that everythings look red. I thought first of all that my DVD players were confused. It wasn't. If you want to watch it, I suggest that you adjust the color of the TV until it is black and white. If you don't, you can never get through the movie. When you do, he reminds you of the poor film students who are trying to revive the Pulp Fiction style.
