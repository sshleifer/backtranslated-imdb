I'm one of the millions of Columbo drug addicts all over the world and watched it in the British Channel 5. It's exciting to think about what's coming from this so-called movie, and I can only wonder who noticed the huge potential of Columbo and added all the small touches that make it so a wonderful and classic series. This means that this particular film is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode and the patronizing British episode). If Columbo had been made according to the original "pilot", it would not have gone very long or would be traceable and lovable around the world. In this movie, Columbo is smartly dressed, rides a normal car, has a partner, doesn't talk about his alleged relatives and is so aggressive. There are also no mouse and mouse themes between the columbo and the "villain". Traceable, but only to see the novelty of how Columbo started.
