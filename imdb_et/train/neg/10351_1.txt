This movie was barely a movie story. There were no interesting points in the book in the film. They made it difficult for the "tween" Disney movie "crush" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that Hillary Duff should have played that part or one of the nice ones. This film was nothing more than insulting the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can't believe Disney would even be able to get the basic renditions of such a cheap one. If you have ever read a book, I think you would agree that it could easily be made equivalent to "Lord of the Rings". This film should never have used the title of A Wrinkle in Time. Bad done.
