I entered the theater, which was going to be entertained after a pleasant 90 minutes. I didn't stay entertained or enlightened. This film can't think of what it wants to be and what is no longer. There are some funny features and some incredibly pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows - it's about coming down!). Though none of the characters treat much respect, over thirty gays get the worst: all predators, fats, sad, slippery. If you're in the mood for a movie that deals with gay relationships, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. Thank you. <br /> <br />
