The Christmas story is a classic of vacation and my favorite movie. So of course I was alive when this movie was released in 1994. I saw it on the opening day and was ready to enjoy myself. I came empty and digged. Assumption that is true at Christmas is curious about this confusion. Red Ryder BB Gun is better to get than a Chinese top. And it's not very funny at all. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stops there. Bottom line: 1 star. Don't even bother.
