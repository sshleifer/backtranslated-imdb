Yes, a lot of shouting, yelling, rejoicing, debating, celebrating, fisting, high fiving & fighting. You have a general idea why you can never be 100% sure. The knowledge of the Navy would be an advantage for the finer points, but then there would probably be many mistakes. Not a terrible movie and Hackman & Washington is not their usual brilliant, but the plot was one that could be tied up very early. I'm still waiting to see a submarine movie where people are in contact with each other and don't argue, but then probably there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
