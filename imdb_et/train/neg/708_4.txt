The story and the show were good, but it was really frustrating and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. She really put top-notch performance and her sister played the girl was really fantastic and proud. Seriously I thought he was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I was reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm happy to see the movie before reading the book. This is a bit too "real" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis's tiny little slaves to fight. Eartha Kitt was so horrible and after her character she did what she did. I could hardly show the rest of the show. (Sorry for the vagueness, but I don't want to give up) Sorry, but it's not just my example type.
