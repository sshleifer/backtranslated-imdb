I'm a high school 11th grade student. In my current world affairs class, my class child had this video and suggested watching. So we did. I firmly believe that we were going to hear that my father was working with NASA. Although I think this film is the biggest mess I have ever seen, the man who created it is serious balls. First he had to show JFK shooting? And how he dares to use all these biblical quotes. The only good thing about this film is that it creates discussions that are good in my class and we have weekly discussions. This movie didn't change my thoughts. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. Michael Moore's next movie could be called "Spetman's 11th Funny Thing" or "Funny thing that happened to the White House".
