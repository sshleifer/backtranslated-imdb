Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most unbelievable couple on the screen with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction breaks uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein thinks that it is a former one and that its small-scale, self-centered roles emphasize the complete lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. Normally, I don't like being ascerbial, but Bell Jar is one of my all-time favorite books, and what they did, makes me literally crazy.
