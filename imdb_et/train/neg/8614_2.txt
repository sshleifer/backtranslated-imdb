I have to admit I'm never a Rodney Dangerfield fan. Indeed, he gets "respect" from me. I only looked at it because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I was expecting: a stupid story without true humor. It's a full-fledged, raw joke and a completely ridiculous plot that circulates around the developer (Dangerfield), which plans to build a ski resort in Utah that just didn't pay attention to me. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield, the film played a weak lie, including Andrew Dice Clay and completely over the hill John Byner (I didn't even know he was still around until I saw his name for that credit.) < It is indeed a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
