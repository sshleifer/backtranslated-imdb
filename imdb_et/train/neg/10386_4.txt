Could it be interesting? Japanese set haunted house story from the newly installed American family? but falls for too simplistic treatment and for both cast and director unsuitability. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem that I often encounter with a domestic fare that is a popular modern renaissance. that the spirits show themselves to be evil, for no other reason than what they expect! What's more, does it do much in fear? giant crab attack is just silly? since the ghosts generally live in a specific character and cause him to act in a completely characteristic way, like Susan George, who attracts a diplomat / family friend Doug McClure and Edward Albert, bringing a daughter into a cup. soup! At one point, the old mung comes to the house to warn Albert of the danger when they stay there? he is finally asked to occupy the buildings. But history is repeatedly repeated and the tragedy is the only result of a tense situation? which leads to a violent, but inadvertently funny climax, where Albert and McClure, who own the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, are killed in a career race! At the end of the day, will this harmless timeframe arise? allowed within 88 minutes but under no circumstances significant viewing.
