This movie is a complete dog. I found that I wanted to laugh so I didn't feel like I was wasting my money - and my time. Writing this movie is absolutely terrible. It is a shame that it does not meet the standards of other Hale Storm films. <br /> <br /> They would have had the money on the D list, like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, to spend money on the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not used correctly to perform his duties. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves you wondering what is the most plot point - including sub-blocks. After watching this movie, I get the impression that the producers hoped to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite humor, where it is not as much a character as a character and a delivery. Unfortunately, this movie can't produce lines, characters, delivery, or humor. I had to go to the dentist instead!
