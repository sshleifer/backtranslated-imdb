This film is an insult to ALL submarines. It was stupid. It seemed to be written by the monkeys. Operation was absurd. If this is the view that most people have in the Navy, then I cry for our defense. This movie was terrible. I put it below "sea to sea" to submarine films. Gene Hackman needs to rent money to make this mess. Denzel Washington must be high. There's no point on a little plot. And the end. To be rewarded for a crime? Only Hollywood thought of this garbage. If you haven't figured it out yet, I didn't like it. And if it wasn't for all the pro comments, I wouldn't have posted.
