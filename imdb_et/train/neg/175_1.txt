I looked at the lake in the afternoon from the US. Given that this film was made for television, it was interesting enough to follow the sequel. So I am tuning tonight to the incitement and I was very disappointed. I knew I wouldn't want a movie, but I didn't expect the DV (digital video) to use it in a puzzled way. The film would have been acceptable if it was not in the adjacent digital shots that seemed to come from somewhere. I was expecting the plot line to be related to these frames, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: NEXT SPOILER !!!!) The cabin at the end of the lake has ended, but the sequel has ended ridiculously. I can only predict that returning the lake will return to the cab to see if anything was shown but infomercials at 4 am.
