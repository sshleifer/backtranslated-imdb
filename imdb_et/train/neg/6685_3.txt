Although the film takes place at the "Ivy League" college, it was completely released in North Arizona, mainly at North Arizona University in Flagstaff in autumn 1976. I was there in the theater department and most of the appearances in the film are members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is an absolutely ridiculous scene (if you know your Arizona geography), which shows a number of cast members traveling from college to stream. We at NAU know that the campus and the stream (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles away, and while the trip is downhill, it would be impossible to go back on the same route on the bike!
