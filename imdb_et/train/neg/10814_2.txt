As a fan of "Jane Eyre", I was glad when this movie came. "Finally," I thought, "somebody makes a movie in this book that follows the author's actual story." Wrong! When the director planned to throw "Jane", who was clear, he certainly succeeded. Certainly he could have found one who could act. Where were the tensions between Jane and Rochester? Where was the horrible relationship of the novel when laughter flew at night seemingly far away? Where were the sparks of the child who flirted and danced like a mother? Finally, why was it changed at the end of the plot? One wonders whether the scriptwriters had actually read the book. What a disappointment
