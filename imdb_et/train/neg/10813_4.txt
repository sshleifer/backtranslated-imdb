The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made). Jane's development of childhood and character was exceptional. Then, as someone said, "Oh, it's too long," and hacked the rest of the story into chips. The main scenes, if any, are merged, combined, and positioned to completely change. There was so little transition or even a scene development that anyone who is not familiar with the story would find it difficult to follow. The big disappointment was that the start opened so much hope and finally it ended.
