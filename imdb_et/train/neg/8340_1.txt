One of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm so bored that I turned it off to watch the news. When I turned it on again, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are some more dreams. Come on, what should I care about? The film must be interesting. The moment you felt the movie was just a dream, when a reasonable filmmaker turns off. Has anyone ever asked me to tell you your dreams and what does it mean to them? This is so !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible.
