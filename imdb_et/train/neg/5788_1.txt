OK, so Mr Agrama's company (associated with some dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi) made Mr Carl Macek a terrifying mish-mash. <br /> <br /> What is this terrible mish-mash I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three completely independent Japanese sci-fi animated series (namely Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added the TONS dialogue, firmly believing that the American audience is too stupid to understand the narrative and artistic value of silence - edited all too strongly for violent content, added to a metaphysical mumbo jumbo called by its worst voice artists by this hell (the song of Reba West was - and still is - intolerable and complete outrage, especially when compared to Mrs. Mari Iijima) ... And the result was A series of 85 episodes with hundreds of consistency issues and plot holes. <br /> <br /> Mecha was, of course, on the bay (especially those on "Macross Saga") and parts of the undamaged plot were good. But whatever Robotech was good was not the result of Macek's work or his voice skills. The reason for this was (not credited - why? Would I be too bold to blame HG for plagiarism)? Japanese creators. Those of us who finally came from a real deal and compared the originals with Robotech now want us to never have contacted Robotech. Of course, the originals are so much better and much more meaningful. <br /> <br /> Robotech is worthy of DID: it called the legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start the Japanese Anime Creator Protection Campaign "Intellectual property from unauthorized and unnecessary reprocessing by talented people like Carl Macek.
