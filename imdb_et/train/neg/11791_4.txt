I can't get it. The film probably has a pretty good budget. He has very good cinematography. It has a pleasant pace, good editing and good management. Then WHY OH WHY did they not employ any final rewriting of the script so it wouldn't be hell and WHY OH Why did they hire such terrible actors who can't get out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. Mostly he looks good and good looks good, but finally you realize that the film wasn't good at all. <br /> <br /> So I would say it's a good production, but a bad movie. Too bad actually. <br /> <br /> And the eel? Come one, really!
