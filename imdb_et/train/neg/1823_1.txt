The character of Jack Black, Tim Dingman, "Dreamer" in Envy's, finds the idea of ​​wealth and success in the aerosol spray "Vapoorize", which is sprayed on dog manure and makes it thin. For a moment, I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product, so I could spray this film on the "stinker" and turn it into thin air. While Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months (this honor goes to the cat in the hat), he gets closed to another glory. <br /> <br /> Not funny, not sad, nothing. Real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> From 0.2 in 10!
