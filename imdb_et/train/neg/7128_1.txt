I am a DVD redline rental dumber person. The pictures of Chicago who made this stupid movie didn't pay Palisades to the Media Group to buy web-based ads at a variety of automotive sites, including a mine with ALEXA rating of 16K. They stopped me from the deal and now I'm $ 16,000 and they wasted a lot of their personal time (Palisades Media Peter Rapport), you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this Film !!! It sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has losers and poor players! <br /> <br /> This movie is Joke
