A pretty crazy bubble that has all black casting trying to figure out who killed a movie enthusiast who was almost ready to go to Hollywood to make it big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? Her potential girlfriend? His Father? His Butler? Newspaper boy? Who knows? And who cares? The result is only a small base and the actors here can not care for me in any way. Why a snake poison as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? It's all right in this music, but there's little, and most of it is "getting it" It's not worth your time. There are better black cast movies.
