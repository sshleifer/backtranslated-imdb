OK, not possible, honestly the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It didn't make any sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no action, just something. <br /> <br /> Here is what I thought when I first saw it for the first time on June 28, 2003 **, this is a spoiler announcement. it is also a lot of complaints to me about how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> ok so the movie starts and the characters are introduced, but there are no characters. as far as I knew the main character was new in this school, but probably not. it also appeared that he lived with himself ... then he was a stepchild ... then his mother was a furious alcoholic who lived with her. not all of his friends apparently had parents nor lived by themselves. <br /> <br /> Now we reach the main plot point, this crazy man has left the shelter crazy and runs rampant. Now our main player is obsessed with this guy and focuses his attention on the unexpected situation of the film. I think I have to skip the main plot element here. The main character was no reason to get hooked. even if this is the reason why not all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes before, suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie continues and it gets fine. they run to school, blah blah blah. but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is working on the show. wait for the crazy guy not to say that basic character, not to do that? it was supposed to be anonymous. <br /> <br /> ah another important piece of parcel has been missed ... the crazy man shouldn't be crazy ... all said he wasn't crazy. but if the story goes on, he is MINIMUM OUT OF MY. but I thought the news people said he wasn't ... um ... <br /> <br /> now the movie is over. Was it closed? WHAT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL? Not only did they not answer the questions asked about the main character, it did not answer any questions about the madman. are these people in the same situation? If so, there are some very basic story lines that don't tend to. if not, what is the point of saying "it's up to you in two weeks." ?? <br /> <br /> * End of the thing ... * <br /> <br /> That's what I was thinking. it is pretty much what I still mean. it is 6 months along the line and if I get it for free, I can give it another chance, but I doubt it. I doubt it.
