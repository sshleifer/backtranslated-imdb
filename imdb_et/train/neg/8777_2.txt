Okay, I was trying to ignore the fact that the real movie about selling EVP was basically me. I explained that hell, I don't believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula so I could live with it. <br /> <br /> But even the movie is very good. It has been expertly done and acted, but it doesn't let you at all. There are several "jump" moments and I watched them easily and thought "yes, I didn't expect it" without jumping. "<br /> <br /> The resolution does not make sense either. If the force behind it is able to do things that seem to be, why hell needs to use buffer? Plus, the end title was absurd. give the film credibility, claiming it is a real thing, but it really has to be at the beginning. But they can't start it because they will give the plot away ... stuck at the end, just put it out like a painful thumb.
