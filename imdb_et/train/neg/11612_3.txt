Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time this movie is played by erm ?? laughs. During a diving trip, the Roman seabed will find a body of blonde beauty with feet that could assume cement. Rome happened right after she had recruited a man-mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome is in immediate danger because it has to investigate some types of mafia who turn the tables to him and that he is himself the main suspect, he has to run away now and hope to settle the case. Portable Sinatra tries to sell us flat jokes and makes us believe she is a good detective, oh and not to mention that she is sexually attractive to the fox Raquel Welch, but she fails, in this ham-fisted void project. A fairly ridiculous story that surrounds all women is quite amazing, every woman in the movie is a head chef who loves lifting the camera, Director Douglas of course undertakes to increase his donkey cracks every time they flex their rear muscles. There's even a ridiculously terrible fear that comes out of faith, a film that "real men" did for "real men" to affirm their flagship sexuality, a disgrace.
