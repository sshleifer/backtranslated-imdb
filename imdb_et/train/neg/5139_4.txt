Many fear fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I'm not very popular saying that I found it to be quite boring. The idea was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes horror movies in the dark can work (like Humongous), but the scarring is in the darkness of the film. It is hard to understand what is happening for a long time, and while some neck collar shots were horrible, most were hard to see. If a little more lighting had been used, maybe it would have been better. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, there are not many killer-peacocks with the exception of the Dark Night, which is much better. I would recommend that you override Scarecrows every day.
