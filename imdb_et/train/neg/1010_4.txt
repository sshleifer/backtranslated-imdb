I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman there, so it seemed promising. And that was until Justin Timberlake arrived. He's really a bad actor and he shouldn't allow the movie to ever be done. I mean, he's one of the most boring, unintentional actors I've ever seen. He does not give any emotion to any of his lines. Why did he hell for Josh Pollack's role? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another great disappointment. His character is so boring, it looks like his character's bad blend of American beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It may seem cool, but believe me, it's not. <br /> <br /> Now Dylan McDermott is very good at acting. This is about one of the few good films. He's just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. He has a pretty cool line. <br /> <br /> The story, although it was a bit obvious and sometimes exaggerated, was good. I had been waiting for a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing happened.
