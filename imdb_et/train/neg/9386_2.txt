In many of the films I've seen in Warren Oates, I've come to a definite conclusion, here's one talented person. For the first time, I saw Mr Oates's Stoney Burke television series from the 1960s. Since then, I have been following my career closely, and I felt that he was meant for great roles. It happened in 1974 when Sam Peckinpah gave him a top-notch bill in "Bring Me the Leader of Alfredo Garcia". Of course, his greatest claim for fame was his great role in The Wild Bunch. I've always thought he could bring some character out of some magic, ie until I saw him on this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to Raymond Chandler's 1950s iron fist detectors. Because the summary said that it was a difficult nose with Private Eye, I was immediately interested. But I sat patiently throughout the film and found it to be a boring, interesting, slow, complicated and confusing saga that, if it had a theme or plot, should be left in the dark. Collectively, and with some of Hollywood's top stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo, and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to reach Mach 5, but it tended to launch and didn't go where. As a result, one of my favorite actors remained in a poorly made vehicle that never went out of the ground. **
