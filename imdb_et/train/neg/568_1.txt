It's "debuted" today on the SciF channel and all I can say is "I'm speechless". I recorded it today so I can watch it after work today. I had great hopes, now I beat the cabinets looking for the length of the rope so I can hang myself. Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "This movie was fun", but this movie doesn't give me anything to do. I know you shouldn't warn the spoiler beforehand, but I'll go anyway "That movie sucks" There I said it! They should show it to flick film students to show them what SHOULD NOT do! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is sound and / or soundtrack. Oh! I found in my old toolbox just a rusty C-clip. I put it on my left hand thumb and tighten until the pain clears the memory of what my eyes have seen. I can just record this VHS, but I think I'll burn it in a cube of fire. I could wash with soap, but I'm afraid I can never clean it again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to the people I hate. -Mike
