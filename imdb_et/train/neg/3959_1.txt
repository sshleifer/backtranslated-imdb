it is not one of those films that is one of the greatest tricks I've ever had, the camera's work is trying to be flashy, but it's really just a mess, it looks like a red shoe diary, but without sex the only reason I bought it was that i wanted to try a dvd and it was the cheapest I could find, maybe the worst to buy from my life and could have put you out forever, the soundtrack is really sticky and most of the movie is made up of the endless of the first two movies repetitions, why would anyone want to make the film so terrible if it is behind me, if they had really tried to make the original film and failed, I would be nicer in this review, but they either have no right to first reproduce and then change the first two materials repeat this movie with about one-third of the original film material that meets the standards of film school students, DO NOT buy this movie. The only entertainment that this dvd can offer is if you were stuck in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER incredible GARBAGE! 0/10 if only the voting system allowed it.
