I could not recommend the Christmas movie more than this precious piece (trust me, double-demanded here - it's so bad). This film was in trouble during the opening credit when it turned out that the screenwriter was the same person as the singer. The musical numbers are all too long and none of them are good ("Thank you very much" is a decent melody, but the words are fools next to the words). I would be delighted to have the chains stuck by Scrooge in the odd hell of the movie as if to sit back on the musicals of the film with this insult. <br /> <br /> The only fun part of this movie (by the way totally unintentional) includes Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Guinness, dressed in a soft powder-white costume, throws her scenes in an attempt to show her as if she was a ghost, or show her complete contempt when she has to be in this terrible movie. Meanwhile, Albert Finney combines Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton with the best to create his hopelessly incredible Quasimodo / Scrooge character. Finney Scrooge is a man so terrible that his transformation cannot be believed. <br /> <br /> Make sure movie production is costly.
