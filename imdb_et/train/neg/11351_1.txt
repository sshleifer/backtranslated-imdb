With massive advertising, it starts with Nickelodeon and Nick Jr, and my son has tempted us to see it. I have seen quite a lot between DVDs and theaters from the now outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) and really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But it was just the worst movie I've seen, kids or kids. It was "when this stupid thing ends?" experience? OK, it's aimed at babies (or better - it's offensive to someone's 3 intelligence), but I've never seen anything so predictive, repetitive, and slow. When you are finally starving but relieved that the movie is over, it's a strange thing at the end that you think it's a joke setup, but there's nothing - it's serious, though it's hard to say what's hard to say they're trying to to achieve. 3-D Effects ... yes, if you have never seen a Viewmaster, they are a big deal, otherwise (if you look at the screen without glasses, it looks like the same process). Even my son was bored. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Bad in every sense.
