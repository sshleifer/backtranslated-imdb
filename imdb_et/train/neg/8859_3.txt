An ugly blow, poorly written, and amateur friend followed Joe Dante's 1981 classic. "The Howling" is one of two or three ONLY good werewolf films that has ever been made, but still it became "paid" for a number of unpleasant and unsatisfactory sequences like this. If it is a consolation, "Stirba" is just a name and has nothing to do with the characters or events used in the Dante movie. The plot here revolves around the bloody cult of Transylvanian werewolves? mainly female? Under the leadership of Stirba. Stirba is played by Sybil Danning, who instantly converts a blonde woman into a super-baby baby (impressive breast) and becomes sexually irritated. His arch-enemy is seemingly tired of Christopher Lee. His character? Stefan Crosscoe ?? is a hidden investigator who travels to Stirba's kingdom with an American couple who lost his girlfriend's cult. If you are looking exclusively for dirty gore and free nudity ... this is your movie. Even the smallest killing has been shown in great detail, and we even treat the image of an explosive eyeball and a dwarf who gets a sharp fence in the garden. However, if you want a little content or depth, you are disappointed. Dialogues are embarrassing and there is no tension to detect. Script artists seem to be constantly confused with werewolves vampires (Transylvanian, garlic, wooden stakes ...) and Danning's gorgeous balcony is disgracefully used as the only trick in the movie. At the end of the credit he rips to his top, he is repeatedly edited (according to my colleague Dr. Gore, at least seventeen times!), Which is quite pathetic and pointless. The music is fine and some landscapes are pretty beautiful. I'm talking about the acute forms of the open credits and the dark caves of the Castle of Stirba. Managing Philippe Mora is a huge mess and ?? as much as I am concerned? his only worthy film remains "The Beast Within" which appeared three years earlier.
