I have been a big fan of Lynn Peterson because she is a breakthrough in the 1988 blockade "Far North", and although I loved her in her second "Slow" (2004), where she plays "Francis", it's Lynn, I'm sure you all know (or should) play a critical role in the "driver". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than Lynn's amazing performance, I'm afraid this movie doesn't have much. <br /> <br /> Wait - there was another thing - amazing creativity in editing to remove the embarrassment of TV viewers. Memorable features like: "You-a-gun!", "You-Witch!", "Shoot!" And "Well, forget you!" <br /> <br /> O.K. P.S: Does anyone know where I can get another Lynn Peterson poster?
