I had a lot of expectations about this movie and all the more that it was Yashraj Film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy works in a call center and one day Pooja Singh invited him to teach his superior, Lakhan Singh, English. . These two fall in love and decide to escape, but Pooja tells Jimm that he can't do it because he owes debt to Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiyyaj. But they decide and steal his money and only then will Jimmy discover that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, Jimmy, and Pooja to pursue. <br /> <br /> Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar. Krishna Acharya is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" must be one of the worst films I've ever watched. Yes! The terrain is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much publicized weight loss) seems good. But the plot is a very thin story, and sometimes there is no point in one scene - so why did I say that I have been expecting more of this movie since it was Yashraj's production. Referring to songs, there is unfortunately no other song I remember. <br /> <br /> There are moments where you can laugh and this is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saife could have done better to make Kareen Kapoor played well. But it can't be said about Anil Kapoor - it didn't fit her as a villain at all. Finally, do not forget that Aditya Chopra, who has previously created and directed good films like "Mohabbatein", which was Yash Chopra, doing such a trash? Conclusion: A bad film that is not worth your time and it is my first and last impression.
