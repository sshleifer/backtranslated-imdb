... then they have the right place to play this mess. Unfortunately, this "mystery", as claimed, is a religious mumbo-jumbo. I was expecting the "unacceptable evil" that I was allowed to, but "evil" in this flick would be unthinkable with just five years of learning difficulties. <br /> <br /> I can't believe they really managed to find some of the biggest names they wanted to participate in. Unfortunately, it has changed my mind beforehand, and I probably won't do anything in the future. I'm also a little chewed, so I now have the name of the writer and the name of the director I remember, because I avoid everything they do, like the plague. <br /> <br /> It's really a pity that all the religious fanatics who post here and say this movie is from 10 to 10, etc. This could lead to more people being deceived, as I was, believing that this film was something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it's out of the video store to get your money back for wrong advertising. Too bad they can't give me 105 minutes, which I wasted, watching it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural film.
