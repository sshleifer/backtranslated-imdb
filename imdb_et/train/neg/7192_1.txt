5 minutes to this movie I was hyperventilation, shaking and painful. And not well. The story speaks of an idiotic troupe of children who make proverbs to the psycho, which is always a good idea. It turns out that psychologists do not like the phone calls, because after 2 minutes he killed the poor Williams mother and father. Well skip over 15 years and guess what? Still prank the phone to call people. Yes, you would think the terrible murder would have prevented them from doing it, but not. So after about two hours and too much shout, I realized that this movie didn't give me anything but a terrible taste in the mouth and a serious desire to take my life. This chick is not even worth laughing in slag production, "acting" or Rutger punishing. I love outrageous horror movies, but this is the most dissatisfied piece I've ever seen. Just no.
