The best Laurel and Hardy short pants are filled to the brim with projectiles, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but Ollie got a wide (!) Punishment - see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or 'The Reversed Hole' (1932) as some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here are the guys playing for some reason (was it because of Stani's father's sketch)? "comedy" built around jokes and allegedly funny situations. It doesn't come out. This is just another tertiary, 30-year-old comedy that only Stan and Ollie personalities who have never shown any of their trademark gestures (Ollie's finger wiggling, Stani's empty stars, etc.) or comic abilities. /> The film begins with their visit to the police. Since we don't see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and hides Colonel Buckshot in the mansion. The premise of "Humor", Ollie goes away when Colonel and Stan went away, because both the meatcake and the maid are never very tempting. They don't play Stan and Ollie in this movie. Their parts could have been played by any participant of a pedestrian studio and it would be the same poor. <br /> <br /> Stan can mime and do what he does funny, but he has no way to do it all here. He is finite when he talks too much to move the plot, but none of it goes stupidly. We are treated with endless third-order comedy chestnuts, such as the running gag that has not correctly pronounced Lord Plumtree, "Call me a cab! Okay, you're in the cabin!" jokes, policemen lose their clothes and see them in long johns, and Stan and Ollie's non-yet another end when two parts painfully obvious horse costume when they run twice on the bike, and James Finlayson still makes his quiet era full of body takes and Keystone Kop jumping. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie are doing much better in the comedy "Sons of the Desert" (1933), where we see what we do to love them - be yourself. In fact, 1932-34 seems to be their best years. <br /> <br /> Because this movie doesn't play any of its strengths, why does it work hard? I have to give it 3.
