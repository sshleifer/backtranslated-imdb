As a buffer for the history of the World War II fleet, and someone who is not proud of the history of this country's racial relationship, I was expecting to see this film. What a disappointing piece. I did it about 3/4 on the road, but I should have attacked it in the attack scene. The idea that a U-boat would burn a torpedo in DDE, as if there was hope for a hit, and then being able to "drown" DDE when it was drowned is inconvenient. And it's just a little detail. The whole film was badly written, poorly targeted and badly acted. I agree with other members of this board that it could have been a good movie. They would have decided that since all these outrageous World War II propaganda films were made from white pains, they had to make black people. And as bad as these old movies, it's actually worse. And it almost smells like the wrong ad headline Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out that they had very small roles. I have to believe these two fine actors were associated with this movie. I've finished. I've given too much of my life, this movie movie.
