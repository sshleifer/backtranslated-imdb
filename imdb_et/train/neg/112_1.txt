This movie is just terrible. John Ritter makes the drill fall, 75% of the participants who submit their rows, as if they had read them from smart cards, bad editing, terrible sound mixing (the dialogue is hard to spot the background noise) and the plot that really goes somewhere. I didn't think I'd ever say it, but Dorothy Stratten isn't the worst actor in this movie. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patti Hansen offers her features with Ben Stein's passion. I started thinking whether he was dead. Even the children of Bogdanovich are terrible (the oldest of them reads their lines from the smart card). This movie is really horrible. That's why Bogdanovich didn't get another project 4 years later. Please don't look at it. If you see it on your TV shows, cancel your cable. If a friend recommends you, check your friendship again. If your husband wants to see it, you are better off to find another player. I'd pinch out the lawn with darts when I sit through that garbage again. If I could put this movie in one word, that word would be Suckotrocity
