I have not seen many low budget movies that I have to admit, but this is the most likely film that will soon be spoken, as the old man told me, he was a lobotomy and lost the ability to speak more than one word every 5 seconds. a year old could work better. The story was the most terrible, and the army boy was what he thought of the army, and then just went over, I just watched it laugh, how bad it was, and hoped it would lead to a real movie. I can't believe it was a blocker for 2 overnight stays, instead take it for free and get it out of our sight. I think the woman had one semi-decent actor, I think the only thing to do with the budget was, but they show every important bit of the movie in the beginning of the scene. Awful just terrible.
