What should it be? Fisher King's remake? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What a slow, harsh, boring who gives-need-need-need-people-movie !!! Just just hurt to sit, I turned it off before it was over. It's so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; as I said, can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in your daily life? We should not think deeply about it. Why does Cheadle give Sandler a chance to turn to violence? If they were such good friends, how did they leave? If Cheadle is so in control, why is he looking for a street shrink? We have never been told. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and why it sucks. About 8 out of 10 scores? I disagree. Overall. Even top films are happy to get such a high average rating, and this mess doesn't deserve to be in the same universe with them.
