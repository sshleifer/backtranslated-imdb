It's really a sad little movie. It is true that the original (holy) trinity was regulated by the law of declining return, the third, "final conflict", which degenerated into a ridiculous sub-section of about half of the film, apparently simply to provide the necessary unnecessarily twisted deaths that have now become the entire Omen series. But if you want to jump this TV-movie (buy the buyers of the Omen box on the DVD, don't be fooled by the widescreen aspect of the screen, it was and is strictly a small-screen stuff) on the back of the series, usually from fine demonic coolers, was unforgivable, especially when it was the first three films by Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I'd give the plot if it were, in addition to the usual death scenes (hopelessly under the sensitivity of television) and some of the worst effects I've seen. Anyone who participated in this project in the catering industry should be ashamed of the fact that this travesty was never put on the screen, not to mention Oman. If my review makes sure one person avoids this confusion, I feel better.
