If you're a Mystery Science Theater 3K fan, a giant leech attack or Pinata Survival Island, this movie may be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I didn't even know the existence of this movie until the day before it was released, when the advertising company put and danced dozens of fleece and billboards on Music Row. In theaters, it barely lasted two weeks. <br /> <br /> Poor performance, poor writing, and poor production will only describe the embarrassment of this movie. For starters, the names are a bit much: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eyesh. <br /> <br /> Toby's inconveniently slow line delivery makes it wonder what production assistant has kept the smart cards from the camera. Angel's character moves quickly from his suburban ways to the cowgirl who slides into the slangs two days after the ranch. His wardrobe goes chic to Toby's female version - in fact, in the last scene, their outfits are identical, making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called the sick. <br /> <br /> Sound is inconsistent. perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to swim and his voice sounds suddenly at a sports competition. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development that would suffice on the screen. Exaggeration, irritation, grimace, and mood best describe the interpretation of the actors and the direction of the terrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after consuming some alcoholic beverages and the company of your most common friends. But it doesn't talk much.
