Poverty Row horror pictures of 1930 and 40s suppress hell out of me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget movies, but this period has produced such a harsh, dirty look at them - and ultimately it is not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is somewhat more fun than a barrel-dr-dreck like "The Invisible Ghost" and "Ape Man", but it's not classic. Bela Lugosi, a long-time Drakula prosperity, is still playing another mad doctor; unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays with her wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a suspicious young female reporter (Luana Walters), the coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Ureca are also in the hands of the fans of the 30's and 40's films.
