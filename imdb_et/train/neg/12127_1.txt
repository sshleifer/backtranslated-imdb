Sorry Fulci fans, but I didn't get it. The music was about as annoying as they came, the actor was clean, the story was done and done, and the direction was non-existent. <br /> <br /> The blood vessel seemed honestly like a children's film project. But I've seen them, and they actually look better than this! It looks like it's underfunded that they can't afford ... WHAT! Not a DoP, not a director, someone who even had a clue what worked. It was a very bad film experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> It was about the worst suck about the festival I've seen, alongside Terror Toons, the only one from Killer Klowns Outer Space. I don't know anything else about it. <br /> <br /> This sets 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
