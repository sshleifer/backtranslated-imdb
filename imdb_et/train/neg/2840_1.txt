Two old friends are sent to Japan to return the results of the genetic research from video tape stolen with a black ninja at the beginning of the movie. First of all, they just have to know the ninja skills because "only the ninja can beat the ninja." <br /> <br /> Sakura killers are trying to be an enjoyable ninja-flick but can't do it badly. The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that it's hard to say anything: the same plot is seen in different variations tens of times before, the characters are too briefly drawn, the direction is boring, and the script doesn't offer anything surprising, even in the end scene, which in itself reduced the scene movie (trash) value. <br /> <br /> Even the 80s ninja-flick fan who understands the aesthetics of trash can hardly even enjoy this movie. It just doesn't offer the viewer anything new, not on the visual level or on the plot. Shurikens are thrown and the katanas are swinging, but it is not enough to steer the direction of the film he had to imagine, and similar fighting scenes will recede even for the most audible viewer in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's hard to recommend a movie to anyone. Even Franco Nero's clumsy report "Enter the Ninja" came down to Sakura's killer American ninja. Even at the visual level, there is no ball in the film and it is a waste of time to try to find great fighting scenes in this movie. All in all, I'm one nonsense ninja-flicks I've ever seen. Don't even care about curiosity. Trust me in this. <br /> <br /> Â½ of 10
