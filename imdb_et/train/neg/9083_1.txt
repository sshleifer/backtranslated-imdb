It was so terrible. It wasn't fun at all. Even the scene where a girl uses a vibrator is even fun to watch in the movie. I say again, the scene where a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if this was the only part of the movie you watched, just a girl on the couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should just release this scene in theaters, maybe the film would be enjoyable to a certain degree. My advice, fast forward to this point, rewind movie, watch again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy yourself for two hours. This movie is side by side when I spit on my grave and the Doom generation in the worst movie category I've ever seen.
