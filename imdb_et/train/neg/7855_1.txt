I couldn't believe my eyes when I was watching this movie. There is no point in blood or violence. Unlike other scary movies that had gore and meaning for this film, it's just blood, gore and kill one after the other. This movie is not at all interesting, it has no significant plot or story nor is intelligence. Blood looks very fake and this movie is useless. Don't even waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two of meaningless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not scary, but simply rebellious. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen on all the horror movies I've ever seen.
