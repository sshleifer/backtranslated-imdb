Oh, man, this movie bites! If you had ever been afraid to see the slasher genre rehash possible, as much as possible and at the same time be careful (pc-friendly, not nudity, classic movie classic). Each clich√© is restored without self-awareness and actor. Oh, the actress redefines the word horror. I should have felt better because a direct Dutch translation of the title would have brought me out.
