You can't resist it too much knowing that it was done in four days and I was waiting for it. (Actually, it's not all that is campy in reality. Except for Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who doesn't take himself seriously, the rest plays halfway; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to what shocked me; I thought their ultra-low-budget horror film was meant to satisfy the best sexual fantasy and not give it a story, but they use a lot of words like "technological" and "physical" in the script to get their points over. (Although it is possible that the story is only important to explain why there are so few cast members.) Nobody cares about this fool, and the only thing that is interesting about the film is the mocking of cults and the homoerotics of soft hearts (which is not all that nervous). I would have enjoyed it more if there were some random killings without reason. The film is grainy, with quality television and functional levels. There are some "sexy" scenes that are fine - boys twist their boxers in bed, feeling up; or when they are tied and orgasmic faces when the wine is poured on them - and some of them are funny. And I liked L. Ron Hubbard's excavations and the planned irony story of religious cultists who talked about intense gay men, but it's still not good. 3/10
