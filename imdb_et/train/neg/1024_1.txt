I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, which had a pretty strong expectation. the film is big and the festival closed, so it must be good, right? when i was wrong. <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble when, before the film was directed, the director spoke of how he led a spiritual episode where he met an unknown actor named Kevin spacey (director / writer who made his own feature) debut = blah) ... Edison's director / writer must have some accusing images of Kevin's cosmos killing a homeless man because I don't see how he (along with other film actors) ever would agree to a disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely terrible! it is a blend of every cop cooked in a clich√©. There's nothing new with Edison. the act was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like the episode mentioned above. it was the best video I ever saw. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples of bad foolish moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock music and play ... justin timberlake get creative criticism of his belle if he the apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj, who manages vintage firebird ... 3 men who have headed ... <br /> <br /> this movie is a good opposite. EDISON!
