No doubt Frank Sinatra was a talented actor and talented singer. After all, very few actors nowadays get the scene in just one key, and that was pretty much the Sinatra set-up method. <br /> <br /> I feel like the quality of a man in the 1960s. the movies really started to refuel. Tony Rome's detective series was not something that tried to compete with the Dean Martin's Matt Helmi series, which came out simultaneously. Maybe even James Bond competition, but Frank had nothing during those years. His personal life in the dark, his music vanished ... Sinatra seemed like a setback in the 1950s. The last big Sinatra movie of this period was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
