The so popular horror story of a luxurious building in Brooklyn that hides the gates to hell. It resembles Polanski's "tenant" (issued a year before the "sender"), but is too far from any aspect of the filmmaker in Poland. The "tenant" was so disturbing, while "sentinell" is not at all. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this movie is the majority: it's full of American cinemas (Burguess, Gardner), Wallach), veteran artists who act as food (guess). <br /> <br /> Decision: Hardly fun. <br /> <br /> * My price: 4/10
