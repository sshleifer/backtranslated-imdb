Dude, really !!!! Where have you been for the last 20 years, it's shocking in any way, horror? It's a joke, there's nothing wrong with a small budget, but it's a laugh. If you want to look at the classics, then Dr Browna, Frankfurt, Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's victims, Freaks. Golem and ghost passengers, you can't compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad behavior, a bad scenario, and so on. Money and leisure waistlines have watched many movies, were horrors. my all-time favorite, i'm really speechless, there's nothing else to say, please don't make the effort to look something like this, please
