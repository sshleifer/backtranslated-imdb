Nothing will happen. <br /> <br /> Then you will not create personality characters. <br /> <br /> Then it ends at the end, because there is no beginning or no average. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that aren't beautiful because they don't even have to be, because this movie doesn't even exist. There is no "in" in this movie because there is no plot, no signs, no themes, no ideas, no symbols, no discussion, no dialogue or no point. There's nothing! <br /> <br /> There's a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But sound editing is such and the right movie is that watching it is not even worth your time, if you are really interested, I would recommend going and buying a soundtrack or something. You get all that you can with this movie, without any fatigue, headache and impatience. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
