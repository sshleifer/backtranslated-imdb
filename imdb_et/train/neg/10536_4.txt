William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the director's / writer's credit for this entertaining, low budget movie with about three boys who go to the forest with a magazine in their forest. The fire and the feet supported by the schoolchildren back and forth ... and the terrifying city of tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... from Leatherface's fame) travels the story of food and food in four stories. <br /> <br /> One story is The Hook's old recovery ring, two teenage lovers on the lane attacked by a demented killer. Another story is a couple of tokens who need some weed score. They stumble on a boy who knows a man who has some big s # @ t. When they smoke in a couple of bags, the skin begins to turn gray and green before it breaks down and falls off. One of the best stories is the happy man who returns home for Christmas, who can't wait until his mother is dead, and enjoys talking to his nephew and brother, Satan Claus. The fourth campfire is a greedy sailor who is washing the ground around an empty treasure and reaches the sea with zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a big special effect budget, CAMPFIRE TALES could and would have been much worse. A little horny but fun to watch except maybe a sailor's story. Working is not worth it. The cast members are: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
