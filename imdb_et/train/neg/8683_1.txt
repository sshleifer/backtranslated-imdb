This exhibition is not smart. This is basically what he wants. The "original humor" that these writers are trying to draw to avoid the rest of the world is simply inconvenient. In another comment, someone quotes a couple of fun lines. For me, George H.W was special. Bush tells the kids that they don't have to watch television other than Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point in the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem, like this sad excuse for political satire, is that these people get into the second season. I am a liberal republican and I know Bush is not a good president. We all do. But this is no excuse for wasting the time. I put those writers on the same level as "Meet the Spartans". Their formula, bite as many unsuccessful topical jokes as possible, and throw even worse original material so you can actually write your own credit. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad. Unfunny, and it just makes me more and more unhappy that such a mess has been renewed, but amazing and original exhibitions, such as Arrested Development, have been conserved after 3 specific seasons. Please do not look at this crap if you are not one of the green bloody liberal hippers who think that any sentence with the words Bush and stupid is comical gold. Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. All she does is imitates Texan's accent and expresses her very hard at the end of the punishment. At least South Park admits that the votes are not accurate. If you want a funny political satire, check out the Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for any political visions of Robot Chicken that is fun to watch because the animation of the stop motion action figure is extremely well done. Look for George Bush's Jedi bit on youtube. Priceless
