What is the insult to the film industry in SA! I've seen better SA movies. The comments I read about hijacking stories, saying it is worth ten out of ten, is quite scary. The rating of the film should not depend on .., "Oh, MOVIE FOR A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. THE SCIENCE OF THE NUTS OF THE INDUSTRY THAT IT WORKS". We have good movies for good movies. Don't judge the film industry about what people say, how big they think predators are. We can say great stories, such as Cry's Beloved State and Shaka Zulu. Cry loved country I give 9 out of 10. Big Darryl's leadership, with great action, two big older actors, no matter where they are. Hijack the stories ..., I'll give one in ten. It could only be a person in the project who would give him high results. I would have done the same if it was my film.
