Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants serious television reports. When the job he asked for goes wrong, he is fired. Her beautiful, but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) also says sayonara. Coming home, Tim is surprised to discover an uninvited visitor to his house (Christopher Lloyd) from Mars planet! He called him Uncle Martin, Tim quickly tries to help his new friend live on earth. But Martin gets in trouble wherever he goes, bathroom washroom and much more. At last, Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) sees the opportunity to do Tim, but the way of true love does not run in this case either. Soon all the people on TV will watch Timi hoping for a true alien. What does a man do? For those who loved Bill Bixby and Ray Walston of the same name as the old one, this movie is not worth knitting for proverbs. It's really, undoubtedly terrible, without a plot and dependent on supposed special effects that fall evenly. Daniels is okay because of landing, but Lloyd is just terrible as an alien, stabbing over the storm. The rest of the majority is sufficient, as are costumes, a set, and production details. Even if your kids see the cover and beggars of this movie, convince them to choose another store from a video store. Be sure that children and adults find this movie colossal, so choose a museum in the night or 80 days around the world.
