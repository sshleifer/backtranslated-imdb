Although the casting of this film was amazing, especially Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of writing was so bad that no actor or director would be able to watch the film. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason for watching the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck and it was almost impossible to turn. Perhaps it was that we "hoped" that the message would finally be obvious and that we could read some meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience could "understand" the meaning that is honest, that the person understands the absurd. The writers did nothing to facilitate the innate need we seem to find meaning. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that those involved were simply going through their respective craft movements and any inner passion for characters or story was either secondary or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, movies made on television seemed to change over the years. Considering that message forwarding to the audience may be the primary interest of writers in the past, today's writers and producers seem to be disgusting their audience, focusing mainly on manipulation to "stay tuned" through constant advertising, which seems to be the only reason why movies like Surrender, Dorothy are done.
