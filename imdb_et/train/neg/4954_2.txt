I looked at the original Batman animated series and I am an avid Batman graphic novelist. If the comic book is an icon like Batman, there are certain features that cannot be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but if it alters completely, it is too far. I bought one Batman season in the hope that the extra bonus feature could enlighten the creators' reasoning that it showed such cruelty. In an interview with The Batman, an artist or writer (I'm not sure what) said, "We felt we shouldn't be confused with Batman, but we could be confused." So, they started making Joker an immature son, who begged for attention, a penguin for some animation, Mr. Freeze's superb jewelery, a poison Ivy teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts that make Bob Kane cast into his grave. All in all: I wish I had more hands so I could show it under FOUR DARK. This, in my opinion, pushes 2 out of 10 just because he uses the name of Batman. Warner Bros ... think about it again! Please!
