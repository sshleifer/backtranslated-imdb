I don't like using the word "terrible" to describe the work of the cinema, which takes a lot of time, effort, talent and money, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel "Jane Eyre" is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The absence of a script is powerful and powerful, all explained to the viewer in insecure conditions, leaving little to imagination. Leading actors are disgracefully unsuccessful, clearly hired as the names of these stars, and the musical result is boring and boring. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have no chemistry at all. She is like a wet noodle that is even worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least had some emotional involvement in what should be a disappointed passion. William Hurt works in one tone throughout the film, and this tone is flat and has no energy. Of course, the slippery and coarse scripts will not help another sophisticated participant in their quest to bring this flick to life. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Fairfax, Joan Plowright, is like some of Disney's creations that keep the scenes more sweet where she would be best left out. <br /> <br /> The secret of Rochester's first woman's story does not exist. The role of the other spouse played by Elle MacPhearson's Barbie Doll is an empty symbol. <br /> <br /> A very big actor, Fiona Shaw, is completely before Jane's aunt, Mrs Reed. She would have been better than Mrs Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, like Jane's beloved school teacher, creates genuine compassion or credibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the version of Jane Eyre after watching Robert Young's British television in 1997, playing Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Joungi's important, romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova, compared to Zefferelli's wet squib. <br /> <br /> Now I am interested in the 1970 version of Timothy Dalton, which I have read very well on this website. I'm surprised how many people liked the Zefferell Yorkshire picture book. <br /> <br /> With all this movie, it can be said that the house is beautiful and the cinematic art is vividly painted, besides being full of dud.
