This comedy isn't really funny. It's a romance that plays so much in stereotypes that it doesn't affect. It's a fire-proof paper - yes, even at this time - it's not a snap. <br /> <br /> Cast is enough. More than that, it's hard to say. But the nice thing is that the players are unknown. MGM would have celebrated Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman who had no time, but the work could have been any actor. <br /> <br /> We may be grateful that this little-known movie is mostly experienced by today's unknown performers. And the production values ​​are not terrible. But it does not give a real impression. <br /> <br /> This is a common call. And who wants it?
