Thomas Clay has mixed the wrong types. It is a problem with young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main part of the film is slow and rather outrageous and cures a drug that ends like it would be a director. We introduce a character character who is a bit outsiders, we see him in school and at home, which is not quite appropriate, feeling uncomfortable with so many adolescents. Robert falls with the bad sons and starts to disappear from school and take drugs, and before he knows he is a psychologist. <br /> <br /> The film is really Clay's total inability to understand the relationship between images of violence and violent acts. Clay seems to think that on our television, war scenes are a generation of evil youth. but he has filmed most recent SIMULATED violence. Is this man real? <br /> <br /> If Clay hasn't seen YouTube, he's naive and he doesn't know if he's making his movie brutally climax? Everyone who wants to see is the most scary scene at the end of the movie and I'm sure it will be with people. <br /> <br /> The remainder of the film is meaningless for the Clay movie, not only for young people who are actively involved in war prevention, but also for the devil himself as an extreme, tasteless perpetrator for better reasons than his own personal fame.
