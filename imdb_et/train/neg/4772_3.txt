Before watching this movie, I can already say that it was a complete copy of Sawi (with that pair where they were, and a black boy who wanted to break his hand to get out of the cuffs). MJH's name on the film would usually be next to me (ugh, can we say GROSS?!), But I wanted to try it again. <br /> <br /> I was a little bit interested in getting started. Action is absolutely terrible and I found myself laughing at the characters from almost every reaction (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even the worst, but I kept watching. <br /> <br /> The end was their biggest joke! I was serious in shock thinking: "Was it the end?! Is it a comedy?!". <br /> <br /> I thought this bunch was more fun than "scary movie" spoofs and it's really something to say!
