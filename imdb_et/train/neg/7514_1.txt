A small budget effort from Texas is at least well filmed, but it's a little consolation. Bad action or, if I say, a bad, overactive, pretty stupid story that is nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. There seems to be a bunch of young people bringing together a Halloween ghost house that is done every year, but this year things are different. He has a long, long-lasting lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely filled with empty spaces, of which there are many. Putrid, puerile, definitely avoidable, at all costs.
