I really didn't want this movie .... mainly because of the main characters! They are both immature, selfish, and self-centered. They injured everyone around them, playing their foolish game. The visual effects were good, but what are the good ones, if there is no sign you connect, or a story that is interesting. Should I be happy if these two psychological people finally end their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought it was France's # 1 smash? ........ <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The End: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
