Action is a bad ham, all jokes are superficial and the target group is obviously very small children, provided they have average IQs. I understand that it was meant for children, but so is Malcom in the middle, but they are still throwing adult humor and situations. <br /> <br /> What Bob Saget should expect is the only comedian who is less funny than the ball that hits the man's groin, which is probably why he stopped accommodating America's more funny videos. <br /> <br /> Parents, don't let your children look at this example if you don't want to save money at college. Open your children to stupidity and grow up.
