Like most festival entries, Hamiltons makes an interesting look at the movie, which means all the ideas and little performance. Although it is impressive because it is obvious with a low budget, the film stays in the final twist and becomes terribly long during its extraction and obvious conclusion. The film talks about a family of murderous emigrants who are trying to survive after the parents are dead. They kidnap people, drain blood and eat something in the basement. Mckellhar and Firgens have some nice dark humorous performances and the rest are just that. The film is never realistic or very disturbing about this issue. But in the first half, this strange humorous and dark mixture is a surprising achievement. The next half is not as successful as going into the forgetting of the film with unrealistic twists in a ridiculously shining finale that makes the whole movie perfect. It is a shame that there is no doubt that a talent was related to this production, and while it is very faulty, it remains original and creative. It is too bad that when it comes to deliveries, it will fail completely at every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
