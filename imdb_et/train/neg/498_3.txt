I saw this movie when I was a lot younger and I thought it was funny. I saw it again last week and you can guess it. Some funny parts in it, very little and too long. The beginning is the only thing that is funny to me when you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a full b-movie, it's a good choice, but don't expect too much alien dwarf
