The famous exhibition master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly she kills her and runs away when an old lady gets a heart attack. The name of the female assassin is Sawa. She is still going to school and working for a malicious offender, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day Sawa finds he killed his parents .. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans have to admit that this witch-like thriller is a disappointing gore fest. "Kite" is a style, but it's still a trash. The strange plot of teenage girls who kill people as an assassin tried to be at the same time scary and touching, causing only the story of falling from that face. One of the most important events is the sequence of actions where good / bad hero Sawa falls with the bodyguard from the building, but the dramatic structure is not as good as the strange and grotesque face of the director and director Yasoumi Umetsu is terrible. Not just that intercourse is just simply horrible. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
