I own almost every Seagal movie (yes, even those with a low budget), and I have to say that it can be the worst, not just his movies, but all the films that he's ever made. The only highlight of this movie and the only reason I gave it to the 2 stars 1 is that A. it is Seagal and B. Seagal has some sweet action sequences, especially in the shop and also when he ever takes out a whole army knife. The next time I give me 90 minutes of killing the Seagale people and don't even worry about the storyline because the story not only climbed, but also the actor, the fact that F-18 and F-14 have changed somewhat in the F-16s, and also the fact that Stealth was as fast as F-16. Did Stealth never have to refuel? And since then it is a hostile territory for the Afghan Air Force. Last checked, Afghanistan has no air force, we (USA) control the sky. This secret mission was also played through the speakers throughout the room, but the admiral whispered to another guy that it was secret. How did Seagal get to the bottom of the truck? Please tell us why they were imprisoned because when the Air Force pilots are big chests (if they are not Owen Wilson?) And when are their drunk in the Arab world in view of Muslims, do they drink alcohol? In addition, if Arabs listen to women like command # 2? The highlight of the film was definitely the killing of Seagal in the shop and the other 50 people with whom he died, as well as the very short and completely random lesbian scene that came out somewhere.
