I don't think I've ever been so bowed by the absurdity of the movie as I was when I walked out of this fuck. WHAT there is no point in it. none of them is smart or thoughtful. Due to the absence of really tight moments, they repeatedly use the helicopter where you build the music before the character does something that opens the door or pulls the curtain and then there's nothing. it's OK to do once, maybe, but I read three times. there are things that are thrown for no apparent reason, characters, semi-formed story. The animals were not well developed at ALL. the end was .. bad. bad, bad, bad, all, every part, this movie is terrible. and I'm here to warn you about it.
