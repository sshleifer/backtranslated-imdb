Spike Lee must be one of the most rated ratings I've ever seen. He's a sweetheart, because he's supposed to make movies with a "message", or he's just so bohemian in his approach that he's making critics who are torn by water, eating Hollywood movies just to be different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam is not doing it well. Cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone, and so is the narrative. The plot is much like "Make it Right". The depiction of "Guidos" or Italian-Americans (for which I happen to be one) is directly from Eddie Murphy's raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of an Italian man who chooses to fight a much higher African-American is much more credible than the figure shown in the figure for a large Italian cartoon (the character of John Leguizamo is a possible exception). <br /> <br /> Did anyone who saw this film realize how it should end? As soon as Richie arrived in the movie, I saw a fist on my face and stomach, I already saw him being accused of being a killer. This character was the most honest in the film, so Lee shows, of course, what happens to people who stand out in the crowd (which is a white beard!) <br /> <br /> Please, give Spike Lee a lifetime pass for all such basketball games. So, maybe he enjoys himself for too long to get a movie camera for a long time, and we don't have to give ourselves an important motivation and, moreover, I don't need critics (some of whom I respect) to sacrifice and ahhhh the emperor without clothes.
