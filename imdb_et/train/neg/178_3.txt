This film was made for a TV set, so taking this into consideration, I am not getting as hard as a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it gently succeeds in humor, whether it means to be or not. Action is mostly up, but it applies to many lower budget films. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hated was that 90-95% of it was filmed, but in random places it takes 5-10 seconds to record a video. You can say that because of the less contrast, the colors are less vivid and the film material is 30 frames per second instead of the 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if these scenes were supposed to be shot later and that they didn't have the money to film at that time (I assume that is, why), but it is unpleasant and makes the movie really more amazing than it was to watch. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've definitely seen inferior movies, but I'm certainly not saying I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend anyone seeing it.
