Where is it written that the steep must suck? Scream 2 no! Others don't! But it certainly was ... the problems include terrible actors (only Christopher Walken can act in the whole movie), bad writing (you never understand what's going on and I've even studied Nephilim's idea before). horrible choices. Eric Roberts makes the foolish archangel Michael what I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague if you don't see Christopher Walken in despair. In that case, just move on to the parts where he is in the movie and avoid others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
