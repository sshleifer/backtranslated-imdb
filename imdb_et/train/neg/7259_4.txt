This is definitely one of the 70's movies that is out there, and it's the most remarkable when you want to have a bigfoot hysteria in the decade. Also, in the case of the whole film, little insanity has been observed, especially when the dark, spirited first half is replaced by MUSICAL INTERLUDE (as the other user pointed out, one song is dedicated to the character, Travis Crabtree, who for some time wanders around the canoe, .. pages that are never seen again. My favorite thing: the man gets so scared that he jumps in front of the door (!?) And the narrator explains that he went unknowingly "in shock." I would say that breaking the door with the head is more likely why he went unconscious, but whatever. /> <br /> 4/10 stars or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.
