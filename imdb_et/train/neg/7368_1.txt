I was unsuccessful in wasting on DVD: Attack Force's 10 new quid purchases on the SS's new movie. Now I usually stop watching my beliefs in such movies. A tear of salt and some beers on a dark night on the couch looking at the noise of late night shooting is perfect for a similar alpha man. I bought this movie to think of seeing cool martial arts and shoot em up. <br /> <br /> Did I call. Segal is old and swollen, the plot was ridiculous even by the SS standards and all this has been pulled out of Segal's action (as it was at the beginning) extremely terrible. So scary that half of her voice was copied by a man who sounded NOT LIKE HIMI. Whether the crew's SS slope was no longer (a controversial point), it was so terrible at the workplace that they couldn't record properly. The voice would slip between Mr Whisper Segal and the man who makes Honda's voice transmissions! <br /> <br /> Image wise is not a problem because most action movies work with the same assumption as it is, there's nothing new. A common combination of characters dying terribly like cannon fodder and stereotypical bad guys waiting to blow. <br /> <br /> Avoid such a movie as you avoid walking on a speeding train or H5N1-bird dose ahead of the flu. <br /> <br /> Use garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This has been a public health warning.
