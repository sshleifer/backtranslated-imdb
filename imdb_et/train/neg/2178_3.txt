I would have enjoyed this film a little more than Jason (Herb) Evers had no constant experimentation. Many early seven Samurai reviewers accused Toshiro Mifune of being over-active. However, when more and more critics saw this movie, they saw it purposefully. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune and his over-doing is just that. <br /> <br /> Most of the players in this classic class were good actors, minus Evers and showgirls. If you watch this movie, you would have noticed that Evers screams almost every row, ie until he smokes and blows the smoke coolly in his nose. <br /> <br /> Special effects were the same for the B-film course as it was. In hindsight, there is not much that I think is fantastic or bad for this movie.
