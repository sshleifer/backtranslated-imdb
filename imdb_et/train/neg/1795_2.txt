I had the opportunity to watch this movie as a member of the test group, and the only thing that held me up was the opportunity to perform screening. I felt that the biggest problem with the film was the lack of a main plot. Instead, it was compiled (too) from many sub-blocks that were competing during the screen. As a result, there are no signs that are sufficiently developed to allow the audience to create some kind of attachment. What the director and the manufacturer could not do was to show us why we should take care of what happens. In fact, one sub-ring and the associated characters could be completely removed without serious damage to the film. (The collected time would have allowed the much needed development of the remaining sub-lines and stars.) Simply put, the hungry Bachelor's Club disc is overcrowded if it is desired to eat and appetite.
