There are many deaths in nature. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out! But should this be the focus of the nature document? What is this terrible death with this fascination? Do we really need to see an adult elephant packed with a hungry lion? Or, cheetah who grabs gazelle's throat slowly, not less! I thought it was a family-friendly natural movie! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show horrible violence in movie trailers? Did filmmakers fear losing money? It was surreal! It's like filmmakers believed they were only dealing with the first and second classrooms of the school. Wow! Heartbeat from medium to moroon! <br /> <br /> If wings look for natural documentaries when reading a movie review, why not focus on: animals that are actually copying; childbirth; egg laying; bathing; sleeping; cleaning one another; communication; gaming; Emotional displays of fear and anger; abnormal behavior, such as mouth grabbing; migration; problem-solving skills; culture (yes, in many animal species, culture is what people call); communication skills; in other words, stop focusing on violence or fooling beauty and why not be much more rounded - and instead focus on joy and inspiration?
