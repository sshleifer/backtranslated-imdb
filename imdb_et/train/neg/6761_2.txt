Let's face it. As a film school project that has been done without budget and "real" actors, it is a passively interesting film. Like anything that needs to be released on a DVD for an innocent viewer, this is a very poorly produced product. If I exchanged channels and would accidentally catch this movie, it would probably seize the eye and attention for some time. As a person who bought the impression of this DVD that I get a decent cinematic product, ie a movie, I feel deeply disappointed. This is a video game with a video clip, something like the serial number of the old sixties, but without it. In addition to the leading person, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), other participants seem to be either campuses (which are actually too old for it) or members of the director's household who appear in front of the camera without any help from the active sofas, but also from the make-up artist or a hairdresser (over the hoods that have grown over the hood or the hats are a long way from the creation of the 1840s). All this is captured with a still-mounted camera in a small bare studio, sometimes using a blue screen outdoors. The synthesizer created a flat "period" of unrestrained scores inspired by romantic karaoke for more than once. The film is trying to be "dreamy", whereas in reality it is just a concept-free collage of images that changed it for editing (and believe me, the standards were not too high). Every day and then there are interesting dialogues, but in general it is pretty flat and two-dimensional production in more than one way, without the genius blinking from both the director and the team members. That's how the artsy movies tried to look in the 1980s. Mr Redfield does a much better job than the director.
