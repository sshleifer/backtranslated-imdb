Personally, although I am able to evaluate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy even the toughest. You know those times when you just want to sit down and watch some terrible cookie movie to kill time. This is the only movie I remember actually turning off in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of ending it. The plot was so viable and predictable, I called what the next scene would be easy (and I'm not usually very good). The actors were terrible, I've seen better action playing high school. Even the scenes of the scene were bad, the flow was all wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that forgot about jokes.
