All possible means of identification are found in the little girl's body. When it is found that one leg is longer than the others, it is assumed that it is the body of a couple of lost daughters. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes dependent on sedatives and leads to unhappy existence. All this will change if one day, how many years later will she get a phone call from her daughter! With the help of the former police and reporter, he sets out to make sure his daughter is really alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a nonsense plot, moving painlessly slowly and completely uneven. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who is doing an excellent job as a desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the end, but I'm not sure the rest of the movie is worth it. Be careful with the English subtitles remaining in the R1 version - they are not very accurate.
