Some guys are attacking. Just seeing the other boy sees him. He has some bodyguards and they are attacking the killer, but the reporter is interested. He goes to the hospital where they took this boy. He walks and nudges one bodyguard, but he doesn't speak. I can't figure out why. It's not like anyone else. He's the only reporter out there. Anyway, his editor prevents him from working on this lame story. But hey, he does anyway. He goes to the killer sister and mother. A few minutes after leaving, they get off for a long time - someone blowing their trailer - a huge fireball. Then he looks for a bodyguard from the hospital. He thinks he's hungry on his boat, but after a minute they're both sucking underwater in an underwater tank because three men are trying to detach them (and have been blown for a long time - a huge fireball). The reporter and bodyguard will hit two boys trying to disassemble them. <br /> <br /> Over the next hour, another boy goes out of the street, there is a warehouse with several rigidities, some driving with wrecks and death, fake suicides, etc. Lotsa's rigid, all confident carnage. <br /> <br /> Great things, but what a reporter and bodyguard can't guess is why the hell has been attacked by the original boy. What is motivation? Of course, this can help us understand why the reporter is even interested. Almost all this, he is the only reporter in the story. No one in the media cares. Not even with all the big fires and corpses. True, the original man who got rid of was not exactly a celebrity. His work was a bit boring. He was just the president. Yes, he who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a representative of the secret service. <br /> <br /> Is it a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no TV cameras, no other print journalists, no bloggers ... just one of these police-blotter crimes ... <br /> <br /> What is a spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yes, the first lady. He was because the president was deceiving. And he's gonna go away with it. He's really sharp? But how could anyone ever understand this? Why should someone work hard? After all, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a "1" movement. It was so stupid that I just had to look. And it just got fucking! This is a real spoiler! But even though I have told you, you must believe it!
