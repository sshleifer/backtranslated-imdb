It's just bad. Sometimes reprocessing, even if they are wrong with the original products, is good in itself. They can bring a different perspective and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. It was so poorly thought out and done as possible. It wasn't good even on your own. Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his roles and project choices leave something to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was such an exciting, psychological adventure; it is not at all an adventure and it is not enjoyable or fun. This was done on the basis of the film-taking-side approach drawn in the points that someone in Hollywood believes that what they see is a contemporary filmmaker. Basically, they see us as idiots. It is offensive that someone puts it out as a feature film and even tries to make the culture classical by sloppy. Manipulating plot equipment, "make-it-obvious-so-they-no-miss-the-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotypical characters, amateur direction ... <br /> <br /> It's common bad.
