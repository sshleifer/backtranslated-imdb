It's not as much a movie as a high-budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate-covered espresso bars. This theory seems to be proven by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as "Insomnia". When it was first mentioned that insomnia caused civilization, I thought "Wow! Nihilistic martial arts film!" but there is no such happiness. Although you have to consider this as an experimental film, if the villain is strangled by the long eyebrows of an old man. Zu Warriors has exactly the same understanding of whether subtitles are turned on or off. It's not a good sign. I found that special effects would fall between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
