If it is based on true relationships, as claimed by Mrs Curtin and Mr Levinson, I am glad that I do not personally know them. It's painfully slow, and both characters freely take pill pills throughout the movie, while the theme song is played into the ground. Many foolish scenes where people act stupid do not make comedy.
