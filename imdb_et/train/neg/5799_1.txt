I rented this movie yesterday mainly because of the fine art and the summary on the back of the jacket. After I opened it to my DVD player, I looked through the jacket again and although I took out the cover, I couldn't read any production information about the film on STILL. This movie is titled Evil on Jacket and he had to find it by visiting the Faith Films website to find out what the relationship here is in IMDb. <br /> <br /> Filming and special effects made in the film seemed pretty good ... Then the actor of the line-reading spoke. Oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like a jockey high school jug, whose voice just managed to change the pitch, and no attempt to go beyond reading the rows of the script. At first I thought I had a bad disc out of sync, so I had to assume it was a foreign film because I couldn't read the jacket ... English dialogue. If they chose the right person to copy the dialogue, this movie is TRANSLATION. I gave him the opportunity about 20 minutes before it was pulled out, when I discovered that a bad line reader wouldn't die, but stay a permanent head. Yes, it's bad! The jacket covers the art and the art made in the film is great, so gave one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for a rotten dialogue. I don't recommend it!
