Based on my cable TV guide summary, it was much more interesting than actually. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror film I've ever seen, called "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From my opening scene I can say that it's really bad, but I was so bored that I didn't care less. This film contains ridiculous action, especially a man tortured by his dreams, incredible, because not in credible plots and in some of the more famous music I've heard, and I live at a time when Britney Spears and Nsync dominate the air waves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it is not funny. One would be a movie boring and boring and so NOT scary because it would try to spice things up with some funny one liner here and there, but not. We have been tortured by Guy's self-centered friend who is trying to be funny but ended up being annoyed instead. (spoiler) And please tell me who in this madness world is crazy and selfish to visit the middle of the night? Nobody! If you are going to make a horror movie, make it at least credible. This is something other than.
