It was interesting to see how accurate it is to write geek buzz, but very naive in the business world. The Ministry of Justice would strive for bigger major giants when they won such naive things. The real world of business is much more subtle and interesting, but it is really bad. I seriously doubt that any body would kill someone directly; even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, impurities, poisons, etc. This film must be developed by some garages, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted to take advantage of something in the Microsoft antitrust case.
