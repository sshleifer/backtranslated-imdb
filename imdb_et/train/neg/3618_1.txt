Clich√©-driven story of impending divorce - or is it? - In the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Corny dialogue, carton characters, stock situation, red herring zombie sub-block and worst case absolutely no profitability emotionally or dramatically. The real sign of a weak storyteller - if you can't create any dissatisfaction - just finish the story. I'm forced to ask, "What made you think this was a story worth talking about!" "<br /> <br /> A good but wasted debut by the child artist Anthony De Marco - the rest was forgotten at best, and they don't know why nobody watches indie movies! It's ninety minutes of my life that I can't never back.
