I watched this movie with every other adaptation I could get, including seeing what games are in preparation for academic research. Cinematic art is very touching, as is music. Unfortunately, the whole life story was taken out. I've never seen such a horrible image of Rochester. All of his most important features have disappeared. Where is his spirit? Where's her passion? Scott's Rochester is like Rochester's foil, St. John's, as a novel. In fact, the St.John player in this adaptation played passionate St.John, while Scott is pleased to break things or just stare at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they think. I would like to give this film a slightly higher voice, based on excellent music and cinematography, but frankly, I can't see this movie for too long, because George C. Scott is the result.
