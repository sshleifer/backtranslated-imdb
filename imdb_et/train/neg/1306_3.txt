(aka DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian TV, although it was made in English and never intended for earlier DEMONS films. It had to be simply called "OGRE", for which the director Lamberto Bava had issued it. <br /> <br /> The American family leases an Italian villa in the summer. A woman (Virginia Bryant) has repeated dreams of her own little girl who goes to the old wine cellar of this villa. It glows and is covered with nets and has a face like a spider or insect. It drips, which looks like a green color. <br /> <br /> Of course, he doesn't believe it. The villa is just old and wrinkling and makes the night in the midst of strange noise and it should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then OGRE will appear, which looks like a 16th-century costume. looks like a wolf head attached to it and has attracted the scent of orchids. <br /> <br /> Movies aren't really that bad and at least the dialogue is semi-intelligent, with no ridiculous uncomfortable phrases that duplicate. There is no real spirit other than some skeletons rotting in the cellars that look like the bottom of a modern pool. The OGRE itself simply disappears after the family Jeep Cherokee has overcome it. <br /> <br /> The Shriek DVD copy was defective, the picture changed to black, for about half an hour, into a movie. The annexes contain a brief interview with Lamberto Bavaga, where he explains how it was not a sequel, etc. It's quite common. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
