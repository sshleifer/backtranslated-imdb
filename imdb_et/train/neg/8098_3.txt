This is one of the most terrible repeats I've ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a bad story, they should refrain from giving a fine book title. There is hardly a connection between Wolfe's book and this film, except for the title. I'm not mindful of the changes when they help the story flow on the screen. At least the changes should not damage the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully convincing. Participants have failed. The director and / or the screen writer probably couldn't decide whether to make a flat comedy or preach unbelievable preaching. <br /> <br /> If you have seen and disliked this movie, try this book. Once you've seen and liked this movie, read the book.
