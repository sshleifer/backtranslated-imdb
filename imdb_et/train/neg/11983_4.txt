Marie Dressler wears this depressive drama of a friendly bank owner who recently played a fool during TCM in April. If you are expecting the hope of big laughs, you are disappointed with the Dressler-Polly Moran team because it is a really amazing movie. It has also been very badly done, surprisingly, that it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's bare-cinematography is strictly "created by the camera and does not move it to school", often to the detriment of the foundry who finds himself out of the screen (like a frying pan and scanning before it existed). ) or whose head has been cut off. The film does not even have a credible director, which is the basis for the obvious flight of production. In general, this is a complacent confusion, because Dressler is often too emotional and just this strange, last rollerbuster holder to separate the bathroom.
