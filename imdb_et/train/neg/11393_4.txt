Wow, I can't believe people consider it a "good" movie. Now I have seen much worse, but John Cusack has many more romantic / funny comedies. <br /> <br /> This is at best a mediocre movie. Although acting was not terrible, but not great, there was little passion for romantic comedy, little romance. There were many open ends that didn't appear or were addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters come as a coward. They do not feel well enough to understand that they do not love the people with whom they are connected. How do we know they're not in love? In the absence of complete regret, both characters have left their finances. I think some things are more romantic than the constant escape from the commitment shown by these two examples. other than hot potatoes when the commitment is approaching. This movie is really about two people who can't do anything, unlike Cusack's earlier characters who were more than ready to deeply commit (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this movie was the complete absence of any kind of twists or factors of interest. When the movie ended, I felt they couldn't add the top of the story, which basically fits the whole movie: boring. There is no tension as to whether these two come together, no joy when they do, any consequences for their actions. criticism "Everyone is too cynical!" The criticism of this film is not cynicism, just an impartial investigation. There are many other better romantic comedies, even those with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies, hearts explode: Princess Bride, say something, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Religion, Charade, Rear Window, Northwest of North or Mary (which is a good idea-romance and study of today's society).
