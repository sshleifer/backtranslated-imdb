I can't show it! Have you ever had any redeeming quality, one funny or one plot line that "doesn't" mean that the average viewer would want to sink into cornflakes? <br /> <br /> Voices. Oh, those terrible, evil voices. Repeatedly try to drag a fine set of cutlery from the dust onto the board so that each character is exceptionally annoying in its ability to nose vowel. Cosmo sounds like a whirling mongrel, Vicky sounds stereotypical, and Timmy's father makes every line of sound like a bad recognition of the game performance (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street"). <br /> <br /> Animation is terrible; even "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at this exhibition overwhelmingly on bad works. Each character has a three-head head for its teeth or a square head or for its body. And what characters speaks, every row speaks with a wide eye and smiles, as if the photo would represent the op with the president? Then there is the fact that every exhibitor is completely moral. Not from the fame of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck's "Charles in Charge", the characters are so foolishly depicted. Usually "unreal" is synonymous with "unusual" and it is definitely so. It hasn't been so dirty because it's "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show (and that's the same for every episode, so big time spoiler warning here): Timmy wants something with his "relatively oddparents", something goes wrong, there's always a somewhat understandable reason, why he can't turn around immediately and want to prevent damage, and then everything turns out well. Oh, and on one side point out that Timmy's parents don't believe him when he complains about Vicky, and they continue to use him whenever possible. Perhaps this is just me, but it seems that the children's exhibition, which contains a fine message that it doesn't do much to say about the abusive babysitter, is probably not a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you write paper and want to quote an example of how much cartoon quality has fallen, "Honest Strange Parents" must be a great place to start. An excellent example of television producers who throw little or no product at the worth of a product for children because they know someone is watching it.
