Every time and again, you hear a radio dj who invites listeners to name movies that the listener can't stand or ever watched. It's a movie I think ... days later. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Shakespeare. Not sure, but I think he saved this film for about 20 minutes a minute ... I think I realized that my toenails wouldn't stick to me and they looked at me insignificantly to get cut. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to me boring and pretentious. <br /> <br /> Although this is the first movie I've ever given so low a score (which I was actually trying to watch), I wouldn't want to put you off of other films by English director Peter Greenaway. I remember that his "cook, thief, his wife and his lover" was a really big British film, although its content was sometimes stained - a brilliant film, but I understand why people are obstructing it. Another good movie from Greenaway was "A zed and two noughts". Again, there was content that pushed the limits of good taste, but was intriguing. <br /> <br /> Another movie I usually think of for such radio shows too late is "Brazil". Never was able to see that he was falling asleep all the time! <br /> <br /> If you have no taste for self-important films that are highly stylized, hard-working, and hard-to-track, guide Prosero books.
