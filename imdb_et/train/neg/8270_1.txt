There is no plot, tons of poorly targeted / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers / world-famous cereals who can't even reach their targets a few meters away? And what's up? ---> A number of lawyers swearing in the carnival gallery? WTH?), Technical mistakes (How many bullets can you get into the schedule? 100+? These people shoot weapons without reloading). The film is so bad that even an older Hollywood actor, such as Michael Biehn (foreigners, terminator), does not save this spam. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie (I realized I wasted a good 100 minutes of my precious life in it). Hopefully, the director will stop knowing more about making movies or his next movie.
