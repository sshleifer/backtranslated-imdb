There is much talk about torture these days. It's all this movie. This is a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. Since then, he has been attacking him. I don't know at what point you do anything. There's a woman and a child there somewhere; he has great guilt and fear. But it should have been some time he could have acted. The film seems to be a joke. I think that after Manson's murder we had a bit of a fixation of these two. But why should someone make such a movie? What complaints, except sadism. The conclusion is totally unsatisfactory, but it could have been improved by the twisting of the obvious plot. Oh, well. Another hour and a half of my life.
