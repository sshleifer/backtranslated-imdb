Charles Bronson continued his 80s decline, which may be his worst film of the decade, if ever. He plays a detective who goes a long way to follow a pimp who has kidnapped an Asian girl and is currently selling him to the highest bidder. This is a disgraceful attempt to act and is probably the most depressing film ever. Many people consider the Death Wish queue to be Bronson's worst film. The aftermath of Death Wish was not a big movie, but most of the time they were competent and very observable. However, Kinjite is a completely boring thriller that is thought out of heavy racism and child torture. It is a really controversial film and all that worse is that it is trying to declare a "law and justice" mentality that is too redundant to really say something. Indeed, the film begins with a minor sex that breaks with Bronson, then shakes the pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago theater, which I looked at just because of the awkwardness of this scene, only looked at this pimp shaking the girl in this movie. It makes no sense whatsoever to use, and the movie was not well written enough to rise above the usage level and give something that would work. Bronson seems like things, but it's obviously too reluctant to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor, but it's the last of his worst. The sequences are also bad. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * 4 (awful)
