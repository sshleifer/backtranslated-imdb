Wow. This movie worshiped me when I saw it. Bland, pointless and immobile. <br /> <br /> Probably ash and lid. "The Spirit of the Garden" ("Princess Mononoke" much?) can take the time, they meet Dork named Sam and the "plot" begins. Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get high with nature, become hippies and try to release Celeb ("Spirit") from some strange hunter. I don't even know what went on. Everything went blurred. Ash's friends were barely and all the fighting scenes were boring. OO;) Then Ash learns after returning to his time that his new friend is actually his rival grandfather. And I think this is the case. Really slowed down? If you love your children, you won't reveal them. (1 out of 10)
