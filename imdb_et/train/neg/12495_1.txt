OK, I love bad horror. I especially love horror, which is bad enough. Demonicus or dead house - they were bad enough to joke. Severed wasn't. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and we sat through the movie and I have a number of comments on both style and actual criticism. <br /> <br /> Plot - In this city there is a boy (possibly Seattle, see comment below) who runs around and cuts his head. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you very much), maybe two or three years. One head a week. And the police JUST NOW calls the "specialist" (who ONCE refers to psychological, but it never comes again). <br /> <br /> Schya right! Federal companies take over what, MOL, related to killing? After HIGHLIGHTS TO FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING, we were under attack! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this "specialist" consults the voodoo chick who has been ignored by the police all the time, and two of them conclude that it is Baron Samed, a voodoo spirit who cuts his head to get enough power to do yourself body (and then probably around the world - or maybe just go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Setting up - where is it going? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you may not realize that the bar / rave (where there are about ten movie workers and their family members) has a poster for the local radio station and that the "Pulp Fiction" Esqe Dialogue (as IF) between the two police (yes, those who can cut their heads in about 15 minutes flick) will talk about the "new stadium", which may be a problem when it was made. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize for the movie and hang my shame in shame. <br /> <br /> OK, here's the critical - horror movie writer (not published, don't look for my name in IMDb), I'll investigate. A lot of research. And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - the Vojon Loa (spirit) who is guarding the graveyard and has traditionally been associated with various Christian accusers "Satan" is actually the God of the Loki-style trick. In other words, he won't break his head. <br /> <br /> Moreover, much of Voudoun's religion is that Baron Samed may have a body if he so desires. Their religious ceremonies are in the midst of various church members. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that if he already has someone else, why make a new body? <br /> <br /> Baron Samed GOT's body, he didn't want to cut his head, he would have got good rum and cigars and par-TAY !!! <br /> <br /> All in all, the only thing they did to get (surprisingly) is that they are completely unnecessary when reading a Tarot card (used only to show that the voodoo chick is "horrible") Screwed Interpretations of Cards How Most Movies Do. Again, I've done some research. (Anyone who remembers reading old late-night ads for tarot readers - "Lovers - you have to be in love soon ..." and all that nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you did this through my comments, congratulations. And I'm still sorry. I'm sorry if you feel the need to watch a movie for me so please don't.
