I've read the comments that you shouldn't watch this movie when you search for Shakespeare's dialogue. Unfortunately, this is true, because the whole confusing dialogue, this wonderful game, is cut and replaced with songs. I have read this game and recently luckily show it, but this is one of my favorite Shakespearian comedies, but this movie seems to take everything I like. The princess, though she did not doubtless do what she had done, had no regal maturing, and all the girls seemed to lose their wisdom - this was also influenced by unreasonable cuts, which not only took away women who had already had little dialogue, but took notes out of context - it was a little pointless to hear the princess proclaiming; "We are smart girls who mock our lovers!" The news in the film also rolled the stream and took away many great scenes because they showed information in their scenes and were in modern terms. To sum up, this is a great game that is destroyed by a strange concept and smart cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What were you thinking?
