It's a terrible movie. All three stories are closed with a psychiatric hypnotist that is unnecessary and all stories are bad. The first is natural wolves and a lady, there are some things that make no sense, but the thing about hypnotism is. One who has a bad Bill Paxton as a maniac companion should not see anyone. Last, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible, which I think makes it better than the second garbage.
