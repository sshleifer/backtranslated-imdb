This movie had such a promise !! What a great idea, the underdog paintball team is fighting for recognition and personal glory, but loses its speed because of poor dialogue, poor editing and half-story. At first, the characters were interesting, but losing steam halfway to get one-sputtered one-sputtering fatigue. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spent more time on the story and dialogue he would have had a great movie, not just an afterthought.
