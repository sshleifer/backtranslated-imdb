If shrubs can really make fun, it would be better to make sure that it has something extra. If this is an extraordinary version of the political characters that make jokes about the future, it is not yet easy. Dick Cheney and George Bush are well done, but Dick Cheney mostly breaks. There is also Condoleeza Rice, who for some reason has Bush drunk and Donald Rumsfeld, who is not at all similar to Donald Rumsfeld. Democratic figures rarely give their names, so it's a secret to who might be Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> Episodes have cohesive stories, but it's not nearly enough to sink.
