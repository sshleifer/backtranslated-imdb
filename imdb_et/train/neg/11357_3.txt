1. good news. 3-D is remarkably well done and they don't go to any tricks. The film is based on the true story of the highest point of human history and even one of the actual actors in the story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now there is meat: it's FLIES, Crisscake! Hitting the eyes of big, horned people, true, but still flying. Remember when I compared "Underworld" movies to rats vs. cockroaches? It was not meant for praise, and I didn't dream that anyone would literally take it. That's even less empathy for that. Baby breeds? Ugh. One of these Hollywood group reunions was obviously flik on the drawing boards "Space Chimps", as well as space launchers. <br /> <br /> Go for "Apollo 13" and see the 9-digit REAL space program (RIP).
