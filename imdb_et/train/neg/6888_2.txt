This movie is poorly prepared, badly behaved and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly annoying and cannot access the same Napolean Dynamite routine. Confident and unknown. Diane Keaton plays the same minded, overly affectionate mother who takes care of too much and is not nearly enough about her children 's lives (see. Because I said so). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I like it in general, is also playing a foolish idiot. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is satisfactory but something special. Please skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
