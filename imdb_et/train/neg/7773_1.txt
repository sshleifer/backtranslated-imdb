This film was what sounded like a good premise: 9 people are facing their fears to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and pointless as a dance scene. Some scenes are just a pretext for directing the camera to parts of a woman's body. Action is bad, but some lines are fun in their horror. What's really strange is that at the end of the movie it turns into a 5-minute western, and ultimately it doesn't make sense for the rest of the film, which many of them were. It seemed as if the director had just added things because he thought it would look cool while ignoring the plot of the movie. It just didn't make much sense. The only crappy thing was that the old people danced down in the hall, but it's not even close to that confusion.
