** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is completely unrealistic, there is no plot, and it was basically just a letter to portray. The most embarrassing scene of the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower, and then we see her television from PSYCHO showers. This movie assumed that the users believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character has enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how much! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Finally, the killer let his gut Shabana Azm long enough for Naseeruddin Shah's character to hit him! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ENDS *** <br /> <br /> At first, it's a bit humorous (just a little) to hear the General Director and cast members who insult each other and heard Shabana Azm's exclamation: "Oh sh -t! " <br /> <br /> baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** Off ********** (2 out of 10)
