It must be one of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to be filmed and shown in cinemas as recently as 2006. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many visible sponsored products in the same movie. It should not be so clear. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why so many famous actors even thought the idea was even visible in such a movie. If I had any respect for the well-known participants of this film before seeing the film, it is definitely gone. I've heard that there is still a movie, and I don't understand how this is possible.
