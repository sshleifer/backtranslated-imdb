Critics spoke of death if it is not so great. Of course, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, just alternating between the spokes. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was a fast paced glove like a silly movie "Swordfish". The reason why this film is more popular is that it was released in the US and "Chaos" was world-wide at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and the US. <br /> <br It is true that this movie gives a lot of respect to classic movies like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that doesn't mean it would be a pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> See if there is anything else in T.V, but you probably get bored.
