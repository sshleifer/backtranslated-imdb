The horny naked female angels in heaven (with big plastic fangs) have started to live in a horrible forest where they feed on all the unhappy souls who should climb. Isn't it a long time before group rides on the road to become blood-sensitive babies? An independent low budget horror made in the UK, in the forest forest, is an interesting prerequisite and rubs it in a pan with some of the worst actions, effects and directions I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts Shows The Camera's Random Beauty? The painted house scenes are quite tense and there are some "shock" moments in hand - but mostly the film is technically amateur. Throw in some truly terrible performances of Tom Savin and Shaun Hutson, and you have one real bad movie in your hands. <br /> <br /> Some fun can be deduced from the shyness of the film and there are many loads of female nudity that the boys will taste, but most will find this harvest to sit down.
