"They are among us" is at best poor scientific literature. In the middle of this movie are bogs. Plot holes are many. Aliens who somehow came to earth on the meteorite and who are hiding among us for over 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to appear as people. In their unfamiliar form, they have exo skeletons (so they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. The heroine's father "disappeared" after closing the Blue Book project, but was probably an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, choose "Body Snatcher Invasion" and see how to do it right.
