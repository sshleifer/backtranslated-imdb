Amazing. What you say when you sat through this movie. Just, incredibly, amazing. It's actually so amazing that someone was stupid enough to make money for that monster so you just can't believe what you see. That, my friends, is really scary for this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea. <br /> <br /> Well, here is another amazingly original story: a high school student (sometimes as a college figure) is a whore for a mother, lives in a trailer park and is an "artist" who is ridiculed because her "everything is different". Well, of course, this bad ridiculous boy is killed, and here is the original part, his soul lives in a scarecrow (under which his last mother, the last John, is killed). Then he goes by the standard that kills all the people who hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here's a breakdown: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> - An amazingly funny movie, even if it's not what the drunken filmmakers wanted. <br /> <br /> - This and the order on one disk in the Wal-Mart $ 5.00 trash, so it's just overpriced. <br /> <br /> Couldn't hurt it, Didn 't Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and gore are sort of standards. One person is carved with a chimney. <br /> <br /> - as they make music work hard, but it doesn't really fit in with the film and it's not all that good. <Br> Bad: <br /> <br /> Strong, terrible action. When was it finished as a low eyebrow stapler? <br /> <br /> - A ridiculous story. <br /> <br /> - Scarecrow vomits one liner that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - The standard love story goes somewhere and is badly done. <br /> <br /> - Some people killed seem randomly selected? you never know who is and then they are killed. And you just think they had to come. <br /> <br /> - Man: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average fare, just with the murder scarecrow? well, all this second mess. <br /> <br /> - As close as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or even Angela's "Sleepaway Camp" series, all better than this cruelty. <br /> <br /> - The absolute worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The script is loaded with a level I never imagined. Am I serious here? This is a complete step awfully. Don't get me wrong, but it's funny as hell? But I've never heard more of the asinine torture even "Slumber Party Massacre III." This movie "Jason X" looks like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - A man who kills a scarecrow boy who is the worst wig. Dialogue that fits. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - This is where the primary school youth get out of their funny dialogue: "Hey, let's tiny torture. Huh huh." <br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematic Art: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (No Nudity, Mother Whore, Girls) do not suffer bras) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (low quality, medium volume) Dialogue: 0/10 (extremely ridiculous, blatant, superficial and painfully funny so bad it is good.My first evaluation of the dialogue in every movie!) Music: 5 / 10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> One more just for those people like me, who enjoy watching pure nonsense. Or graduates of the Slasher movie. It's not a good movie at all. The laughing dialogue and the characters keep it really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
