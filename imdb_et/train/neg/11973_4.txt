This is probably one of the worst French films I've seen so far with more than 100 French films I've ever seen. A terrible scenario and very mediocre / unprofessional action leads to non-conductive force. with the fact that it doesn't matter how nice the western French scene and the fancy music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this movie is that these two characters don't attract people unless the audience cares about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how this film received a jury award at Cannes, a man I love almost all the award-winning films in Cannes, but not that. It is a great disappointment for me.
