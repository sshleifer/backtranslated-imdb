How can a big German TV channel transmit such confusion? It's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even the well-known Gottfried John is acting very bad - especially in the double murder scene - how amateur .......! The screen layout is very, very extended - maybe fill in 2 movie sections. Be careful to stay asleep while watching! The set is probably often a blue screen, eg. Scenes on a ship with an unreal sea background ...! In the German version, sound and dubbing are very bad - probably the reason: the languages ​​of different parties - but: other international productions are more professional. Tip: DON'T look - it's a waste of time!
