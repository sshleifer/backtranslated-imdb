Sheesh! What a terrible movie. The Dodgy camera works, a script that has more corn than Kellogg, and acts as a hammy so you can open pig farming. <br /> <br /> To limit everyone, what do you want to target - Cornel Wilde - or is it Corny Wilde? - About the dangers of smoking about the dangers of smoking when someone illuminates a cigarette, dear oh dear, and on another awkward scene we have baddie, Lobo, forcing him, if you want, a "male friend" to make a striptease dressed in bikini. Try to explain that this is for children ... <br /> <br /> Throw out an exaggerated treasure of the Treasure Island-cum-Jaws, and the result is an unintentionally funny movie, it's enjoyable - I shouldn't wait for a special edition DVD every quickly.
