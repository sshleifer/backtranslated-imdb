For the first time, I looked at Cold Case after having been on Danish television for about a year. Almost 4 or 5 other American crime exhibitions, which had been broadcast at about the same time, drowned upon reaching the TV. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I missed death. Inferior actors with independent right faces and morals were behind. The whole assumption that so much money was given to the team of investigators to solve the murders of 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor because they only have 50-60 mins to tell the story, which means they can break through time to solve the case and bring surviving family members to life when they are still alive. This, together with the "personal" problems and relationships of the investigators, which have to show time, leave the exhibition complete. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2-star rating because the music is over, which is really the only reason to watch it ... which you don't do, of course, because it's too small to watch this mess.
