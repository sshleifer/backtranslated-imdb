I keep this short; thanks to Greg that he helped me to put it briefly: Captivity is about a guy who drinks drugs, impresses and tortures him, then he is imprisoned to have sex with him. This is a single twist of a movie and a punchline. It is torture when rape is slow. And it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad that it's good; it's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that there are "spoiler code" among the critics, which they do not dare to break, although some tortured it because it is so weak. Why NOT ONE was a cojone to speed up and say, "It's a garbage, and that's why it's outside of me. <br /> <br /> Don't give your money to these poop-football.
