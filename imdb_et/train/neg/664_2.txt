I don't really like the remake and the retellings of modern jargon, but this movie pulled me down. Original Prom Night, though not in my humble opinion, the masterpiece still realized what it was ... a horror. Horror film making must be remembered. Critical interest is very important for maintaining the interests of the audience. Sorry people, but it wasn't a white finger! The fears were cheap and predicted terribly. (A good example of the intimidation that has now been made for the cliché surplus, whether the cat jumps out of the closet, shortly afterwards, but the film's villain is now an unexpected look.) another horror movie convention. Must be a pleasant hero or heroine. There's no such thing on this movie. The person I most identified was the head detective. His calm behavior, but a flat approach to the killer's escape, was what more movies this movie should have. Common sense approach to events. (If you run Axis who use psycho, then you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Do not hit, looking back three seconds, trying to kill the killer, but travel over every branch and on the path of inanimate objects.) them alone. And if you suspect an unpleasant game, tell someone not to look at yourself. These clichés are tired and well played. Horror's genre in general and especially in this movie.
