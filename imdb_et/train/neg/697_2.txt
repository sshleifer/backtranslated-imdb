These two things are good about this movie - two unknown fame. <br /> <br /> First of all, with Daphne Zun, for the first time in a movie, young and supple, with a look that still covers her body today, steals what's all at first, and that's it. He's obviously just starting out because his actions improved with his next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the famous composer Christopher (Chris) Young's score is the one that keeps one star of this smell ... yes, I know one star is not much, but for this movie it's a lot . The rest is just a stupid meaningless horror from a couple of students trying to clean the dormitory, which is designed to crush, one by one to attack the unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where it goes. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zun, then turn it off.
