This is a hybrid being born in the mind of Carl Macek. Robotech's second generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 are one unhappy movie with no logic! The story is very bad and you can't forgive Megazone for action if you have nothing to do with Robotech. If this film has such a high rank, then for TV series and not for itself! I said it, the name won't save it!
