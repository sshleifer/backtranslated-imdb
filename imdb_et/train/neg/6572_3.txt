In my opinion, the title of this movie should be changed to "All About Lane" instead of "Bold". I went to screen this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with this result. Although I appreciate that the director made a film about 442 men - a topic that had long been a feature of the film industry - in some parts of the film, action was quite hidden. The performances by Marc Dacasos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all great. At the same time, the director should NEVER make the film the main character. Sorry Lane, you're not just a movie actor. Stay tuned to what you are good at - a theater artist. Gina Hiraizum's performance in this film was also terrible. He should never have spoken and his appearance was not suitable for playing the part of Miss Nisei's queen. There were other young actors in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were excellent ... Why didn't they give that role? Another major problem with this film was its sequences of action. Japanese-American soldiers don't look like they are fighting with German soldiers ... not to mention anyone. It was a low budget, but since it was a war-based film, is it not important to show that some of them are actually fighting? This movie was a worthwhile test, but it was definitely not worth the big break.
