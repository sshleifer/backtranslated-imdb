I do not often go out of the way I write my comments, but I just had to warn someone who might think that when they look at it, they see comedy. It's not close. Although the premise (color / gender / any change) is bad enough (and it has been done, better, several times before), the actual transformation of the two black boys into two white girls is one of the most convincing transformations ever put on the screen. It would be bad enough if everything that the script required was changing the white chicks. But Wayans brothers have to hide themselves as two specific white women. As you now think, they are not fully capable. I have seen that queens without makeup are more convincing women than the two best suited to Hollywood's special effects and make-up people. Its terrible. Add a basketball player built as a building, a terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course, and this movie will hit a new personal low. And I like bad movies! Avoid like plague.
