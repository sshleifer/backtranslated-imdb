"Raw Force" is like a highly perverted and perverse version of a love boat, with additional Kung Fu fighting, demented cannibalistic monks, white slave trade, energetic zombies and a whole host of terrible exhibitions. No wonder this movie was included in the recently released "Grindhouse Experience 20 movie set". It has everything the fanatics of exploitation are looking for, mixing with a totally inconsistent and seemingly improvised script! Production values ​​are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic, but it is difficult to describe the amount of free violence and sex. The film opens in a tropical sunny place called Warriors Island, where the power of the Sneering monks raises the dead without obvious reason, except to make them Kung Fu fighters. The monks also buy sexy slaves from a butterfly-like businessman, probably because women's flesh supplies them with the necessary powers to expand their zombie army. By Hitler's soldiers, tourists are attacked by a passing cruise ship, including three martial arts fighters, a female LA policeman and a whole host of fearsome but dull women, as they planned a tour of Warriors Island. Their lifeboat is washing the island anyway and the monks are challenging survivors to fight their zombies. Okay, how does that sound crazy at night in horror movies? It's not over yet, because Raw Force also has piranhas, orchestras of natural boats, Cameron Mitchell's yet another embarrassing leadership role and Camille Keaton, the dukes of 70's exploitation ("I spit my grave") in a totally irrelevant fire. There are many poorly realized gores, including ax and fraud, hammy jokes and bad romance. The value of the trash in this movie literally leaves no word. The background of the evil monks remains, of course, inexplicable, and they cannot even be punished for suspicious hobbies. Perhaps the movie "Stop" instead of "To Be Continued". The sequel never came when it was not so hidden that IMDb didn't even list it.
