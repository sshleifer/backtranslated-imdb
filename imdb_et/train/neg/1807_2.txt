I testify that I am an age-old hippie dip, I'm a mammal of these films. I can enjoy some of the hippie genre scripts much more than most "normal" people. However, this film is simply conceivable of any formidable. <br /> <br /> Any hippie stupidity is presented as a gospel, police officers kill young long hair when he peacefully lands. This movie is so terrible that it's not even funny to see the hippie drone's exaggeration. It's like the left-hand version of Dragnet, except for the professional actors. The only reason I gave him two letters was because there were some interesting things in the sound track, and I couldn't find the choice of negative characters. <br /> <br /> There are no actors, almost no plot, emission, barely script ... you have this, "art" movie .... All this happened in the slowness of drilling a root canal, just dragging every meaningless scene for time. <br /> <br /> A strange biography that imitates art, the star of the movie "nonactor" joined the community in real life and kidnapped the bank from Boston, one of its robbers was killed and sent to jail, where he was killed in a "Accident" during suspicious weight gain ... and I think he had to leave it as a legacy .... Oy vey.
