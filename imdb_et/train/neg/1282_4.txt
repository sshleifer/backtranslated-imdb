Here is one of the films that the studio demands for a happy ending. The conflicts that stretched out for years are solved in a few minutes. It would have been much more interesting than injecting ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck has been canceled with a sudden metamorphosis, independently and confidently, from a woman to her, as she has put her life down. Brent, as usual, is over his head, and then Gig Young's ridiculous situation is playing Gig Young's name. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then who appears, but Gig Young, the actress! It is worth noting what is much lower than what it might have been.
