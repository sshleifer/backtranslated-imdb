Such a happiness deserves a space camp with unhappy happiness during a happy accident. "Stars" are acting, Lea Thomson actually turning to the side when asked more than his usual wide-eyed innocent smile, probably to hide his striking attempts. The film is sometimes fun when it comes to asking you too much. A little boy holds a multi-million dollar robot in his closet, which breaks when he is given too many orders by the hordes of pent-up dormitories. This hackneyed and unlovable machine, "Jinx", is the main participant of the ridiculous premise of the film, which seems to be part of the Short Circuit, part of the 2001 plane team. I will not suffer you with this, it is enough to say that you can only laugh at it. Having said all this, SeaQuest is pleasant to see if it's recorded by Bell. Romance and technology, be careful, be as incredible as each other. Even if you're a freak of the eighties, it's impossible for Kate Capshaw (Willi's Doom Temple) and of course Lea Thompson's fun show. Joaquin Phoenix also takes a vicious turn as a kind of wannabe Goonie, who interacts with Jinx. Don't go near this movie if you're not a trash fan.
