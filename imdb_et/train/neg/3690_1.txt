Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in her life. It's a movie that caused her to fall. It appeared to be a leap, but it fell badly and caused serious financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to repay them personally for the damage they suffered. Soon after it was released, he tried to participate in politics but failed unhappy. This is a very bad film with terrible action, poor quality makeup and a pathetic scenario. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a disease. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba's first first show in the theater. The viewers were so bored that most of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I don't recommend it to anyone.
