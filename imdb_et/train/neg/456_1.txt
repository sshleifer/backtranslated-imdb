Add to cartoons: the southern preacher and the "congregation", the tortoise singer (Sophie Tucker?), The Dance Choir and The Mills Brothers - which makes it worse. <br /> <br /> "Negro" performers, who often perform in the movies to parody themselves and their competition. Although "Negro Comedy" could be received on her day, it is very offensive today and I doubt it was ever funny. Though I wouldn't be offended, I don't think I'd laugh with a weak sense of humor. However, as an 11-year-old white boy, I wouldn't have understood it.
