This is the best-known Ferrari that fell during Eddie Griffin's promotion. <br /> <br /> The race and betting story is badly made with numbers that seem to be the director who didn't see the numbers. The ratio of scores and shots to a group of participants for salary control. It is not a good movie, but it is not bad enough to be observable and ultimately what something film is not worth disturbing, no matter how you watch it. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the leaders is a woman, a movie that was clearly made just to become a producer and director near beautiful girls. Do you want evidence? There is nothing that prevents women from staying side by side for a long time, but not just to get too many people who are afraid of renting a porn or sports illustrated swimsuit DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid all the costs of this movie
