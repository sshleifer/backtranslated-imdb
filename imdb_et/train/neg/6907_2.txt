There is no artificial record here because it doesn't deserve one. Not a feature film. Not even one of these "hidden" gems. You know, like those movies you hear through a friend who saw this amazing movie in the city center, where they show all the good, independent and artistic films. <br /> <br /> Simply pack it on Christmas cards and destroy it quickly.
