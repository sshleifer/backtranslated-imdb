I despise thinking about what people have to think about for environmentalists after watching this surprising preaching cinematic trash. With remarkable Indian-wannabe nutrition and space-brothers to supply a new-era shop, Starlight makes anyone who gives the planet a damn look like a faded crystal pleasing idiot. <br /> <br />? Alien Rae Dawn Chong comes to lead the underwear model in a mysterious attempt to prevent the Earth's impending environmental challenge. But first they have to defeat an evil alien who doesn't see a refugee from Castro Street Bar. Luckily, they have a mysterious grandfather, Willie Nelson, with help (who also sees embarrassment as well as being) with cheap F / X and nonsense swell music. /> Of course, the clunky script helps to hide the movie's tricked plot and the amazing pace, but that's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg. Anyone involved in this film should cancel their professional cards until they complete the actual environmental science course.
