Ivan (Valery Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates inexplicable. He goes to a small town where it says that the witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> Her car stops and hides in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly he becomes a demon and he kills him and the city wonders who murdered this woman ... who I think was a witch, but I'm not quite sure. Ivan is now catching up with his spirit or something and he must believe it or something to win it. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with flat actors, stupid story and minimal effects. Not to mention that it's not just a Christian movie ... but also a stranger. Ivan's actress made the movie more comical than terrorizing because it is so high and clever. There's not much left out of this movie.
