Joe Don's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (on the island of the pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker on Italian mobile tracking. Joe Doni's character is called Geronim (pronounced Heronimol) and all he does in this movie is to shoot people and get arrested over and over again. Everyone in the movie hates him, just as everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked the earlier picture of Greydon, "Angel's Revenge," because it was a stigma for boys over the years. Avoid this movie at all costs!
