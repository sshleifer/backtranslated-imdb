Last day it was caught by IFC and can't believe in positive comments! Am I the only one who thought these "ladies" were something else? Kate tells Jed that he can be fired because he should be a community pillar but puts him out! Then they suddenly decide they're in love? And he's SO dead over his death, he doesn't go to his funeral, much less, tell his family "good news"! By the way, how did the American become a great British school director? Janine should have fought for the power to make it impossible to abuse power, but nothing happens! And he runs up when he brought him to the poll! The less you talk about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> As for Janine and Molly, I feel over Jedi! This is a damn damn mistake he got into the road! Where's the fault of the bad Gerald who's got in? If only I could do the bosos behind the same "movie"!
