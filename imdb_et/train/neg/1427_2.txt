In the British claymation series, which made "funny" conversations about "average" people "cute" in the mouth of masterly creatures, at least the advantage of non-British spectators and the rare cultured humor you didn't get on US television. Someone made a mistake on PUTTING this US television. <br /> <br /> Similar to the sadly failed American com COUPLING American version, which died in NBC during the month, when the same basic scripts were not "translated" from English into English, which looked droll and cultured (and just BIT) bored in England, the American version of CREATURE COMFORTS, which is just bored with dolls. There is no graphic line, no signs, and after one and a half episodes (three final results), there is no reason to suffer more. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about the new Summer series and the gracefully short run was that Claymation has been at least professionally made and is one of the worst shows in the CBS schedule, the new adventures of Old Christine ( or "how to be a HORRIBLE mother - or a man - with an infinite, unusual lesson), kids who wanted to stay at bedtime will be happy to bed when they sat through this show, and adults could wait until 21:00 when" two and two half man "" (innocent joy) and "how did i meet your mother" (real quality).
