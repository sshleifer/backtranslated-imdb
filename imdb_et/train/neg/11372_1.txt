I've been using IMDb for years and I've never wanted to participate in movie commentaries until now. This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I'm not a Muslim, nor am I an Islamic research expert, but I know enough to shed light on the obvious one-sided view that this documentary supports. <br /> <br /> The problems in this movie start with a documentary. Most of the documentaries I've seen have anchored some of the current points and surround them with controversial interpretations and false statements. This is definitely for Islam: what you need to know in the West. Yes, there are fundamentalists in the world, and some of them are Muslims, but the creation of a documentary about all Islam about a small part of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. It's really a documentary about Islamic fundamentalist aspects and nothing else. <br /> <br /> For those who want to objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary, there are several points here. <br /> <br /> The documentary showed nothing positive for Islam. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside the area. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The Quran translation used in documentary is questionable. I looked at the documentary while watching another translation and the differences were striking. I had been warned of the translation used in the documentary and now I know why. A good example is Surrah 98: 6. The documentary shows that Surrah says that believers are going to hell. But the translation has read instead: "Those who reject the truth between the people of the book and the polytheists are hellfire." The difference is that those who reject the truth are the people who know God and the truth of God and choose to reject it. <br /> <br /> The film mentioned that there is no morality for Islam, but that is not true. Although it is true that much comes from the Qur'an and the Hadith, Islam also recognizes the concept of "Urf or normative behavior". Obviously, the normative can be interpreted in a number of ways, but "Urf is meant for" good "behavior that the average person would consider right or wrong. It's not just true. There are many Islamic educational institutions and they range from progressive to modernist to fundamentalist as they interpret the law. <br /> <br /> The Hadith tradition is similar. Hadith has thousands and every law school accepts and rejects others Using Hadith without a serious scholarship to decide which are accurate, real, and applicable, selects and chooses non-history citations that match what you want to say - that is what the documentary did. > I hope people understand that fundamentalism is a problem, not Islam or any other religion. I know it is not the same as suicide attacks, just to understand that fundamentalism justice is unquestionably a problem. If you feel you have the answer, everyone else must be wrong. But if you feel that you have the answer, you can work with other people's opinions about politics, religion, God or anything else.
