CRIME BOSS is headed by Alberto De Martino; An Italian crime drama, partly filmed in Hamburg, Germany. A simple forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good car chase sequence, this flick seems almost pure. The new Don takes over the mighty mafia family and finds himself in the fight for his life. The unwritten laws and ethics of Mafia codes make it harder for anyone to trust millions of dollars at stake. Brutality and violence grow in the same way. It can't be put on a real gangster epic shelf. The appearance of the film brings back memories of American driving. Even a popular American actor, Telly Savala, cannot increase the caliber of this criminal. Antonio Sabato also celebrated: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
