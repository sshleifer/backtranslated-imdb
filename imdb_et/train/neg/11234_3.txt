This movie is bad on Friday 13th. The film is about a killer named Bernie, who kills people around the camp council training camp. He kills people because the camp council training camp is in his father's land, and when the police forcefully landed their fathers, they accidentally killed their mother (the second from F13 start). Intro sees Bernie killing his first victims. Then we introduce the family who is going to camp in the same forest right after their arrival, connected by a strange old man who likes to talk to his son. Later we find out that his son is Bernie and that he is locked on the back of his caravan after he has broken out of the mental institute. He sets Bernie after the family so that they can take their things off and then pursue. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for those who enjoy B-Class 80 slashes.
