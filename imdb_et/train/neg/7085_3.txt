I really tried to like this movie. It is a major problem in every society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> With this story, we learn that you can lose everything if you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, who has sexual interference with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic), endanger his marriage, work and even his life. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are terrible; mainly operate. Oh, you don't enjoy MORE sex scenes, most of them are made with very bad taste and you might think you are looking at home decoration. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is not just a mind. How could such a smart and beautiful woman get all the nasty things from her husband? How does he believe him ?! The triple situation is invaluable and will make you confused for a while. <br /> <br /> The scene with the black cinema transmitter is also just nonsense and leaves you thinking of "wtf?" <br /> <br /> Scenes like those you find a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please beware of this; it's not a soft core, it's not documentary, it's not dramatic. This is a pretentious effort that forms a documentary or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski's legs are worth the screen. I got it for HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money. But these 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
