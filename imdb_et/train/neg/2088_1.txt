What a terrible exhibition. Fans of Science Fiction seem to see nothing more than they look at quality. It strikes me that something extraordinary, like Firefly, lasts for one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake creates a spin off. This spin off is sad at every stage. Action is minor and forced. Characters are carton bundles of anything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. Dialogue is worse than the main soap opera. The direction is dirty and the kits are terrible. Caprica is a waste of movies, a waste of time, and a waste of effort. This is one spin off that you should never have done.
