First: I bought it from a video store. Second: I watched it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: it wasn't funny. Fifth, most antics were sheep. And last but not least: it is not only a bad film, but also a complete fiasco. <br /> <br /> Despite this disappointing and forgotten movie, I am a big fan of Adam Sandler. I'm sorry because it was his first film. Even if you're a huge fan of Adam Sandler, don't worry about watching this movie. Instead, just take a video, sit on the yacht and throw it overboard.
