As noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently "You have received a letter", Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" with Ryan. In many versions, this is my least favorite. I think the problem is that the studio remained a charisma for the stars, which is not completely cut here. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of everyday donuts, pleasant but blissful. And if the drivers are bored, then the rest of the movie can be followed. In particular, Judy is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I don't know if he has a problem with pain or anything, but he looks like a turtle trying to pull his head in his cream, all hit and all. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was so hot. I would have made this lovely violin player for a bee. And Van was not great either. I've always thought of him as a pretty general Hollywood leading man, and he doesn't do anything to scatter this picture. </p> may like this movie. But there are lots of fun romantic comedies and they offer you much more than stale pastries.
