I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotypical, and the whole idea was hanging "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a shining girl who is sent to a place she doesn't belong to. The whole place hates him and there is a hot man who doesn't seem to like him to make things worse (the whole fucking school can't stand you). She finds it amazing how she fits and puts everything to her liking. Then there is a choice where he has to choose between drawing and hockey. He chooses ice hockey, then he goes to the skating citizens and gets to the Olympic players. No real surprise. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was so predictable when you knew what would happen before you even saw it. It was so terrible that I almost towed, and until I looked at it, I had a terrible headache and the urge that I would shoot myself to see such a mess. Don't look at it if you're not under ten years, or actually like crappy tween movies.
