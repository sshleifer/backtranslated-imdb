Whether Farmer (Lanter) is playing a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, a super-government computer designed for potential terrorists' profile, is following him because he is borrowing (hacking) money from his neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip in Philadelphia to play chess. At the next neighbor whose computer wants to be confirmed, there are relatives in the middle of the East who send money through their bank to a neighbor's bank and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley has power to rocket rockets. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of war games has been much faster and more aggressive in the early 1980s than warfare. Well, the electronics industry has a lot more work these days. Sounds logical. So this film is dazzled by computer screens with fantastic CGIs, and when Ripley's predecessor, Joshua, has come to work, we are left with a computer and people are breaking, hoping, praying. oh-ing, OMG-ing and more hope that things go. In other words, we are now experiencing a TV-type movie and it's Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 1980s and watch the original warfare movie. That's much better. But we really have to ask ourselves: do we make computers too intelligent when they control us one day, at the right time? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.
