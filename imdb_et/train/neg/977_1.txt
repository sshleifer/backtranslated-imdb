"Fever Pitch" is not a bad film; this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that Hollywood's frustrating extracts say they praised heaven even a mediocre movie that barely laughs? This is the only reason I can think of why this terrible romantic comedy (and I'm using this concept loosely because there's nothing funny about this movie) has good comments. <br /> <br /> I was sitting through this movie that stunned that Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel scriptwriters would even think for a moment that their script was funny. <br /> <br /> An excellent Nick Hornby usually translates a movie. He adapted Fever Pitch to British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell. Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice on "About Boy" (2002), and when "High Fidelity" became an American film in 2000, writers D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not go wrong because they kept the spirit of Hornby and humor. They made one of the best films of this year. <br /> <br /> So why is "Fever Pitch" the American version so painful? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected, and gave us two characters that we could love, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel are all funny in Hornby's work. In the Americanization of production, they are busy removing everything that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replacing it with the usual drivel. <br /> <br /> They've made a funny story into a formal romantic comedy, never a twisted wrong formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each with a separate feature. Obesity, second cynical and ambitious, and third romantic. Want to guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" such fun was not only good man and lady, but also supportive characters. In this "Fever Pitch", six supportive friends make or say nothing special. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason they're in the movie is that the formula requires it. Poor Ione Skye strikes one of Lindsey's palms as an ungrateful role. Lovely Skye must have wanted Lloyd Dobler to come and take him. Come on, Cusack would be great Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to add to such a completely annoying script. <br /> <br /> There are no single moments in this movie that seem to be original or compulsive. The progress of each plot is predictable, each flat joke telegraph. Ganz and Mandel are laughing. The first 45 minutes are so amazingly slow whether you know whether these knees realized they were writing comedy. You can mark this movie as a rotating plot by your watch. It is almost the same as Ganz and Mandel took this screen writing guru with a formula that is pasted on the wall. When they reached a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, "OK, the guru says it must happen." And presto! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't help the movie. They have no idea how to introduce their story and characters (they do not give V.O. a story to the main character, but to another man who is sitting at Ben in Fenway Park). Thanks to some extremely complex writings, we have to look at Barrymore and Fallon through their inconvenient initial meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore does cute and divine better than most. He's as good as Goldie Hawn's flowering field. But even his hardness does not save this extraordinarily horrible movie. He strives to bring out energy and humor from this story. Lindsey speaks about 30 minutes of the movie: "You're funny." The only explanation for his comment is that it was a script. Fallon Ben never says anything funny. Fallon is not funny or funny; when he does comedy he crosses. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never "Saturday night live". He was a fairly funny person at this show. Remember, this flat sketch of the radio DJ, who made all the voices? The only reason why "Weekend Update" worked from time to time was that Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows something or two about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they're funny and behave so rarely, if any, are actually funny. This applies to Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he barely pulls. His beating, unsure of his own shtick did not work on a small screen; it is a lousier on a big screen. <br /> <br /> For Fallon, his role in this picture is also dramatic. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get your dramatic stuff loaded. Especially the two scenes - the first in the park, the second in front of the school - are painful to watch. Scenes need an actor with dramatic power, but Fallon has no knowledge or ability to do it. The amount of his emotions cannot even play from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. Often he comes as an oaf. And it's not loving. It grabs what Lindsey should look like. Compare Fallon's performance with the British version of Firth and understand how terrible, unpleasant and forced Fallon Ben is and how wrong he is for that role. Watching the Fall in "Fever Pitch" makes one long ashton Kutcher's dramatic depth and comedy nuance. <br /> <br /> Just like "High Fidelity", the American "Fever Pitch" would have worked great. He just needed better writers, more competent directors, and certainly a stronger, more fun, wiser man. Make a huge difference: Avoid this rotten movie; Rent a British version of 1997 and read Hornby's book instead.
