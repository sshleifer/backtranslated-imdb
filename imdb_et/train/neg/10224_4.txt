Spoilers <br /> <br /> One line summary tells everyone. Melville "Le samurai" is original and has elements "Leon". And they are better - much better! <br /> <br /> Samurai Alain Delon is a lone warrior / professional killer who keeps the birds in a cage and steals cars for their jobs (so many tense ones)! Even at the end, it is exactly the same: the samurai is looking for death with dignity and gets in hand with an empty weapon. The world has changed, it understands and there is no place for the samurai. <br /> <br /> Delon doesn't kill as many people as the Ghost dog. But I think Jarmuschi liked "Leon" very much or even "Desperado" from Rodriguez. So he added it. And let me think: the girl becomes a professional, like a ghost dog (like Natalie Portman "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So what was Jarmusch's idea? Where's the unique, original idea in this movie? <br /> <br /> I don't see a carbon (celluloid) copy point. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Rating by Macaulay by Connor
