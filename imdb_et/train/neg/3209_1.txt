I also saw this amazing piece of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you need to look at this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably a few beers, so you can get some pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue to be fun, I think it is the introduction of Cremator. Animation is terrible. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. Perhaps it was a good idea that the producers had hired at least one person who was not colored blind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say, this movie is a failure at every level.
