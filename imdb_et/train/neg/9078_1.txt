Wouldn't it be nice if no other teenage movie would really stop all those foolish, pointless, I'll get more sex than you teen movies? In a perfect world, yes. But it is even worse. That doesn't mean lowering the stars, it's downgrading to the distributor. All jokes are basically college students who exhibit things that people probably don't see, but it's funny. Devon Sawa, who was really good at the final destination, is just bored in this movie. It makes you wonder if it is bad. Rating: F
