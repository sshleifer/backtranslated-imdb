Well, there's it, another disappointment in my account. Two, actually! Firstly, although I like to think that I know a little about the introduction of the 70's and its most productive contributors, I never heard of Joseph W. Sarno. Here's a guy who made over seventy raged and culturedly loaded exploits and I haven't seen any! How? Why? What happened here? Secondly, and even worse, when you think you have found a new source for hidden cult movies, this director's most famous and predictable "masterpiece" turns out to be a totally insane and irritating film. Indeed, lesbian vampire movies form a rather insignificant sub genre, but some of them swear by a malicious atmosphere and curious sensuality (like Jos√© Larraz's "Vampyres" or Harry's Ten "Dark Daughter"). Joseph Sarno's film has nothing to offer, except for a large number of free nudity free, and even it gets bored quite quickly. The events take place in a separate old castle hidden in the German mountains, where five centuries ago a malicious and bloody (literally) baroness lived. His loyal disciples still cast the naked dance party into the catacombs of the castle, illuminated by penile candles? AUCH, and I hope that Baroness will recover immediately. Suddenly (not even asking how) the castle is full of young and sexy female guests, so more erotic clothes are created. Sounds delicious and fun, but "Devil's Plaything" contains a huge number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the unknown facial expressions of the cast members are simply unsatisfactory! Sarno is incapable of generating a relationship or building a Gothic atmosphere (or maybe he's just not bothering) and the ability of the actor topless is confined to the front and a truly pathetic face. Please do yourself a favor: no matter how desperately you are trying to see all the 70's lesbian-vampire movies, it's not worth the penny! Even Jess Franco's and Jean Rollin's repertoires are pure art in comparison to it.
