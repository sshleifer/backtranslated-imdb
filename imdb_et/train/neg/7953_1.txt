Although action and leadership could be said to have some values ​​- the story is a very poor Wannabe Vietnam film whose name has just changed. <br /> <br /> At the very least, you have to keep the movie reliable. Try and have some precision on equipment, weapons and tactics. Not to mention that force behavior is a normal misconception. <br /> <br /> In addition to the mighty propaganda of the South African Defense Forces, this is little purpose - definitely not an entertaining value. <Br /> <br /> Capturing filmmakers - it doesn't make a movie. Do some research and pride your product.
