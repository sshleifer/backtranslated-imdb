I am sure that people who look at this British outside will be an entertaining clock, but someone from the UK is hurting their mistakes. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, Elijah Wood can remove the tube that is in the trash can. She tells her sister who she's meeting, "What happened here" and she replies "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in town. They are part of the city, they don't have to go there! And when the fans of Tottenhams wanted to fight other fans, the last place on the earth they'd like to do is the bank's station, which probably has more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> Errors, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays the main hooligan. He clearly decided that East Endi's accent did not attempt to speak, and instead chose Dick Van Dyke's style to make my ears bleed. This was underlined by the fact that the rest of his gang was talking as you would expect the West Ham fans to speak. This mistake made him incredible and the movie really was broken.
