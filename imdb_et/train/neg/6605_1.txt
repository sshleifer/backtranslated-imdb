Designed only to distract (or entertain) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the director's intent had not been to the viewer's editorial, it would have been fine, but I know that the Hollywood director has no such thing as to criticize the American Marxist movement of the 60s, especially not the filmmaker in the 70s. There are so many idiotic dialogues here that sometimes I wonder if I really don't see comedy. You wouldn't be guilty of thinking it's a satire? this is a naive film. Spacek has been part of the left-handed film that brings me to the obvious, inevitable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of these Hollywood liberal mores. But I mean, isn't everything? Nice boobs, but s ** t for the brain.
