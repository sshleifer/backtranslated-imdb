GENERAL RESULTS: - Finally the long awaiting AAG screen. Unfortunately he could not set a progressive fire for the audience. The first best thing to talk about is the powerful SHOLAY idea. And Varma chose to change the overall background of the movie. When he repeats the same Ramghad background, people say again that there's nothing new about it. The different background is grateful, but how he presented it is not worth it. From the beginning of his career with Gender in Telugu, he had used the same lighting and background. I'm seriously bothering the man Varma thinks of lighting, or he has no other lighting technique except Gordon Willis GODFATHER. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why should some body use so many corners of the Netherlands and extreme close-ups !!!!!!! Image sharing is flat. The characters could not do the emotional things that the performances are not their sign, the narration is worse, the background is really terrible. VARMA produced big crooks such as Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he could not celebrate the best stars of the Hindi cinema. Gabbar has not been compared to Babban. Babban is a psycho rather than a villain, but he has a soft corner for his brother (this is a gift in this movie). Amitabhz's performance is not his mark. His appearance is pathetic. The grace of the nose symbolized forgotten black and white cinema villains. Whatever they did in Babban, they are not successful. Babban is not comparable to Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: The first best thing about this character is not to skip your audience. If you did, it would be similar to teaching ABCD to the Bachelor's degree holder. It's good when he opened an early secret. But the setback is pathetic. Varma couldn't use a big actor like a mohan on her sign. <br /> <br /> Durga: The only sign of healing. This sign has been corrected with satisfactory modifications and was used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body disturbs or at least does not guess these signs. The complete failure of the film begins when the director could not work for the close friendship of our loved ones. These characters do not carry anything on this film. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is degrading, decreasing. AAG can be considered as a C-Class film. Sholay is a revenge, a city problem, which means Dharmendra's true friendship and highly appreciated distraction and fun. The AAG never carried emotions with its emotions. The storytelling is too weak that he could not feel sympathy for the audience. Don't compare AAG to sholay, u don't like it. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
