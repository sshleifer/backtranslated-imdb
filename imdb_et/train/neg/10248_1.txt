At the end of the world looks like a good movie box on the cover, but warns it bad. Being a big fan of mega star actor Christopher lee i was deceived. Like tentacles (77), a good pain does not mean that it is a good film. At first it seems promising, then it becomes a tedium, many parts of the movie are too dark to see what's going on. briefly like Lew ayres, dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as security guard. I look forward to the Charles band who made good fun movies like re-animater and dolls.i heard that Christopher Lee was made to make this movie. said his stars were Jose Ferrer, john carridine and dean Jagger.well dean Jagger, but the other two did not (happy) when you make the film to the end of the world using a larger budget and Jagger later went on two good films, alligator (80) and The Death Game (79) also complained about Lyon (Lolita) in the movie minus his fool. If you are guilty of a punishment, I look at the end of the world to dare to say awake throughout the film.
