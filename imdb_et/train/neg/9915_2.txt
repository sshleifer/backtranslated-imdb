I just finished "Dark Chamber" or "Under Surveillance" and I'm stunned. I was stunned, not a movie, but some rave reviews that I watched, affecting my viewing. The story was devastated by the chips of the chips, and most of the actors were as flat as it was comedy. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in astonishment because I suffered this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin leaves the boundaries of residence with a pain-killer mother to live with her police father, despite her mother's warnings that her father is not good. When a young woman is found to be murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of tenants living in adjacent apartments. With the help of a couple, he installs hidden cameras to keep tabs on these people. As the truth begins to unravel, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> One positive thing is that Felissa Rose is hot! I would have kindly added a star or two here if he had a bit of a peel, but that would not be the happiness. This would have been the potential sustainable arm of the film. Eric Conley played Justin very adeptly, I thought, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, although suffering from clich√©s, could have been working without the ridiculously hollow "presentations" of key members, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father). Fear! (sorry pun). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget movies. Indeed, I believe that independent film is our only hope for a decent film in the coming days. I'll cut some low-budget movies somewhat loud when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical scores and overall picture quality. However, I do not give the emission allowances and the Swiss cheese lover script. There are a multitude of competently produced low budget films. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can't help but suspect that at least some of the reviewers recognized by Dark Chamber are somehow related to its production.
