Let's be honest, romantic comedies are considered light compared to dramatic films (see the Academy Award nominees every year). But these art forms are still good. See "When Harry Met Sally," "Sleepless in Seattle," and classic like "Rome Holiday" and "It Happened One Night". I like the good feeling of seeing two people who are determined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to build something that resembles romantic comedy. However, no one believes that the novels are among the main characters and that there is nothing funny to make up for this greater drawback. Modine is such a leading man - especially a romantic leader. I'm sure the CEO, he had the tools - but not in good sense - to throw himself. And Gershon ... I see some comedy talents, but he didn't have a script and a poor character. And whose idea was an English accent? Others are pointless. Others have said this, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly designed, poorly executed; participants are terribly wrong; and characters, well, we just don't give them anything. <br /> <br /> This art is not. Go to rent "Moonstruck" again.
