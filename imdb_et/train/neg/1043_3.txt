What's bad, bad movie !!! I can't believe that the leap that is pretending to be an amateur pretext for a real movie! I left the theater before the end, stunning how bad the direction of this movie and the camera work !! And reading the adorable limbs claiming that this film has the truth and the reality, when it is all in reality, the harsh attempt to pull the wool over observers and festivals is cheap and dry. <br /> <br /> At least this film showed me once and for all that the Sundance festival has become a complete joke, and here the bad film is labeled rather than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You want your time back! I know I did.
