Short version: The seed is not worthless. It is simply derived and worse. And breathless. <br /> <br /> Long Term: If you have never seen any movie that consists of a vaguely defined "psychological horror" genre, this film will probably fuse your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening ceremony of genuine animal abuse is enough to open your eyes to brutal-video capabilities, and the (only) memorable gore scene in the movie may be more than you can. The climax plays with its emotions so that there would probably be no other movie. <br /> <br /> But if you don't have much experience with the genre. If you've seen the real thing ... "August Underground's Penance", you'll find it awfully hard to stay awake until the end of the movie, as I did. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have compared it with old video masters. I understand this comparison. As with video nasties, "Seed" is more violent than mainstream horror film and less exquisite. But the reason why we still know the video nasties is not just for the reasons above - for those who are still popular, there was something special. Let me be unclear, I think you understand: those who are stuck were "souls". <br /> <br /> Get this quote from Gabriele Crisant, the director of "Burial Ground", about an interview with a new-on-DVD: "... we never have more such movies because technology has gone beyond imagination today. And technology is cold Many things disappear because such small movies are no longer being produced, big, extraordinary stunts that are very expensive, but they are cold, this is a fear of terror, more than a million dollars today. There are real effects that have been made with our hands. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is wrong to compare the horror of the old school so seriously, but Crisant has hit the nail on his head, even in the most seemingly exploitable way the best video players acted primitive And this is where Boll falls. It's like watching movies and not understanding them. All the data in the checklist is there ... BS on "filing a statement on humanity", a hidden torture scene, etc. But this is , as Crisanti puts it, "cold". Gore is all CGI. The whole thing seems to be similar to other movies in different genres. And the pace is so slow. Man, so slow. Another interesting note: one gore scene reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, BS is enough. Weak film.
