I saw it last week after the DVDs became cheaper. I wanted to see it at the age, finding the plot sketch very intriguing. So my disappointment was insignificant. I thought the leader actor was very flat. Such a part called for a performance like Johny Depp at the ninth gate (which is almost full of hanging), but I think that TV budgets do not always reach such a capability. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the direction was confusing and boring, serving only to remind that Carpenter hadn't made a decent movie after madness. As for the story, I was also disappointed! I thought it couldn't meet my expectations, but I thought the profitability and explanation was bad, and the way he finally made the film anti-climatic to say that. <br /> <br /> It was written by one of the main contributors to the AICN and you can say that he loves his cinema, but I would have liked a better result based on such a good initial assumption. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
