This documentary is best when it simply shows the Ayurvedic healers' offices and treatments. There is no denying that Indian poverty and even the desperation of their richer clients. However, as a general argument of Ayurvedic medicine, this film is unhappy. While Indian customers mentioned they had seen "aleopathic" doctors, they were not asked by doctors, and we had to take out the vague statements of their patients at face value - "the doctor said there was no treatment," the doctor said it was cancer, etc. " Well, "no cure" does not mean "any treatment" and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have? The film is the weakest in ayurvedic practice in America. It is likely that this stunning suggestion that high-performance Wall Street work may hurt your stomach will decrease.
