Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad film, such and an interesting real story. It had such a promise, but action was at best ridiculous. Some kits were beautiful and realistic. Others are out of the theme park. I saw myself laughing when I looked at what was probably serious scenes. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The best part was fighting with friends who ended up with the king's death. I liked the queen's punishment. And the last shot made a nice picture. There are so many better movies to watch. I don't recommend it.
