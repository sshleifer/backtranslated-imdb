It can be one of the worst films ever producing. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the start where the man is walking ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). Just 15 minutes on foot. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention that there are many problems with lighting, and it's almost like they were shooting around the clock. <br /> <br /> 3. Operation was TERRIBLE. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then took away the people who were turned away. <br /> <br /> Please do not rent this movie for love from all holidays. If you know someone who owns it, excuse them. The director should punish the war crimes tribunal for making it public.
