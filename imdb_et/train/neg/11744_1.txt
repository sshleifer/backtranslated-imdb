After watching this movie as a whole, I'm completely mysterious about what critics and online users have got. Is it the hardest west? No, I wouldn't say that. But the "last big American west", a phrase that I saw it more than once? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A movie that tries to say that kind of story needs credible characters that talk about plausible dialogue and dialogue in this movie is one of the hackney and clich√©d I've ever seen. The film can be measured in the veins per minute; how many times has an actor or actor forced to say something that no person would say in real life? There are so many cases that it disturbs. Cheesy lines come to you with waves; predictable, unoriginal and frequent. <br /> <br /> If a bad dialogue doesn't bother you, how bad is it with weapons? Few Westerners can show that it is incredible, but desperately tries to take their mind seriously. It's okay to have a comic edge such as Silverado for such a weapon fight, but in Tombstone, the highly staged and very rigid choreography of the early attack is another reason to exclude this film from the good west. The final showdown somewhat redeemed the director at this point, but by that time I was so interested in the movie that it wasn't saving. <br /> <br /> Apart from these errors, I can say that the images are stunning - the movie is well captured and the settings all look great. Operation is satisfactory, especially considering what the actors did. However, if you are looking for the last great west of America, take your preference - go to rent Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
