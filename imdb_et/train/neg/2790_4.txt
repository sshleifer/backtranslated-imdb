Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their toddler Alex to spend a few days with their family on the island of Savage, on their island. The couple hopes to solve their problems on a remote island over the weekend. Waiting for the boat, two strange men meet in the harbor of Julia and Steven, and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that the island is home to a mountain-pressure family. Cautious Peter smokes a pot when he is driving at night, and turns off the headlamp to show off; but he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage family, but in the dark he believes he has hit the animal. Later, the Savage family argues that Alex is compensation for his missing son. The young family does not accept trade and they start a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> Savage Island is a very low budget movie with a stupid scenario, amateur cinematography, but a surprisingly good actor. The wrong story is completely absurd and there are many incredible situations. For example, how could two men leave two women alone with a woman at night when they threatened a frustrated family? The logical procedure would immediately go to the continent and rescue the police forces to rescue Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their car on the continent and in their house and friends and no one traces them? Peter calls his sister Julia Alex when she arrives by boat at the beginning. There are so many bugs in this flick that I could write a lot of lines on this topic. I believe this movie was filmed with a home video camera so the pictures are terrible. Good cast earned better material. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Blood Island")
