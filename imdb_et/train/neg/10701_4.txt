Good Madcaps In London, there is a treasure hunt where one young woman involuntarily puts her married, a strong, independent female flight of a politician's father who is never in love. An early vehicle of interest to Katharine Hepburn, playing an aviatrix like Amelia Earhart, who has been too independent to give herself a person. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Franka's book) were obviously involved with this project to get a woman's perspective, but why are all old clich√©s intact like frozen items? Billie Burke plays such a simulation, a crying woman who takes her to bed when it goes wrong, and Hepburn's last scene is another rotator. Curious artifact, but not Kate-watcher classic. ** from ****
