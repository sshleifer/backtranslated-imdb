Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a fantastic horror film that focuses on junkies. What I got was a complete nonsense focusing on junkies. I don't know if there is another movie called "Cookers" that these people looked over? There are only three main characters and none of them hit me well-written or well-behaved. Basically the whole movie I just spent shook my head and admired the stupidity of these drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Don't try this movie. Rent a Cabin Fever or another decent horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are worse and more convincing than anything you can find in the "Cookers" section.
