Weird ... I like this film crew and dark humor movies; but I didn't like it at all! It's terrible, horrible and definitely not funny. Unfortunately, the whole movie piece doesn't get nasty. And it was really boring. The film is filled with long empty moments; it could have been removed. Certainly, it should have been even shorter. Maybe I was expecting too much from the team - like recording a movie lol -. It is also full of exaggerated clich√©s of characters and situations ... I don't get why people liked it ... "Poetry", "hope"; Mom, you didn't see anything like that! All in all, it is empty and crude, bad and hopeless. Oh darn see ........
