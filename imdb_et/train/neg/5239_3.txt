I watched this movie on the basis of very favorable comments I read here by others. <br /> <br /> They definitely saw the movie I didn't see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a lot of momentum and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it will be interesting, it will start logging in and dragging, not to mention the utter incredible. <br /> <br /> Finally, you find yourself saying, "What?? He's going to do it? How far is he doing this?" <br /> <br /> The piece begins with John the character of Jeff Goldblum, who goes to the deli to buy a wine bottle. At the time of robbery, robbery and the new store secretary Auggie Rose are killed. <br /> <br /> John gets an ambulance and goes to the hospital with a man. It seems a bit much, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John is totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make any logical sense, John, who has a very good life, beautiful, loving girlfriend, safe, paid job, nice house, nice car, expensive costume - decides he wants Being a loser like Auggie Rose, and experiencing a life of low paid work, littered with a girlfriend in a landfill and possible connections with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why this dull, half-burned movie got a good overview, I never know. Of course Goldblum is doing good - he always does - and his appearance has improved with age - but if you do not have BIG's affection with Jeff Goldblum and you have to see every movie he has turned on, I wouldn't recommend this turkey. It is about two hours of your life that you are not going to come back - and believe me - you have nothing to be grateful for when these two hours have passed, except you are grateful that you will not see this movie despite it. ! <br /> <br />
