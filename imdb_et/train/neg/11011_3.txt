Several painfully uncomfortable sketches that seem to be forever and day. Not so desperately terrible as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but it is by no means an affirmation in any way, sense or form. Includes the worst rhyming clown ever. Most if it is not offensive to anyone, but the most proud or politically correct. It also has the worst song parody EVER to put on the film, WORST Arnold impersonation EVER (not just the worst film, literally the worst EVER). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or Slash would celebrate it (the reasons I first watched it) The only thing that was amused by Dickman was. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie to ANYONE, but people who do it for a lifetime to get it down to 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable to you by living with people. If this is true, the Church of Scientalogyi hates him, he cannot be all bad. <br /> <br /> My degree: D
