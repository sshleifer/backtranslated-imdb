I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most of them aren't big or even good, this steamy pile has been reduced for bad movies. <br /> <br /> Plot: Not sure. Something about drugs that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the film is cut scenes that move back and forth between people in dark light, complaining about how good the Seagals sign "Mashall" is. <br /> <br /> Works: Blows. <br /> <br /> Copying voices ,,,,,, What was a terrible voice transmission?! Could they find someone who sounded less like Seagal? Maybe Cheech or Chong had some voice tasks, maybe it was at least entertaining. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid it at all costs !!
