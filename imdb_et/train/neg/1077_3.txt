Have you ever heard that people "telegraphs your intentions?" Well in this movie, the activities of the characters do more than the future plans of the telegraph - they appear in the drunk of your house and sanctify you. It can be forgiven if the device has been used better or the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. The character of Embeth Davidtz is not mysterious, just wood, and Kenneth Branagh fails to convey the terrible charm that his character probably wrote. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: evident plot, single-pointed performances, unlikely characters, and grotesque "south" accents of British actors.
