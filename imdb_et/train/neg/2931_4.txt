Sitcom "The Gentleman" follows the life of many "Royston Vasey" villages. Different scenes are linked by common settings. <br /> <br /> In the first series, the chart shows that the main piece is about a new road that will be built through Royston Vasey. As a result, more foreigners visit a small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of the "local" store, far from the city, don't like foreigners. When a visitor enters their shop, they kill. In my opinion, some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny, for example, when a couple swallows two engineers who want to build a new road. Edward drums, while Tubbs dances around the sides of the victims. In addition, Pauline Royston lives in Vasey. He works in a local job center. Although Pauline hates people she needs to work, she does not want to lose her job. So if an unemployed man gets an interview as a firefighter, he won't let him go because he's not ready for work. <br /> <br /> Then Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver, goes into great detail about her "sexual conversion". <br /> <br /> In addition, the veterinarian, Mr. Chinnery always kills animals instead of treating animals. In one case, he will have to farm and be led to the living room where the dog is in his basket. The farmer goes out. Assuming the dog is a sick animal, Chinnery screams at him. The second one later opens the farmer's door, keeping his "real" sick animal, sheep. <br /> <br /> Some of the other inhabitants are the husband and his wife, who are visited by their nephew (by the way the owners of the shop are killing them. The couple is fine. They have towels of different colors, for example. Each color represents one part of the body. Thousands of different colors are marked with keys and accurately classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. The scenes become comic when playing women. Costumes are also suitable for actors. Tubbs carry scarfs and some crazy characters like Edward are black teeth. There is a lot of dark humor, typical of the British. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses are gray and decay. There is often a mist around the local shop, which strengthens the threatening effect. Even the sign of the village is threatening: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. never leave. "<br /> <br /> Although I think the actors are doing a good job, this type of series is not my taste.
