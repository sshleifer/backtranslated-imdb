This film is probably the worst. Bad behavior, bad script, bad things. Interestingly, it is compared mainly with two other films of the same genre and about the same time. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem more powerful in both story and leadership, and yet it is Albert Pyun, who has also led these two. <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place that can be caused by an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people are living in medieval conditions. There is a special breed of robots (cyber) living in the human blood and there is a story ... The cyber must get a lot of people to fill the "prophecy" there and people need someone to stop them. One girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson), built by the creator of Cyborg, is destined to fate by the salvation of mankind. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the director tries to try some of Hong-Kong's stylish fighting scenes flying high and jumping far. The movie fails in this experiment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for the sole reason that most people get a new "worst" movie. And for fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg" because I think it's a very underrated movie with a rather high entertainment factor. And if you can't stand for Van Damme, look at "Nemesis." <br /> <br /> I appreciated this movie 1/10.
