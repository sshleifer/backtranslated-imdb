Ted V. Mikels' film Corpse Grinders 2 is a 103-minute scary movie. The plot is pretty much confused by meaningless business transactions among people who grind corpses into cat food, while cat aliens who lose their war against aliens are looking for some of these foods. Looking at this movie, I began to look for any distraction, to convince myself that I was doing something other than losing my thoughts from within. <br /> <br /> Many scenes continue for too long when characters do simple things forever. I have heard that Mr Mikels does not want to jump too often too often, fearing that they are interfering with their audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid." Try as I can, I couldn't take care of any unnecessarily huge cast of characters, including possible exceptions, except for the old men who are the custodians of the factory. Most of them are a number of non-talented amateurs who don't even bother to learn "Amazing Grace" before they sing it on the camera. Although perhaps the blame should be for poor audio quality, as I heard only 80% of the dialogue when watching a DVD. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst film ever to come. I have listened to the fragments of comments and Mr. Mikels comes as a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell did he do in the trash? I would like to hear the explanations of the old men who had to wait for the metal conveyor belts to stay on the ground. The movies I hated for a long time seem much better. I have Excalibur reasonably fit music and dead Dawn's consistent lighting. I have to go do something. Don't look at this movie.
