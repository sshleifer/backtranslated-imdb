The United States seems to be leading the UK police, all of whom are armed with teeth, and did you know that CID officers will be at the end of the job and go under the pub! It must be one of the most unrealistic films that represent the worst "real" UK police, which has never been publicly unpublished. I see that Mr Snipes could have paid back the necessary money, but what the hell of a good actor like Charles Dance was doing is a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse Than Worse Low Budget B "50s Movie. Hour and Half Suicide and Time I Never Get Back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as a real plague.
