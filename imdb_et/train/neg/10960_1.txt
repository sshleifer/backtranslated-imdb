Ouch! They don't get much worse than the horrible adaptation of C. Lewis's beloved novel. Although adaptation is very true to the novel, it is just terrible, and the sets and special effects are on a scale that is equal to the school game. I have read that the ministry's budget was the highest that the BBC has ever given, but they would have been able to sum up a little more than $ 2 that it looks like. The worst effect is Mr. Beaver. I know that computer effects were not at the required level or even at a cost-effective level at the time, but the man in the costume bachelor was terrible. It is better to just cut the character of the movie than do this role! Avoid it at all costs.
