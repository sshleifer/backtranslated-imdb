Bad plot (though good for B-film), good fast-paced fighting scenes, at most 5 out of 10. But something has still bothered me about this movie: how does Mariska Hargitay never speak? In TV, he shares with Jeff Speakman a number of intimate moments, even in a garden kiss. But in the usual (video) version, most of his scenes are cut and he doesn't speak at all. It bothers me because it does not only take a female (though stapled) film, but also makes the final shooting terrible. This film would have been better if they had kept their scenes because, at least on this scene, he had a personality subject to all of Speakman's statements.
