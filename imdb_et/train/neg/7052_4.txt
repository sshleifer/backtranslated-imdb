God this movie was just as boring as the music that I really loved, which means that what really was in the making of the movie, please, that someone reading this review doesn't watch this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emran can work but was really pathetic. In this movie, I'm ashamed that I'm one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was just very bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another face because of the lack of talents she can never act at all and she had no sense of participating in this film because she was probably the second girl, Radha, but could have done better. <br /> <br /> That's a waste of time. please buy great music and don't watch this movie.
