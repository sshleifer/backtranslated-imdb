I hated this example when I was a child. It was back in the day when children show characters who actually had accents, not just the usual general American dialect we used to. Jack Wild had a British accent in the south of Pufnstuf. However, as one of the others mentioned, I never realized what the witch who wanted the flute was. It always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute bothered me and I wouldn't have had the trouble to take it off! <br /> <br /> Just a comment about Pufnstuf's similarity in the early 1970s McDonald's ads that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf hung out for McDonald's. At the height of McDonald's popularity, the TV show (or rather their creators) tried to license McDonald's characters for their show, but when McDonalds refused, the TV show changed the characters somewhat and gave it to it. They even took former employees and votes of the McDonalds advertising agency to make TV sets. McDonalds complained and won. Find the Pufnstuf McDonaldland case and find many articles about it.
