This movie served in the Mystery Science Theater. Even if he has nothing to do with the king of Solomon, it is worth a look, because it is an unintentional laugh. Really! It's worse than "Destroy All The Monsters". Be sure to check the following: cheesy medallion (looks like Shriners has been here), obviously polyester Norfolk jacket "Allan Quatermain", badly beaten by David MaCallum (which draws attention to even worse action), an incredibly bad process on all "monsters", monsters themselves - a watch that threatens a little girl, a giant snake that threatens Macallum, while she puts a sink in oatmeal, red eyes on motorized crabs, an amazingly fun boat (oh, brother !!) that seems to be made of plywood installed in an old sand mine and looks as Jr.Sr. prom ("Voyage to the Future with Class '71"), the City of the Phoenicians, where they carry the Roman Emperor's armor, but with inexplicably Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (Phoenicians invented the alphabet - fire!) and the worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with their fear wig) who play smoochy-face-fear! The best part is that intrusive investigators are able to lose the comic French and African man - Snffleupagus or whatever - probably decided to die heroically to die, not to be more scenes.
