I can't say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever made because I haven't seen every Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it might be. <br /> <br /> This film seems like an artistic attempt on behalf of a suicide director and I believe he has been successful in his mission. No A list actor outside of this film would jeopardize the presentation of the same bill as the one it carries with it. <br /> <br /> But not only to blame the director here, there is an operator who looks like he is practicing the year for an amateur home video maker. There's a dramatic score that hopes to take you to the next scene. A man who needs to keep a cigarette on one side and a light bulb on the other, and hoping that the flame burning the cigarette will add the necessary light to each scene. And of course the actors! Some of them are not newcomers, otherwise we can all be forgiven here. The actress's ensemble was set up to promote a new start and dimension to transform India's most loved Sholay movie ever. One should not forget that these actors were not forced to enter this film, they are A-list and the participants want something that would definitely have been a big and eager public expectation? So this raises the question, Amitabh aside (now), did other actors believe that their performances were even trying to make the original better? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believed that people would remember their dialogue movie in this embarrassing abomination? Don't be stupid, of course he didn't do it, it was a public demonstration of how much money talks the participants can walk. <br /> <br /> I really hope that everyone involved is pleased with what is actually a vulgar attempt to make a classic movie that will first be remembered when they watch the original.
