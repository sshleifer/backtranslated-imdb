I don't understand this movie. OK, if you like a cheap splatter, you love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - don't look at it. Personally, I didn't like the participants in this movie, they seem to be hired directly from the street. Dialogues are perfectly flat and you always know what follows. The overall quality of this movie is missing from the expected very low budget. When we saw this movie (I and 3 other people), we all thought that this film was made by some people who had to do it, just to get their graduation from film school - with the least effort. Another problem that reduces the whole experience is a bad cam (very trembling) and a bad sound, the whole movie seems to be a single microphone.
