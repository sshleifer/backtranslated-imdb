From a cheap gap, this shock-video training was hard to go through in failure. It has a typical gore that you should expect in a zombie movie, but no necessary atmosphere is worth it. <br /> <br /> What's strange is that it is an amateur-German video and version I saw is in English dubbed! Dumbbells seem to be American fans (German penpals?!) Who are unable to decide whether they want to play it or turn it into a comedy. One character (of course white German) is dubbed by a black man who probably speaks of thick ebony! "Kno wahm sayin", Comrad?
