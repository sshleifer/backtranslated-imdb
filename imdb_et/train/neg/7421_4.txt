Looking at beautiful women who fall around, play cops and robbers, one of the most pleasing guilty things a medium film lets me enjoy. So the house of Carroll Street was not a complete waste of time, even though the story is structured and the scenario is intrusive and somewhat irritating. <br /> <br /> There are many tips for different Hitchcock images, especially Kelly's choice. McGill is starring. She's dressed like Grace Kelly and she's not far from the mark. Not at all. But his character is not convincing. How he is introduced to the public should be someone with political convictions and purpose of life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined time, real events and a specific problem. But the story degenerates in the first minute to an excuse, an incredible coincidence, great predictability and two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable because the performances of the actors are good, as well as the photography and the set design. It starts on the ground and then moves to the roof. The film can be commended for the good use of this architecture.
