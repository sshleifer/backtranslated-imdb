In the title I wrote that the story is ridiculous. below, I'll explain and tell you why it destroys this movie in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> Gere and the Danes are doing their job, and while it's not their best job, it's pretty OK. The rest, however, is very bad. Remember that this is not entirely the fault of the participants. The problem is that Gere and the Danes are the only ones who even have the slightest space in the film to really give the depth. All other characters have too little space in the movie to create depth, or the sign is a cliché that doesn't matter how difficult the participants are. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit of Se7en, but I'm just looking for the direction I think he's doing OK. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is a script that is bad in two ways. First, it's a bad movie script. The characters are low (except Gere and the Danes characters), the villains are clichés, and the action of the characters is incredible. In addition, writers must have an agenda where they want to bring their views and ethics back for a hundred years. This is a movie that says some criminals are still criminals, even though they have paid the price society has given them. It is also a film that says, though only between lines, that any sexual deviation should be punished without trial, judge or jury. Of course, according to the film, everything that is not sex in the missionary position of the couple is a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So if you go to a film school and need a bad script or if you write scripts yourself and want an ego boost. Look at this. For all others, I also recommend another movie.
