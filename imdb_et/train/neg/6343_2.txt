Maybe I'm not complicated. This and the denser are the two most suspicious brain films I've seen recently, and both suffer exactly the same problem. The dialogue is wrong. Nothing that comes out of one's mouth seems remotely plausible. It is possible that this movie was created so it should feel, but it was invisible. And boring. I went out after 20 minutes of tedium. <br /> <br /> I'm sleeping and bananas for my Woody Allen. Whenever I meet on the road, I turn around and try to find the Quincy episode instead.
