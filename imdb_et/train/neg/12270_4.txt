This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild, and it had at least one jump that seized me from the guard. All in all, the film is incredibly silly, with a detective trying to track down the suspect serum, only to find out that he has committed one crime. Then he finds himself haunted proudly by an Asian lady and does not know why (nor the viewer). When other murders have been committed, it becomes even more confusing because the killers are easy to find and still haunts him for some reason. The plot is not just a fool, a woman's ghost is more fun than anything, especially if she suddenly flies across the city, like Wonder Woman. And there is little point in the end, in fact, not the whole idea of ​​the film, and I cannot recommend it at all. If that were not so serious, I think it should be a black comedy. Outside the Bright Future, this is the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.
