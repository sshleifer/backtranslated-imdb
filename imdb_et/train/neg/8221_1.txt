This "film" strives to follow a low-budget, hand-held camera genre that has proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> It fails and HOW. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is amazing how many so-called "awards" this garbage cover is covered ..... it makes you wonder what those critics were when they actually filed it .... <br /> < br /> Words don't describe exactly how this movie is really terrible. Seriously, this is that BAD. <br /> <br /> I looked at it in a 20-minute apartment, almost continuously fast forward. <br /> <br /> Waste from light to terrible alignment, sharpness visual sounds and sounds. of course, without forgetting ABYSMAL, it was one completely and completely pathetic part of film making. <br /> <br /> It's serious that NO Wait for redeeming features. Save your cash and see a proper low budget horror effect, there's a lot - Dead End, Blair Witch, REC, to name a few. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take this garbage at all costs. DON'T waste your money or time in this trash that is a real movie. <br /> <br /> See all other comments! You have been warned!
