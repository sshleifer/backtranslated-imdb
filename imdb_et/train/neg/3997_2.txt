After setting up a high rating for IMDb, I decided to see this movie. In addition to this high rating, I deliberately avoid reading readings. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean slate, an unknown plot or with predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you see that I was disappointed. I liked the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also liked how the hotel manager tried to enter her hotel room. By the time EnSlin entered the room, I was ready for some scary things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolate comes with pillows and toilet paper folded. Enslin reacts in a credible way. He's overwhelmed. I encourage and think for myself, that's good. The people who made this movie realize that there is less more. <br /> <br /> But it happens next, which was a great suppression. Fineness replaces with a fast predictable shotgun ... Just blast the audience in every Hollywood scary book and hope something works. Let's see the clock radio that turns on itself? Good, it's always scary. Are moving objects in the room? Good, you can't complain about it. Blood dripping from the walls and sinking? Great. The spirits that commit suicide? Good. Something else? How about loud noise, trembling, fire, more shaking, mixing space, more blood, etc. and so on. It's all good. And all this has been done before. Overwhelm our audience with impaired attention quickly with all kinds of things one after another, and they can't look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I see a horror movie in the theater, it is typical to hear a number of audience groups who are frightened by fear in frightening moments. But this film had no frightening moments. The audience was quiet and interested. I didn't feel behind my back. Something. Shining was 100x what this film is trying to do. <br /> <br /> So who are all the people who say it's one of the best horror movies? Director's Friends? Sorry, I just can't get it.
