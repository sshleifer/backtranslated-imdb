Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunt (oh, excuse me ... treasure protector whatever it means) from a long treasure hunter. One of his ancestors became aware of the location of the great treasure that our founders, most if not all free-sellers, had decided to hide because they simply did not want to finance their independence financially. <br /> The first hint is probably lost on a ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his team, consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean), Movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha's immortality "Gigli") and a few facial shortcomings, enter the ship's cargo space. They swell up to a ton of gunpowder on the whole floor, not that it is important in some way. Finally, they find a clue (the skeleton moves on it) and it turns out to be a letter ... In some sense. Don't ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> This is a mystery, and despite the fact that his expedition is obviously miffed to find no real treasure, Gates rides around in the sense of a riddle. in this frozen cargo space, while the crew is just around the jaw jaw. I mean, come on. Somebody should have had a little vocal disappointment that they came to the amazing Arctic all the time and found nothing interesting, but they just stand there when Gates enters his world, solving the riddle. the next hint is a declaration of independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is terrible. Different characters offer intelligent exposure (accustomed to it). All this leads to a shortage of Ian pulling the gun to Gates, and the gunpowder goes into a big explosion. (Oh, that's why they poured the whole gunpowder!)! Ian and his henchmen are fleeing, and the gates and film Dork Riley walk nine miles at lower temperatures in Inuit Village to stop them. <br /> <To stop them, Gates concludes, after trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), that Gates and Riley must steal it. Then, Riley Gates tells the embarrassing detail of why they can't steal the declaration because it is protected from metal and laser eyes and high-tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that there's a chance to steal it from the storage room. Does Riley know what storage space is, Gates asks? "The place where they make jams and jelly?" I'm not kidding; this is the real line. Bartha doesn't give it to the joke. So Riley does all of this research in the Library of Congress and Archives, and on water and sewerage, fercryinoutloud, but does not know what is the storage space. This shows pretty much what the script is on. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this brief, Gates actually creates a ridiculous invasion of D, which can only happen in Movie. (I also hate how they depict computer monitor technology in films - full of unlikely and impractical graphics and fonts.) For convenience, Abigail Chase reaches the label and the obvious "love interest" angle. At one point, from the law, these three talk about their plans from a truly loud clothing store surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> The series of hints and kidnapping by Gates's father, played by dyspeptic Jon Voight, lead both the good guys and the bad guys to such a large Indiana Jones amusement house, located under New York. Strangely enough, the subway builders never found this thing. Gates and Gates The parent controls the chase of Ian's wild goose. Ian believes they are stuck and leave them there. But after they're gone, Riley asks how they go out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... boy ... <br /> <br /> ... and the door opens. No, I'm serious. Button as they can have an office building in a vacuum toilet. Good to know where it was. Anyway, they find this tremendous treasure room after finding it somewhat more complicated (remember, it's all under Manhattan!), Full of all kinds of historical golden things. Riley can really fool. Again. And the FBI Officer Harvey Keitel gives them forgiveness, arrests Sean Bean and allows two less chemical leaders to marry. <br /> <br /> For each viewer, I think it would be difficult to ignore all expositions, jump logic and stereotypical characters for a very long time. Although some of his exposures include beautiful history lessons that are randomly added to the conversation for moments. I'd like more of these conversations in my life.
