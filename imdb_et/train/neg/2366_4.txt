I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but it's terrible. Deaths are so trendy. If you look at it 20 years later, the entire nintendo scene is out of date. I liked the setback. I think they should have just got a prequel when he was still alive. It would have been more interesting. This is a movie that can be taken or left. Depends on how much free time you have.
