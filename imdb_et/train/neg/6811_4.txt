When I saw this movie in the cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think that management and cinematography are great as well as music. But this is really a script that has started to bother me more and more over time. I find Emma Thompson's writing to the original book self-absorbing and unfaithful; he has reduced Marianne's side sign, the second violin to his too old, too heavy Elinor - he has been given a lot of "focal points" in the movie and often seems to have a Thompson show I understand he cuts several characters from the book, but left a scene where the Willoughby book is redeemed? Someone who red and loves the book long before the movie is the things that are always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. He is not given the best script in the world, but he still pulls it gently, without excessive sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a bit old, but he plays a role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she's absolutely fantastic as always.
