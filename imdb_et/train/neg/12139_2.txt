I remember when it came out, many kids were nuts about it. I think I was a little too old to get all excited and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and I always found it a bit cheesy. children feel they could fight and be a stranger or equal to their ninjas. I think both the parents and the filmmakers were so ill, because all we really had was kicking the kids and beating everyone. <br /> <br /> Many children's movies have a big point in what they are trying to do, and it's great for your kids to look at the message and get it, it doesn't have any messages ... it's just millions of differences less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Does the film have any great visual qualities, but does it require it? Action is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actress, but it was embarrassing to see her here. Short, greasy, goggled eyed laughter as a powerful ninja that was just fun. The kids acted too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst child I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has a plot that everyone knows before they even look through. 3 ninjas ... yeah, you know they're fighting a lot of bad guys and probably winning ... Need me to say more. I'm sorry if I made it worse for anyone. <br /> <br /> Everything that said KIDS loves it. This film is aimed at children and only children can enjoy it. If you don't mind your child seeing movies of kids fighting, it's a good movie to see. If you don't mind your kids seeing a complete garbage that has nothing to do with actual martial arts, actual action or reality, then you've found a movie for your kids ... I tell the kids because I think even girls like it ... I remember all the girls who have broken Rocky's. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and make it enjoyable for adults .. this movie failed a great time. It's outside of cheese and something original and unique, and I don't allow my kids to watch it ... Kung Fu TV series has a DVD and there are many Shaw Brothers movies. ..Why not show your children things that really do not provide them with entertainment and do not bypass them, maybe even teach them some moves and not just how to hit a man between the legs when Grandpa did 3 Ninjas ... no no no ... ever hit a man between the legs ... never.
