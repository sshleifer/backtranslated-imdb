This movie was a great actor in it! Unfortunately they had forgotten how to act. I was hoping the film would go better than it was, but the actor was so robust that it was doomed from the very beginning. Actually, it seemed that the actors read the script all the time. Perhaps it was a musical result or a director himself, but one thing is for sure that the Make-up artist needs another job! The face powder was so thick that you saw the actors saw! Don't want to recommend this movie to anyone, it's no wonder it didn't hit the theater. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods is ashamed of you not giving it to everyone. The plot was great, just needed a lot more.
