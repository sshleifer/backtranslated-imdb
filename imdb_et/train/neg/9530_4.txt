I think this movie is based on a real story .... It's about two young girls who whistle up a grown man during the 48's. I don't see where terror is going to play here .... In the movie, some "weird" and "surreal" and two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) are playing on two psycho-man's wrath rollers ... they do a pretty good job (although some of it is just up), the movie is not good, and it's not terrible, it's just really dated! I mean, this thing drips in the 70s .... It's not really bad if you like this thing ... do you know that thang?
