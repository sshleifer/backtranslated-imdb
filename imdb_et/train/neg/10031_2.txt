I saw it in a movie theater. The film has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs can be. That's it. Film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone involved in the film is frustrated, even Mumbai Indians (right now Chennai has reached the semifinals). <br /> <br /> But the film's worst feeling is action scenes. Currently, Bollywood is trying to copy Hollywood scenes. But they forget that Hollywood leaders are taking a lot of effect to make it look real. But unfortunately, Bollywood leaders don't have so much time. They spend their time publishing songs and movies. Now, in southern countries, so too stupid scenes can happen because the audience just pays to watch their favorite actor killing people. But in Bollywood, it's definitely not working. All the action scenes I would like to convey. Finally, even some Chinese people appear somewhere to win Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. The target audience does not pay for such stupidity. I think Bollywood should forget about movies now. They can't do that. The last good thing I saw was "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon also Khialdi". The current Bollywood scene is really sad when I like movie fans. Do these people see their movie after graduation? Could they not understand that slow motion (which occurs in ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? Better if you don't have scenes if you can't handle it. I just want to go back to the Amitabh era, where the film, like Zanjeer and Deewar, were with exciting scenes. The sound effect was not very effective these days, but visually it is much better than the scenes of the present era. <br /> <br /> This movie should now open the eyes of Bollywood film directors. Please do not make more films before you acquire the art of realistic creation.
