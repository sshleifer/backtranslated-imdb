Demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so she brings her head back to life. Honestly, this is a drawing of the film. She is trying to get her second body she is looking for in the perfect area of ​​the city for this perfect body. For some reason, he is a monster in his cabinet unobtrusively. The film's purple style is ridiculous. No one in the movie can actually act with the head. The monster of the cupboards is the man with the mask tie and what can really be said. The plot is slow, weak, and the end is so badly done. See the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me in people I wouldn't watch this movie separately.
