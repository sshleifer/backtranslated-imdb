This film was so disappointing. In a painting that made me look for the love of Phantom (why is it called?), I had been waiting for something beautiful and thoughtful with beautiful shapes. It had interesting pictures, but they often seemed random and didn't make sense. In fact, they seemed to be entered to fill the time. Finally, the effect was pointless. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was meant for the atmosphere, but it wasn't. The lack of a single plot did not contribute. It can be said that it was mysterious, but I think it was not about the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the plot wasn't enough for me to take care of his situation. Without a list, I would not have known that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I'm not a bride, but the sexual scenes (there were several) seemed pointless and confused me, I recognized Lulu, but I wasn't sure if it was the same man, different men, mistress, husband, or he was a prostitute. Only when I saw the credit I discovered was the furry company to belong to her lover. This film couldn't do what should have been shocking (the sequences of dreams involved in Lulu's mother) seem a little boring. <br /> <br /> Nail filing was actually more meaningful because it gave some references to Lulu's emotional state. I don't blame the participants because I don't have much work to do. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the lack of context or flow in the movie was due to injustice or because it was terrible but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can't talk about it anymore.
