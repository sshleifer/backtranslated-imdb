Considering how much money this film is intended to make, it would create more of a story as a whole. It can be a pretty valuable movie I've ever watched. There was no real rise. Note, minimal. Maybe the plot's progress. Enjoy, not. I'm not sure what the points were even trying to do. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are good guys, the American CIA bombs will put everything that is not in our opinion, all the capitalists are corrupt and you want to see something similar to the success of storyboards, accompanied by death. For those of us who realize he's not gonna kill some good men, we'll stay with other movies. In conclusion, it was a terrible attempt to “ocean 11” style dress-up-a-man-on-think movie, because not only do you know what's going on, someone who made the movie. Home Alone 3 was a better cinema.
