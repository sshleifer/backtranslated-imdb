I didn't think the French could do a bad movie, but I was clearly wrong. As mentioned earlier, this film uses its title as a starting point; his imagination of his life and human being has little or nothing to do with Artemisia Gentileschi. The script is terrible - conscientious, clever and coarse - and rewriting its facts is unusually offensive, even in a genre that too often makes it life, distorting, not repeating history. Along with a somewhat decent set design, Valentina Cerv's physical delights as the main asset of this film and from the start it is obvious that filmmakers were also aware of it; they do not waste time creating different "erotic" sequences much more related to titration than plot or character development. Unfortunately, this movie cannot continue and is not supported by the fact that we see that a pretty young girl is looking at sexual arousal. The performance is remarkable and the score is too general despite an interesting chord or two. Cinematography is OK, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences that use distorted lens effects that are better suited to the 1960s movie as a costume drama. In any case, the script Artemisia leaves the dwelling too often on the body and too rarely on his paintings. <br /> <br /> I said almost complete failure. It's neither smart nor tasteful enough to be a serious film, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as a soft core for pornography. So the French can't do it all!
