One previous reviewer called this film "pure visual pleasure". I mean, did he see the same movie I did. "High Quality" was supposed to be the "seven" most reluctantly depressing interior. Sheedy and Mitchell can almost be forgiven for the first time they can go to B & B. Of course, before they do, look at the parties of opium populated by people who are not obviously paid but can somehow support the flourishing use of drugs. Not to mention this familiar movie type, Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Starter who is well aware that they will be thrown over in the next 100 minutes. The film also says that Sheedy has left professional photography for ten years. What did he do to retire for twenty years?
