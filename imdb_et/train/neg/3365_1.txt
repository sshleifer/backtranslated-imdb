This start of classical rebuilding in 1963 begins quite well, alternating with confusing and meaningless special effects. For example, the original has one of the cool moments when Nell and Theo are lying next to two single beds listening to fear outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let him go, because he's hurting him. Nell then looks at Theo, who has several legs and realizes that it was not in Theo. In the final version, Nell is alone in bed when he suddenly dives and slides through the floor. It is only when he tells the invisible force to stop his drawing that we understand what happened. And can anyone explain what Nelli's last words mean - "It's family. It's always been a family"? <br /> <br /> One redemption feature is Lili Taylor's play, but even this can't save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that there is little depth beneath her outer surface. In the original, Claire Bloom suggested persuading her lesbian. However, Zeta-Jones needs to find out, for example, asking Nell if she has a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be a pointless remake cemetery.
