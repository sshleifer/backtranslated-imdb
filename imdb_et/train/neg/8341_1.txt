I love horror films. I can even appreciate the most cheese (face, 9 of these days, 10 horror films), but it was just ridiculous. Terrible action, terrible writing, completely hollow and incredible characters (not Meisner's characters) and lack of weight. I wish I could take my life for 79 minutes. At least Crook's brothers are aptly appointed. The only good thing about the film was to look at Alicia Silverstone's desire to get on the face. How this EVER did to Sundance is completely confusing for me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic even according to film standards. I mean, Come on! Who would hurry to get an inexpensive earring 10 seconds after a horrible stalker just left the doorstep? Lame.
