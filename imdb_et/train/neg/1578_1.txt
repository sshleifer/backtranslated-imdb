Imagine her, say 12-1am - your home, your boring, your not tired. This scenario took place in about four years. I turned on the TV and shook a few channels and found that the movie was turned on. OH MY WORD This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Accelerated car that can't be stopped (if the brakes are cut or something cut off), down the road - what happens? This movie was so bad that it was really funny - I think the tricks cost about $ 2, there was one case where a child / little child is being beaten by a car with a helicopter - trying to stimulate the viewer - conveniently placing the bridge is coming soon ... This is the best movie every day - it shows that the child is missing the bridge, but it looks so bad - you almost see what mannequin is used - the whole low budget classic! Don't forget the end of the movie, but I bet it was great <br /> <br /> I doubt they will show this movie again, so I'm glad I saw it in the trash!
