Slashers ..... well, if you like the horrors you are sure to see, otherwise you won't even bother. It is quite obvious that this movie has an extremely low budget, for example, it seems that the whole movie is made in the warehouse somewhere and you see many times mike boom shadow and camera shadow, trust me so you don't have to look for them. Also try ignoring cheesy actors if that's what you call them !! There are some people deciding to go to the show where they have to survive the night in a big maze because they are 3 killers and who lives at the end enriches. Now there is something like that that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that these days of low budget horror, for example, when I looked at it, I thought to myself that I wouldn't want to play this game! especially $ 12,000,000. so I would recommend that you look at it and make your mind.
