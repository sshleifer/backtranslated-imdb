I admit that the problem I have seen so far with the films of Ealing I have seen so far can be mine. According to my taste, they are black and hanging funny, or so light toned that they are not comedies or stories. This is a self-evident way of saying I wanted to be like "Man in White Smoke", but I found myself sitting in difficulty in my short time. <br /> <br /> The textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be weak, but he is firmly committed to progress when he tries to invent a fabric that cannot be broken or dirty. Using a factory lab for his latest experiments, he is attacking both material and human constraints - the latter is a benevolent mill boss who doesn't understand what he has to do, find out and become even more committed to stopping him. br /> <br /> "This is a mind like yours that is progressing," says Sidney, practicing in the mirror what he is fighting to say to a person. <br /> <br /> One Problem "The White White Suit is that Sidney's vision of progress is also terribly low-minded, even more than the vision of those bosses or workers who are offending their work. My problem is elementary: no comedy is not a "white suit" funny. This is a pretty serious script that tends to spit out its weak sense of humor, double-shots, triple-ups and dizziness. <br /> <br /> The best joke is machine sound Sidney attacks, endlessly "Bleep- Blop-Bleep-Bop "and pulls out every visitor until Sidney pulls out her breath or blows it to try. Like any other sense of humor that works properly in this movie, she's too inclined." <br /> <br /> I've never seen Guinness in the film less affected, although he looks impossible young and serious (though in fact in his mid-30s). He seems so bloodless, even more than the face of wax he played "Doctor Zhivago s ". He is the same cold fish, whether he ignores the exhausting girl's girl who offers her life savings by losing her job (Pan-faced Vida Hope as Bertha) or more strange young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood) charms, her one a true ally in the fight against "Sabbath and Dirt" making these words impossible for sex. only Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Player support makes "White Suit" as good as it is. Ernest Thesinger's famous "Bride of Frankenstein" fame plays an exceptionally disgusting industrial captain who looks like Nosferatu and makes a laugh like death. Howard Marion-Crawford as the second plant manager is memorable when he played a "Arab Lawrence" blinked medical worker. Then Mandy Miller has an undeniable charm as a little girl who steals some of her momentarily from the camera. <br /> <br /> But most scenes are played so straight that no one thinks director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked in comedy (his previous comedy "Whiskey Galore" didn't hurt this impression unfortunately). The performance of Roger MacDougall represents the development of science as a potential catastrophe, but does not present anything other than the most delicate light to the dull Sidney. <br /> <br /> The comedies of commemoration are remembered as a comedy for the human. Yet I never saw Ealings doing it, working only when they played aggressively with their sympathies. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (again, Mackendrick are in the drawing) are classic in this way. The "white suit", on the other hand, is a meaningless ramble that breaks down when it should consist of like this unfortunate suit.
