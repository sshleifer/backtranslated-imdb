I rented this movie yesterday and can barely express my disappointment in the little Laura Ingalls to get something that was badly produced. I'm not sure if it was terrible writing or bad leadership or both, but it leaves the viewer very disappointed to waste time watching this color. It consisted of a weak naive line of lines, very bad lines, and was based only on beautiful landscapes and the real people who sold it. Unfortunately, it was not enough. You'd better rent out a static tape to waste your time on this mess. Lindsey Wagner also played a rather pathetic part, as a ranchman who seems to be working very hard doesn't do anything, someone who has ever been close to the ranch knows that it was probably written by a young person from Los Angeles, not someone with a lot of knowledge of the world.
