Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was very disappointed with making wood and the arrogance of producers when they boldly ignored the plot. I feel this film does not in any way reflect the brilliance of Bronte's work and rather gave the impression of low love. The film's short 2-hour condensation lost the film with many of the key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat nervous plot with little grounding. There is no romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so it seems rather steep and unfounded, because these two characters have a rare communication that you can't help but imagine that their "love" is superficial. This is such injustice for the Bronte novel, you will not be exposed to the peculiar cheek and courage of Jane that attracts him to Rochester, and his arrogance that attracts him to Jane. that some cartoon characters were portrayed very amazingly, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, but in general the output was bad. Due to better scripting, the film would probably have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for excellent production.
