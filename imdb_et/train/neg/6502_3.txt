Considering the opportunity to write, search and celebrate in my movie, I would probably choose something with weapons for robotic women. However, Anthony Hopkins decided to make the most strange film someone has ever seen. "Slipstream" is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and says, "What's going on?". <br /> <br /> This is a movie where in one scene a man crosses the road to the right of the yellow car, which suddenly turns pink to the left of the car. This is a movie where two characters are in the conversation, with random human tapes and walls climbing insects. This is a movie where a person starts talking about "Human intrusion" only for the actor of the film who suddenly appears himself (and then disappears). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that decides to throw the need out of a single plot straight out of the window and use it to make fifteen different edits, as well as black and white, because it's not seemingly causal at all. <br /> <br /> However, I have to acknowledge Mr Hopkins for the selection of participants in this film (some of whom are several characters). All involved are throwing themselves into their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they are actually doing. My favorite was Christian Slater's thug in a hat that was impressively threatening. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins is quoted as saying that he made this movie a joke and that is probably the best way to sum up "Slipstream". This is an audience joke. You look at it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is happening and hoping that the answer will come to find out that the answer is not really happening. What is this joke is that Anthony Hopkins is never known. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I'm a big fan of this driver. I think Anthony Hopkins shares my love for "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". But "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as any Lynch movie, despite the imitation of many of his techniques (although I was surprised that no one was talking about "Slipstream"). It is too chaotic and casual - as the other reviewer said, this is a film version of Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt that there is a small number who can look at it and do something about it. Unfortunately, for us, "Slipstream" is quickly becoming a tedious and confusing experience that was only made with the involvement of Hopkins. <br /> <br /> Look at your own responsibility.
