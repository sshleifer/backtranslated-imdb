The girl is in the shower, not knowing that the seer looks at her through the skylight. Detective Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot, but not hot on their trajectory, when they find it after killing, rape and eating a girl's nipple. Hopefully this would be the end of the movie. Not because it is too horrible, but because the level of action is cruel. Unfortunately, it is not at the end and the sixth later that the ascendant resurrected as a zombie by Satanists. So he continues where he left, and again the detectives, this time is a flying baby after him (don't ask). It has been very good for very low budget movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty to remember from spring), but it's scratching the bottom. Disgraceful, crappy dime ecommerce special effects, flat test comedy and oh yes, and ending sucks too. <br /> <br /> My Degree: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul gets completely naked; Anne R.
