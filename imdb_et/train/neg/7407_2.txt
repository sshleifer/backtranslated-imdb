1. Watched 6/18/2009? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): A strange psychotic movie about a girl with autism, who is being tested in a hospital, the power is blinking, and then all the hell is broken. I am not honest about the intentions of the filmmakers. In the next 1 and a half hour (at least it was no longer) was a twisted horror / twilight / zombie / ghost film that really ended up meaningless even to the end. Initially, after turning off the power, everything in the hospital is missing, except for a small group of confusion, including the girl and her father. It has a typical annoying character, a creepy old man and a typical tough guy who resembles many scared men and, of course, attracts a young girl whose main character. Random things happen at different times, such as ghosts and monsters, a hint that time has stopped, and dead people, because this little group is trying to escape, no matter where they enter. I really hate how they used this girl's affliction and hinted that she was the cause and put it in a hospital where people take care of it is really flat. We don't really know what's happening, which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. If you don't want one hour and a half to crash and be confused, it's not for you or any mover. What's the waste of time?
