haha! you just have to smile and smile when you carry it out. I think it says something about itself. The movie itself was created I think to be a psychological test or some kind of drug to bring you to a past place. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical work, he said it was pointless and useless, but if you read it, after you are done, it would lead to a new level, like a ladder, and you could throw the job and see things clarity and real understanding. this movie is what I think. <br /> <br /> Because this movie is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in such a unique way. First, it's snipes. I loved watching this man in different films. and I have suffered through some weakness. Although you know that the film can suck, you never doubt that it could be as bad as it really was. which is its fun. I mean, it's snips. you know it may be good, but that's fine, right? smile. <br /> <br /> So this thing on every level is pure boredom, pure unoriginality. a reference to a professional is as dead as obvious but so badly made to be comic. there is at least one character in this movie that is at least interesting. and to make the whole thing more surreal, they have a sound that sounds like parts of Bourne's identity-type movies, but is not quite right. In fact, although it seems to be close to the background music for a movie, it happens to be so fantastic for you. <br /> <br /> then all the scenes in the black pitch, where honestly, because the characters are so flat, you don't care about what happens, but despite this and someone being killed, you tell yourself if I should to see it? whatever? how scenes that are dazzling, unpleasant flashes on strobe lights are too long. sure to throw it in. If you are tense and your eyes are no longer able to cope, do more to kill them in the dark than you actually see what happened. And besides, you have a face that you don't care about. you were bored from the start. <br /> <br /> So I ran a few times in and out, but I got almost all of this movie. and it will become something you can watch without something that grabs your mind at any level, something that you can effectively bring out to the zone and start thinking about your life, where it goes, where it has been, and that .. this is the real magic of this movie.
