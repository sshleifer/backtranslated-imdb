Probably his much better "Orlando" admirers, Potter, is giving the vehicle the worst thing about this: he writes, directs, marks and deals with music, including the mawkish love song. The film is very similar to a teenage school high school or college project, convinced that its own intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are so exciting for us. But the character of Potter is just as unreasonable as his romantic obsession with the object is unlikely, and the whole film is an embarrassing daffodil game that masks the tango. Perhaps if he hadn't done it himself, he would have worked. He just can't act whether he plays himself or not. Pretentious, too ambitious, boring and stupid.
