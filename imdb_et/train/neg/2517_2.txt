This movie is a perfect example of not making a sci fi movie. The worst tendency of Sci-fi is to make your subject a terrible, sophomore, pseudo-orphan / Huxleyan / whatever "vision" of the "future of man". <br /> <br /> The science fiction filmmakers (and authors), as geeks, take yourself very seriously, taking into account the high ratio of their genre to good. I think other genres with high CTGSR (yes, I just did it up, relaxed) like horror or action, or even romantic comedy, seem to have somewhat better understood that they don't change the world of some deep "Sci fi" can certainly be a serious success because many big filmmakers have proved it, but the whole concept has a huge downside, represented by "Robot Jox", the rental of which is "the future" (a single good design element: odd, sliding ticket board ads all over the place that encourage women to have more children) and its painfully heavily handed over the "Iliad" parallels (She is NAMED IN ACHILL TO THE BIRTHS OF GOD! I didn't really take it until I saw the film for the tenth time, but I went to school for the filmmakers not to be released.) <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are a crazy movie like me, this is a negative side. I love absolutely such movies because bad movies are often more fun and some even more interesting than good. It's a kind of Lester Bangs approach to watching a movie, I guess. <br /> <br /> Note: The director of this movie (Gary Graham? Is that his name? I refuse to check.) It's not that bad. He's gonna get out of it. He's cool, especially when he's drunk / hung.
