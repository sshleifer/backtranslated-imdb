Life in a future in a fascist or almost fascist state that severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurring topic both in contemporary literature and filmmakers. Such works provide us with warnings about unwanted trends in our society; but to be effective they must also be fun. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective in posting warnings than we do for entertainment, to get really widely read; although the problem with films is usually the opposite. The first such well-known work was probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948) and is still readily available in both book and film. <br /> <br /> Look or read this: and when you feel that the human inhumanity of a person is a little depressed, Cinderella will reach 2000. It is a feather light comedy with a low budget, based on the same theme that offers effortless but wretched viewing; and as in 1984, the calendar has now passed. Most of the comedy is put on a shovel, although there are only a few really funny moments. To practice understanding between them, you can focus on the question of whether this film will become a new life-long DVD, or will it eventually be forgotten, because the existing tape copies are damaging the earlier redemption. There are a lot of worse movies that appear on DVDs these days, and frankly I don't care what happens in either way. <br /> <br /> So far, the best films in this genre have probably been "The Handmaiden's Tale", but I'd be very happy to exchange them all for a well-made movie for Jack London's high-profile The Iron Heel. Ambitious, as it were, still seems unbelievable that no modern filmmaker has dared to try it (IMDb lists only the silent version of B / W made in Russia in 1919).
