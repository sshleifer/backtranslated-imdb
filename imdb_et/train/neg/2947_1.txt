There have been very few films that I have been unable to sit on. I did this through the Battle Field Earth problem. But this is one of the worst films EVER has to do. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to act on it. I don't blame her. I would be ashamed to continue. I believe this is a rare event when almost every movie is dragged on its face. It happens here. Not to mention SFX, look for a dino whose control cables are hanging at its back !!!!!! I was still looking for a plot halfway through the film. I've never found it. Save yourself on renting and saving for 90 minutes.
