I've seen very horrible horror movies in my time, and while it's not the worst in the cluster, it's definitely below. The script starts with OK. A young doctor goes to the hospital with an intern, hoping that he will keep him better for him and his future wife. Cute? The film is directed directly to the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. It turns out that there is a demon in the basement that is the collection of human souls. It is the work of one doctor, one nurse and one security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs, to make a ritual that simply means pulling out the tongue, and then allowing the demon to haunt the house out and steal his soul through the magic of special effects of cheese. At this point, the film becomes so ridiculously stupid that I asked for it to end. There was another hour to go. It seemed half an hour from the "Tales From the Crypt" episode that somehow reached one hour and a half crap-fest. Tiny Lister, who makes his best John Coffey (The Green Mile), for Tracy Scoggins, who plays the stereotypical Cold Sister Ratchet, fails at every possible level. I gave it 2 letters for only two reasons. 1) His groom is quite hot, he eased the pain a bit late, and 2) The film really looks OK, much better than the current trend of horror movies with wal-mart high quality home cameras. <br /> Ultimately, avoid this, even if you have a Blockbuster movie ticket (which I do and I still felt cheated). As a bonus game, you take your friends and your friends every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) talks to the head. You drink 15 minutes of the movie.
