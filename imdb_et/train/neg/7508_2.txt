I wish Spike Lee had chosen another title for his film. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the movie is a notorious serum killer David Berkowitz. This is not. This is a giant, reputation portrait of NYC street life '77. In the hot summer when Berkowitz terrorized this city. <br /> <br /> The film follows a number of young fictional characters in the Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions are threatened by Sami's son. There is Vinny and her wife Dionna; there are Richie and Ruby and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not pleasing. They are usually annoying and sometimes intolerable. Lee belabors own a high energy, chaotic life that is full of anger, lust and general instability. There are at least two protracted fighting scenarios between Vinny and her husband, disco-dance scenes, countless pieces of pieces ... Over and over again, where did the film editor work? <br /> <br /> In the meantime, all this loose, movie goes through the opportunity to convey any real fear or fear that comes from Sami's Son, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different threat from the neighborhood vigilante groups. <br /> <br /> Operation is good. This, combined with 70's disco music and pride in costumes and product development, makes you feel like you're in 1977 in the NYC neighborhood of Italy-America. <br /> <br /> But the atmospheric authenticity of the film is not nearly enough to compensate for the terrible, overcrowded script about the lives of seriously irritating people.
