In order for a scary film to work well, it must be truly original or very good. This movie is neither. Of course, the pseudo-original twist is that the man kills people because of the toxin and not the disease, but it is a very small twist. There is a corner of government conspiracy, the main character of a crusader with personal experience ... <br /> <br /> One real drawback of this film is that the contaminated person has no sins. Although the character is written to be someone who should be bad, he is not. Without regret, the film is meaningless. Other signs are so cookie cutters that they are ridiculous. The sub-blocks are twisted and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the movie is too flat to enjoy it. Make the movie 45 minutes long and it may be worth it.
