I made my comic back in college when it was done. It was a lot of charm "Get Smart". Although this was indeed a mistake, it was quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was very interested in seeing the film version. It was before that. I would never want words after that. <br /> <br /> In addition to being switched over (who is on Earth, even though Broderick was even close to the role), it didn't just make a class. Effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked about the film; you see gadgets in live-action version action! There was a lack of story and treatment that made it funny or charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a funny comic with a very light attitude. It was fun. Cinema became dim and took too seriously. If he had had a serious plot or it would be crazy to make it a "comic" movie, it would have been nice. <br /> <br /> As it exists, it is not worth reading "Gadget Legacy".
