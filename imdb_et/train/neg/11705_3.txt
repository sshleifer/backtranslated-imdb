This stormy melodrama is quite the worst movie that Ingrid Bergman will soon see. Even the presence of his light screen cannot record this unlikely slow and curving film that is almost impossible to sit without directing it forward. <br /> <br /> For hard-to-hard Bergman fans only; others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you look at "Who's Someone's Charges" instead.
