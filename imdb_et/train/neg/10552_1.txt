It is practically impossible to follow these pieces of slag. Sound is crap, picture quality gets worse from bad to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason that appear and disappear. Did the director suffer from massive brain damage during production? <br /> <br /> Poor movie omission, the story is insecure just sick ev * t If you like rape, murder and self-harm, this is the right alley for you. And if the murders of simulated scenes are not enough, you can enjoy real people clips. I looked at almost everything, but I had to switch off after I saw someone's brain blown. Never before have I seen a movie that was both shame and dirty.
