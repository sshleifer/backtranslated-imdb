I just couldn't finish this movie. I tuned in after what I would say, my candidacy is the worst thing to catch a sexual desire prize: a scene where Pia Zadora's picnic stands between two boys who want her. One (a good boy) wants him to see his road bug. Another (bad boy) simply asks if he wants the hottest dog he puts out for him. Cross-level. I hope I will not break anything he says and will take a hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
