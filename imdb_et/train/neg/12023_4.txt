Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia, who has been in a spiritual shelter for over ten years after finding that he has bloody paths in his hand. Doctors want to experiment with a new experimental drug that returns its lost memories when it works. But when drugs give him demonic hallucinations, he decides to escape instead. Outside of friends, he interacts with a little boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) treats his mother badly, does not let his basement close in the dark room and generally suspects. <br /> <br /> Although the general mystery film is an easily identifiable way before it becomes apparent, I found Mr Diamond acting to be amazing enough to keep my attention all over. (For the sake of full disclosure, I've been a big fan of her killing and her short but extremely important role in Shield through Journeyman & Dollhouse.) Not a big movie or a good one, but it works well. Although I liked it better than the previous movies I've seen from director / writer Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: one short pair of hallucination <br /> <br /> My class: C-
