Visually filled, prime less, incredibly annoying. Not even close to Greenaway's right job. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Overlapping "split screen" effects do nothing more than confusion, the movie has a lot of time in the dark, and the artistic composition of the images is extreme. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to suggest about this movie; Even nudity is incredibly uneven, which shows that it fills a large part of the film, becomes very boring. <br /> <br /> In addition to how someone can say that acting on Ewen MacGregor is brilliant, it's beyond me. He showed more abilities in the Star Wars series and says something. <br /> <br /> I haven't been so impressed with the film because I saw Darby O'Gill and the little ones!
