It could have been a very good movie if I could have seen it. The hand held camera was very striking. I was worried about open credits. Many of us are watching that they finally felt very badly. But we ended up because it was such a fascinating and interesting film that gave some insight into South African young pop culture. The black-and-white film increased its artificial sense. The action seemed very authentic. Some dialogues were somewhat difficult to understand, but not the South African theater seemed most funny. If you have any illness at all, you can seriously consider skipping this movie. It is peculiar but not nausea.
