First, there is the Gujarat Theater, there is also Bollywood. Both have their own strengths and a fan. In Bollywood production, Gujarat theater should be sought elsewhere than Director Vipul Shah. First he did Aankheni (adapted from the gujarat game), which had a unique plot but could not be considered a Hindi film. Now he has adapted to another Gujarat game and called it Waqt - the race with time. All in all, emotions are foreigners. Land development is not for Hindi films. For example, the role play of the father and son is best left to the Gujarat Theater - don't bring it to the Hindi film. Even the comedy track is best left on the gujarat stage. All the performances are medium - nothing to scream - limiting Shefali Chhaya Shah, who is fantastic.
