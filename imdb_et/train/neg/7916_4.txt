Where to start? How would it be wrong to synopsis: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine speaks of Wolverine's epic violent and romantic past, his complicated relationship with Victor Creed and the X program of a malicious weapon." <Br /> <br /> His epic violent past turns out to be extraordinarily violent. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so exaggerated that it is hard to see how they have any connection at all. We are being thrown from one point of the opening scene that shows them running on children, the assembly of war scenes that they have won over their long life, and finally to the point where they are part of the hardcore government team of assassins there is nothing to show. Nothing is difficult to believe that it is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and steep. We are thrown so fast that it's over before you can blink. Having just introduced this character, Silverfox kills about fifteen minutes later. We don't know why we should care about it. Who was he anyway? <br /> <br /> This weak revenge story as a key element has been surprisingly unexplored by romance. It was rushed just because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, when Wolverine finds that her love is dead, she leaves him rotting in the woods when he goes to find the Saber. Romantic, he is that he was characteristic of him, but he was still needed to earn a plot to draw a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As far as the weapon X program is concerned, just say that after a painfully exhausting procedure, Wolverine works and works. Eventually he arrives home comfortably, but mostly to a loving couple. Surprisingly, I and Pa Kent have not worried when they discover naked sweat in their claws. No wonder what fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous movies and comics, the main reason why Wolverines amnesia is bothering him is partly because he was allegedly evil and knowing that it was so ... did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue your more positive lifestyle in the fight against world villains with your teamworkers? Like X2: X-men United, when Stryker gives up some of his secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he knew of the evil acts they did together. This movie creates a team quite well if they really don't do anything. No disturbing violence, not ruthless actions, they simply harass some foreigners in ten or fifteen minutes when they are on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not a bad person at all under Stryker. Instead, he was constantly trying to put his brother Sabertooth on a strap, which was why he was a violent agent we all thought was Wolverine. Finally, he leaves everything together. <br /> <br /> There is no duality conflict at all. <br /> <br /> Idiotically removing that character conflict from the good and evil DULLED story immensely. They can also give it rubber claws. <br /> <br /> There were many other bugs in this movie that were in contradiction to the X-Meni trilogy, including the introduction of one flattened Deus Ex Machinas ever to hit the script. <br /> <br /> Magic memory deletes balls. Really? <br /> <br /> Obviously, they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine. But it was probably forgotten as an agent after sending an agent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would definitely not work with him at all. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that he tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing tons of other mutants at all, little or no. Interesting characters were just window blinds and the story didn't do anything. Most of them were on the film for a maximum of 5-10 minutes, and yet you find yourself wanting to see them more and less in Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (Blob, but not the comic version) can launch a tank missile with no physical damage at all, but with the simple head of the Wolverines metal cap is enough to frighten him? <br /> <br /> Cyclops optical beams (which are no longer similar lasers to competing forces) can be burned through buildings, but when it is burned at the time of Sabertooth, it simply crushes it into the ground without damaging the clothes. The cover of Adamantium ditch everyone? <br /> <br /> The mutant Gambit (gravity-attacking), instead of using his signature cards, has been made into some kind of crazy acrobat. In a poorly edited scene, he knocks Wolverine unconsciously ... then surprisingly a few minutes later he is on the roof that runs towards Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran a few blocks, climbed up the building, ran back to Wolverine, and in the middle of the Sabertooth scratch game there is a mystery that needs to be clarified. <br /> <br /> Some have apologized for the weakness of the films, claiming that it has been made comical, and therefore it should be a weak character and a heavy flash. The idea that this film is a comic film is weak and superficial because of this fact, is wrong. <br /> <br /> The comic book's source material, the true origin of Wolverine ... is the story that deserves the screen. It does not sugar its past nor deals with the reader as meaningless CGI junkies. This is a well-designed story, and although it has been overhauled over time and corrected, Barry Windsor-Smith started with WEAPON X. Much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie must be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Everyone has this magical weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
