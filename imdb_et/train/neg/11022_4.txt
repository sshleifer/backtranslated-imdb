Mister Foe (originally and more appropriately named Hallam Foe? I do not see the respect of my name "mister"), there is respect for the good actors. Both Jamie Bell and Hallam, the physically attractive voyeur / creep and Sophia Myles, like Kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. The problem is when you try to combine your roles in real life. A young man who talks about the intimate details of human life, how Hallam serves it, would have earned the flesh. And Kate's woman would smile and scare - she would probably be called by the police. <br /> <br /> These things are not going to happen in the movie. Bad Hallam's mother is dead and her father married a woman with whom she had a thing. Of course Hallam hates his stepmother and lets him know it. She's having sex with her. Kate is a kind of working person who takes Hallam washing machines and plays sexual competitions. She looks like her mother's birth. It all ends happily with Hallam "solving" his "questions". <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, a game and a brilliant movie, afraid of Virginia Woolf, had the same optimistic end, the characters became smarter and better after tearing each other. The problem is that it doesn't always work that way, especially if someone doesn't really care. The end of Virginia Woolf is likely due to the intensity of emotional revelation. At Mister Foe, emotional revelation never happens.
