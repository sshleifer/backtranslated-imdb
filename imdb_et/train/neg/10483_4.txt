I saw this movie on a Westbound American Airlines flight. It was so bad that it actually seemed to be a longer flight. The plot had the potential (who does not love the movie about a woman who involuntarily kills every Elvis incarnator she meets?), But it pulled together a million different times with really bad writing. After all, the embarrassing bad scene is where the gang of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of this casino, which recovers the sky from thinking that he is going back, then the group of stars moves together to form the "Elvis" constellation that quickly buys the lightning strikes that sent them through the roof . Bad ... OR bad. What is the theme of the whole movie. I would avoid it at all costs.
