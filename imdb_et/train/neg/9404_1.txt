This absolute trash is based on Friday so closely that the 13th series, which is practically a carbon copy, accepts that it is Australian film people who can't act. <br /> <br /> Uncommonly, a young boy at the time of filming a music video on Lake Eildon was inadvertently burned. Now, several years later, everybody has grown up and revenge everybody who can take music videos to the lake. It is a climate and a waste of time and money, looking only at curiosity or when you are an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to (not) act. Leading role Alan Dale used the TV in the Neighbors' Soap Studio, but reached the X files - how did it happen?
