[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this movie precedes this, so I was waiting for me to see it in the TCM mailbox. What is the main disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent and the product values ​​are first-class, but the characters are deeper, the plot is thin and the whole thing goes too long. For a film about alcoholism, family division, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless and climate-free. One example is the depiction of unfithfuness by Frank Hirsch: his rather difficult hand to "go and relax" with his wife, followed by a predictable headache, leads - even more predictably - to his contact with his secretary in the evening ("Hey, Nancy, I have blues in the evening. Let's go. ride "), all according to a well-worn formula. We don't feel like these are real people, but they are cardboard clippings in the marionette games. Likewise, the obvious source of friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch has never been studied or explained. Dave's call to back-to-back Gwen is inexplicable given his cunning inability to get out of the stool or pot. His later desperate marriage with the character of Shirley Maclaine / Ginny has clearly failed since it was presented to the observer, and it was clear - with this type of soap opera conventions - that it can only be solved by someone killed. Right now, when a jealous lover started to run around with a gun, I started to make myself betraying who - Dave or Ginny - was killed. The whole thing was fake with capital P. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there is a presentation by Maclaine and Dean Martin. But in general, I find that the film's interests are purely Hollywood's history.
