With the exception of the Brady hour, it was a hockey TV I've seen for some time. The video production characteristics were not too bad, but the overall appearance and feelings were unmistakably obvious in the early 80s. And Marie Osmond looks like she fought with Avon Lady and lost a lot of time. Too many eyeliners. <br /> <br /> It was so embarrassing to see veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severe. It was even more interesting to watch Alex Haley talk about the African pavilion in a world view that would open in about a year. <br /> <br /> Since writing this, it is 17 years later and it's not yet open (If you don't read Disney's animal kingdom.) All in all, it's all about the drawbacks of Disney's history.
