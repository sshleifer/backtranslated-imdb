This movie is just flat. Time and waste of money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are both clich√©s and the way he talks about RPG players is not funny either. The problem is that the writers do not know how the RPG game works and, most importantly, how to make fun of this game. Of course, there are a number of losers playing RPGs like freaking retards and losers. But that's not the funniest way for me to make this game fun. The story doesn't make any sense at all. Who cares how long the game is played? The biggest problem with this movie is that writers and actors didn't even try to know what RPG was kidding about it. I was ashamed of watching this flat movie.
