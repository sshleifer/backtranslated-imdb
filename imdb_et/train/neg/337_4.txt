Well, what to say. GOLDEN CHILD belongs to the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy is funny (and sometimes quite annoying), but you're still entertaining. Chales Dance has never been worse than her role as a frog Sardo Numspa (what is that name?). <br /> <br /> Who should look at GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... hard to say, but my best guess would be people who love embarrassing movies and can be attracted by poor, bad plots and even more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
