This movie should have been fun. Young Lea Thompson, Young Joaquin Phoenix and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it pulled forward, was unlovable characters and was not the target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and are accidentally caught by a robot friend (named, appropriately, Jinx). The space scenes are then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and depending on your point of view, either cheesy or scary. Adults are bored and chewed, children may be scared because it was really filmed about this horrible mindset. . Why it was first included is unclear, except maybe adding additional tension between the characters, but it failed when it was an idea. I mean, "Back to the Future" is great. But no, he was irritating and on average. No one with whom you want a date is a friend or even a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He is really happy that he still appeared in this movie in the movie. Maybe he can act like Mikey Life Cereal in ads, but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy. She doesn't fit on the screen and I don't think we can find her at home. I would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
