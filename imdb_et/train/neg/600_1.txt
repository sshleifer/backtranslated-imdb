...... in a horror movie. Alright first off, let's start with Kate. His main goals are putting George Clooney, good and last, but not least screw. I have to love her. He had about 3 astonishingly good ways to stop the disease, but he ran. I think he didn't want to bring Guy for 10 minutes and when he did it too late. I mean, the boy tried to rape him. I can't enter these movies when the main character is a sad idiot. I mean, who honestly would express sympathy for one of the boys who finishes everything he's met at night. The film continued. And as a result, it lost all its credibility.
