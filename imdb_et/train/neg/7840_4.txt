This film is being discussed in a Catholic school in the eyes of a young teacher, looking at and around the RAWANDAN genocide. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation of past history and rivalry in Rawanda. Then the story goes on in the eyes of the young idealist "NEW-COMER" who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach the road block, he plays with his driver I.D. does not understand that this is a serious moment and if the driver is unable to identify himself as the right tribe to the soldiers they are killed. And this is how he treats chaos and the evolving story around him. Perhaps you realize that every Rawandan (including his leader) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists cannot and do not help. Media cameras are unable to stop the machine, and too many mechanics who are also fighting militia men. The title comes from the military captain, saying that he is letting a dog eat corpses around his compound, but does not fire military personnel killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired the soldiers yet. Finally, he understands the hopelessness of the situation and the boy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his place for one of the intended victims flees between his tails, instead of coming to school with immanent deaths with the children he has promised not to miss. <br /> <br /> This is more of a character exploration and a moment for Jesus as a story of "RAWANDA" genocide. This film should not have taken place in RAWANDA, it could have happened in any of the genocide hell that was moving around this world at any time.
