Okay, just reading the title, you think it's a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started good but got so boring for the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This tells the story of a mother who is so desperate that her daughter will become a cheerleader, that she will go to every length to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is a girl. He always wins the races, bringing his mother towards his "losing". After talking to "hitman", the mother decides that the girl needs to be a little peeled. This is how action is taken, but it will finally be closed. <br /> <br /> Cast is terrible and the movie moves too long if nothing happens. Don't waste your time looking at it. <br /> <br />
