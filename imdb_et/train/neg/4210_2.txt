Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. She doesn't like her cycling or climbing her wooden house because she knows what accidents can happen to her. So one day he rides his bike and because he starts to rain, he decides to wait in the library until the rain ends. There's the whole story. He experiences all kinds of workers and he is no longer afraid. But the whole story is incredible and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make the story better.
