<br /> <br /> Killer Attack Tomatoes are a "parody" of bad monster movies that gets worse than the movies it enriches. The (very little) story tells about tomatoes who are rebelling those who treat them badly. Basically, they spin and crumble (yes, they crumble) and the next thing you know is covered with ketchup. Actors are non-names who have not made the films since then, so it would make no sense to name them. There's a man hired by the government to try to stop the danger of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black man who is a disguising master, a girl and a diver. Anyway, there is another woman who spits the first man who works for the government. if you don't understand much, you understand. This film would not have been very good at first, but it does not even have fun ridiculous attack scenes. The film is terribly funny, but even though it is the whole point, it is really a pain that could have been (reasonably) entertaining. At one point, the giant wax tomato "slides" is an unmounted plank of wooden wheels on it! Maybe I would have recommended a movie if it was an enjoyable camping value, but it is also missing from this terrible movie. 2/10
