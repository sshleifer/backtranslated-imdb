First, I'm a huge zombie movie fan. I loved all Romero staples and enjoyed a profound transformation of dead Dawn. So when I heard every criticism of this movie, I was still optimistic. I think the critics hated Resident Evil and although it may not be a particularly big movie, I enjoyed it, if not because it was just a fun zombie-shoot-up with half a good plot. But it's a nonsense. The film has a terrible dialogue, a semi-primitive plot and video game scenes. Who rightly thought it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely), which I enjoyed, was Captain Kirk (Ugh) of Jurgen Prochnow. Although his name casts originality out of the window, you can see in his speeches that he knows that he is in a godly film and that he can also make the most of it. All others are acting as they do Shakespeare. And very badly I can add. Basically, the only reason someone should see this monster when it is.) Is a big zombie-buff and you have to see every zombie-flick or b.) I like to play MST3K, a home game. Watch it with your friends and be ready for unintentional smiles. <br /> <br />
