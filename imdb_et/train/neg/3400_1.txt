This film is an obvious waste. Watch this movie if you just want to hear the spoken gel or enjoy a pleasant soundtrack. Watch for another reason and you are disappointed. It should be charming, but not - it's just irritating. Characters are difficult to care for and the actor is bad. The stories in the movie are also charming and ominous. I had been waiting for a warm-hearted family film, but it didn't publish my fourteen-year-old daughter. It is rarely that I don't see the movie until the end, but it got better for both of us. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is currently set, it's cheap and east. European film made during the Cold War. For modern Scottish landscape and cinematography, it is not enough to redeem. True shame, because it is embarrassing to Scotland as a film.
