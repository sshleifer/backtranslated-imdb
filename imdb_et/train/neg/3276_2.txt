The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female meat and fierce language. "The Duke of Hazzard" carried me through; it is not repeated when I was in front of television in New York or California; or, I would probably have watched. Yet I knew that somewhere (like the updated press releases of 2005), I knew it was fast, with an orange Dodge charger - and "General Lee" is still good to go. <br /> <br /> Hunky Cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (like Bo and Luke Duke) are the new riders of Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her short short time - but even her irritating pink bikini can't compete in a dormitory that is full of bouncing, topless coeds. Too stupid plot belongs to the gray Burt Reynolds ("Boss" Hogg), which threatens to turn Hazzard County into a limestone mine. <br /> <br /> Duke of Hazzard (July 27, 2005) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
