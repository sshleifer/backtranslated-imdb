I'm a big Karishma Kapoor and Govinda fan. I watched this movie after I saw Fiza, which was absolutley great. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad and there are movies that are cr * p. but this movie just takes a cookie. <br /> <br /> We were so angry that we were forced to pay our money to wait for a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, not even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
