I have now realized that by watching this movie, I have lost valuable moments in my life that I will never come back to. Ths movie isn't just bad. It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia talks about his competition question, probably not like "white" people because it doesn't have white actors. Mate, I think you will find the reason why nobody liked it because watching the color dries is much more fun and fun than it does.
