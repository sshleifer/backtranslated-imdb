"Say yes" is one of those pains that you expect to get better but never do. This is a "motivational psychopath who decides to threaten an innocent coup." Dialogue is dirty and misinterpreted in many places. The actors are equally poor, especially from the offender played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that if he does not blink or try to speak deeply, he will make his character threatening if all that really is makes him a little easier. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves special attention because it is idiotic beyond faith. "Heroes" do not believe it would be too strange that their attacker threatens to kill them. The "heroine" can see twice that she can't see her unless she is more than her leg. The offender passes the police checkpoint (wearing a shirt covered with blood and a bloody head with a bandage), showing the body burnt to the police on a passenger car seat. The offender strikes, shovels the shovel and stops with deadlock, but they never seem to be hampered, but serious injuries. And don't even start with this terrible twist. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only plus point in this movie for me is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very beautiful but actually no more than a mediocre actor. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie looks like a poorly written, dimly acted and shocking attempt to copy The Hitcher and Spoorloo, but it fails every step of the way because it has a lack of everyone involved.
