I couldn't tell if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be a Hitchcock devastation or a modernized Edgar Allen Poe tribute. These days, somebody would have somewhat crushed and presented it as a TV anthology episode of the old Tales From the Dark Side ... but only after extensive rewriting. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that it seems like a nice, nasty little story that is trying to get out of the film's fracture, and the actors obviously do the best they can with their talent and the material they work with. However, the director simply did not know how to play a dramatic scene or drive at a pace; special effects just didn't work; the scenario telegraphed its thread plot so clearly that two-sided could have seen them; and the soundtrack played German "oompah band" when he was intimidating the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they really tried hard. But it's only interesting for a periodic piece. I think someone very young, who didn't see much tension or horrors, could get the "The Screaming Skull", but someone who probably doesn't get most of the subtext or motivation for the young person. ("Mommy, why is this nice guy trying to frighten a terrifying face?")
