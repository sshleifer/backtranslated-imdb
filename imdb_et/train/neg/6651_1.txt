It's the worst movie I've seen all year round. <br /> <br /> First, I say the actor was very good and the whole cast. <br /> <br /> It was probably supposed to be very fast and successful. Similarly, the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe, a helpless, talented, chronic liar whose source of confidence is a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> It was worse than watching a car wreck.
