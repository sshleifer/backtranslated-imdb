The patient flees to a psychiatric hospital, killing one of his custodians and then a university professor after he has gone to a local college. The next semester, a late professional replacement and a new group of students have to deal with the new killing. Dialogue is such a clich√© that it is hard to believe I was able to predict quotes. This is one of those cheap films that was thrown in the mid-80s. Despite killing the heroine, it is just a poor quality junk. Terrible action, horrible script, terrible effect, terrible terrible terrible! "Splatter University" is just putting your video recorder into place if you have nothing better to do, although I suggest you look at your head cleaning product that would be more fun. Leave it out and rent a "Girl's Nose" instead.
