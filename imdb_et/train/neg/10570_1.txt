Don't let the MPAA fool your "Rated R" for extreme violence, because there is definitely no extreme violence in this boring pice's s * t. I waited for some cheap rambo 3 types of activities that the trailer promised, but its just a boring boring nonsense with tons of flat slow mo rebounds doesn't make sense. AVOID!
