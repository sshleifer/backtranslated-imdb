Oh Judas. It was a real big mess that you couldn't help yourself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and is not going anywhere. Until her mother meets a rich businessman Mert (Jeff Daniels) with whom he can marry. <br /> <br /> It would have been an OK movie if Heder didn't play his Jeffreys so annoying, a great start is no way for him to like it and it only gets worse and worse. Finally, we should like him, but there was no reason he hadn't changed from the selfish brutal he was at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton doesn't even look to try and is a terrible form after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton and where should I believe their mother and son? The only sustainable arm is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they don't look very interested either. In addition to some small smiles, this film really doesn't deserve comedy just because it's hardly a laugh! If your recent mood of Diane Keaton sees Mad Money or Smother, which is much better than this abysmal effort.
