This series gets 2 stars only because it puts some Dickens' blind houses on film and maybe someone reads the book. Contrary to what is thought, Diana Rigg was weak as Lady Dedlock. He was clumsy and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martin. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong with Mr Jarndyce. So I'm interrupting myself and answering all those people who say, "I didn't read the book, so I don't have to take this man's opinion, because he's relying on his own book reviews." True and not true. Above all, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because it is a bad act, whether you read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a satisfying Jarndyce (though too old). The series is not because it is unfair to compare it to a book, but because the different plot lines and characters simply don't connect to create a cohesive, dramatic, mysterious and understandable entertainment. It's boring and flat. If you want to make a good house, you have to spend 20 hours of film 10 in two hours. But I recommend that manufacturers etc. leave Dickens alone (even on Christmas carols). Television destroys the Dickens gene, which appears in its brilliant plots and unforgettable characters.
