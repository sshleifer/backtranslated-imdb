Often I watch a movie that is just as terrible as it is. I continued to look, hoping every minute that it was meant to be a joke to find it seriously. Well, as seriously as this genre requests. <br /> <br /> The actor was disgraceful and situations were terribly agitated and clich√©s. When the film was made in 1920 (for example) and its direction was Hide & Seek (Cord), we would think the cinema was naive. It happens that this movie was made in 2000 and I have not yet seen a quiet era movie that has as little charm as it is. <br /> <br /> Definitely not a serious movie visitor. <Br /> <br /> [Not worth the evaluation]
