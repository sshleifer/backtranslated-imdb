It's very unfortunate when such a movie is made. A lot of work and money has been placed in the best possible way for the amateur. <br /> <br /> Editing pulls forward, there are obvious mistakes that could have been easily corrected a second time and the soundtrack is unimaginable. Much more could have been done with this video. I think they run out of time or videotape. <br /> <br /> Handheld shots have a clear feeling of amateurs.
