The sun should remain on this film forever. <br /> <br /> It's going forever (which is not usually a bad thing - an English patient, Schindler's list), but it's so annoying. The aging of the actors is incredible, and so is the endless story that seems to be somewhere. <br /> <br /> In short, wasting talent and movies.
