I watched it on the tube last night. I got the primary attention of the actors. The first scenes were in the center of attention. Some funny are sad. Good character development. I felt the other third of the film was different. If it weren't at the beginning of the movie, I would have stopped watching. I was looking at how it would be tied. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel it has never happened. In particular, the extension period did not like the fact that several characters spoke in Yiddish (?). Was it another shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend it? No, I don't think so. Since other observers mention a large part of the slang, it is 60 years old, but it was not too disturbing. The end ended me completely.
