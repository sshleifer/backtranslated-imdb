Well, where do I start? I think this is very offensive to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie and I was expecting it to be a great movie, but I was so disappointed! the actor is terrible, the original Annie came out a few years before the birth, I'm now 25 and Annie is still one of my favorite films, so I was very excited to see Annie 2. were they original? very poorly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie I want to see again, and every Annie lover would recommend you not watch this movie because it only leaves you very disappointed. Young girls who sing are not bad, but still don't compare them to the original
