I can't believe it's on a DVD. Even less, it was available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue that this is a good movie when you consider that it only had a $ 4,000 budget. I find it funny. I find it very bad, no matter which budget is. <br /> <br /> Even more fun, I read the following review: "Aside from drama, if you love horror and you love something by Duel (1971), a little more story is refreshed and some beautiful girls you love love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? This is a shame when comparing these two films. <br /> <br /> I give "1" because I can't give "0". I just can't see how this movie would be fun.
