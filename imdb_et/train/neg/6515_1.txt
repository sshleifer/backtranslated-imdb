This is not a boring film, the audience can stay with their own board, fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both filmmaker and actor. The story is simple: After the divorce and ten years of unofficial Hollywood career, the author plays the quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is, what is true: what is written, what was random? Both answers, "yes" or "no", represent M.Berkowitz as a low average human being. If you are looking for self-expression of such love, I suggest you read some independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that I heard quite a bit of disappointment about my country, France. I know that the American people usually say that the French are arrogant (which may be true), etc., and certainly the French (and the whole world) have many griefs against America, but why hate so much? Don't think I just liked this movie just because.
