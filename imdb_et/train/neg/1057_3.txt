I'm sorry I had great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long for my attention, too thin and too weak. When I realized that the whole movie was really just an older man living his dream, I felt cheated. Certainly, there could have been a device that brings us something deeper, something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So don't buy a big drink or drive to the lounge. My children didn't enjoy it either. Ah well.
