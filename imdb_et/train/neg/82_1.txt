This movie was sucked. It was a waste of my life. The act was cruel, the plot was absolutely incredible. A long and long story, these people "terrorize" this pathetic "madman killer" but can't fight back in any way. And this is after they take the ferries without running and during the camping, and appear on a campsite that has already been assembled and fully equipped with food and clothing and daughter headphones. Besides, after the boat disappeared in panic, they were stuck in the forest, but then the girl's boyfriend looks up and probably never thinks they could just go out of the forest like he did. As I said, this film sucks. Complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend see you.
