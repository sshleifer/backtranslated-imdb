If you don't understand the evil redundant movie, it doesn't really mean much to you. A bit of humankind was tried during the cold and gloomy period of alcohol and drug consumption - it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak makes her big disco number, her voice is apparently dubbed, it's pathetic - the producers would at least have been someone who sounded like her. <br /> <br /> Recently, the documentary on television has been much better and provides a more reliable overview of our history ever since. <br /> <br /> No one, except Mikey Myers, can be accused of acting; but he does incredible work.
