"It was supposed to be you" is another sign that Hollywood's ideas have run out. This is a picture of Charlie Hudson, a former police officer. When Charlie's fianc√© goes out of town, she's stuck with all the wedding planning. She spends a week in a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn with a teacher who just happens to marry. These two will quickly become friends and put their wedding together. That's when the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose a safe life or Charlie. This movie hangs from any romantic comedy ever made and just waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge provide truly mediocre performances that just make this movie even more eye-catching.
