I love B movies ... but come on .... it wasn't even worth it ... The end was stupid ... b / c NOT REAL FINAL !!! .. not to mention that it is for life independently ... I do not mean that the storm of illumination or crazy demonic power? Slowly like hell and then they just start killing the characters one by one over a 15-minute period ... and I don't even get to the part where to kill one man without his head ... and then you don't even see what Jigsaw is doing so-called new mystery .... If you have nothing better to do ... Id look at the color before Id recommend this abandoned movie to someone else ... oh and make it even better if you see another movie totem, you see the window in the basement throwing one being. It was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching movie waste
