Definitely not terrible, but certainly not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, a beloved country (1995) directed by Darrell Rood and wrote it on screen by Ronald Harwood (adapted from Alan Paton's 1946 novel). It's part of James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is for pre-apartheid South Africa and a black man and white man intertwined. An old but naive preacher, Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones), receives a letter from Johannesburg that he must go straight away; later he finds that his son has killed a man. The rich farmer / landlord James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a black rights fighter, was killed by Kumalo's son. In this, they unite. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to a movie with the same name in 1951 because I haven't seen it. Or the 1974 music "Lost in the Stars", which I didn't see, is it; both look better. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I've seen; it has much faster air, as it actually tries to say, when Cry, a beloved country, seems to have a clue where it happens. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film with the novel (except that I enjoyed this novel more than I enjoyed the movie) because novels and movies are two extremely different media and there is no point in transferring or comparing them directly in the same way. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie blew. Well, I think it wasn't so bad - ten to ten - but it wasn't that good. Both leaders, both very capable actors, draw some of the most woody I've seen in the film's most inconvenient dialogue (but it can be blamed on his screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also a strange challenge), this film is also written by sublime Pianist and Being Julia). Among other things, the idea and themes of the novel disappear almost entirely when they move to their third film; there is little tension in any moment of the film, racially or arresting. Music doesn't help. The painfully misplaced and boring pastoral orchestral works really help to suppress the film. One upside is cinematography, which has many pretty good or great shots, but unfortunately it doesn't help the movie too much. <br /> <br /> The latest, striking words of Alan Paton's novel are shown in recent moments in the film. It is too bad that they seem to be so loose from the movie. I don't know what Nelson Mandela saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
