Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of Satan / serum killer with "first power": even after the capture of detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and death in a gas chamber, he can move his mind to the body and continue his will. Thanks to the attractive psychological Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, Melanie G. half-sister), she tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept was probably some of the options, but eventually the "first Power" suffers from routine scripts and movie making. We have never seen this before, sometimes better. There is nothing in this film that would differentiate it from other thrillers of supernatural horrors. What's more, it is not very exciting and it is certainly not scary. Phillips is hard to sell with harsh nails, a cynical police stereotype, and Griffith doesn't seem to be very hard to try; The best cast member is probably a character Kober, doing his best to be extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> The climax is quite stupid and ends very weak. <br /> <br /> Not quite even acceptable as such an average film, so: <br /> <br /> 4/10
