This movie is very bad, the script is full of memorable features and incredibly bad performances. Special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it. Only two short themes (30 seconds long or so) are repeated throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worst films I've ever seen is.
