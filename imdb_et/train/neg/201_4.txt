Iberia is great to see on television. But why see it on the silver screen? Lots of dance and music. If you like classic music or contemporary dance, it could be your date movie. But otherwise it is too long for an hour and a half. If you want to see a skillful dance on a silver screen, it's best to see a Bollywood movie. They know how to combine soul-dancing with a long film. Director Carlos Saura knows how to dance from old experience. And from time to time it is very good. but if the movie is one and an hour, it should be at least mostly interesting. There's a lot of art, not everything is bigger than life, and it's not too big.
