A ridiculous horror film about a rich person (John Carradine) who dies and leaves all four to his children, and his servants are divided equally. One condition - they have to spend one week spending their money in their building. And if someone dies, others get more. Guess what happens next ... <br /> <br /> I saw a new print of this movie via cable. The colors were bright and bright and the house itself looks beautiful. That's all the good things I say about it. <br /> <br /> Let's just list some of the problems the film has: the killer is scary; servants are called Igor and Elga - come! some of the sound recordings were so bad that I couldn't do the dialogue (I'm not sure I got a big loss); the tree was weak and very poorly made; other murders were just boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains some really terrible actions - so bad that you looked at the screen incredibly. Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only pretty good actor was the troupe of Faith Domergue (who deserves more) and John Carradin (who looks painfully old and weak here). I must admit, however, that the closing line of this movie is a pearl! <br /> <br /> Why it was renamed "heritage legacy" next to me - there's another 1978 horror movie with that name! <br /> <br /> No matter what the name is, it's a bad movie. Must be avoided at all costs.
