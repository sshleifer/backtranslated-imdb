I've never seduced the movie, but I felt like I could do it after that. Nobody is buried in someone's funeral and says to the missing person, "My relatives died, so why should I care for you?" <br /> <br /> There was little minus propaganda if anything called "art" at all. As a daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly disturbed when using deafness as a trick. Any deaf who knows this tremendous vibration would probably have studied it, not ignored it. <br /> <br /> The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are few topics that I would stay away from: the Holocaust is one; that's another. I wish these filmmakers were not so arrogant (and inert).
