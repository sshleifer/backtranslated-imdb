This film was the worst film I've ever seen throughout my life. I'm not even joking. It was badly done and the participants were unable to act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together. When the movie came, it will definitely hide. Nothing in the movie looks like a front zombie. It seems that the director or make-up artist has simply put a black eye liner in his eyes, calling them a zombie. Credits at the beginning of the film take almost 20 minutes for the film. What was credit viewing was the best part of the movie. It was a fairly terrible movie and I couldn't believe how bad it was. Scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes they were "what's going on?" The sound was terrible and the action shots saw a couple of teenage jokes around the fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or buying this movie, I would recommend that you at least look at the trailer as it shows how terrible it really is. I wish I had rented it before.
