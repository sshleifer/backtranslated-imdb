I didn't think it was as terrible as some people probably do. It passes through one of their cheerful horror films that can be wasted in the middle of the night if you can't sleep, though it is not better quality. It is true that the actor is not great - I thought, for example, Marianne McAndrew, like Cathy Beck, was going to be totally passionate, but the main problem is that many aspects of the plot are not really reasonable for me. Becks is part of the work described in John (Stewart Moss) and partly a honeymoon that they never had (now it's romantic!) There's something to do with the tourism caves, which in itself sounds strange (how does it participate) through a group of caves involved in someone's work? ), but it becomes strange when it turns out that he is a doctor who is doing research in the field of preventive medicine (ah? This association completely lost me). in the cave, he begins to become what I think it should be a human-bat hybrid (although when we finally saw him in makeup, he sees much more than a monkey man) and killing begins. Here's another problem. The first killing is a hospital nurse. First of all, everyone thinks his death was an accident. Another murder is a young girl described as ripping a throat. Then sheriff (Michael Pataki) says his death was similar to that of a sister (which means that the throat has been pulled out? - How could anybody think it was an accident?) And what is sheriff? She seems to be pretty nonsense to the scene of Cathy's room when she takes a drunk in the water and then almost rapes her after what seems to be going back to normal. It's exhausted with an end that left almost everyone unresolved and also one of the most irritating issues I've ever heard in the movie. Even for that, there was something that was watching me. Sometimes, joy can take you an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yes - but not as terrible as some people say.
