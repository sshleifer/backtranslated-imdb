I have just the evidence to confirm my doubts. A number of children, 14-22, put a Titanic DVD on a fantastic top-of-the-range household entertainment type transaction. Only two of them had seen it before. But they had all seen Kate, Leo and Celine Dion's moments so many times that most of them felt they saw the whole movie. Soon after the epic began, they began to become troubled, some of them asked others - "call us when the iceberg appears" Over an hour and a half of the movie, only two girls who had seen the movie were still there. They started yelling at the iceberg, the iceberg. It was cumbersome, they all came back to see the Titanic drowning. They sat in their mouths, hurried to Ohs and far. So, as I thought, the film first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours is the bloody thing to sink, but what is the rest of it. For example, Zivaghol had the same working hours, but I guess how much is going on in this movie over the same period. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. See the supposed creme de la creme face and hand in the ship's first-class dining room. See historical details when you find them. The story is so thin that they have to introduce weapons and shootings on a ship that is going to sink. The real drowning here is film standards. All efforts are focused on special effects and opening week. The movie always became the highest film I know?
