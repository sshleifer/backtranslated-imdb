Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei. Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this flick and get a good background you need to start from the beginning. And its beginning is actually George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out of 79, Lucio Fulci decided to do it indirectly and call it Zombie 2. You know where the zombie is fighting the shark! OK, so after that the flick (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge amount of cash, the Italians decided, the devil. Allows you to do some more zombie cinemas! These things do the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. The story is really just reading the stories we've seen in many American zombie clips we've seen before, the best comparison that comes to mind when living dead. Let's see that the government is experimenting with certain toxic gases that make people zombies. The canister is released from the population and shebang! We get the longing zombies of the human animal. A lot of people are going away from the zombies and arriving at an old abandoned hotel. They have to fight zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There were many problems with filming this movie. First of all, Lucio Fulci, who was the beloved goddess of Italy, was ill. So she couldn't really stop the movie the way she wanted. The film was then given to two smaller directors, Bruno Matte (Living Dead Hell) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to create a film that wasn't that good anymore. You see that Fulci himself was not in the heart and soul of this flick. He was embarrassed against it. He handed over to the creator producers and said in principle: "Whatever hell you want with it!" And God loves them, they did. <br /> <br /> And this is why we and men have such a terrible zombie flick with a big Fulci credited to his "director". I think the main problem is that it's just such a nonsense cage! There's no substance for that! After the first few minutes when some terrorists steal and unintentionally release the poisonous gas, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty breathless characters with no zombie personality. In some cases, it can be fun if # 1 is zombie formation and zombie making is really good and fun, and # 2 is involved in many gores and guts. <br /> <br /> Here we can't! Well there are some inspired moments, for example, when some eagles get infected with gas and they start attacking people. It was cool. There is also a scene with a flying zombie head (which by the way breaks all logic and explanation) and a scene where zombies leave the pool of an abandoned hotel and mute the poor girls. But besides ... the rest of the flick just falls on his ass. <br /> <br /> Endless endless scenes that do not plug the existing plot. That was my main concern. The sets are unfinished and the direction of art is practically non-existent. I hate it when everyone looks so fucking unfinished! I like my b-movies, but it just went down! It's closer to the z-level when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Zombie Make Up? Pure mess. Zombies are all Asian actors (filmed in the Philippines) so you get a lot of Asian-looking zombies. But this is not a big problem, because the film was placed on the Philippine Islands anyway. Its appearance zombies that really sucks! They all died on the same clothes for some reason. And what a zombie is out of here is a bunch of these blacks (more like solid) on their face. One or two zombies were a bit more complicated, but it was not yet impressive. It's just a bunch of goo that seem to be spectators. So not only will it flick slowly at the pace, but zombies look like a mess. They should be dead people! Anyway, for those who are waiting for the usual coolness on the Fulci flick, it doesn't have to wait here because it's mostly someone else's flick. And these two actors (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't really get into it and into the heart. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD, you'll see that when Fragasso is asked about his memories and his feelings here, he doesn't even take it seriously. You can say that he's ashamed of it and in many cases he says "he just had a job and they did it". And this is my friends, the last pound on this flick. There is no love and no heart in making this movie. That's why you get half-confused, crappy zombie flick. <br /> <br /> Only perfect or people who want to get or see every zombie flick ever made. Everyone else, don't even bother! Rating: 1 out of 5
