Where do you start with the movie as bad as it is? <br /> <br /> Did you mention unlikely heroes of heroes? The general act? Scary Script? <br /> <br /> No. You just say that anyone who pays the money to see the movie as poor as it needs their head. I know I do. I respect those poor boys who saw it little or no previous word like the empire (usually a bad sign if a copy of the preview is not available for high quality movies). However, cinemas should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer is not satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after he opened with two other companions. The only other cinema man was one father himself. <br /> <br /> And it was a cheap night. <br /> <br /> Whether the advertising campaign was unsuccessful or the word was most common This is what it is. <br /> <br /> Not since The Avengers (1998), when I've been watching this movie, I've become so short. If a few months later your companion comes with your camcorder, make sure it pays your electricity bill while you watch it. Keith Allen retains some dignity in cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have kept his performance, Rhys Ifans did not succeed in his career after Notting Hill's success, but only Dani Behr is semi-pleasant as a busty secretary. he used to be in Word, but any viewer's expectations about his ability to act had to be quite small at first. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are obviously not limited to budget, but this script is cruel. If you want to hear a lot of unpleasant signs, say "Fak!" a few hours then it should be right on your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, package trips are required. <br /> <br />
