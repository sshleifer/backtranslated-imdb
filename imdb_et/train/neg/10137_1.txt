First, f117 is no longer a high-tech and it is not a fighter plane. <br /> <br /> Second, f14 and f18 cannot change their appearance; they are not transformers. Third, f16 has only one m61 cannon, not two. Last but not least, at the end of the movie, Seagle chose to miss out on a rocket. But somehow, when he fired, the actual rocket rose to a refugee. Since I have experience how f18 and f14 have become mysteriously converted to f16, this little rocket transformation is not a big surprise for me. However, there is one more question I have to ask: how could they use a flying rocket to shoot down an airplane f16 ... <br /> <br /> If students give a very bad job, teachers will set 0. Now I think IMDb should seriously consider adding "0/10" to properly tag this movie. Otherwise, it is not fair for those who get 1 out of 10.
