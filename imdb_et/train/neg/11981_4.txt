Yes, Marie Dresler drinks the plum juice she thinks is poison and she's going out. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my tea, but he's a solid performer who definitely keeps the screen. <br /> <br /> I watched it for Polly Moran I have seen elsewhere. Here, Moran is OK - just OK - like Dressler's terrible friend / enemy. Too bad he has almost completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> The plot is good for the heart. The bad guys are trying to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and ends well. <br /> <br /> I don't know the middle of the plot mechanism: bonds. It came out during depression, so suddenly you knew all the bonds and what they could use well and if they were misused. I, but not the era, know them vaguely. They are just as different as stocks, right? It seems strange to create a story about a small man around a somewhat complex financial entity.
