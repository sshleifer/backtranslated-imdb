The plot is rocky. Actor is somewhere south of Jr High School. Cinematography is not bad, but it seems to have been cut with machetes. I couldn't decide if it was a deliberately busy flick or if the people behind it thought they were making a good movie. Consider Death Valley Days Mayberry RFD. People who run around "illegally" in a modern city are fast carrying 6 gun platforms. It has more than a fair share of "cutsey" things. Picture of good boys pulling the old farmhouse and park the Ford Mustang right in front of the gripping device. Take a photo of the hotel secretary, obviously looking at a western (hemispherical) movie with Japanese sound but with English titles. All this is really strange, but it may be better if you look at it when you participate a little peyote. This is a real curiosity with modern parallels for every Western movie clich√© you can think of. There's even a modern version of a good-hearted dance hall, and the soundtrack has a complicated Jewish-harp. Really! If someone brings it to your home during a Saturday night movie, say that your DVD player died.
