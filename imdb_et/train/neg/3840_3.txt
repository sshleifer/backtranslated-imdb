I heard a friend about this movie some time ago and he recently got it from a DVD. There were a lot of expectations and excitement because we both heard that it was a terrible movie, really scary. How disappointed was I? VERY !!!! Besides that one scene (we all know what bit) is NOT something happened !!! I had been waiting for the woman to look a few times black and make some more scenes, such as appearing in the window or walking across the hall or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all of the comments here say it's a scary, thrilling, atmospheric film. I just didn't see I'm afraid. Perhaps there are differences in what people in the United States are scared of here in the UK. <br /> <br /> Great jump after all mortgage comments (
