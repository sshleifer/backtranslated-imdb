C'mon guys some previous reviewers have almost written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60-year-old TV show! This Star Trek episode is remarkable due to the most serious baby (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used by Star Trek, and the fact that it was filmed in real outdoor conditions. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series, which were completely limited to sound stages. <br /> <br /> Using this outdoor location (and baby) will give the right ordinary episode the right depth and almost film-like quality. and a very familiar exhibition. <br /> <br /> Except for some remarkable exceptions, such as "the city forever", "the task of the earth", and "Tomorrow is yesterday", the old series of Star Trek must be seriously moth and put it to a boring misery. Half a dozen good out of 79 episodes is a pretty bad batting average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring product that Gene Roddenberry produced back, contrary to popular belief that some people worshiped the land he walked, he actually made a lot of garbage! He does not deserve to speak in the same breath as Irwin Allen. <br /> <br /> Just look at the company's bridge collection from today's perspective. They used glowing plywood on the floor, chairs with a plastic backrest, and a cheap cardboard over the dashboard. You can clearly see the paper folds! Any cost savings or what!
