Without repeating what has been said about this film, I would like to add that I look forward to seeing this film ... work by cast / location and superb director Michael Winterbottom, etc. "Don't look now" about the story from the beginning. Stay in different surroundings (Italy) to reduce the loss ... or maybe I saw it? So I was sitting there waiting for the story to open, and I put a spin on what we would expect with this family in a foreign European country. And I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? nothing will happen! and I don't think anything! You are not even given the chance to enter the characters because they are both 1-dimensional and empty. You have believed in the speed of the movie that something happens to turn the whole movie on its head ... The older daughters flirted with the local vespa-boys, they had a great opportunity to take the film in another direction, the youngest daughters' vision of their dead mother came to a barren and pointless exercise, fathers trying to attract her to a female student felt ridiculous given her age. It seemed that the script would be the last reminder, where they decided at the last minute to lose the story of any courage and to minimize it. When the credit started to roll (unexpectedly), you can't help but feel you have been robbed of your time, looking at it in the trash.
