I have to admit that I got stuck, I thought something should happen after the body in the first scene ... and at his disposal. I was wrong. It was the Betty Cinema Verite that hits the first part of Mordant Morven's beach. I really do not care about what young Scottish lambs living in Scotland are doing these days, who they are, the drugs they take. Visually, the walk through Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was a pleasant and definitely the highest point for me. The lowest was his dead boy's grocery store. Since the movie was closed, I had two thoughts ... 1. Is it all there? 2. Now I see why his boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. "Bare Bitch Boredom, or what I did on my trip to Spain." I'm so strange that these things get stuck.
