Go now and rent this movie. It's on the bottom shelf of your local video store and covered with dust. Nobody has been touching it for years. It might even be $ .50 special! I'll take ten bucks, I swear! Buy! Compared to this, there are not many films - the celluloid version of the boat, which is formed in the bottom of the trash in a few years. Yes, I gave him "1", but it deserves much lower. 1-10 scales were not meant for such things.
