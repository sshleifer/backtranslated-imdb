The fall of Robert Altman, the revived Westernist Edmund Naughton's book "McCabe" was ignored at the time of his release, but in recent years it has gained a great critical level. In addition to a completely convincing boom city scenario, this character is not very interesting, and the picture looks deliberate and unpleasant. Habe Warren Beatty plays a century-long entrepreneur who lives somewhere and is nowhere near the suburbs and helps to organize the first brothel; When profits begin to come, of course, Beatty is threatened by the harsh city of the city who want some action. Altman creates a festive, winter atmosphere for a film that gives the audience a certain amount of time and space, but the action in this unfortunate small town is limited - most of the story is made up of vignettes - and the Altman pace is deliberately slow. There is hardly any claim that this is done (in fact, it is the opposite) and the nervous actors staring at each other without thinking. It is a self-defeating picture and in an Altman-like way he proudly wears a defeat. ** from ****
