If this film does not allow people to do drugs, it will fail. I was ready to use them. I was expecting something to happen and nothing really was. This movie is not horror or drama. It's just methanolic paranoia. This film can win the F-word prize so many times and so meaninglessly. It wasn't well said, but I felt they were doing Meth to replace Meth, to whom they owe. Hector became worse and more paranoid when the movie went and the girl just got hopeless. The end didn't really make sense. There was no point in the film if it just shows how annoying it is in the middle of a forest house. I supported the second feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating of this movie should be much lower.
