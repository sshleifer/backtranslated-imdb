Yes, the first "Howling" was classic. A pretty good werewolf movie that I admit, started slowly, but got a boost to get a pretty good finish, then the anchor woman turned into a cute werewolf to kill her with the camera. Yes, what has been done for an entertaining horror movie to make sure ... forget about it, because this movie has nothing to do with this movie. They are sure that they will do that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something wants to know what and why things fell like they did, but they go from small cozy returns from the first movie in Transylvania or somewhere where they have to fight evil magicians or anything. I often do not know what Christopher Lee was doing in this world, but I read a trick where he says he was never in the werewolf movie, but still read the script before taking the role. Perhaps you could have been an "American werewolf in London" in hell that could have been possible. After all, it was in London. Herk, with werewolves, it doesn't seem like much in the movie, except for quite strange and long-lasting sex. In fact, I was the most memorable death in this movie when one galician spoke loudly and this guy is bleeding in the ear.
