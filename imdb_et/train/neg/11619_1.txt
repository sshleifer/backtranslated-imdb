I watched the whole movie, waited and waited for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault to wait for evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it strange to say again about the Oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and make a musical theater with him? I did not understand why some of the plot elements were even present: why was the structure, why were there big stairwells with the ideal place for someone to fall into their death, if no one is going to do it, why is this scene with my father at all, why is it nice kitchen, if you only want to eat a meal, why would a boy want to be baptized and parents vice versa, on the contrary. I see a lot of good comments for this movie ... have my taste spoiled with 70's b-movies and old sci fi flicks?
