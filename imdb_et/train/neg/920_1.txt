Seriously. I just offered my first look at Demonicus and the words have failed me. He was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for a small man. The man whose films arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex, but they still hugged harder than most of the trendy junk that we otherwise had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> A painfully evident California walk doubles the "Alps" and an abandoned train tunnel should actually be an "ancient cave". I didn't think they'd even try to dress it up with the moss or film it in a way that might indicate that it was something other than the old train tunnel! Ugh! A fearsome demon instead of a gladiator, as the cover refers, is treated with us who wears Wal-Mart's Halloween garments. There's a pretty cool looking body that lives from time to time to hit his fingers, but he doesn't even learn to stand up to the last five minutes. Why couldn't he be a villain? Instead, we have a boy with a plastic sword, Joe. Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such fear. I love movies that are so bad they are good. Hell, I have occasional jokes that are so bad, just bad. However, this is simply unobtrusive. The perfect example of making a box, not making a high quality movie.
