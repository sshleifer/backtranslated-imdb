The greatest mystery of Veronica Mars is not what he had to solve on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rather, it is a secret why this multi-year assessment is still in the air. This week, the lowest for Veronica Mars was found in 146 of the 146 out of 146 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read. Veronica Mars was beaten by every now broken WB show and every UPN show. All Fox exhibitions and, of course, all ABC, CBS and NBC exhibitions were hit. <br /> <br /> Now hip hipers will say: but it was restarted. But all this week on television was pretty much repeated! It looks like the reason why CW would choose this proven scoreboard because it is one of the few UPN records. <br /> <br /> It is clear that there is something behind the scenes. The benefits are exchanged and influenced. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The "Veronica Mars Potential" line is now clearly dead if it has two years to prove itself and failed. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is Joel Silver's influence and influence, but frankly, I'm at a loss because someone would decide to spend their influence on showing that they don't look at the audience. <br /> <br /> Great secret and very bad debut for CW.
