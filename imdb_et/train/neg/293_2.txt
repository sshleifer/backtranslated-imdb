This film is basically about some girls in a Catholic school who get into trouble because they put a red color in their schoolmate shampoo and, after punishing this act, they decide to take off during Florida vacation. From there, they meet some boys with local eateries and decide that they will both meet later in another place. Girls get to the nearby road and stop for a while, and when one girl decides to move around a little, she sees a murder where the local sheriff is bound. He gets scared and runs to tell others what happened. The other girls decide to go with him and two to kill. The other two girls then kill the killer and are placed in a local prison. Meanwhile, the sheriff's deputies keep the girls and despite their demand that the sheriff be a killer, they both ignore them and act unknowingly and all others in this movie who simply can't put two and two together much less terrible detective work. this. The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one girl, where she decided to rape her to jail, and it seems that the girl she wants to be raped by the man and the bare chest scene I admitted was good, but before they met her lips there are other things in mind. This film reminds me of a small budget thriller "Blood Song", where Frankie Avalon stared, with the same motive of a different character. It's not a movie worth renting even for an 80-year low budget movie, and the end was the worst end I've ever seen in the movie, and it left me money back!
