Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately there is no leadership in his forte. Before I rented it, I had great expectations of the film and maybe I didn't like it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a movie that takes place mostly in one small environment, but it's not an attempt. I found the film boring, boring and stretched out. Operation was not remarkable. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since she is aware of most other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but it was one of his first films (I got a kick, how young and buggy it was for the Scream). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was one of the above-mentioned car wrecks. The center line of the roads was completely centered and the camera moved along the line and wreck. But this blow was a very "normal suspect" ish, and I think Spacey has got the idea of ​​this earlier movie (which is great for you). If you want to see a fabulous movie that takes place in one small place, look at the Hitchcock lifeboat. Perhaps Spacey should have filmed it before that.
