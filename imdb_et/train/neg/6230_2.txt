I was interested in this movie because it was a drumless cannibal flick. I was deeply disappointed. it was the same disappointment I felt I was watching on Friday 13th: jason takes manhattan. so much potential wastes! <br /> <br /> Opening position is a decent attention. then grind it. Big breasts and egregious 80's fashion can't help this movie. the only things that eat near this island of cannibal monks are piranha! I'm not asking for the "cannibal holocaust" level, but I was looking for a cheap general exploit gore. I didn't find any of that. <br /> <br /> I found some parts of the fighting scenes somewhat intriguing, so 2 stars. I don't think this is the time it takes to watch it. I saw it in a party where no one cares about what's going on and just want something in the background. but i'm not telling anyone, "oh, dude, you see GOTTA this movie." it is neither good nor bad enough to justify great attention.
