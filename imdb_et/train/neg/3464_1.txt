It seems that many people who have reviewed this film have been watching it for the first time because it was filmed near their residence. How is it for ringtones? If this movie was filmed close to where I lived, I wouldn't mention it in my review. It's terrible! Several reviews show that this movie is a junk or linguistic horror film, neither is it. It is sad to see that this film is seen as a comedy because it is not only a bad test of horror, but also a comedy. But I smiled at how incredibly bad the film was. <br /> <br /> This movie contains 2 good things, a mask and a choice, unfortunately, it would have been interesting to watch the hour and half the mask and weapons that put on the table watching this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also ridiculous, minor and stupid. Do not bother about this movie, that you have already wasted this time reading this time, that this movie is no longer wasted. Arrggghhh! It is a shame that such films are even ready. I was expecting the entire crew member to be credited with Alan Smithe, a name used when a person, usually a director, does not want to credit a movie because it is so bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing redeemed in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I feel like I was hanging. Avoid. 1 out of 10
