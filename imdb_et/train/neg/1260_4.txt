Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nickname that Donna Reeds' romantic leader Tom Drake plays for him! That way, you can immediately make it clear. His first role, THE GET-AWAY (1941), also his last, DALLAS (1984-1985) Ms. Reed could never be called CHUNKY. Not that attractive and thin actor. Whose tasks are M.G.M. rarely lived his talents. <br /> <br /> ms. Reed is supported by a group of competent characters who, unfortunately, have to play with this alleged "screwball" with comedy. It is clear that M.G.M. it was such a film because of their depth. COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even better produced in UNIVERSAL. Ernst Lubitsch's "touch" or the mind of Preston Sturges does not save this film. A fairly common romantic comedy with all the pre-war (WWII) efforts. <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg was still alive, the screen game would have been either a remarkable rewrite or never a daylight. It was in Louis B. Mayer's "safe zone", where there was no complicated entertainment. A form that could not keep up with DeHavilland's decision on post-war challenges, the disappearance of their theatrical chains, television, and would help M.G.M. For Fortunetly Donna Reed, her best days are before her culmination, which ends with HERE ETERNITEET (1953) and her best actress victory.
