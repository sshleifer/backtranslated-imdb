SPOILERS: I'm always surprised at how many people gave this game. It was terrible. The script and the voice acting alone destroyed it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unpleasant characters in the game. You almost pray for their death. And worst of all, there are less vampires in this game than wolves inside Beast. <br /> <br /> The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you are expecting some Anne Rice style vampire story, forget it. The story of this game is very little related to vampires. You don't even see one end and even then you can't fight them. <br /> <br /> The story is radical and pretty much godly, for Christianity. I'm surprised that he pulled on the table. I'm not even a Christian and I found this offensive. Mostly, the story focuses on searching for the Holy Grail and buried in treasure. The robbing of the royal baby, which should have been focused, does indeed rise aside. Gabriel has no urgency to find a child. In fact, he does not ask for anything about the child for the first time after a while. <br /> <br /> Graphics are pretty bad. The characters are moving at the speed of the snail even on the best systems. They are thick and outdated. And it's hard to go from wild animals to FMV to this terrible game engine for Holy Blood. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace is also terrible. I really do not know why it was so terrible, but they sleep together. And it's not fun. Gabriel spends most of the game saying to her best friend Mosely how she thinks Gracest is more of a sister and she doesn't think she's one for her. And he really looks like they slept together. But it is so unlikely during the game that you almost don't care about that moment. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he constantly made stupid sexual enthusiasts for all the woman women. At the end of the game, Grace leaves what seems to be an expensive John letter. I think he was so fed up that most of the players were. <br /> <br /> I found this story tedious and boring. I was waiting for the story of a royal baby kidnapped by vampires. And I was expecting to see vampires and fight them, maybe even Gabriel or Grace become one. But not. Instead, the story focused on the author's twisted vision of Christianity. What a shame. Here they were elements of great adventure and instead we got it. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting part of the game was actually the end. Finally, we get some action style puzzles. But there was nothing to suffer for them throughout the game. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this game. I had come back years ago, and I hated the game engine so much that I dressed it for years. I just looked at it recently to see what I lost. And now, I'm very sorry that I did. My favorite characters were destroyed. I hope the series can only be redeemed by the fourth game. And I hope they will get it next time. It would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment.
