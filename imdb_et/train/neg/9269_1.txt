Well, since you see part 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they should never have done part 4. Everything from sticky and I mean sticky scores to bad action, I dare to look at it and don't forget I mean parts 1 to 3 are badly damaged by Damion's plot, but without him it's just not the same. Of course, at the end of Part 3, I got a bit tired of the ongoing story, but it was a good closing at the end of the third. Again, there was no reason for Part 4. Even if they could have done a much better job than what I had to do, lol. There's an hour and a half of my life that I never see.
