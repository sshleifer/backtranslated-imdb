This movie is terrible. At the end of it, you realize that you have been stolen for several hours in your life so you can't come back. The end of "Twist" is very natural. The progressive nature of this development is incompatible with these final acts. Ninety minutes of preparation - assuming Rob Lowe's symbol dies on Christmas Eve - is literally explained in ninety seconds: "No, we were just beating you." Then Rob Lowe's character is not even upset! "I'll forgive you if you forgive me," is as irritated as he gets. If someone could convince me to convince me that I was going to die and then said, "No, sorry, just cheat on you" I would raise serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away a spoiler because I can save some of you from watching. Please save yourself and DO NOT THIS MOVIE.
