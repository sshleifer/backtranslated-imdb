I discussed if I should mention the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show has probably been seen by any Scrubs follower, it probably won't appear in the spoiler category. <br /> <br /> The clip shows. Grrr. We all knew that the Friends went down the line when they started to show the clip ... and five and a half years to Scrubs, which they've gone and fallen to be like that. <br /> <br /> I have to think about whether the writers just could not bother writing this week and just said we were showing funny things to others. It didn't work. <br /> <br /> For beginners, leaving the context at all times has not shown people to fall. It's not funny to see that Todd hangs on his banana bug if we don't know why he was hanging on his banana mat. <br /> <br /> Second, what was supposed to be a collection of JD fantasies, was one of the Turks dream, the other was not his fantasy, though I forget what. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We've seen all these things before. And people's dancers? Why? That's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to admit that the two moments of my favorite bubble were in the final compilation ... Dr. Cox realized that Ben had died ... and JD tells him he's proud. <br /> <br /> But even seeing these moments did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> The worst episode. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE, don't let your show go like friends, keep it fresh, keep it funny ... or pack it up.
