What are Indonesian Musical Films? I've never seen Indonesian music movies like those made in Bollywood. They don't let the spirit of the story and just "what they called" poetic lines. <br /> <br /> This story of the love of two children who are divorced and meet again after a few years of change is not a special remark. This is a simple story plot (but it's quite focused though) with "designed to be" musical story lines here and there. <br /> <br /> The confusing characters that should be saved from brilliant action are overlooked. The main actor can try to fill this character, but it is the best he could do. As far as casting is concerned, I do not feel the need to put a pupil in Bali into this story and, of course, this is not the only unnecessary sign. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is why would I like to watch this movie? Maybe due to mangoes ...
