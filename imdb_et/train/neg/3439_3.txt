***** Probably small spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can't say I liked it, but I can't say I don't ... it's very strange. It has bad things like a shark that has come out of somewhere with the worst CGI if you could imagine if I was a director who would definitely cut this part, I was intrigued by the rest of the movie. .. For some people it is boring because it has no activity, sometimes it seems at home ... Take a scene that one friend died and the next thing they do is what? nop, not crying ... their horror stories to each other .. * sighs * (just after she's lost) <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing was when they talked about the boat they had like "hundreds of candles in the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by some kind of curtains (old windows cover) and sofas / sofas ... I thought it was stupid, using candles, but not thinking around, besides the sea alone ... <br /> <br /> Good, some frightening scenes that they've done nicely, I liked some. Sometimes the horror works better than its hidden, if there's something instead of showing it, so this movie does it well, can it - because it's a small budget I don't know, but it works well for me! You feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Don't wait that much but if you like watching the movie, look at it, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> n your raw English) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
