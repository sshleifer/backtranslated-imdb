I think this movie did so well when it was Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first movie after "Beverly Hills Cop", so when he was hot. Given that it was over two hundred million and it was R and it was about 80 million and it was pg, it doesn't say it's not that popular. I've never been a great Eddie Murphy fan so it's probably another reason I don't care at all. It has Eddie as a missing child finder. He has to find a golden child or the world is terrible. The plot is very bad but as bad as it is not comparable to the special effects. I had seen better things in the 1970s than some of the things offered, Ray Harryhausen did it better. However, the main reason why you see a movie like Eddie is, unfortunately, it is not very funny at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the "lost Ark" Raiders. I think they were hoping for the fish out of the water effect, but it just doesn't work for me.
