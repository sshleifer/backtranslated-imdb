Only one thing is important to thoroughly evaluate India's Runner. Get your pants off. Peek inside. Is there any evidence of Y-chromosome? Okay, you do it. <br /> <br /> This movie contains all the things that men need: blood, weapons, caravans, women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics - what have I left out? - Oh, yeah, the boards. Like a woman, I really hope that Sean Penn will consider it as "when I was a child ...". As he wrote and directed this thing, he is almost entirely responsible. Uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen as usual shows how the work should be done) tries to save Penn. Too late. Lines and activities are there. Even dedicated, experienced actors can't change them. <br /> <br /> I found this movie calmly and stupidly and predictably. The Dialogue Moves Along - Sandy Dennis honors my aspiration to breathe life into a wooden mother's monologue without maternal authenticity. Then he dies. After a while, the father of the protagonists, Charles Bronson, will do. Their absence is hardly noticeable. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned pyrotechnics, etc. seem to occasionally enliven things and frighten the audience to think something is important. <br /> <br /> If you're a man and under the age of 25, you can adore this movie. A plan to go back to it at 35. I think you still like it? <br /> <br /> I don't think so.
