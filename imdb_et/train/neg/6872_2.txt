There were pretty good stories at this show, but a bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. It is quite clear why this exhibition was canceled, though, like most UPNs, I never knew that it existed until it was running the syndicates again. and movies, making me think that the producers had no original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I haven't commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. A special effect was not bad for the 2001 exhibition. <br /> <br /> Gnome was a nice character.
