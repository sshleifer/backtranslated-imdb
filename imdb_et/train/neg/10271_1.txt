This movie was supposed to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The act was terrible, terrible and cheesy and talked about a predictable plot! I never watch this movie again or recommend it to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the movie started, I realized what I got. All they did for this movie was copying many scenes from other horror movies there and all those movies into one movie. Prank phone calls, halloween night, psycho and one knife! That's completely ridiculous. I wasn't afraid of what I thought the horror films had to do during the movie. As for making a movie, it's pretty fun how they all talk about how big and so scary this movie was. I mean, how do you not understand that movies are, for example, "Scary Movie" cheap blasting. At least get some good actors out there and maybe it would be a good horror movie.
