This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented it as a joke, waiting for me to get out of the first scenes and just let me say that I've never been so hard in my life. The first scene where ninjas open out of the air accidentally and start a huge and ridiculous fire is one of the unbelievably funny stupid moments of my life in my life. It's not a dinosaur film, but more of a movie that makes the genre fun (and doesn't mean at all). I didn't see the first two, but based on the complexity of the plot, I don't think I have much to miss. If you want to see a movie that fits well with six packs or herbal medicine, if I demand that you rent this movie and sit back and watch 100 years of going to the cinema into the trash and get into the box.
