Margret Laurence apparently did not intend to have any of his novels as a film, let alone a stone angel. Hagar was the character who constantly plagued the social norm (Gainsay, who dares, someone?), And ended up in the process of almost all of his humanity. Symbols in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) There is a constant reminder of the old and new struggles and the carnage (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> Although the film is fairly reliable on the book plot (but not really a storyteller, is it?), then I think it missed the point of capturing the spirit of the movie. Hagar's resistance (in the interests of resistance) was not there. Bram could have been much more crude than imagined, and Hagar's father could have been "traditionally" playing. If the filmmaker had demanded stronger images, the film drew the point straight home. <br /> <br /> Similarly, why should we see cell phones, organic produce, and other modernizations? Are we trying to make some points for some points (eg Muslim girlfriend and local people). Hagar and cover. is all but politically correct in the book, so why should we see it in the movie version. Modernization can be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but its use as an excuse for sending unconscious politically correct messages that are completely irrelevant to the novel (and film) seems to be throwing under the intellect. There's also an audience. It seems we are conditioned to see the bitter old people so cute and cute. Why should you laugh every time Hagar is at his tantrum? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh or with Hagar. These people are frustrated and full of anger, and all we do is laugh. I don't think it would be Hagar and other people in his situation.
