I rented this terrible movie. The worst I think I've ever seen. I believe that the 1st class class could have done a better job. The worse movie I've seen and I've seen some bad things. Something frightening, except that I paid for it 1.50 and it was 1.49 too much. Action is terrible, characters are worse and the movie is just one trash. Slauther's house scenes are so low budgets that B-movement looks like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is if you want to waste a good evening and the little money is going to rent this terrible flick. I'd rather look at the killer clowns from space when I sit in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again
