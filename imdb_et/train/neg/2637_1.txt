Seriously, I don't even know where to start. It's like someone who gave the autistic third grader a $ 1bn budget and said he was "making me a secret service movie". Editing is ridiculous, cinematic was at best casual, the syllable of each dialogue was completely slowed down and leadership ... well, was there even a director? Everything was just as meaningless and flat and pointless ... and casual .... and flat. <br /> <br /> Here is SPOILER for you; This movie is the most stupid thing you will ever see. <br /> <br /> However, if you like this piece, you will also enjoy; Deterrance, Dark Blue and partial front lobotomy.
