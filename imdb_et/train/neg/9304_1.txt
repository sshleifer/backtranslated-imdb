I've seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, but that is undoubtedly the worst! I usually like stupid movies when they are somewhat fun, but I can't even think of a good thing about this movie. I like "Teen Witch" for heaven. But S.I.C.K. is terrible acting, lame porn music all over and even sex scenes suck! I should compare this movie to the foolish "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys" or even "Very Brady Sequel". Although it is much worse than any of them. I beg you, don't waste your time. Believe me, it's 2 hours that you never get back.
