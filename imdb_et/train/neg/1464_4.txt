I looked at this hope to know something I didn't know about the most notorious person in today's history and couldn't help thinking that history is HITLER: EVIL RISE. Hitler was so obsessed with his brother that he threatened to be one of his admirers. Hitler turned his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but have the writers confused with Adolf Hitler and Tony Montana from SCARFACE? It is bad enough, but what was offended by me was that there are no pieces of the historical context in this mini-series. Germany lost the First World War and the Allies took a big price for it from Germany. It was this economic environment that led the German people to somebody - someone - to restore their pride and because they turned to Nazism. The German downgrading of the 1920s caused by the merged authorities seems completely absent, so there is no chance that HITLER: REDUCTION RISE could be taken seriously as a historical document and I did not even mention that Himmler and Goering are sensitive because of their lack of <br /> There is one positive point about the Mini series and this is a role for Robert Carly. Okay, some of her heroes are wrong and her voice is a little too loud (archival materials show Hitler had a soft seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and she can hit Hitler's own charisma on the screen. The British journalist remarks that Carlyle reminds Sparker players more than Adolf Hitler are unjustified and provide a better interpretation of Hitler. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of Robert Carly, but I hated everything else about this mini-series and wondered why it's on the ground first. Don't recommend it to serious history fans
