It has the logical consistency of ketchup-filled marshmallows and the overall aftertaste is the same disgusting. <br /> <br /> Used during the 9th Hell Circle. Just torture. <br /> <br /> I'd prefer to watch 90 minutes of your computer through a 5400 blue death screen when you look at this terrible again - ever. Terrible. Terrible. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> Do you know that it is good for Swiss cheeses to get cheese with holes: here are only the holes - and the excitement? Well, what makes color drying an adrenaline fast and an Olympic sport. <br /> <br /> My brain hurts when I try to work out who the drivel was, whether they thought about the assumption? (I hope not, otherwise there is no redemption), the only consolation is when they had the pleasure of sitting through the desert. There should be no synonym for television: "Of course let the horses walk in the living rooms! Our audience is idiots!" <br /> <br /> I was hooked to find out how it could get worse. It's not a good sign, people. Hallmark should be ashamed of its release. <br /> <br /> I should be ashamed of watching it. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed. I'm in a long shower.
