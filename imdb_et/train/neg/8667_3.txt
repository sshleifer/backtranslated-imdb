This sport is nice, deep, but for thrillers it is better to offer more than names and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing more than talk and talk more. Most of it was a bunch of women against everything. <br /> <br /> The first five listed actresses here are women, which asserts that it is really a "chick flick" and small. It's probably playing on a lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick crime scene and then more talk. Halfway through, they had lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked around 15 years ago.
