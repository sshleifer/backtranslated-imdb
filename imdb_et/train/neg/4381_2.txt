It's one of the five worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they didn't try. There were some decent writings with some structural elements, good pain, some good actors. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some elements may be a bad structure and a story that is too much from the lead (who is probably much better than restrained), some bad leadership and editing. I had enough time for about an hour, beating my hair for about an hour and a half and feeling very sensitive for hours and fifty minutes. It was also just insecure, being that I went to someone who was previously a heroin addict. He was upset that it was glamorizing something that wasn't good for him. It was supported by a pretty 17-year-old girl who was in love with a 30-year-old junk. <br /> <br /> And the essence of leading mindlessness was enough. There were clumsy plot points that had a test structure, but the end result was endless and infinite (with an uneven timeline). The characters were colored but did not end, which made me feel good for the quality participants you just didn't see enough. <br /> <br /> Leave it out. I assumed it was the first time a director loved his turds, but he's done it before. I'm amazed at how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who actually gives them money.
