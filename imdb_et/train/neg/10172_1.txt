When I noticed that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like a score! I testify that I wanted to see the movie. And I have to say that the first fifteen minutes were so nostalgic. Then it all went down the hill. I did not expect it to be a politically correct mumbo of civil rights. They took all the possible controversial issues and threw it into one stupid story. I was shocked that Noah attended something like this, especially his role. Someone with a fully functional brain does not really agree with all this mess in the Vietnam War. If anyone really wants to know how Communism was, sit down and read this book. And no one who approves it or is against it, but cold hard facts. <br /> <br /> I just looked at a couple of scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that's all I was interested in. Everything else about this movie irritates me.
