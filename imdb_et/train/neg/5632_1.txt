I watched a DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the USA) and later felt it was a really terrible movie. But they have to cut out the original movie quite a bit or I have a lot. Sex scenes had very little vulgarity and nudity (not even breastfeeding), but I have read a number of other comments on IMDb.com, mentioning the temptation and something about the swab. I didn't see anything like that, just a bad, boring film with unlikely characters and a tricky, sophomore plot. Giada Colagrande is paralyzed from the mouth or Botoxed to her claws and nary's expression touches her face. And his name makes me think about the size of the Taco Bellis drink: "I have a Cola Grande!" It was actually so much fun that it was so bad, I have to play as I was at my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, noting that Dafoe's skin is too big for her face. It's really like a silly putty!
