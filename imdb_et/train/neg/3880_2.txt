I can now and now watch a good gory movie. I've seen pretty sick things. But this is one of the few films I found grotesque in a way that was just modest and reluctant. I like fun movies when they're fun. I like wen that they have a lot of creativity behind them. The holes in this movie are not creative. It's sick. It's reluctant. This is totally unpleasant. That's why this movie is definitely not fun. The film is a horror film, but it has no fear. So, the only reason for watching this movie is that it is for gore, but it is the most unpleasant and ugly aspect of the whole movie, and it says a lot. The action is terrible, the plot doesn't make sense and music is really annoying and WAY too electronic. Everyone took me out of the movie. Pretty much the whole movie is one big long depressing ordeal. There's the guy who has a train unhappy accident and wakes up in the hospital to find out that his skin is dissolved and melted. I think after that he goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the digestion process. There are some weird subplots where an old couple, with a dog, a broken head, flowing down the stream and ending with a man with an electric shock. There were times when I really tried to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie I thought was even entertaining, at the beginning of the scene, when the nurse runs slowly down the hospital corridor. If you like ugly, nasty, ad unappealing horror movies, this is for you.
