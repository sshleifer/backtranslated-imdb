Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like football. Unfortunately, it was not a goal. The historical theme of the giants is good, but pour the gonce milk and you reach the giant cheese wheel. I say, take this roller and roll it out of the rock. I couldn't even watch the whole movie. It says a lot because I'm rarely away from all the movies. I always like to give them the opportunity to redeem the last minute. It's impossible to let anything like that go wrong. Well, at least the action was good .... NO! <br /> <br /> The only thing that falls in this movie is rating. 1/10 and sink into negative numbers!
