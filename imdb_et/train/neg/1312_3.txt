Tom listens to one of these old radio programs that children would watch from the 1950s to the present day on TV. But they're not watching television when it was made into a comic, so people got their entertainment - from comedy to scary music - on the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally shakes his boots, listening to some of the "fantasy". In fact, he literally does everything the narrator says, such as "the hair that stops, the icy chills robbing behind him, his heart beats in the throat" and so on. Meanwhile, Jerry looks at Tom and laughs at his ass - cat voices. <br /> <br /> Then we get a taste of what we see for years after this 194 drawing, where Jerry tortures Tom for other reasons than sadistic pleasure. If a cat asks for trouble, this is one thing, but when she has her own business and Jerry has physically (and in this case mentally) abused her, I have a hard "little boy." These early T&M efforts were also a minute longer than all the following. Sometimes one minute has changed. It did this because it really took some time. It could have been cut for five minutes without touching something, because the sketches went too long. It's common for Tom and Jerry. Usually they work much faster.
