I've seen about a thousand horror films. (my favorite type) This movie is one of the worst. For me, the idea guides the film. So, even a poorly-made, cheap film can be good. Something weird is definitely cheap. However, this is little to say. I still don't understand what the karate scene is with the movie at first. There is little to offer a strange thing. Save yourself pain!
