The life of the holidays begins with an atmosphere of vision from London as a busy, busy, strange street and sunshine city. I was hoping that this atmosphere would keep, but it would hit a story that goes far far. <br /> <br /> Othello works with big, fat, Mr. Karva, his father of criminals (at least I think it's what he should be, because it's never exactly defined, but he leaves kittens deep in fat, so trust me, he's a jerk) who does tiny little work when his skanky girlfriend gives dad's hand jobs. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who's always out of B. Runner demolishes lost boy Othello in an apartment where he will immediately give more wishes. Willing to have her own wishes fulfilled, Karva's boy has been kidnapped. But he's not sure what really matters to him. Is it again a child's innocence or is it another hand job? Either way, I don't want to see a little boy give him a second time. The end is trying to be shocking, but since there is almost no background investment in these notes, it is just to release the eternal audience. <br /> <br /> Writer Tony Grison, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, is trying to mix into some kind of religious allegory that ironically reaches everyone like hell. If he gave us something more accessible or at least better explanations that the characters suddenly act strange, it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we introduce us to a number of tedious loudmouthe who seem strange to feel the mysterious boy facing intelligence. Who is from has never appeared. It's just irritating! <br /> <br /> Apart from the occasional moments of films and the desperate score, this film has little to suggest.
