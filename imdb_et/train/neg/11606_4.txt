Enough stylish picture with some stylish design, but little budget stops things. <br /> <br /> I also have the impression that they are trying to shock you with some graphic weirdo pervi websites. <br /> <br /> If you like anime especially in things like cyber city and AD police, it may be on your street. <br /> <br /> But in principle the cash in this low-budget matrix is ​​not exactly your style. <br /> Great soundtrack by famous celebrities of some grunge / punk / post-grunge ensembles. It's worth checking out just for the soundtrack.
