Yes, there are great performances here. Unfortunately, this happens in the context of the film, which doesn't seem to be a clue what it does. In the first 45-60 minutes, all music will be realistic. Suddenly, about an hour after those points that always talked to each other, they start singing with each other. For further blending, a little further, away, they do not actually make about a 15-minute conversation dialog, it seems that this idea goes down and moves on with other things, such as a number that starts with a jazz club drummer and two electric guitars that suddenly become a full orchestral piece, having a huge invisible string. In addition to the contradiction in the use of music, there is a clear inability of the composers to actually write music in the style allegedly portrayed. Although the first few pieces mimic the Motown sound of the 1950s, the rest of the movie is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there are groups of pure stupidity who imitate the bad Jackson family and the Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown for Lionel Richie. When he started to steer Stevie Wonder, I couldn't laugh out loud. It was clearly one of those films that made me appreciate how little time I had on the ground and frustrated that I spent two hours watching this movie.
