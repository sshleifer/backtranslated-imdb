and rent a good horror movie. It's like a writer had never seen a horror film and didn't think that every thing he wrote was cliché and hackneyed and is shown perfectly in movies like "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> The BANAL and BORING dialogs are the most frightening bits ever written. Stupid "we go away" to junk. I wanted to hit my ears. Frankly, The Hills is a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There was no need for this movie. The leading lady is uninteresting and thought "He? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All characters act in a stupid way, including the police. (Cover in 2 teams! Front and back! One sleepy policeman who sits in a car with a roll in the car, waited for his throat to be cut.) <br /> <br /> The serum killer just swears to kill anyone he wants without the least problem. There is no resistance against the victims (or doors). No one has any protection or the least idea of ​​how to fight back (or lock the belt in a hotel room). People are like sheep with mental disabilities. <br /> <br /> If you're a gore fan, you're also disappointed. All killings are kept off the screen and are - tastefully made. (So ​​boo hoo you!) <br /> <br /> No killing is the least interesting. Most of the time, when we found it, has already happened. <br /> <br /> The only customer lost was a cat that always appears in such movies. "Oh kitty! You frightened me! I thought you were a killer - YOU!" <br /> <br /> And then, when it's time to kill the killer - well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> Audience and return to the screen. It was too stupid to believe and not quite scary. Don't encourage such a lazy movie. (Oh, and by the way - it's not a king or queen crowning. No tiara. No belt.) <Br /> <br /> So save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (any of them) to scare some of the original twists.
