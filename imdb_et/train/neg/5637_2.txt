I understand that I want to make a movie that is nervous and different. I understand that the previous reviewer commented that it was an unknown film. My thing is as soon as this movie finished my first comment: "It happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ..... she uses her father's money to make the movie she wrote and pays. .... probably close to the movie to realize that there was no character and no direction like the beginning, the middle and the end ...... The voyeur part was good and sharp but what was? I saw women go into the house, find some pictures, screw the caretaker, come out in the cold cold night (not believable) to check the noise and run over her caretaker lover .... the movie ends ..... one teaches my ignorant arssi? I really want to know what the point is .... what was the vision of the directors ..... why isn't the development of a dead mistress? Why is there no caregiver's background? What is a Night Vision Point? What is lipstick on the car? Why a dead caregiver? Why tell us escaped mental patient / peeping tom? What is urn? Oh and the lamp is what it takes to have a house? Territorial? Why? Why should a janitor feel that it is his house? this aspect was never followed ...... like William Defoe ... I rented this movie because he was in it and familiar with sharp signs ..... write back and tell me what I need to learn. ..I am just a mother in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
