I saw it in 1994 when it was finally released. Apparently, because Orion's images were bankrupt, it doesn't look like a movie a few years earlier. I remember this very boring film. I discussed whether to go out of it. The store was not interesting or interesting at all. It was the third speed of American Graffiti imitation. None of the performances deserve this. One of the biggest disappointments, as the local newspaper reviewer gave him a high rating.
