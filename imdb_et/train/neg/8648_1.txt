Basically, the movie blows! This is Blair's witch, who meets Sean Penn with ill-conceived imagination to go to Iraq to show the world what "war on terrorism" really is. The script sounds like it was written by the 8th grade (no eighth grade offender); the two main participants made the whole film; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (not that I knew about such things - but it just didn't seem like real documentaries I watched) and the worst Christian Johnson took the great idea and made it suck. It reminded me of a time when I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and really ended up with a bad face that saw a thing that seemed like a giant swarm. I'd rather look at Blair's witch VIII when I sit it again.
