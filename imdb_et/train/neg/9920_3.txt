I love Clash music and I love the music of Joe Strummer and Mescaleros. I went to this movie, hoping to find out behind this man. But I came out of the theater because he didn't know much more about Joe than I was after reading Wikipedia's title. The film will never be made by a person, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was collect the little material they had, trembling blurry videos, and interviewed some people from Joe Strummer in the camp fire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or no, and that the director just wanted them in the movie to get more celebrities: "Oh, he was an inspiration for us all". Like Bono or Johnny Depp (from whom they asked for their pirate costume to benefit from his current progress in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems the director couldn't even wait until the body was cold before he jumped to sell his version of "the biggest punk rocker and hippie heart" that once lived, celebrating the person without actually knowing enough. <Br>> <br /> Of course, as a fan, I felt like I was seeing the band's pictures, listening to the anecdotes behind the songs, but finally I felt that what left Joe Strumer's portrait at the age of 90 -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go watch the movie if you are a fan, otherwise you might want to listen to some Clash music or even better unknown unknown Mescaler, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his music development before his death, all his wealthy influencing one amazing sound .
