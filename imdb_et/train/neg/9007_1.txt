This movie is one of the worst things I've ever seen. While watching this movie, I literally got a sharp pain. CGI was terrible and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was something like a Super-Intuitive-I-can-figur-out, except he didn't seem to have worked his helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was shared screen camera work. I felt like I was looking at Brady Bunch or something, but it wasn't a different person in the boxes, just closed and different views of the same thing. I can only guess that the actors really need money because this movie was not a worthy film he had shot.
