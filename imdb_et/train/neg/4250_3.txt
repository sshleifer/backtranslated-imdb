It's like other Dracula films always, Drakula leaders always on the side of Dracula, which is the end of disappointment. Regardless of whether a person wants to be a vampire or not, I would like to see the first film a fighter fights against his master. This is much more interesting (because you can almost predict how the story goes) than just a priest or D. win the game (we need some surprising plots!).
