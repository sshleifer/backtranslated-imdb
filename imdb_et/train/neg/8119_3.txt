First, there was nothing in this movie that really grabbed me. It wasn't a bad movie, but another movie where I said, "Well, it wasn't special" after I saw it. There was probably a drama and stuff, but it just didn't grab me, but more semi-dimmed. As I said in the title, it was very cheap. The film's own quality (pictures) sewed like low quality and reminded me more of the cheap products made for the TV movie than the well-respected English filmmaker. The camera corners and shots were, in my opinion, very amateurs. There were really no closed frames or similar effects to create scenes of interest. I have not seen many English movies and what I have seen did not impress me more than it did, and they rebelled like camera work, colors and the like. "The Game" was trying to be cooler, more clean and smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" about where you want it), but I didn't succeed either. In general, it is just an indifferent indifferent film that was not something special (at best I am afraid) and basically unfortunately over two hours.
