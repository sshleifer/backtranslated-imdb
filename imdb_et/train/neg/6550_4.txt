I almost made myself stupid when I started this review, saying, "This film reminded me of BILLY ELLIOT," but then I looked at the continuation of the sculptor Lee Hall to find out he was the man who wrote BILLY ELLIOT so is Mr. Hall, who makes himself a fool, not me. <br /> <br /> Is I a little cruel to him? No, because Lee has something that most of the other UK-based scriptwriters do not have - he has a leg in the door, he has previously written a successful British film that won prizes and made money in the office and what did he do next? He gives the audience as much <br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Spud lives in some kitchen sinks. She is bullied at school and no one loves her. The only thing that keeps her is that she wants to be a ballet dancer. In fact, he is not an angel, but considering his household, he can also be a ballet dancer. He has his father's macho fighter who thinks "ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs when his grandfather says," Ballet dancers are just as tough as any person you could meet. "I remember seeing Bolshoi ballet ..." Yup Ballet is the main talked about British council estate these days - NO. Don't think of this or the left-wing politics that seems to be the only one to keep the middle class good people living in good houses, so immediately all of this structure seems ridiculously wrong <br /> <br /> Another big criticism is that it is a movie that has no a clue to whom it likes. criticized Channel 4 for sending movies at a totally inappropriate time (LAND, WHEN TIME IS AT 6:00 AM), but they showed it at 2 o'clock in the morning and when they arrive there is a story related to the ballet dance (Gawd I hate) this) lung cancer and poverty is not what it can be considered to be suitable for the family, but because the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and has angels and ballet dancers (don't blame me if I seem to be obsessed with this subject) - there was no need to) also here there are not many intelligent adult audiences. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Lee Hall told the producers at the script development stage that he should write a story with a schoolboy and an angel, and he had firmly refused to say he wanted to write about other topics and then I apologize. but throughout the movie you will feel that after the movie is finished, the same audience will be marketed who enjoyed BILLY ELLIOT
