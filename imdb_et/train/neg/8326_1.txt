This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> Plot (which there is little): young billionaire, Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen) with a bad heart desperately needs a transplant. Clay has been secret to his mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. At night, when these two get married, it just happens that the same rare blood type heart donor is found. Go and draw its odds! Clay discovers from the operating table that anesthesia is not working, and he knows everything and hears everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay is probably capable of filtering the razor sharp scalpel cutting pain to open his chest, focusing just on his memories of Samantha, which is told that he is doing a tedious voice that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> certainly start when you see surgical scenes. How could a young billionaire accept a heart transplant by one surgeon, one nurse, a caring doctor, and a drunk anesthetist? There were more people in the room than my wisdom tooth rose. Not to mention the medical behavior that is too stubborn to take it seriously, the operating room is not even sterile ... people are virtually able to just go inside and out of the room without even being washed. During the operation, the viewer hears Clay's thoughts, none of which is too exciting. Ah ... but here's what it all is ... the doctors are trying to kill him. Believing he is unconscious, the villain freely speaks. Gosh! What happens? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there hasn't been anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has received four infringement proceedings against him is carrying out a major heart operation. Even Clay's defensive mother seems to be able to control her status. The only one who is interested in upgrading is Samantha ... but oh no ... a sweet Sam could be in it .... You can quickly find out through some dialogue with Scooby Doo ... <br /> <br /> it is important whether Clay underwent anesthesia because the end would have been the same in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can't ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make patients who are victims of anesthesia consciousness, maybe there are some funny jokes ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
