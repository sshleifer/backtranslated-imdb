I didn't know if I would laugh or cry. Only depend on the fans of Dan filth would have the taste. It should be a horror movie, but it only has a dirty movie. The coolest scene is a car accident with real special effects from Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. Look at it just for the research how bad the movie is ................
