Although this trip certainly does not correspond to its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, just after putting the waste in the city block with his "Videodisc Cannon", we see Nimoy's face. Like one teardrop with his left eye, we know that Nimoy is more than just killing. The viewer can't get into his emotional confusion, but we realize his only flat effect was the façade. Absolute shine !!! Sex scenes have a nice balance, carnal but not pornographic. Later I felt that I had a pretty good idea of ​​how to use the Magnavision Videodisc Player. Too bad that they haven't been producing them for more than 25 years.
