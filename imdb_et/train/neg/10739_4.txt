Iedereen Beroemd has everything we expect right from the video. This is the story of a man who believes his daughter may be a star. The only thing he needs is to get him on the stage surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he must rob and do some extortion. The film's problem is not the main picture, but the way it is done. Everything should be funny, but it's not. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are low and the final sequence is completely without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel laughing, but only how pathetic the whole setting is.
