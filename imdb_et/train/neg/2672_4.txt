I can't say I'm all experienced in the mundae flick, having seen only a handful, but it is obvious that it was made on the shoe, and though it could have been honorable that the filmmakers could make a Tomb Rider - Keep it inside the garage , it is not because it is quite clear that this is what they did. The film only lasts forty-five minutes, and that's definitely a good thing, because there's not enough plot here to extend it. It has something to do with the evil Nazi scholar (who sees about the same evil as the porn star is playing a Nazi scholar), the mummy, which is obviously in the toilet roll and Mistyis - this movie is a version of Tomb Rider who keeps his head much less time than Angelina Jolie's big budget line. I must say that, even in spite of its shortcomings, this film would have been better. It got Misty Mundae from the beginning, and even better than when you ask me, it also marks the hottest Darian Cain. The couple can participate in all lesbian sex that you would expect from a Seduction Cinema film, and it is non-existent at the expense of the plot, although it is not really bad. Obviously, this is a garbage film - but the fact that it's short is a credit for it, and if you do a little lesbian sex then you could do it worse.
