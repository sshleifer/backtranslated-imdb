Frankly, I barely get a milestone of cinematic incompetence in writing my time - life is just too short. I say that in the dark alone, only three things will succeed: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. You can throw several useless plots into the air, but they all fall. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. It disgraces the completely classic computer game that it is supposed to be based on, as it is a complete making in all aspects of film making. <br /> <br /> Doctor Boll, if this is really what you are (I mean proctology here), what does Earth do with the director?
