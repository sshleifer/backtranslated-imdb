Usually I have a lot of time to write my comments, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent one hour registering with IMDb to get it out of my chest. <br /> <br /> You would think a movie whose names are like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a contributing bet ... this movie was just terrible. It is almost impossible to "stop disbelief"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just doesn't let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stay on the music, which is a terrible performance - NO presence as an actor, NO characters. Justin cannot be blamed: the film also has a terrible plot and poorly timed editing; this is definitely "F". <br /> <br /> After I see it, I have to think about what motivates the participants. I mean, Morgan actually read the script before taking part. Didn't he see how poor it was? What could you motivate her? Money? Of course, acting is sometimes more about what you see as developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets a lot more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles with poor script. In the meantime, the audience goes, "What the hell is going on here? You expect me to believe this mess?" <br /> <br /> In short, except for Justin's big line, it is badly destructive.
