I downloaded yesterday a website of good quality! I watched the film with great expectations (though I knew it was a flop), especially when the film was superstar Amitabh Bachchan, who was playing the attack. Although at least such actors as he would have made his roles worth. Unfortunately, Mr Bachchan was not impressed by how scary it was to prove that no one could compete with AMJAD KHAN's magical Rgv trial to restore the past royally! Sholay, the old is a milestone in Indian cinema, with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that has still hit the current generations. A good actor like Ajay Devgan's Talents is wasted and his power is average.Prashant Raj, the newcomer does not know what works. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actors we don't know how she is still in the RGV team, Urmila & Abhishek has seen a song that has no excitement and the passion Mohanlal tried her best and Susmitha Seni's work was a good job in this movie was the complete killings of the original Sholay
