I'm sorry that this movie didn't scare me, it just irritated me. It was just as depressing as I saw the potential and it all fell on the road. Children! Father! Imagination! There was so much potential and ziltch! null, nada! I've heard it all before. Scary! No! I can scare myself alone, where I sit, as in the movie. Are there people who write that women should be so annoying? Ah? This film was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been whether the director / writer had trouble doing this job. We could have had good music that would have added tension if someone had done it. What do I really want to know about why they get money? Just give it to me and save all this effort. Abandoned? ... No, we betrayed
