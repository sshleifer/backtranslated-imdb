Even if you subscribe to this movie's knee-jerk free trade policy, it's still the tired note that is played again and again. Clink clink.

She has a pretty woman, I have to admit, but it could be more tons to save the movie's terrible rescue. Endless bus rides are the worst part - show progress - can you think the color line is moving on the map. Aww, you thought. Well, this is a chance to be short. Is this the only good thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yes, be afraid so.
