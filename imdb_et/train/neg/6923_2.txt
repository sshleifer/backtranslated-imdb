An absolutely terrible Mexican film, allegedly based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story about a news publisher who wants to hide in the woods to write a story about how it works, and so on. When our hero Gaston is the chief of asylum dr. At Maillard's big show, we see all sorts of things that are thought to be terrible, such as men who are imprisoned in a prison cell, and a comedian, like our hero joking about soldiers, climbs the ladder hanging on the ladder. Then there is one vision that could have been both: a man dressed in chicken, yes, it is the right chicken that tends to be around the chicken feed. The scene was supposed to be a comic highlight of the film, but at least for me it was a low point of the movie and really the most disgusting when you thought that grown men and women thought it might even be far-sighted. Ah! This is the real horror that Dr. Tarr and his name change legion are. And this brings me to the fact that the film, which is the majority of movies that go through several headline changes, is usually a serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems, and others, one of them, have a lot of headline changes, so someone could buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely a garbage. That's very little. The only speaker to watch is Claudio Brook, head of asylum. He is one huge ham because he laughs manicly, relaxes commands, rebels in the sword and commends the chicken. I got so tired that I heard him from a "soothing system" when he was treating his mentally ill. What a number of ludicroos (Hey, such a script-like movie deserves such a word). It does not take long to find out what is happening in the shelter and whether it is no longer interesting. Kinematic Chicken Scratch!
