Romance without feeling drama issues without a point (or drama) .... This movie should be all of them and will fail for every account as if it is not trying. Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter team hasn't really tried. Participants are able - they need better support. <br /> <br /> One element that fails is George Delarue's score. Beautiful and moving. Which shame is attached to this movie. Synchronize and maximize the impact of the words and movements of the film actors and the music. This editor plastered music with a view to dialogue and movement. The scene of love in this respect is particularly grate: the talents of leading parties are offensive. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the movie that works: location photography. Noteworthy moment at Grand Central Station. I thought in advance what would happen; but how it was filmed in this environment was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Some comments from this board have pointed out that the assimilation of US Nazi scholars was actually taking place during their years of intimidation of MacCarthy. At the moment when the film seems to start looking at American society seriously, it becomes a normal romance; before any person can move us, it is away from the (predictable) withdrawal of the thriller. accept. <br /> <br /> You will be warned.
