Prom Night is about a girl called Donna (Brittany Snow), hiding from a psychologist killer trying to kill her at night. And by doing this, his family, friends and his enemies are killed. <br /> <br /> Now, before I start, I'm saying you've been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scared lately. Are you tired of the foolish girls' dialogue "Oh my God" and talking about men's things. And are you really tired of the girls in the relationship and then cry. And the last thing if you're tired of reviving US, Japanese and Chinese films from the US. It comes a lot at Prom, but I've still not reviewed it. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "Prom night" is to laugh. If not, don't see Prom. You never see that killing only hears screaming and you see on the blood wall. And how do deaths recur like 24/7. So not only are they frightening, but it is unpleasant. By the time I was cast, I thought I was ready. Too many girls to talk about, too much guy to talk to and lots of â€œOh my gosh. It's our prom. I understand it is fun, but seriously it is too much to ask not to focus. <br /> <br /> When I put Prom Night on the list of the worst films of 2008 without seeing other movies that would be the first. I'm not going to be surprised if it is published on the DVD for cheap and fast. Do not spend your money or time seriously to watch the movie from dull, cheap fears and "die at night". <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS If I could give the film the null stars I would like).
