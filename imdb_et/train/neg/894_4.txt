Just saw it yesterday at Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Immediately before I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, pretty nice ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I died out (never did), but I felt they did that because the film producer was screening. <br /> <br /> I didn't like at all, dialogs are low and don't go anywhere, characters are lower than dialogs, nothing to drive anywhere, and worst and worst: lots of Siemens and Organics in the ad movie. Regardless of the fact that I already paid for going to the movie and for entertainment, I have to bombard the internet spectator in a conversation and all the time with the opening of my Siemens mobile phone on my laptop; or any other bath that has a bath or cutting her hair just to make Organics shampoo on the screen immensely displayed! All of this would be acceptable if the plot, characters, novels, something is good, but was bad, really bad! "Don't know how to do it" sex-in-the-city. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money.
