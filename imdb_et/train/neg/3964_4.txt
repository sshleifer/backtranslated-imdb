The whole hypothesis of this film was openly what I mean. And while it is a bit slow from time to time, 90% of the movie is pretty good, more than a few "old time" fears that make one amazing and unresolved. I thought cinematography was great for many of these scenes. While Dark Remains fails, it is at its peak. The ending and striking of the film is what seems to be MILES APART from her body. The story is a totally illogical conclusion and his answer collides, and the answer I was most looking for - what really happened to Emma? - It wasn't explained! The idea of ​​negative energy was, at best, ridiculous and finally I felt very disappointed. What might have been a great horror movie was finally refuted by the terrible end.
