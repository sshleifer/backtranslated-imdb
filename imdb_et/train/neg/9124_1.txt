It may not be the worst movie Peter Sellers ever did (I think the laurel goes to "Zenda prisoner"), but it is certainly the most depressing. Sellers, especially sans makeup Nayland Smith, see that he has just undergone chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, he hardly sees the better and spends most of the movie (except for those strangely annoying scenes where he gets caught) on the verge of collapse all over this makeup. Supporting players also see tired and running, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (One bright spot: this would be one of the last time a big movie filmed the Asians so insultingly ... or that's why non-Asia celebrates one!). The film looks surprisingly cheap, soupy with photography and drab-kits - even at the end-bang Elvis number looks like a cut rate. Only the amazing Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous guy who wears their pants adds sparkle to life to this sad thing. All in all, this film gives a shameful picture of the great death of the comic and even the deadly documentation of his death.
