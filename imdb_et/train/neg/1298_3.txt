Sogo Ishii may be a qualified filmmaker in the right conditions, but Gojoe talks of a warrior monk and his only rival, the Genji clan. The film has the main features of low budget production, including blurry combat scenes and clumsy assemblies (such as those you can find in the under-producing morale). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his fate lies in defeating the mysterious spirit of the Gojo Bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will bring him to conflict with almost every element of society at that time - but that could serve him enlightenment. However, there is no lack of ambition in depicting the conflict between holy and earth. Artsy blooms in some photography and editing helps to compensate for the relaxed film making style. <br /> <br /> Fraud.
