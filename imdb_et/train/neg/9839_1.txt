The beginning of this movie was good. After he told the people he wanted to kill, it really started to fool. I think if I came from such small cities, I would be offended after watching the movie. They made many of these people feel stupid and crazy. How can these people do so little that they watch him all day. Many times, when these people told him how to kill himself, as they called him to do it. How can so many people respect little other people? I also think they could have done much better for this movie. There were also good parts to this movie. Some people might like it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
