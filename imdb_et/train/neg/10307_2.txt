This "math" aspect is just a trick to try to put millions of other police events on top of the TV show. The only redeeming aspect of this exhibition is Rob Morrow, although his career must be after the fall of the Northern Exposition (un-earned) when he signed up for this scheme. <br /> <br /> "Math" lacked to show is encapsulated in one episode of co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which just confirms that this show is the last shelter for damned.) In order to try to escape, "mathematician" uses some theory "bubbles". So, he gives this long explanation that when we have seen suspects in A, B and C, we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where he could be. He does it all on the board or maybe with dirt in the dirt (I can't remember). <br /> <br /> When you look at finished products, he basically took three stars and chose the right in the middle and said, "Ok, mathematically, here's where we most likely find a refugee." At this point, another sign "Oh, this thing also happens to be the cabin where the man lived." Is this math? It's not even-f ** k ** g-points! This exhibition reminds me of the mathematics I used in banking, having a mathematical analysis that he could do to support points that everyone had already agreed through less complex analysis or common sense. > <br /> It's just a show - if you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can't wait for them to stay in the NUMB3RS team at OSAMA ... They use the calculator, call the air strike in the middle of the mountains and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... cuz hey ... its all in numbers . <br /> <br /> Totally ridiculous TV show.
