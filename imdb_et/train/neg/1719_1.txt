Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most terrible, amateur-like movies I've ever seen - there are Manos hands that are the values ​​of bad behavior, useless direction, and kindergarten output. In this film, a silly look / stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hit the lake in Bumblebum (CA) and starts eating on local grasslands. At an exciting peak, a creature called by one local "giant alder", it pulls terribly loose to the ground to chase his future lunches before the bulldozer falls a few times and dies of boredom. Every character in this moov is a complete moor. One pointless sub-block indicates that the hero goes to the liquor store to buy $ 4.75 pepper Ripple; Instead of just buying a bottle, the idiot captures the cashier and the other bystander, lets the cops, goes to the lake, everything so that the monster can eat. Lucky monster close-ups show that it is nothing more than a polystyrene foam. There's a fake player struggling with a counterfeit British accent (to make him feel more legitimate), two over-worshiping boaters, some cheeses' prehistoric cave art made in a crayon, and the annoying banjo-pickin background moosic. In one painful scene, the fake and his ridiculous wife / girlfriend / companion can make the movie extra 4 minutes, adding to how the stars can be seen in the sky at night, even though it is clearly daytime. Even in the event of constant acceleration, this jam and pain hurt. MooCow says to invite fumigators because this cow pie really smells! : 8P
