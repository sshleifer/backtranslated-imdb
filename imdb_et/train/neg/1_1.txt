Robert DeNiro is playing the most incredibly intelligent illiterate all the time. This film is so wasteful for talents, it's really nasty. The script is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature, not funny. The film is moving at a snail's pace, photographed in a poorly recommended way and inconveniently preaching. It also connects each clich√© of the book. Swoozie Kurtz has a great role as a supporter, but what then? <br /> <br /> Similarly, this new IMDB rule, which requires ten lines for each review, is annoying. If the film is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text so other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
