It was really terrible! It was a terrible story, it was badly acted and was like an evil dead but not nearly as good as an amateur remake. <br /> <br /> It was all about doing this, it's a good job not to have a toilet, I doubt I'd come back! This makes the Hammer House of Horror look like a big screen in the Hollywood epic. <br /> <br /> The only value for this film was the endless offer of beautiful women. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to drop your friends with the beer after the evening, it's for you ... otherwise avoid it like a plague!
