This is the worst show. Buntch grown up acts like kids don't humor anything. Even on Sesame Street, there is better humor and more adults than friends "Friends" can be the worst thing I've seen on television and I've been sitting on tube tracking. Friends are just watching "don't change well for others, modern ones. It lacks the intelligence of" Seinfeld "and the wonderful expression of" Frasier. "The characters of" Friends "seem to be designed to make them repulsive. <br /> <br /> The Unintelligent show is completely without any edge whose characters are cartoons and writing is sophomore - though intentionally. writers may need their abilities to achieve lower goals so as not to confuse loyal friends of friends.)
