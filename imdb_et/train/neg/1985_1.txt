costumes, dialogue, historical accuracy are terrible. For example - Stacey Dash and hanging scenes. The heart was accurate (as I can say), but this type of noise cut off the human neck. Ms. Dash is left to hang at the end of the rope without being caught. This type of man has not strangled, he killed them at the end of the fall. <br /> <br /> And just before they rob the bank (upside down), they stop on the street hugging the group - with their ensembles that hide their face - what would have been obvious to people on the street. "long ride" shows them driving, then turns the movie around. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they kept the scene by taking a horse - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was nonsense.
