I think "Gunslinger" was not quite as pious as most of the movies the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" is showing, but the West is not just Roger Corman's forte. The portrayal of Beverly Garland in the old western city as a sheriff after the murder of her sheriff husband and the fight against the bad is quite predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new hubby, working with secret Allison Hayes (yes, 50-foot wife). Corman's star star Dick Miller, who is a postman (Miller's stars in Joe Dante's films), also appears shortly. Really enjoy this movie. They had a good time with it.
