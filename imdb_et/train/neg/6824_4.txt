After watching Koyaanisqats two or three dozen times and love every second, I finally had the chance to see the sequel "Transformation of Life". I was really disappointed because it didn't match almost the first high. 90 minutes of people with baskets in their heads is not my good movie idea. Philip Glass's score on it was neither first-rate nor correlated. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this film seemed slow and meaningless. The diluted version of Baraka, which is the same idea, but better. I really hope that the third film in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
