This movie is travesty and does not fit with the company's higher original. The plot is absolute confusion and the film is too long. Each time they fight, they desperately inject a sentimental reminder of the first movie. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the best British movies of all time, it's terrible.
