I am delighted with films that fill the gaps in the world cinema. So after looking at the "Water Lilies" trailer, I thought I liked this movie because I thought I had something unique: a movie that honestly represents teenage lesbian love - a sort of "Beautiful Thing" female version. The main characters are 15-year-old French women. Marie is slender, stubborn and pretty clever; Floriane is outgoing, sporty and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, dirty and behaviorally immature. The erotic relationship between Marie and Floriane is always in this film, if not on the surface, just under it. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies" does not mean weaving lesbian love for two teenagers; it concerns sexual frustration, suffering, pretense, teenagers working across borders, and - at least in two cases - joy, mechanical sex. It also proves that scriptwriters and filmmakers make their creations too manipulative. <br /> <br /> On the DVD disc "Lord's Fool" in the extra functions, director Peter Brook says, "French cynicism begins with sex anxiety," it means that the French consider children as angels when they hold adolescents and adults with common cynicism. Part of the film's collapse is filmmaker Celine Sciamma, who has given this cynicism a great deal of power. <br /> <br /> "Where's the joy?" Looking at this movie, I asked myself. Yes, the first love can be painful and depressing, but it can also be a cheerful and victoriously erotic fresh, life-giving way. These positive aspects are missing from this film; there is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this film wants to be the first love. But Sciamma is too nice of her own cynicism and wit and destroys the film. First, what's the point of showing only a chubby girl? I know that the European cinema has a tradition of tastefully earned nudity, as demonstrated by films like "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, apparently; Little Thief, Heart of the Heart; Friends; Beau Family" and "Europe, Europe"; but this example is a small authorial invasion - "Look, audience, I can make a movie where I only show a nasty person." Whether nudity or evenly distributed nudity would have been an honest way to go. <br /> <br /> The club has a scene where Floriane and Marie are dancing. Next is not only Floriane, who cynically manipulates Marie; it is the filmmaker Sciamma who manipulates his audience cynically. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty is when Floriane warns Marie that she wants something that is "not normal". Marie understandably asks, "Who cares about normality?" Then Sciamma plays with her audience a false and hurting film, because Floriane's application is a false, derived and substitute question - not an authentic, cordial question about the film, Marie's character and viewers who have invested their time. <br /> <br /> There are also two moments that lie wrong with the viewer's nerves: 1) When do the French - all people - take a bath with a swimsuit and a turtle? 2) What kind of teenager - any nationality - would bring down the crumbled apple crust to get a loved mouth taste? <br /> <br /> The three main actors are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents, they can get great actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actor in techniques and can have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) can become a leading woman or a bomb or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has the intensity and magnetism that is unmistakable. In the future, he could play everything from an emotionally overwhelmed librarian to a mysterious sensual seductress who disapproves of a meteoric rise. <br /> <br /> All in all, "waterfowl" was very disappointing. Is an honest filmmaker making an authentic movie about two love women! No - not necessarily in the interests of this middle-aged boy - but so young lesbians can have something of high quality that they can watch and identify. And yes, to meet the theme load in the world cinema.
