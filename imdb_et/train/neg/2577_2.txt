This story was interesting for me to buy a previously viewed VHS vision. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> What could have been a very nice story - badly spoiled people and their different personalities - quickly turned to a very profitable soap opera with unlikely characters. <Br> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe) stereotypical racist white person who says f-word for every second sentence and is so despicable that they didn't give him the first name in the movie. He's having fun. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast-talking woman. The snipers had to like those fast-paced "hip" arrogant roles because he played in many of them, such as "White Men Can't Jump". Then there is Helen Hunt, who plays "Anna" this wonderful caring, loving person, who is in the adorable "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a warm, good-hearted stuff for the heart. It just changes my heart to melt these nice people. But if you are one of those who love sliding people, this buggy movie is really nice! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness and there you go! What else could one want?
