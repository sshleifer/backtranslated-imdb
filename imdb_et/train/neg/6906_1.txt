Not only is this film a bad plot, a bad direction and terrible action, but it opens a whole new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this movie, "White" chicks sluts, "White" guys are wana-be gangsters and successful (yes again) "White" businessmen are despicable toilet shitters. <br /> <br /> I just don't know what would happen if I made exactly the same story and script for the same movie, but I did it with Caucasians. "He dude, it's good to finally see that you've finished sending those black chicks". <br /> <br /> Nobody sees it, but watches this movie again and vomit the way they have shown New Zealand's "White Boys". Maybe his white people, who are the main cause of gang aggression, and whores are fast. Only the Samoan girls have a heart, there's no such thing as a non-blazing white girl. <br /> <br /> It is disgusting that they could not make this film without reluctant to the New Zealand Caucasian community. If you think I'm general, check out this movie and see what you are preparing for "white boys". Just because samoans choose us "white boys" in real life, it doesn't mean that funny. If I said hey black boy, I lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Don't waste your money. Don't be racist.
