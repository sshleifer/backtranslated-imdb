In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; And the movie called Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened this year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. There is another president in the United States, there is another pope, new Korean nuclear ... and film Into the Blue 2: Reef that is better than the original ... but it's the same that says "getting your fingers cut is better when your head cut ". This sequel is a really bad film that kept me enormously boring and interested. For Into Blue 2: Reef is made up of TV series actors who have absolutely no credibility and dramatic weight, but who are fit to show their body. Marsha Tomason (lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollows and boredom. I liked some of the earlier films directed by Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's great adventure specially), but he can't even create minimal tension, emotion or entertainment on this film. The characters in this film are not only badly executed, but are also reluctant. The cinematic art of this film is also flat and it seems to have been done by a technical team who makes advertising spots for Hawaii hotels. Blue 2: Reef is a terrible movie that is better than the original movie, but it's the same as I said earlier.
