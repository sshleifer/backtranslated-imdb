I'm not usually slipping a movie. I try to see good points and not focus on bad ones, but in this case there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you want to do something bad, why? Part of the film takes Anne's face pictures as she breathes deeply, and the violin music plays in the background. the second part is filled with bad and wood. Rupert Penry Jones is inexpressible. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern ways. Anne is foolish and suicidal, which is good at first, but she will remain the same throughout the film and you will not see why Captain Wentworth falls in love with him. In general, during the production period, there is no feeling, too many mistakes, which must be ignored, such as escaping from the concert, kissing on the street, unlit streets (why was this scene in the film at all?) The scene was one of the most romantic scenes.). All in all, terrible movie, very disappointing.
