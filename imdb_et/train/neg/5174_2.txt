This movie was so bad that I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I had great hopes for Horrorfest this year, which was also the first year I participated in the Horrorfest, and I have to say that Horrorfest and all its films take the wrong advertising to a whole new level. Snake celebrity advertisers, because I'm sure they'll hit a lot of people spending money and watching these movies. The Hamiltones were easily the worst of those I have seen (others I saw were Unrest, Dark Ride and Reincarnation). The film cover and trailer showed that this seems to be a cannibal family that terrorizes the neighborhood, which I thought was a rather interesting plot, but disappointed finally when I discovered that it was a "age" story about the boy's transition from vampire. That's why drama reigns in this movie in the sense of any horror. And in order to make the plot even more ridiculous, they add to the horny twins, who can't wait to take a "bite" from one another and a deadly creature locked in the basement, which if I had discovered what it was "If there was no secret at the end of the movie, I'd be Quit halfway out of the theater. <br /> <br /> The complete waste of time and money. that two years later I have to return to IMDb and write about it because it is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my memory, and if you read it, beware of other horror movies in the future. what you could do is rent them out of blockbusters or watch it somewhere online. The horror movie has movies from independent filmmakers who can't do it they put on a big screen, and all the jokes about "things they don't show in theaters," they didn't refer to blood or guts or horror ... they referred to the movies themselves. Because they are terrible. Think of the Horrorfest as a lesser known version of the Sundance Film Festival, but horror movies. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "hate", but the next time you think about cheating money for your money.
