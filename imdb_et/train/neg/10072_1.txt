Unfortunately, I made a mistake and I paid in the cinema 7 euros to watch this low pointless movie. My points: <br /> <br /> The film is based on two things: <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic Viewpoint: As with most American films, the writer considers himself an expert after 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But, unfortunately, not enough. Knowing two names of Kunefe and other foods does not make people understand the culture. For example, shaving is a sign of pure life in Asia, but everyone was trying to stop the girl. The Lebanese people are a Christian (Ok they got it) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches differ from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not do ethnocentrism. So we don't understand people after the first question about our life, as the father's figure did in the movie. 2) Girls' Sexual Revolution: Nothing to say about it. Show me 10 girls who had them during the sexual awakening when I say I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers promote the movie with black humor. Please see Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. Black humor must reflect the truth and focus on the funny parts of the audience. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film.
