Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) receives a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - dead drunk) and arrives at Myra (Raquel Welch). He then decides to destroy the male masculinity (or something like that) and continues to teach the film history at the actress college led by Lecherous John Huston (don't ask) and break the young young happy couple (young, beautiful, hunky Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes THE Farrah Fawcett ). <br /> <br /> They took Gore Vidal's great novel that was unclear and tried to film it naturally. They also hired an English man with a decisive anti-American attitude, and hired a number of actors with questionable "talent" (Welch, Reed) and disgruntled old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West). all together and .... SURPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie got its X rating when released (it's lowered to R), mainly due to a truly tasteless scene where Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and the scene where Welch tries to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The film is very sprawling ... scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all, but I was never bored. <br /> <br /> The action varies ... Reed is terrible ... very sad. Huston looks over the landscape again and again. Welch is not really bad as Myra, but his lines don't make sense that you don't know what to do about him. The West is barely in the movie (blessing) and it's really sick to hear a woman who is almost 80 years old and having sex with sex jokes. Roger Herren (what happened ...) was very young, beautiful and not bad as Rusty. Fawcett is fine. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what you're saying ... you just look at it as incredible. Must See The Movie - Believe !!!!
