This inferior result based on the characters from Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant), created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer). They take a little girl named Delia from the monastery. Gene York to elect Congress and chair the Finance Commission. In the meantime, it seems that Delia is about to happen when unexplained deaths occur. It creates a metaphysical fair way, as numerology, therapy, healing, yoga, tarot stores are destroyed. Karen York hires the private sector (Michael Lerner) to explore strange and bizarre events. Delia, like Damien, seems to send a movie every few minutes that makes terrible killings. The main thrill of this is to look at what new and innocent victims can do with special special effects. What's more, the mediocre protagonist, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, though it was a nice secondary, like Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser, and recently dead Don S Davis, he was a military captain. As always, the great musical result of Jerry Goldsmith's Omen I and III is. The film is only for hardcore followers of the Oman saga. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Earlier and much better versions are: Richard Donner's immense original "Apple" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick); Don Taylor "Damien" (William Holden, Lee Grant); "Final Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: Below average.
