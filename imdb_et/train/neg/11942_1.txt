Absolutely one of the worst films I've seen for a long time! It starts badly and just worsens. Katherine Heigl is badly confused about Lolita's role and Leo Grillo is keen on the nature of cardboard cutouts. The only cast member who has the enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who grabs it as a cable and goes overboard with his role. The script is terrible, creepy, and it has enough holes to drive a two-story bus! It's also the sexiest movie I've ever seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is completely atypical. He is an evil, deliberate seductress who attracts poor, innocent married men to cheat on his wife. This is a minor for the whole movie and the fact that the accompanying letter-chain simply spurs faith! Finally, he is not able to redeem himself if he is obviously (ha!) Demented and demented, but the script allows him to kill himself by redeeming himself in the eyes of men everywhere. Terrible. Don't waste your time.
