..Oh wait! This movie is not intended for a typical film strike if you do not want to supplement your traditional cinematographic definitions, such as "consistency editing" and "geographic match". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. For one second, they're going to drive a modern SUV and next to their allegedly 70s in the next minute, wearing what seemed like an 80's style. I'm thinking. I couldn't pay attention to it long enough because the actor was just terrible. I think it just got attention because it has a 3d that I didn't look at. If you're a b-movie buff, and I mean BAD movie under the b-movie, this movie is for you. It's a home movie and all the non-sensitive styles laugh as long as you get awake. If your taste is more for Goddard and Antonion, just skip it.
