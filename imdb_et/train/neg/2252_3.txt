So I heard from some people that this movie has brought them to the tears in the theater. When I first looked at it, I waited for another romantic, teardrop Barbra Streisand movie; Something like we were. I was definitely wrong. Chemistry of the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and his John Howard, was non-existent, so it was not possible to affirm the characters. There was nothing romantic there. The character of the strike dropped for an alcoholic addict who was unable to sing any notes without wanting to move fast. At one point, his character finds himself in the bed of his wife's second wife and gives him forgiveness about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about a dead rock star and a woman who doesn't seem to understand it until she actually dies. The parts of the movie seemed to drag on, and I asked myself when it ended. <br /> <br /> John Howard's death was completely predictable. It was quite obvious that his hidden behavior was in the early stages of the film, and when he died I felt some emotion. It was not a tragic accident, it was an idiot by its nature. Not to mention the whole movie, I was confused by his terrible beard. <br /> <br /> Only the parts of the movie that are worth seeing are Streisand's songs. Stopping the movie when he sings "At a second glance / Look closer" was my reason for giving this movie 3/10. These 7 minutes were the only part of the film I felt as an emotion other than irritation and anger.
