WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you should take care of it. Also apologize for the caps.) <br /> <br /> Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that is even bolder to talk about, this mess and unnecessary drama continues. . It is badly but accurately positioned. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky business. There is a complex system with many possible malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc., and unexpected things happen in largely unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, the mistake had gone wrong. This is called learning. Apollo 11 was unconvinced by today's standards and was under enormous political pressure, but the overall performance of technology on the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Selected mistakes / comments I didn't even see: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon made a call when something went wrong. Well duh. I would have done that. After all, it was the peak of the propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA will give a green light, even though Appollo 11 is likely to blow. (But it's "only" indirect.) Yes, that's why they let people down and hit the clock almost in real time. <br /> <br /> 3) Capsule extraction does not work. Like it didn't work at the time the chimp was in it. Who survived? It was a test run and the rocket exploded, the capsule picked up and landed with the parachute. There's a video, you can find it on youtube or at least watch it somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One interviewed man says the explosion would have destroyed a fair share of Florida. I can only assume that it was meant to be a hyperbole, because if not, I just wonder how he got it wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) Technology was then primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware are used even today, as it must not collapse. It is even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be built from a relatively large component that is not susceptible to radiation. (And in any case, the handicraft must be hand-guided so that a complex management system like B2 would not be.) What is the fact that they used "television screens" rather than "computer screens"? It's the same fucking technology. In fact, television monitors were produced and produced with a much higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this item was not part of a rocket, it may be just one thing." We see where it is. In addition to the statement being wrong, who says it's not part of a rocket? At least the interviewee explains that if it is flying and you do not know what it is, it is an undefined unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) Voting and some wrong remarks make it seem as if the earthing radiation foil is actually his body. What would make it thinner than a room suit. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong's close death during a training flight is what I appreciate; I've never seen it before. As I said, any obvious technology can go wrong, especially if it has not been sufficiently tested because you know it is unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The Falling Pitch Trajectory Distortion) was never life-threatening. There was also no "fifteen seconds left on the fuel", which was actually "fifteen seconds of fuel left before the mission was interrupted and returned to the control unit". <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophic chain of events" usually causes a disaster. I really don't know how to make it easier. However, this is the best example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) One short walk is one of the astronauts who walk and slide like a ugly child, followed by a voice command telling us that the reason for this strange behavior "can now come". It turns out that he walked and jumped aimlessly like a gleeful child. Fun things. <br /> <br /> 12) It has been mentioned that all contact disappeared during the re-entry. This is a completely natural phenomenon and was well known at the same time as it is impossible to circumvent today's technology. Again, its severity is implicit but very deliberate. <br /> <br /> 13) The shuttle never disappeared in space, while the voice command proves this "fact" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a bunch of nonsense. Appollo 13 was almost gone, but two real disasters occurred during the resurrection and re-entry respectively. In any case, comparing shipments with Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just stupid. Even ignoring this, it seems that a successful shuttle mission has not been of interest to listeners. <br /> <br /> 14) What's the hell with UFO? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. If you don't think it's done for entertainment purposes that target a specific target audience (which seems to involve people who have no history, science, or rhetoric), <br /> <br /> Even the film's point is somewhat unclear. Caught sentences such as "covered so far", "first released here" come out, but the film does not blame or offer a lesson or something that could be expected from an emotionally made film. In a good old sensitizing tradition, there are many techniques and records of interviews that are often out of context or with people that we don't know anything except "NASA scientist". Oh, so the astronauts were very nervous during the quest? Fancy it. What is it about a movie point? Oh yes, what point. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is not intentionally or incorrectly inaccurate, not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a man who enjoys his horrible documentaries; this movie is not funny, witty, weird, it's nothing.
