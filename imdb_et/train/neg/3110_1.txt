I usually came to this site before going to the movie, as I like to see what other people think of the movie. I read a lot of comments saying that "the thriller is not a horror film." It prompted me to try this movie. I really have to challenge these "thriller / horror" statements because it wasn't! I went almost back to the money and asked back, and if you got a lot of evaluators to enjoy this garbage, then you just have to be happy! At the end of the movie, the people behind me said loudly, "what a waste of time," and I turned to them and said, "I couldn't get it better". I was expecting something to happen ... but it wasn't. There was a potential for many good fears (or to remember if you wanted to) but none happened. Williams did quite well with this part, but I felt that the bad script that slipped around and didn't go anywhere was short. Save your money on people, this is turkey, which is in your near future DVD store's "favorable box"!
