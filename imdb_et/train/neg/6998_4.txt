Hollywood always had difficulties with a "religious picture". Strange Cargo is no exception. The film uses excellent false talents and produces a top-notch budget where Robert Planck is a suitably moody photographer, but it doesn't lose credibility. Perhaps the reason for this is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden invasion of fantasy elements interferes with the viewer's participation in action and the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit through all of the established metaphors, parallels, and biblical references, and it was impossible to receive the enlightened Ian Hunter's cunning knowledge of everything as Christ. And in Boston, Detroit and Providence, the censors agreed with me at least. The movie was banned. Few Boston / Detroit / Providence movements, if any, complained or traveled to other cities because it was obvious on the trailer that Gable and Crawford were somehow involved in the message. It flew everywhere. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the film has revived something on television. The home atmosphere seems to make the film more susceptible to allegorical viewers. Despite the fact that its strange or unusual film has grown, the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable, highly moral traits that have no idea how the main characters will end up in fate.
