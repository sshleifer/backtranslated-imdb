Before that movie, I only saw two films by director Andrea Bianch: a comic zombie flick from Le Notti del Terrore (1981), among the fans of fear of his unforgettable male-child Peter Bark and a pleasantly slick giallo Strip Nude for your killer. Neither film was a particularly remarkable cinema, but both were entertaining in their special way (and the fact that they had a lot of gore and nudity could not hurt). The massacre, however, is boring, boring, boring, despite its rather small spatter and unusual bare flesh. <br /> <br /> The story, a series of murders in a hotel where a cast and a team live during a horror movie, is confusing and oh-so boring: if blood does not flow and the skin is not shown, the film is a real struggle to sit (this led me to four experiments) stop), whose endless scenes tend to collide and make very few comments. <br /> <br /> The only interest in the movie is that its producer Lucio Fulci used several of his death scenes to pull his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you have already seen this movie, there is very little reason to worry about the massacre.
