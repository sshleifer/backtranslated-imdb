Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted food critic whose amazing, overwhelming mother moves with her. JJ, worshiped during this event, then blackmails restaurant owner Alex, entertained by his mother in exchange for "maybe" watching his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls on her daughter when she gets warm to her mother. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are generally two-dimensional. JJ is self-serving, angry, mother superficial and low. JJ's colleagues in the press are evil and opportunistic. Over 50 women who are unable to do so independently without male help, the underlying message is bad, bad, BAD. The action is evenly boring, not validating the script. Movies that only save grace are in New York. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
