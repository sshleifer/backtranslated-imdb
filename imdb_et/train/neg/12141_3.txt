... because 99 times out of 100 people lied to their teeth (or someone else) to censor their * graciously *. <br /> <br /> The Shock-O-Rama cinema proves the truth one more time by releasing "Mass Feeding", which is probably a good intent but completely incorrect and depressing entry into the zombie genre. People, it's not just making low-budget movies, it's a very low budget filmmaker, a lot of people who - I'm sorry, I know they have families that love them - never get in the way of a variation. It's one of the baaaaaaaaat mooin 'people, not just because it's cheap. <br /> <br /> The actor is mediocre, but I don't blame the participants; they had no direction. They had no direction, because the script was a semi-baked zombie fantasy lacking real cinematic storytelling. Characterization is at best thin, due to weak dialogue and fine direction. Have I mentioned that the script and the direction are pretty flat? They are. There is no drama, tension, great moments of character, nothing. The premise of all media dismissal is destroyed by sophomorphic "business breaks" and undramatic nature, which violates rational analysis and uncomfortably captures its ridiculous finish. Syd Fields would not be happy. <br /> <br /> How could the government overcome the truth of the virulent zombie epidemic if its reality were evident everywhere? Why would they give it more than an embarrassing trial? On this day, and with the age of wireless cellular cameras, they would probably expect to be able to achieve more than one day at best? Now that they cover something like their own fault ... but "Feeding Masses" never explores such opportunities. Instead, it remains absurd and badly staged to appeal to laugh and / or importance, praying to your audience does not mean almost total lack of production value other than basic film making equipment. Did anyone pay for this movie? I hope the actors did it when only wasting their time on career-dependent alleys, as it was; At least the technicians got to rack up some legitimate work experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans find little use in "feeding masses." Gore is remarkably troublesome for its honorary budgets and has no distinctive character. They are all very forgotten. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even junk, as Aussie's "Undead" was born a mile ahead of "Feeding Masses." Sorry, guys, back to the drawing boards and take your deceptive marketing with you.
