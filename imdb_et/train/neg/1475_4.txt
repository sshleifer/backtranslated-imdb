Most of the first season episodes are terrible. There is no comparison with the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits because they actually had a decent story. Most amazing stories are well boring. Not surprisingly, .. rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard this season's 2nd season much better ... also for some reason a DVD they cut out on Ray Walston's parts, which further reduces this compilation. One cool thing is to see actors and actors when they were younger in 1985. Most of the story is quite predictable, but the series may be better with the twists that kept thinking ...
