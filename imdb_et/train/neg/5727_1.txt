I just want to start by saying it's the first movie I've done online. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it is really one of the worst films I've ever seen. After reading the interview with the director, he says that he respects constructive criticism and tries to prevent the film from being downgraded for that particular purpose and I give my opinion on why I found it so catastrophic. <br /> <br /> 1. Actors. I know that big people may not be able to budget, but Nicholson has been working in the industry for over a decade if he knew some of the participants who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly flat makeup and special effects. What's more, the budget has obviously interfered with achieving the original goal, but there is no excuse for working for so many years. <br /> <br /> 3. Obvious similarities with the hostel. Although it is not exactly dirty, it is trying to get past films to success. The only problem is Roth knew where he was going and how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. Not at all terrible or haunting, not just irritating. <br /> <br /> 5. Script in general. All the dialogue was forced and terrible! Also, the theater and the donors needed to rescue them were weak and almost like an afterthought. <br /> <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. How to jarring and not a good way. NÃ¼f said. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I would like to hear the director's thoughts about my post (he is undoubtedly frequent IMDb pages). Certainly at some point, either during shooting or editing, you understood what turkey yolu was in your hands ... Sorry I don't want to be tough, but you have to have more talent than it is, I hope your next feature that is filming or giving up the movie is better, hopefully the practice is progressing. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, avoid it as a plague. I want my 81 minutes back with interest. (At least I didn't pay to view it.)
