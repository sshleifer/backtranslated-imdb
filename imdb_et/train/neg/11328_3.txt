At any time, I rented an action and adventure movie just so it wouldn't be important. That's why I attribute a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a high quality movie, but it makes me laugh and lets me relax for a while. One of those days I probably buy Princess Bride and Monty Python for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to challenge this entertainment. Mostly I got what I wanted. The plot was something badly written about the Xena episode, and Kathy Long's actor was a very community theater (not a professional kick-boxer and a bad actor for the actress). There were a couple of high points in the cursors. Somehow they managed to get some pretty good players to play bad guys - unfortunately most of them die quite quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies, the more you film, the action, and the plot (which wasn't strong at first) worsens almost as quickly as the actor. But the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director will run on his back. At the end of the movie, I was serious about looking at it a second time to read several times Kathy Long's short shorts were in the middle of the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not enough meat to make the movie look more interesting the second time. If you are an Xena fan who needs some effort in a few hours, go to the grocery store and spend 0.50 cents for rent. There are strong similarities between the exhibition and this film. <br /> <br /> Just don't expect anything more than just for a few hours of fun. <br /> <br /> If, of course, you don't like Kathy Long's derri√®re. Then you can buy a copy.
