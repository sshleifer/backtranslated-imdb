.... And after you see this pike, you're not surprised that it wasn't published. <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie by any standards, but when I point out that this is one of the worst films called Stephen King, you can imagine how bad it is. The film starts with two characters that looked at the open mouth on the horror: <br /> <br /> "My God. What happened here?" <br /> <br /> "I do not know, but they are certain cats of anger" * <br /> <br /> The camera is placed in a house where hundreds of cats are dead and injured. The boy whom this boy is right for, someone hates cats and thinks he should be a cop. Wait a minute, he's a cop, and if the movie starts with a policeman who makes this obvious observation, you just know you're watching a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The reason SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it is very illogical and confusing. Finally, we learn that the title monsters need the blood of virgins to survive. Wouldn't they look for a better virgin who would be in the middle of the West Bible, not the American coastal city? Having said that, at least we know the motives of the monsters - this is the only thing we learn. We never learn how they can change shape or are able to render cars invisible, and these jars end up appearing to have been stolen by the TERMINATOR. Monster's mother walks with several police kills with bare hands, or blows them with a police excerpt (!), But if her monsters are intact for the police fire, why do creatures need to change their shape or become invisible? The death of creatures is equally badly thought to be killed because of the mass attack of household members. If cats can kill them, why didn't the monsters kill all the cats around the garden? There was a full horde of moggies sitting, but the monsters never thought of killing them. I think this is so that the production team can come to an end. It was that they started the movie in my complaint. <br /> <br /> We are treated with a number of scenes where famous horror film directors like John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King do. I think this is because, when an actress who did not know the script read the script, they immediately decided that whatever they did, they didn't show this bad movie, so Stephen King had to take his fear buddies out. So bad SLEEPWALKERS is <br /> <br /> * Unbelievable because it doesn't seem to be the worst line of film. The worst line is - "This cat saved my life"
