The political theme of this film is so obvious and difficult from the start that the result is completely predictable. Each good scriptwriting textbook gives you signaling layers that include symbol maps and three action structures. There is no one in this movie. The police are bad, so they are shown as low, incompetent, and cowardly. For the filmmakers, it never seems that the police could be a respectable citizen who sees joining the police as a good opportunity to contribute to the well-being of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer gets no chance to make his mind about whether Ned Kelly is a good man or a ruthless villain. The film opens when he is arrested for stealing a horse, but we don't get a clue about his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the guru's door, but we only know that he has been inside for three years already, when we hear it in dialogue much later. <br /> <br /> This movie contains many Nedi pictures. camera with serious expression. I found a real harvest to watch the movie. This is the direction of modern movies and it made me look more.
