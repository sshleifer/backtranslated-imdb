I only looked at it because it was led by Lucio Fulci and performed by Claudio Cassinelli, a pleasing actor. I was definitely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that dead prisoners fight TV deaths is Rollerball, Logan Run, Blade Runner, and the new Death Race movie. me because it marks Jason Stathami. <br /> <br /> It was mostly drilled. "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. "Training" was stabbing. It just didn't grab me and wanted me to want someone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others mentioned and you are better.
