The Vietnamese veterinarian decides to take an underwater city with an amok, and anyone who goes on his way is eliminated (including women). For theaters just before "A Star Is Born", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash, starred by Kris Kristofferson, is wild, pointless and thoughtless. Simi Valley, CA filmed, the results are really unseemly, with redneck clich√©s and meaningless violence forming the majority of director George Armitage's script. Armitage has gathered the 70's most curious about his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and a bit of Loni Anderson; but the whole thing is centered on Kristofferson, who is tough and rude. It deserves points, which I assume I am a totally atypical thriller, but a bad vibes (and a ridiculous climax) covers the whole project like a ugly color. * 1/2 from ****
