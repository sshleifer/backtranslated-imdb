What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and credible premise and a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the film loses it. In fact, it never went. There was a bit of excitement when we discovered that Angie wasn't really pregnant, so I know she's after all, but it was. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot of film, was terrible and not all his character was important for this film, except for its extension. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not a pure comedy, which unfortunately was not, but perhaps a comedy with drama. I think if the film had done it, it could have been very funny, because both actors are quite funny in their own way and are sitting here. I mean the numerous scenarios that would have been a rebellion.
