I know I was watching this movie from Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I am a big fan of), but I'm not one of those people who automatically gives MST3K a 1/10 rating. Although I hate the many movies they play, and some of them are one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I've been able to enjoy MST3K movies. That said, it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. (No wonder MST3K writers themselves said it was one of the worst. Don't believe me? See their site.) <br /> <br /> For me, this film is a good example of what not to do in film making. Dialogue is very bad, action is worse, cinematography is pathetic, while the direction (although it is the best in this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> Acceleration is the worst part of this movie. Some times in this movie, the viewer had to wait unexpectedly for something to happen. If the minutes may not seem very long, it may be in the movie, especially in that. I'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but I was very bored. It really looked like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "incredible stoppage" means "almost asleep during the movie," it has a lot. But the REVIEW SKULL is just so horrible, it is by no means possible that I would even be interested in what actually happened in the film, and so the "incredible stop" was indeed non-existent. <br /> <br /> One of the worst and probably the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
