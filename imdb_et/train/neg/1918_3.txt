The Twister TV version pulls a couple of leaks, but can stay traceable. My sister bought it in Wal-Mart a few years ago when it appeared, I saw it back and thought it was fine. Later, "Twister" appears with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt (or was it before? I think it was '97) and generally did a better job. But "Twister" was more silly fun; it is realistic with the message. It all depends on what you want from movies with twisters: Twisters, or a small budget character? <br /> <br /> John Schneider and Devon Sawa (he is the reason why my sister bought it) star and Devon Sawa, who went to "Wild America", "Final Destination" and "Slackers" got their big break here. So I was one of the first people to see him. I don't know if it's an honor or a shame, I haven't seen her act in recent movies. <br /> <br /> "Twister Night" depends on personal taste, as I said it all depends on what you want from movies with twisters: Twisters or a low budget character. "Twister night" is the last one. So you decide. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 2.5 / 5 ... <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
