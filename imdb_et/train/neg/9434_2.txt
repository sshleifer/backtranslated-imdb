Unhinged is banned in the UK as "Video Nasty", but of course it is pretty infamous. But the most shocking thing I found about the film was its amateurism in all departments. The bleeding that I could deal with: terrible action, dirty editing, terrible direction, terrible script, and abysmal soundtrack was a lot harder to take. <br /> <br /> Three girls at the music festival attacked the storm during the attack. They are saved by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The house owner, the spooky old lady and her spinster daughter, greet the girls, allowing them to stay for a few days to recover. But no one wants girls to ever leave! One by one they fall victim to the invisible attacker. <br /> <br /> Taking a long time to go and some of the worst performances on the horror film (and it does something), Unhinged is a really terrible movie. Music is a complete confusion (it seems the three-year-old has been released on the synthesizer) and it perfectly complements the film. Only a few blood to the end of the scene and a little free nudity to save from the least possible score. <br /> <br /> If you are a horror finalist (and unfortunately I am), you will want to check it out of the Video Nasty watchlist. But to warn, it's really bad.
