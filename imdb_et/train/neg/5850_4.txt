Nell Shipman tried to take the plot back to last year's "Back to God's Country" to run to the chase finals, and he failed. This time he does better, though it seems pointless. "Something new" hardly is the plot that lies behind. Here is a brief premise that sets the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) to save the girl (played by Shipman), nothing more than an exciting, incredible chase from there. Of course, this is Maxwell Sedan's hour-long ad, but the whole movie is equally ridiculous. It looks like he didn't learn much about D.W. Griffith or its parodies from Mack Sennett and other comedians he imitates. <br /> <br /> One interesting point is that Shipman writes and manages the film as a story about a writer whose main character is a writer (Shipman again), although he does not do a lot of clever or humorous, though he tries it do. Again, others were at the forefront of the writer's jokes, such as Anita Loos with "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion A Girl's Folly (both 1917). At the very least, Shipman has the impression that he doesn't take himself or the film seriously - nor is anything new, despite his claim, to be a hackney.
