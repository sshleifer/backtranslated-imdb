All in all, long and more sub-blocks filled than holes in Swiss cheese! The director and co-author say he wants to mix the genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two blends like vinegar and oil. Comedy is not very funny and minor for start-up. In addition, the film is not really realistic. Regarding the legal system, freedoms against French citizens are taken against their will and the obvious relief of drug escape in French hospitals. I watched this movie on my big screen TV at home and found myself screaming at the movie to move on. In the end, I finally gave the last long speech one of the main characters makes to his former lover's son. By that time, I was worried about the confusion in the mess, dealing with the dead mistress, the comfort of marriage and the nut-lover. Sometimes the plot directs to two main character families and then returns to one of them - Ismael or mainly Nora. In the eyes of the spectators, the viewpoints of Nora and Ishmael change, his former lover limiting his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two interesting films here, neither of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really match many sub-plots, and it seems he wants the viewer to believe that Nora is somehow lucky, although his situations in real life are equal to the possibility of a snowball in hell. Participants do their best and are tempting, but it is not enough to overcome all the outstanding mistakes associated with poor writing, editing and lack of focus.
