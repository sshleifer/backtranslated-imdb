Why is such a common name? Santa Claus ??? So blissful and unpredictable. The movies before they tried to rest the spirit, especially "Santa Captures Mars", were at least fun to watch because it was a comb, and all the stock that was used ... for some reason that seemed happy to me. But this movie screws in the back of Christmas and screws the joy of all children. Santa Living In Space? Is his enemy a devil called Pitch? Santa Claus Helping With Merlin Magic? How random is this!? Well, because it was made in Mexico, some of you understand how the film was made. I had to admit that some effects were just nervous over time. It was madness! Although, despite all the problems with the film, it still looks like Christmas. Good conquers evil and Christmas still play a part in the hearts of all our good girls or boys in the world, or maybe in the universe, thanks to Santa Claus conquering marches .. probably. So, I think you should try it, even if it's the worst vacation movies ever ... even though it should smile on your face every day.
