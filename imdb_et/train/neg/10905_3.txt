Guy is a loser. No girls, no need to build, stronger, more successful boys, etc. I must say that Rob must move Adam Sandler's part of his life. And get out of the Adam Sandler plot. The whole movie has two funny parts. I couldn't even finish after the last five minutes. I was bored. "Animal" is a boring film. I usually like Adam Sandler's movies with the same plot. But it was trying to impress. The jokes are very old. So, trust me. This is not a movie that most people would really get into. But some did, so I'm nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
