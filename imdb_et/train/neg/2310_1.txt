It was a really bright film. Performances are third rates and the dialogue is so stylish that at times it seemed that he was just dead and dead. The reason for my rental was simple: Find a movie with the scenario. I needed visual help for the presentation, so I thought I didn't use the clip? The boy was wrong with me. After searching for my local video store, I came across where it was suspiciously titled "Starstruck". I thought, "What's hey" and decided to try it out. Well, I was very pleased with my results. Maybe I had one scene that I could use, and in the meantime, I drove practically because of flick banals. So ..... I took it back and started Ed Wood. For example, a film can be used. Again, something could be presented compared to "Starfucker".
