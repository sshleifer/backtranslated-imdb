Personally, I found this film to be terrible, firstly it was barely objective and gave one side of the debate. The only people who were presented as a party saying that he is there are a number of people coming from Billy Grahm Revival. Secondly, he deviated from his supposed topic of Jesus (Yeshua) to talk about how violent Christianity is, and to show Mel Gibson's "The Passion" scenes. Finally, the director is the former conservative private school director who was interviewed and tries to try to teach children there. Oh and Techno Music also made it harder to watch the movie.
