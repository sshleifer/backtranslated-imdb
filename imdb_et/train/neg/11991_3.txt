- Bad Stuff: This movie is a real mess. Bad stunts on one thing, they saw it as fake I thought it was "Twilight Zone". Returns are pretty much useless. One part of the film he takes out of his anger window makes his life better. I want to know the director and when he was high, because the actor, even the adults, was terrible. Kissing this movie is even sucked. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I don't recommend this movie very much. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good things: I don't know what to say. There are some temporary parts that are going to get you, but the bad stunts and the actors make them fast. <br /> <br /> - My decision: Don't look.
