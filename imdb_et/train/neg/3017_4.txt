Now I had the best intentions to see it. I like some of Tony Scott's work, and my friend told me it was a great movie, although I heard from others. But it was just hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott tried too hard to try. It was just too much. Let me specify. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was excessive and not good. Well-done people were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time couldn't save the movie. <br /> <br /> There were some scenes that jumped in their originality, but somehow they seemed to be written by someone other than the main writer. Some setups were used about 4 times, which really started after the second error. I'm sure you won't use the same setup more than once. <br /> <br /> Also, this editing is really because the cutting rate is quite high. Oh, and the repetition of some Keira lines just sounded like a second, third, fourth time, and so on. In principle, my opinion is that if you want to see the momentum and a somewhat funny momentum and you don't care about what I mentioned above, you might like it. <br /> <br /> (Note on the side: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
