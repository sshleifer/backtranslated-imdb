Stereotypical slip sending is much shorter than expected entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and actually the whole cast is completely wasted. Flat jokes are plentiful and each stroke is well telegraphed. The dark one lining is at a fast pace and almost everyone falls into the split grapes. Musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that puts the entire movie in and stays. Another negative is the claustrophobic device located in the walls of a completely abandoned high school. Avoid it and look for one "Lamp" of really funny movies like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
