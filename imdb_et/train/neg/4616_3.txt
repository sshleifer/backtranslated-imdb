This movie is not outdated. Perhaps it is this effect and the artificial characterization, action and direction that we have seen with Sopranos, but I looked at Prizzi for the first time on DVD alone. <br /> <br /> Viewing Experience 24 years ago, the audience must be quite different, but I have to say that I was just over. Not only its violence, but the idea that it would somehow be a satisfactory end. <br /> <br /> I have a good shocker, but it seemed so characteristic ... Even when was this step supposed to be set? The cars seemed like from the 1960s, but the World Trade Center towers, which were completed in 1973, were clearly visible in many scenes of urban space. just the idea that a traveler could travel to his person with a knife on the coast. <br /> <br /> Somehow, in the mid-1980s, this movie was captivated by the film's charming and funny. The mid-eighties meet later: only you can live.
