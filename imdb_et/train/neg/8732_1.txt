The plot is related to the death of young children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the film it seems that she has some problems with her daughter. Finally, the serum killer is caught. That's it. But before you know who you are, you have to see all the participants terribly. It is incredible how bad these players are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but it is a waste of my time. Just don't watch the movie. I've warned you.
