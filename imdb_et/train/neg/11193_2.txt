OK, I had no great expectations, but this film that went deeper, I couldn't imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it was, was accompanied by a suspicious 2-member priest who was investigating the death of the founder. by the organizer. Sin Eater allows Catholics to escape the authority of the Church and is another immortal film with a lot of spirit. Of course, that doesn't make sense, because the Baptist can save you .... we're moving on. <br /> <br /> I'll place the plot, giving it a lot: the priest goes to Rome with his friend's investor. He brings with him a mental patient (I do not do it) who shot him during excorism and who loves him (not one of the lice of BTW), drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller cardinal. They arrive in Rome, find some horrible kids who don't do anything in the movie, meet a slave with the S & M anti-pope, what a drunk Irish man knows (not explained) and who gives information by killing people (oh, BTW, he's a bad man so he has an industrial / technical soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. around the plot. The chills hiding with Sin Eater are traveling in New York with Sin Eater overnight and then something else happens and then (all out of the camera) the anti-pope falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> 1 hour of the movie really doesn't know if something has happened. After all, something has happened, but you can't be sure that it is important and because most of the drama happens before you move or drop what you really feel cheated.
