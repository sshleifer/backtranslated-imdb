This movie seemed promising, but it was really bad. The prerequisite was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried their best with the finest material, but they couldn't stand up to the average courage of this sticky college movie. Jason Schwartzman was once again extremely irritating - even more so than Rushmores, the rest of the pains were quite non-eventful. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be outstanding and incredibly minors. Trying to be a Road Trip / American Pie, but fails at all levels. A waste of time for everyone.
