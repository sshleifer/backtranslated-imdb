STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> This second part of the Che movie moves the story late in the 60s In the years when a man has now moved his resistance fighters to the mountains of South America, surviving without adequate food and water and putting tensions between the groups. Everything comes to the head when it crosses the border to Bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without the last time and place of the movie, Soderberg's second installment will only focus on action in the mountains, and will even be a duller experience. And more pretentiously, the score is submerged, giving the second installment a more unwanted air artsieness that proves the same stranger. A movie that never lets you be bored of boredom. You can't blame Soderbergh's ambitions or Del Toro's leadership, it's just a shame that somewhere in the production process they managed to make it so disappointing. **
