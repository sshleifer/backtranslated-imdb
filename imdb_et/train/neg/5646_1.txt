A completely predictable silly show of a man who killed his wife when he dropped him and claimed he was black. Why did he still drive the car? Why did he still feel he was able to drive a woman killed by a car? This question has not been revealed to writers. The story then tells the psychologist and his failed marriage about the failed marriage of the head of the wife's interruption of killing. A well-informed mother and one-dimensional child are thrown into good measure and the whole builds up a predictable exclusion and crash finale. Are the police psychologists so easily enrolled? Deadly writing that participants do their best, but they are doomed. It's parallel to Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your time looking at it unless it's your goal.
