The only thing The First Power really has done is that it gives Jeff Kober the chance to play one of his beautiful psychotic villains he has done so well in the last 25 years. Kober is a valuable successor to Lyle Bettger, who specializes in these parts back in the fifties. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough, the first power is souped up slasher flick, which is wasted on Lou Diamond Phillips as a LAPD detective who has a special serial number capture. Kober is his last catch, but Kober is in a low-power league and they start to team up and make Lou's life unhappy. Even after the gas chamber is given to Kober, his spirit comes back to all sorts of shades. <br /> <br /> Mykel Williamson is at your fingertips when Lou's partner, who has a nasty tip with a demon, has a horse and a Tracy Griffith psychologist and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights, is helping Lou. Does he manage to fight beyond the forces? <br /> <br /> By the time the movie ends, you no longer need to take care. Lou really fucked turkey. Perhaps the devil made her the movie.
