For me, the only reason to see this remake was to see how bad and funny it might be. There is no doubt that it is funny and bad because I had seen "Voyna i mir" (1968). Do we start? Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Pierre Bezukhov - a lean companion who has no original depth; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova - scarecrow, his image can cause insomnia; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Andrej Bolkonsky - OK incarnation, like a lean man (cf. above), lacks the depth of the Russian soul and "fight inside"; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - a rather unprofessional leader; Prince Bolkonski of Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - an English face; Robert Dornhelm & Count Brendan Donnison's Bezukhov - spineless freak-show ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The actor's movement and the way they see and often speak brutally. They act like modern EU citizens dressed for a one-day masquerade. It all seems cheap and never goes to the standards of our Russian men and women at the beginning of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment to control. We had a little look at our office when we remember the modern product that was shown on our TV last night. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I think many youngsters have never watched our movie ("Voyna i mir" in 1968) or have a strange "Tarantino-Spielberg" quality. Remember the scene when our hussar rescues his friend, spins, shoots and the bridge goes to boom? It looks like this is a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no point or craft that would allow a better version of the novel that was once screened in our country. But I would be glad to see the Russian remake of "The Wind". Hey, directors, wake up and get busy with it, instead of breaking our classics. <br /> <br /> Now back to common sense. Jokes aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, though deadly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> For foreign actors to pass on to Russians (participating in very serious epic and drama), the rude mistake is made and filmmakers make this mistake again and again. Of course, it brings a lot of laughter - especially Clemence Poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and his dancing and singing makes the Russian viewer think, "It sucks so much that it's funny!"). <br /> <br /> To say something new, I would like to mention the pace of the movie. In my opinion, this new version is very uncertain. Talking and scenes are not naturally flowing - they move and jump like modern video. Again, I have to remember our "Voyna i mir", where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you just sit back and enjoy the "flow". <br /> <br /> I thought maybe Borodino's battle would be great (but would reuse many drawbacks), but it is not suitable for the 1968 war scenes. <br /> <br /> After all, this movie should have something good. And there is. It seems that the actors are trying to do all this. They didn't have a chance from the start, but they still joined the losers' team. Plus 1 point for this recklessness. This makes the Russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous, although they are designed to be dramatically powerful and the actors do their best. All of this causes damage and sometimes makes a laugh. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this series is its last part. It shows very vividly how everyone gets their "wages and taxes". Besides, I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene that would definitely destroy the whole project. But luckily there is no such garbage. And that's a big plus. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter" and nowadays we do not even have enough hands to shoot it properly, here in Russia today. Do I have to say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated? Fortunately, during the Soviet era, the right film was reviewed. The American version of the 1950s was somehow justified - we didn't exist yet. Then there were mitigating circumstances. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is awarded from the beginning, 1 point goes to negligence and 2 points to the last part. Thank you for your attention.
