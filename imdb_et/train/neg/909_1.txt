Never consider watching this excusable apology for a movie. the way it is captured, lit, worked, etc. makes no sense. it's all so bad that it's hard to see. loads of boredom are repeated. it seems that the whole movie does not have a "normal" person and the existence of "external environment" is well, it just does not exist. and why this bald guy suddenly becomes invincible? this film is beyond foolishness. null.
