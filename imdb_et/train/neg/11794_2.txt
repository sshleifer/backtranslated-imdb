Average central Sci-Fi channel image. A little tough, but not much. Nuclear Submarine Submarine in the US Jimmy Carter is on a mission near the North Pole under deep rigid ice when attacked by gigantic super-charged eels. A team member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks he has developed a way to interact with monsters but has not been given many vague reasons. The team also includes: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This film could have been a bit better if the eels / monsters were not so comic.
