People like me tear this movie apart. It's not just realistic. Plot is so predictable. You can predict everything that happens convincingly. Of course, they find treasures and become dirty and break the evil. We saw it a million times earlier. The writers of this movie have to think that most of the public movie is stupid. They must be right because most people loved this movie. I mean solving puzzles in seconds. A secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan metro? You'd think that all the work done in New York has already been discovered in this room. and all that was built during the Civil War? Pray And Love Story Between Ben And Abigail? how cute and I thought romance in Clive Cussler's novels was weak. They just love that love in 2 seconds. hell with a girl and a stupid piece of paper. 1/10 of garbage
