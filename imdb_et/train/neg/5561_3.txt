I saw this movie titled "Bound". In general, I've enjoyed Dolphi movies so it gave it a try. It wasn't worth it. I've read some of the previous comments about the flattering viewers. Don't be fooled. This is at best a bad film. Operation is non-existent. The plot that is few is very predictable. Movies in places seem to be broken. It just stinks up. Not even worth a cheap night rental price. Like a little Dolphi fan, I waited to see him in action. At the end of the movie you are still waiting. It is best to avoid this movie and spend time with almost anything else.
