Since others are left on the plot summary, I would like to mention some points about this movie. There may be spoilers here; I don't care about filtering them out. <br /> <br /> - Because of the budget's low budget, creature design was pretty good. It's really nice to see a direct-video horror movie that isn't slathered by the terrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of the digital film in places is rather grainy and it is the most noticeable in sheltered shelters. <br /> </p> Time lapse. I understand that the director could have tried dementia, but in order to be effective, there had to be a consistent flow of time. As it seems, it just seems amateur. <br /> <br /> - The plot twists were numerous but predictable. I had no doubt in my mind about the identity of the looted cultists, or that some kind of flat evil-trumps-good development would eventually collapse. <br /> <br /> - It may seem like clinging, but the characters in this movie don't reliably use any common sense. First of all, the regulatory committees would be in the center of all mental health, which unilaterally reported the cardiac arrest of all patients and workers. Why should a major psychiatrist be able to make a dissection? Why was it not the point of the plot about the introduction of these impressive qualifications or the odd religion? What is the background? What should we care for? And just as importantly, who in the right sense would go to the introduction of this place, look at everything that was so intimidatingly wrong, and then conclude that it was still a good place to continue residing? This film did not even respect its characters enough to give its wisdom doubt. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Watch Wicker Man instead.
