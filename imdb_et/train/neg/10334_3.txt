The story of amazing interest kills time and again with The Psychic. Characters and plots are completely uninteresting (just like Fulci's crazy camera work, which is usually a redemption factor in his films), and no intermediate control is anywhere. It's a cushioned degree down - in the end you're not excited with excitement, but with boredom (and like me, maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves a better film job. Fulci gorehounds are cautious - there is nothing in "Psychology". <br /> <br /> 3/10
