Well, my goodness, I'm disappointed. When I first heard news of Robert Wise's 1963 The Haunting movie, I was afraid it would destroy the abundance of summer-film visual effects. But deeply I believed. Certainly, such a talented cast of intact ... De Bont and the company do not destroy the film, which is original, was a fantastic and frightening film that understood delicacy. Well, the fineness where you are now !! ?? My fears are manifest ... a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is a jaw fall; the film is wonderfully captured; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never make EVER wrong. However, the script tests excellent actors whose task is to provide such a dirty dialogue that is only spoken in movies. Finally, there is always a wonderful Lili Taylor, the only performer who flees a little dignified ... and it's just barely. But the crime of all crimes is that we have been shown horror. We can no longer use our imagination, feel the terrible fear of unknown fear. No, we see some visual effects on SHOW US, which we should fear ... and you know what? As wonderfully understood, these are visual effects like fools. And the climax is a fantasmoral confusion, but things had gone wrong long ago. <br /> <br /> All of the graves are overflowing and bloated. I'm afraid there is no real excitement or creaks in this old haunted house ... but rushes. Check the original instead. <br /> <br />
