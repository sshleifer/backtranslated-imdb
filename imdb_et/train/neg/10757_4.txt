I just saw this movie on the DVD last night and decided to review this morning. "I, Robot" seems to have polarized the critical viewing community in IMDb (and gave many insults and names). <br /> <br /> I find it surprising because this movie is not big (or even good), but it's not terrible (or even very bad). What this movie really is is ... frustrating. It is depressing that the number of US movie visitors is so ready to warm up the unwanted clich√© and recognize them as great new works. This film is written "around", written all over it, from the plot line (inconvenient mix of Asimov and the modern uber activity) to the character of Smith (cynical cynical with titanium backbone), special effects (borrowed from the Matrix and others). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, unfortunately, a pretty perfect movie for today's audience: superficial graph, insipidly cute dialogue, lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew it (he seems to be Hollywood's last failed attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story contains lots of holes in every size, but I don't think most of the people pulled into this movie are critical. Maybe a true winner of today's standards, but a very B-movie compared to real winners.
