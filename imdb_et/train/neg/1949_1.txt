Animation looks like it happened in 30 seconds and looks like a caricature rather than a character. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series was first released in 1969. I didn't think much about Scooby Doo's animated movies (I'm talking about a TV series, not full-length movies), but some of them were pretty cool, and I like most people to find Scrappy Doot irritating, but this series is pure garbage. As soon as I saw the animation and heard the signs (and I use the term loosely), I will speak. Mystery Inc. there was also a team and, without the whole team, congratulating each other, it seems like opening the chocolate box to find someone who has already eaten the best, and the only thing left is what nobody wants. What a new Scooby Doo was better than that. If you have a Scooby Doo TV series, add those items that changed the series for so long. All characters and high quality animation. They have to put it on the stone where it came from.
