This movie was boring! Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can't build the whole movie! <br /> <br /> Characters are too stereotypical, not real stories - only short episodes with freaky side effects that aren't uncomfortable to make the plot authentic. <br /> <br /> Shame, as most actors in Hungary are recognized, this is the mystery of why they took roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a new hope for Hungarian film. It was boring, though it was supposed to be genuine or unique. They could have tried that much harder ... 2 out of 10
