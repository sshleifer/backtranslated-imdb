This movie is terrible. Deceptive scenes or not, the actor is really bad, as you can say they read their rows from the map. All cast persons with painful line breaks. Think of looking at high school play and face-to-face interaction with striking prominence (a weird break between the lines of the different characters, combined with the rush of others). If the movie was all an act, it could be forgiving, but a lot of the movie includes setting up a plot and Family Guy style, a careless cut (Oh, wow, they're badly done). I assume they were trying to be funny about them, but it came again as a bunch of college students / college students who went off in the afternoon trying to create a funny Youtube clip. <br /> <br /> Now in the fight. They are not too bad in terms of film quality. Nothing great, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have said (something like drunken Master). The struggle has a highly staged feeling, LOTS trimming to different angles, where actors are clearly different. All in all, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of your friend's friends who did this very, very cheap production. Which guy can you ask? Oh, the same man who wrote, directed, produced and looked at this high school masterpiece.
