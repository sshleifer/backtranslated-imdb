Somewhere buried, the deep buried inside this film is a decent film that tries to get out. The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (bar and cemetery) and a few pieces of production project. As I say, buried very deep. One of the biggest challenges facing supernatural films is how the characters react incredibly in incredible situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction says that her sister (probably Dee Wallace's first movie) is (was?) A werewolf, as I recall; "Really?". None of the better answers to this challenge. Non-sequences continue when the story moves to Trannsylvania, looking for Stirba (apparently self-appointed queen of werewolves). Like Stirba, Sybil Danning's movie is two of the best. Yes, even better than the werewolf group-sex scene, the act of Reb Brown and the weird witch-like werewolf. Final credits have presumed less legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember that the whole movie makes the same sense. When it comes to catching up on US television, the credit has been re-edited to replace Danning's endlessly repeated shooting that dropped his top with another endlessly repetitive glance that opened the tone only when he had some top down. This is a kind of absurd, surprising moment that is against the satire.
