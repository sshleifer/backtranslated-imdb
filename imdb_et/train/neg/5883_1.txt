This film does not contain humor for anyone who has lived with a family member with a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too much of their life experiences graphically. This movie was a version of "Mommy Dearest". It graphically and accurately depicts the life many children of a child with mental illness are undergoing. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to get corrupt and act like God. Someone told me it was funny. Nothing, I say! At best, it's a sick humor. The film is so intense and frustrating that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use of this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe what families actually do.
