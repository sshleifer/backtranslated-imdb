One missed call, another Asian horror based on a mobile phone. Recently I rented a Korean horror film on a mobile phone called "Pon". One missed call was just as boring as it was. Maybe the phones aren't just scary or anything, but this move was boring and drab. There is no tension or excitement for me, and the last monster was disappointing and unpleasant. The movie was dragged quite differently and seemed too long. Did not hold my attention. It looks like the phones are hard to scare, it's like trying to make a vending machine eerie. And it is ridiculous to compare it to "Ring", it seems that every Asian horror film is compared to it and so far I have not seen this dimension the least. For Fear Managers - Get your phone out of a horizontal device.
