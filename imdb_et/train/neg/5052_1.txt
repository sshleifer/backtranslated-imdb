Plato is in the Vietnam War because Rocky IV is a heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone, in 1968 in Vietnam, is so scattered about the experience of the United States Army unit that it is ridiculous. Although most or all of the events in Plato took place during a ten-year period of US military intervention in Vietnam to portray the things that happen to a small group of men, in such a short period of time (within a week), a terribly skewed picture war. The men of the single men will see in one or two weeks all the following: US soldiers murdering civilians, US soldiers raping civilians, US sergeant, murdering another US sergeant, US private murder US sergeant, US soldiers killed / wounded friendly with fire, 90% + killed or wounded. Stone is trying to pass on this movie because the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is disgraceful. The two Vietnamese war films I would like to see are our soldiers (a real story of the allegedly worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's Bright Shining Lie.
