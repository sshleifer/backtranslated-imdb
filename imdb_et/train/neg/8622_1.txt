Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came, there has been much talk about reviving the Hong Kong film industry. Don't believe it. People who now make movies in HK will give the word crass a new meaning. 2-time shutdown is a great example. Ekin Cheng is the name here, but he spends most of the movie just by idiotically stacking and remembering the coin. He reminds the coin over and over again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays with the police, who is pursuing a real boy. But again: who knows why? A female lead is a beautiful actor who runs some kind of company and has to pay ransom or something, but she looks mostly like she would be in a spa or shopping center than in front of a camera. Nothing makes sense. No action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. Everything is in the name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
