"National Lamp Goes to Movies" (1981) is the absolutely worst film ever made, even surpassing the uncomfortable "space plan 9". The film of the lamp is not reflected in three separate and interrelated vignettes, each containing different performers. The only common thread is the complete lack of redemption properties. Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer of this site has said that the nude shots are nice and right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry start their early, first and second part of the flash. But their glamorous displays are unfortunately wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even R&D needs a reliable story about it, and there is no outstanding one. <br /> <br /> The third segment, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the three most disgusting, with the unfortunate choice at the core of this movie. Benson is eager to play a beatiful young cop who reports his first day of duty, ready to get rid of evil streets. He is linked to an old, cynical policeman who is played by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners put together on their first patrol, we know the potential redemption of the film's previous failures. Perhaps, perhaps, a cynical old player might be reformed with his new partner's cumbersome commitment and loyalty. Maybe all will end happily. But unfortunately, this film does not fit directly into the toilet, without redemption, a happy ending, a unified story. <br /> <br /> Before the "National Lamp goes into movies," I thought I had already seen the worst script that Hollywood might prove to be. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen it halfway. <br /> <br />
