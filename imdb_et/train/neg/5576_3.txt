By the time you talk about Japanese cinema, most people don't talk about Rashomon or Ronin or Ran. Japanese cinema means to the masses all those monsters that we have loved by destroying these Japanese cities over and over, many times in battles with each other. The first and largest of them is Godzilla, who has returned a dozen times or more, and in front of some films there was a three-head hydra, like Space, Ghidrah. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, according to times, the special effects got a little better. But some of the old films' fascination was to see that these paper-packed urban kits were destroyed, they saw so funny, maybe three steps over Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some future visitors have time to travel to Japan to destroy Godzilla when it was first discovered. In fact, he was discovered during the Second World War as a surviving dinosaur when he defended the Japanese army against American troops from the Pacific island. But later, when Bikini's atomic testing was, Godzilla's friendly dinosaur, like Barney, has become the medium we know in cinema. <br /> <br /> Of course, you will clear Godzilla as a clear field for Ghidrah to destroy Japan so that it does not become an economic colossus that was in 1991 when the film came out. I'm not saying more, but we all know that Japan is doing quite well in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all Japanese monster movies, just sit back and enjoy chaos.
