The amazing, cliched thriller has young couples doing transnational research on America's most notorious murder sites, becoming pioneers with dusky young women and her brilliant boyfriend - who is the real psycho. Arty and alienation, the film's tone alternates with poutie-pseudo-irony and foolish confusion. Probably done, but finally ridiculous. Brad Pitti as a small tenant killer is godawful. * from ****
