I've been almost forever playing songs into a movie. I believed that the quality of the film would be improved automatically if only those extremely annoying songs were tentative. But things have changed quickly after watching this terrible black (song) and this movie (many songs). Although Black was extremely weak, it offers a fascinating story with a strong and good direction. The songs were almost random and mixed almost smoothly with the film. There was probably no woman who had any obvious reason to spray with water, mysterious water sources, while at night, in the streets of wild roads. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and uninterrupted approach that the director used. . There was nothing shiny and almost every scene was completely plausible. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to Hindi-speaking people who have at least a little understanding of Mumbai's life. First, because the English subtitles were below the nominal and contained a lot of errors that sometimes completely overruled the meaning of the actual statement. Last, because you will definitely appreciate the correctness of the image if you have lived it yourself. <br /> <br /> I would definitely be an internationally recognized work. The scenes of gossiping drivers were a nice touch, and it simultaneously served as a source of true humor, and at the other point of view, all wrong. However, the film is not in some places where characters are sometimes said to be the most inexplicable things that damage the overall direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that a couple of sad scenes were not done very well. It was an amusement that was interesting to look at, rather than creating feelings of sadness, and the whole scene tended to meet a bit stupid. However, these are small questions because the film is usually very rare to watch. <br /> <br /> Generally it is cynical, pessimistic and refreshing. Actors, not "heroes" - this is the key. The opportunity to blur incredible people in an extraordinary environment - everyday life. Behind the scene is the extent of uncertainty and the rare hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10
