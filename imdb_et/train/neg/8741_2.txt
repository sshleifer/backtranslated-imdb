Five minutes into this movie you realize you've seen it before. This is BOILER ROOM. This is FIRM. And it is DEAD BINDING. And there are no new elements here. Except for the all-inclusive Bill Gates allegory. Conpsiracies is always a good thing to make a movie, but why is it so extreme? The boiler house is a good movie because for at least some time it seems realistic. In the antitrust fight, everything is wrong. For example, how realistic is it that your boss is paying an impostor to be your girlfriend to make you more difficult and to control you? I would give it 1 but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
