I've seen better product quality on YouTube! I regret the participants because the writing was terrible and the trend is shocking, not sure how they could come out - I doubt that any actor would have been able to save this movie no matter how good it was. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion that just seemed to go far. It's really a shame, because the film's premise was good and for a better product quality, direction, and script, it would have been a decent film. It was certainly not a comedy if you were not laughing when copying loudly, which was amateurish, even English actors sounded strange.
