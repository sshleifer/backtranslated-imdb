This movie was fantastic! (Not as good as Leif Garrett's Longshot masterpiece, but still awesome! I thought Ashley looked great in this movie compared to Mary-Kate. Interesting why. Who thought they could get into such places and almost get away. The father was a jerk, but his mother was a bit too dark with Helmit Head. I'll give him 4. Anyone who likes this movie, look at Longshot.
