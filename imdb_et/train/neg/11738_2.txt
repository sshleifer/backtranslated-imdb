"Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for the Midwest Met, but it must be over the hard R rated "Reefer Madness". Yes, drugs are bad and met are terribly harmful, like addiction and how it destroys people, families and communities. But those characters who are either stupid or ridiculous and running on the eye don't teach this lesson to anyone. While the writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on the screen, his partner Diane Foster plays tirelessly stupidly wide-eyed innocent, as Susan Sarandon was already in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, who was attacked by drugs. Only after the end of the film did I realize that I think these two were the last high school graduates to explain some of their naivety because our school pictures are bombarded, but if that is the case, they even saw older people than "OC". they have good chemistry on the screen, they are "imitation" of the "Badlands" pair. <br /> <br /> Guest letters are badly used. Michael T. Weiss, a "Pretender" on such a good television, is completely ridiculous than a corrupt password officer and his brutal violence is just crazy because his character destroys the social importance of the film. Rosanna Arquette must be even milder than David Cronen. very low rent. John Savage even has excuses for the old baby boom, but it is worse. Goth's chick appears with a strange explanation that he is a des Moines remover. A compulsory Latino drug dealer - Iowa? The limited budget depicts the use of the interior design of the forest with quite vivid, rather frightening hallucinations. We will certainly see them crazy. <br /> <br /> Although Iowa's locations are used very well (including a fun scene of propane gas abduction), accents and church references are confusing for South Baptist. It seems that weapons are governed by law-abiding and unlawful laws that violate more citizens here than any drug-related film in any part of the city. <br /> <br /> Iowa's famous bard Greg Brown's songs are used all the time, but no strange credit. I hope they were used with permission. <br /> <br /> I tried it for my business purposes in NYC because I stayed at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it became a buzz - and inexplicable.
