I've read the book a couple of times and this movie doesn't follow exactly how it should. I can shoot this slide, that's after the movie. But I have serious problems with setting up the movie. Nobody seems to mention that this film and the underlying book are based on events in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in a city where this film should be based. First, the "small" city that is being spoken is the third largest city in the country. The population is about 50,000 people. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Secondly, the film landscapes are wrong. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. What is very flat, with very little disability. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me crazy to see my home town being treated so badly. It was a real event. The big parts of the city were destroyed. The book discusses the bikes of the island of Mormon to Fonner Park. I think you could, if you don't understand the 15-mile race.
