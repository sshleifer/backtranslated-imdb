Full House is one of the worst TV series! Why? Because all the characters are so irritating that it is impossible to wear. The best character is Joey, even he is sometimes quite irritating. This girl DJ who wrote her character? I want to kill my self whenever he talks. to mention when Danny starts his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ won about ten thousand dollars in the casino or more. However, he is not eighteen so he should not play under the law. ready to pay him money, but then Danny, his father wanted him and did not let him raise this money because he is not eighteen. They come, give me a break, whether I have this fool and childish scene i immediately turned off on television .Some thing they say in this series is not even a child bought. Who in the world might think that Full House is fun and funny? Every word they say in this series seems like Shakespeare wrote it except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn't be childish and stupid to write something as foolish as they wrote in a letter! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart or any bad health or any life or real world idea, I strongly recommend "Don't look at a full house"! episode when you try. Avoid this series. Save your stupidity and mess. This is the worst TV show ever! I'd rather watch Teletubbies then this. Don't look at it.
