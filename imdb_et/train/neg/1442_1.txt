This is the worst imaginary mess. H. Rider Haggard's novel is very fun and dramatic. The makers of this precious film do not follow it closely. Well, old novels aren't holy and finding free versions is good for me if anyone has their own ideas. If everything can be done, changing things and replacing them with uninteresting and spent clich√©s should be left with the original. If they had done this, this film would have been at least twice as good for the worst actors and if it had been filmed in a studio with cartons made of cardboard. No imagination just fatigue. It should only be purchased or viewed by collectors of Victorian novels collected from films. <br /> <br /> Just a hint, not a spoiler, to think that those who have read the novel will understand what has happened and what you expect if you decide to watch it on TV or - God forbid - to buy money to buy it. Gagool is an old library witch and some of Gollum's predecessors have become a nice tip!
