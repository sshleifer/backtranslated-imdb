Necessary transformation and it can not be close to the original charm. Extreme length causes more than some spider-inducing parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style and mostly lacks talent, not just the actor but the direction, sets, costumes, etc. are below par. This is clearly attentive to the details of the period. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member who shows some elegance, Tyne Daly is not too bad. They should have left alone well enough. Singing is good (Vanessa Williams) for the poor (everyone else). See the original 1963 version and skip it. There is not much to suggest here.
