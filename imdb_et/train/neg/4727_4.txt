This movie is really something of a hell egg, in good parts. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the main mistake is its inability to draw the viewer's interest in characters and parcels. I sat through it because I am interested in rock'n'roll and band dynamics, but if I only appreciate it on the basis of my merits, I have to give it a thumb, a warning: Jason Behr is good at John Livien and quite convincing as a rock singer; The narrative of his childhood trauma is unclear, although we are given clues in Livonia's well-behaved relationships with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately odd to the viewer (which should not be). Nonetheless, it is interesting, though not novel or fully investigated, to use the personality to resolve internal conflicts. John Lennon's hints were irritating, but I testify that I'm not a fan of Beatles. In any case, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles in the sense that they had something derivative. Another frustrating thing in the film was how it opened up to interesting - albeit at secondary and high school level - philosophical guiding figures, but left their threads of thinking there just to be in the middle again. the movie very briefly when Livien says, "There was music in front of God" (never seen this Tia Maria ad in the 1990s, "Before that was Tia Maria"? That is what reminded me anyway); it seems to be an idiotic conclusion and the viewer does not know how he achieved it, but he has the right. Fortunately, his bassist and friend, partially played by Dominic Monaghan, seem to admit that this thinking is wrong when he answers "You don't know". <br /> <br /> Generally, there is limited strength in direction and strength. The plot could go either to future projects, to meaningless banals, or to an interesting and more mature perspective.
