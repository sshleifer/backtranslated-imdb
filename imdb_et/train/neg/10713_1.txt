Come on, let's get real. Christ knights, the Ordo Temple, or the Templar knights, as they are often referred to, do not even exist before the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides, if you want to become a temple of real life, why not just use Christ knights who are still in Portugal. At least they should have considered history. The only redeeming quality I found in this film was that the items seemed authentic for medieval or Gothic periods. Action was bad, the story was terrible, terrifying, and props were fine.
