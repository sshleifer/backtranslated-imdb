One might think that a film about a young person's sense of homosexuality would be nothing but boring. Think again. This production has to be bottled and sold for insomnia, because it is about ten times stronger than all the sleep benefits on the market. It's almost like a filmmaker * made a movie, but it would be lazy and instead decided to run a series of random (and random BORING) pictures and go-Nowhere scenes, throw in a few real scenes that represent real action, pretending to be good light is not important in the film making process and breaks this "arthouse" movie under the auspices of. It is just such a confusing product that makes it easy for many traditional film artists to move poo-poo indie and keeps the public more easily on easier indie films. <br /> <br /> You are interested in films that consist of this theme, you would be much better tuned to some of the great short films available on the Logo website or by renting. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, leave this long-haired piece of dreck.
