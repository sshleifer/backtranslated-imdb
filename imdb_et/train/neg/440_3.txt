** HERE IS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Mia (Helin) returns home from Stockholm's capital Rättvik to celebrate her parents' 70th birthday. She is the youngest child and has two sisters, Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla has divorced and moved to the city. Mia is still lonely and focused on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hostility between nurses, and conflicts arise wherever they come into contact with each other and each of them has personal problems that they find difficult to cope with. When the party continues (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets are revealed and more and more conflicts arise ... <br /> <br /> Comments: The work of the new writer / director was disappointing to watch this movie in exactly the same stories as older Swedish Comedy / Drama has been following for years. There are no new elements or ideas really. This film is based on three main areas. 1) Embarrassing humor is only based on characters who make themselves stupid. 2) Fear and 3) Anxiety. This step is focused on the latter, forgetting almost the first point when the movie goes. There is no loss, because the humor that is there is not funny. The productions of the exhibitions are good, but I think it has disappeared from all the troubles and will soon be forgotten. I had the hope that there would be new ideas and effects, but they were not. In conclusion, it is better to spend time watching it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
