I was expecting the film to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but the fun of fun going on in the singles was fun too. <br /> <br /> It said The Singles Ward had many things that were completely annoying. The whole movie was copied badly and looked at the mouth, listening to their voices very irritating. This lack of professionalism was only surpassed by Mormon celebrities who have no business. <br /> <br /> This movie works well among Mormondom, especially in college communities with single quarters. But the conclusion does not give hope to the poor losers who get married. (Only a few girls in Singles Ward get married, fat, ugly, but all ugly men) Finally, we realize that the whole movie was an LDSSingles.com ad
