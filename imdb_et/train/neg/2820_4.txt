I don't know much about Tobe Hooper or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he wouldn't have to work. As the other observer mentioned, there is not really enough horror or eroticism to bring fans of both genres. The plot is inconsistent, rain sequences are free, and most are doing so. Englund did his best with the weakest material, and Zoe Trilling really has a big bottom, but neither is enough to wear this film. It's a tape. Rating: F
