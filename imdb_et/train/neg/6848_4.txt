I have to say that I am quite disappointed with this "horror movie". I didn't even fear it once. Nor is it very tense ... I could guess the end of the movie halfway ... So ... what's left? .. I want other movies to stop copying (eg trademark: long hair). Please give me originality. <br /> <br /> Don't recommend this movie.
