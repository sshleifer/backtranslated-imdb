And Oscar is the least-valued classic horror actor - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name must be the same as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. His character, Herman, was one of the two reasons I could watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly distracted wrong-pleasing yet creepy behavior that brought you to hope for a greater role in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being a medical institution, I have to give fame to the hypocondria that leans on itself. Although the other "medical errors" gave a short stroke, especially when a good doctor tries his doctors' medication ... "Continue to give it to him" Unfortunately, these two outstanding performances 3 could not keep up waking. slow movie. The plot is predictable only with a few small twists. Filming by pulling out a legitimate spooky atmosphere was a more impressive product - yes, you can use too much shadow. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - look at it once to see Frye and Eburne, but only when awake is awake and a lot of caffeine.
