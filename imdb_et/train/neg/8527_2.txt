This animation style has three movies that I remember from my youth. This movie, The Last Unicorn, Dragons Flight and The Hobbit. I have copies of both "Dragons" and "Hobbit" (both excellent) and I haven't seen "The Last Unicorn" for more than ten years. It was up to the present and now I wish it wasn't. What most disturbed me was the script. It was incredibly dirty and often nasty. Things would happen without reason and other things would happen without explanation. We are not just talking about small things here; we are talking about key points! The story itself is not that big at first, but it could have worked if the script had been proper. Not even close. In addition, the music was terrible! I know that in films such as music, there is rarely a classic piece, but the music in this film made me aware of the involuntary bowling ball. It was one of the films I started to show to my children one day, but it was just cut. I don't think I'll ever be able to sit through this sacred festival. Disappointed lightly.
