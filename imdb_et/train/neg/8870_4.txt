Stefan is an x-con who married Marie five years ago. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan reached the past and offered a courier job. Stefan's work is delivering heroin from Germany to Sweden, which should go easily. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan Elli, a girl from Bosnia, has been sold to a strip club owner. Stefan does not like what he sees and decides to help Elli out of his misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father traveled to Sweden during the war, Elli is now going to Sweden with Stefan. With the past, Stefan promises that Elli will help him find his father no matter what he takes. Finally, in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more difficult than Stefan ever thought. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't look like a normal Swedish movie class because it's a lot of American. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist turn it into an average, but the film is over-influenced by the influence. See it and jugde for yourself. <br /> <br />
