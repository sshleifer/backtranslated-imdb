This movie makes Peter a living Robin Hood in costume, not a human boy likely to be in a non-Robin-Hood costume, and ignores all personalities in what is really important. This film makes Wendy a foolish idiot. And poor captain Hook TOTAL clown. And of course, every Disney caricature must have a badge that has hit the head too much. The only sign that is not embarrassed in this film is Tink. The only letter is for him. <br /> <br /> The story itself? Darling's parents can't even notice their children! Probably one of the most important points in the original story and they destroyed it! The famous kindergarten between Peter Pan and Wendy is also a stunning piece. - There are no rings and acorns - one of the few things that makes the original story unique. It is a miracle that he had even lost his shadow and helped him to hold him. (Even if his shoes do not make sense to me.) <br /> <br /> The destruction of such a great story for children to entertain should be illegal. So you know now that you haven't known it before - this Disney version doesn't contain anything original about the story - it's not really a children's story, it's just a great and great story. <br /> <br /> It just distracts me from the end.
