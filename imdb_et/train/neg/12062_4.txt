When talking about a great director / actor combination from the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson, this is usually not mentioned. Probably because the output of the nine joint ventures between these two is mediocre for really good entertainment. Unfortunately, Kinjite falls: forbidden themes to the last. <br /> <br /> It's sad because Kinjite could have been much better. But during my lifetime, I do not understand why it was necessary to make a missing Japanese girl's father, a guy who was used to some cheap hunting because her marriage romance has run out. It could have been good for another movie, but it wasn't practical here. <br /> <br /> A simple police book with Charles Bronson as vice-president who has seen a little too much bias in his work against the Oriental. This part could also have explained a little. But he must overcome it if he and the patient partner Perry Lopez find a Japanese school girl in prison. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time on vocals has told him exactly where to look for a kidnapper. The stylish and murderous pimp, played by Jaime Fernandez, is his and his and Bronson's history. In fact, Bronson made the film the best scene to eat an expensive role play and put his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At one point, Fernandez Bronson and Lopez will have dinner all night and after that, his rollx snack, he will spray where Uzi will kill everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that in a small case, Fernandez would have had more than a few vice cops from LAPD. But this is another terrible hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> However, Fernandez still has very tough justice. I want the whole movie to be better. This was the last film by Bronson-Thompson's team and the last director by J. Lee Thompson. He should have done something better.
