I did not agree with any of the left-wing theology, but still found the books I collect and read about 12 of them. Undeniably good writing and an interesting story. But I had no great expectations of the film. There was no way Hollywood could have reached the Christian series and made a big budget movie. So it was done independently ... and it just seemed like I was watching a really long TV show. It just doesn't know the movie; it had no "experience" of this movie if anyone knew what I was talking about. So it suffers because of the film, and poor special effects with a low budget were another weak for me. As I read the book, I had the impression of NC that he was to be the charming, dazzling, amazingly beautiful man who spoke English with an almost zero-accent accent. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan. Instead, they found some of Clay Aiken's pencil neckline, which looks like the best worker of the month, and gave her a really bad height. So I lost a couple of stars. The film is not just convincing, as the great villain doesn't see or sound as he should be. <br /> <br /> The actor was okay, but nothing could be written at home. Some scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (don't remember what) - were real seating for me. And some of the Christian music, or whatever it was, were indeed in place for some scenes, like the one where Kirk Cameron prayed in the bathroom. bad movie but it just didn't do it for me. Stay with the book, people, it's much better.
