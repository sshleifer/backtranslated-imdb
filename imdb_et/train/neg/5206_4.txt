Customizing games in the cinema is often a bad idea because they are two different media. Do you think this is a great idea to make ZULU on stage? Imagine if two gentle redot sit in a tent that pulls thousands of "Blimey out there" Big movie and bad stage game <br /> <br /> Two major elements are needed to play the big cinema. br /> <br /> 1) Fine casting on screen chemistry <br /> <br /> 2) Excellent Dial <br /> <br /> Cher and Chazz On paper, Palminterri would be a good choice, but not in these roles. The story revolves around the Palminter strike, which breaks into the house to kill a woman played by Cher with most of the activities taking place inside the house. I couldn't take these two characters seriously, though maybe it was a script fault that couldn't decide if he was trying to be serious or funny. Since the story is very static, it is of utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again, because the strange tone of the scenario tends to torture more than anything related to sexual acts. if you want to see that the streaming game transferred to the silver screen is a big translation, give FAITHFUL miss and see 12 ANGRY MEN instead
