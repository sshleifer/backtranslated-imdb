This film gives a promising start and becomes very confusing and confusing. Kamal Hasan has done a lot of effort to see this period, sorry he didn't spend more time on the plot. Most of the small characters in the movie appear for a specific reason. <br /> <br /> Generally very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
