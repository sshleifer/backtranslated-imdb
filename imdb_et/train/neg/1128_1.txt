This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure drivel. How anyone could create a relationship with the heroine or his empathy is over me. I felt I was looking at a schizoid individual case history with a borderline personality disorder. Just terrible. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, it can be seen as a film production and "art" experiment - unless I could not find that art in my lifetime. <br /> <br /> If this woman had lived in today's world, she would have been able to throw her into a mental institution and she was given a few days of treatment with psychotic drugs. It or just lets the streets roam and get a bag for a woman. Why did the other characters in this film find something to redeem him and tried to help him show his show more about his pathology than any convincing attribute he had worth.
