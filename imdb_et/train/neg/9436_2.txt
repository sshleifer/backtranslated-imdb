Unhinged follows the usual schedule of the early 80s. Pretty young girls in danger. I have to give it to a filmmaker who used a helicopter early on in the road, you think for the second second that production is high quality. Watching the "Unhinged" was like seeing in the amateur classroom through its warming. Some of the most uncomfortable, ill-illuminated, protracted scenes are played with the joy of Overus overdose. I was wondering why they didn't just put the smart cards in the camera, so that the actors didn't change their eyes constantly. The two main girls were probably chosen as their R & D factor rather than talent. Laurel Munson as the main chick Terry is as exciting as color drying. Two naked scenes make the youngsters excited. Janet Penner and Virginia are crazy / horrible daughters and mothers who are cheating when they compete for the worst. Long pause, weird expression, the wrong word, everything is there and it is a pleasure for those who love bad movies. The scenes suddenly move with a long darkening that could drive the Mack truck. Cartoon lightning strikes over the shots without even disturbing the sky. Eyes of eye shadows are attacked by the viewer. But you know it grew in me. I was sorry for that. I wanted to hug it, kiss it in boo-boos and make it better. The end does not damage the damage caused, but I am still talking. I have my own theories about the "forbidden" leap and I hope that anyone who decides to watch this movie will do so with an important drug addiction and sense of humor. Otherwise I will pass.
