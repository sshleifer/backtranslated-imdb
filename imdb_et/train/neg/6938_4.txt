In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman. She meets her in her restaurant. Younger woman, Taboo, floped with her. She doesn't know what to do and asks her. His reaction to his invitation is rather strange. Have been funny. <br /> <br /> And it bothers me for this whole movie. It wasn't that funny. The jokes and the script were terrible! The only joke I liked was the waiter's teeth, but several times, even the one that started wearing. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. It was a strange relationship! Little girl in old woman's mind! It was scary! I know someone can be attached to a child, but this person has conversations with that child. It didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Taboo's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do it. So even the conversation at the end when they sit around the table, even the one that was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I just like movies that are really funny. I guess I'll never watch this movie.
