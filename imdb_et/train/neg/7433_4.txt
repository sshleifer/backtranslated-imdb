I have to be completely honest, first of all, that I sleep somewhere in the middle, so I can't give a complete view of the movie until I can see it completely. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), are going to make a fortune that steals a contraceptive pill delivery at the Finisham maternity hospital. This is where the title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works with the staff of Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and sister Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also around, including pregnant Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous father-to-be husband, Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Bill Maynard also plays as Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. By the way, this plan does not follow this path, because all the staff are on their way. That's pretty much what everyone says about the movie until I see it again completely. Okay!
