This "movie" is rather a music video. In his interview in 2004, Kusturica said that when she was making films, she knew music, and when she made music she knew movies. The best thing about "Promise me this" is the music written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In the same interview, Kusturica said that in her films, dialogues are similar to noise. "Let me do it" is very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle". It was like a music video in the first 30 minutes and at some point later, but it was a beautiful plot. "Let me do it" is not a plot. I had been expecting this movie with great expectations because I read that script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes for great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noisy" and with my regret I only saw two dialogues that I can identify with Ranko Bozic. The second part of the script was used by the director for the music of his son Stribor to make his chaotic music video. "Black cat white cat" said in an interview that Kusturica did not follow the script. The "black cat cat" was the only script about which Kusturica said she didn't touch it. According to Gordan Mihic, after Kusturica returns the script and if he does not, he will not make a good movie. And I think it's so "a promise to me this". He should have followed Ranko Bozic's manuscript. The comic moments are the same style as the "black cat white cat" but not at all funny. I think the difference stems from the fact that "Black cat white cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. Movie.
