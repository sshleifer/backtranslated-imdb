Why else would he do that to me? Or even decent movies. I saw Loista and Clark, I am aware of how ... "good" Dean Cain is. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is a cheesy flick, and every cheesecake has a special way to make you scratch your head. I'm not calling these spoilers because you can't really spoil this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> First of all ... why is this a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How does one scientist from Chicago and another scientist from LA and neither could be more Eastern Europe than they would try? How hard would it be to become an American actress or just change it into a flat state sheet, what movie will tell us that these people aren't American? <br /> <br /> Why is it twice when a movie gives us a slug? Later, we get a soundball day and then a fairground. And then that's the one who cares about the timeline. Frankly, who cared for it, even if they mentioned it, but I think it is next to the point. <br /> <br /> Can a movie really get better if you can view it through multiple shared screens? There is no answer. <br /> <br /> This dragon can certainly walk underneath this hall. Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst end of film history? It was a direct scooby doost. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... let's say you want dinner? Of course, but not in some Chinese places .... with a dragon! H HA HA HA !! IF HA HA !! HAHA HA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! IF HA! <br /> <br /> My god, it made me nervous, it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never be afraid. the whole building exploded ... and nobody was alive ... for some reason, there is another intact, unmanned lab that stayed pretty well so they could continue. Hurray to all of us. <br /> <br />
