This movie was recently released on local television in South Africa, and I thought I'd warn even those who enjoy B-class bad movies (what I'm doing) that it's not even fun. The plot concerns a couple visiting a country house. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film made in the early seventies consists of an extremely wide walk, in real time and terribly slow from A to B. This makes the movie annoyingly extreme and the expected blood and gore profitability just won't happen. I'm really curious - how many people have been following it from start to finish?
