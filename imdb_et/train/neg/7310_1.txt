** SPOILERS BELGIUM !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever is my anniversary movie ... that I've seen it. This movie is straight GARBAGE! There's so much wrong in the movie that you can't help but be surprised how bad it really is. This film had so many opportunities to be good, but in the end it did nothing. The characters were both stupid and none; for the whole movie, do you ask yourself why you would do it? or "what is your idea of ​​doing this?" ... this is both illogical and stupid characters. We don't get them as backgrounds, so of course you don't give your rats $ ... ... you could just laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - For example, "bitch" (Marcy) ... was she horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? It didn't make any sense ... it's almost the same as filmmakers would need to apologize to give him a virus so voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Does anyone really go into the wood and drink water from the cockpit mixer without first looking at it? <br /> <br /> - Why is Bert just sick of a sick boy from the beginning? The film would have been like that ... after all, they finally killed him. <br /> <br /> - Why did they take so long to finally leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? "No, I just wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one flashing away from death) to finally walk there. <br /> <br /> Pure STUPIDITY! <br /> <br /> I swear that common sense was not a friend, much less for these ideas.I do not think the film has ever been worse off. At the end of the movie, 3 young black people (dressed in clothes, one of which is du-rag) go to the store to find out that the cashier cleaned it so that they could be used for hunting. to give them all nails and handshakes and fun with them as they would be at home. <br /> <br /> Okay, what HELL was the place where ???!?!? Who thought of it in the film? the original Nigger comment. It was a tasteless and pointless note. My question to filmmakers: what was it that ended with Black children? Was it to force me to forget the earlier racist commentary? Making things smoother with black viewers, making it fun? Well, I didn't find this pathetic attempt with humor a little bit funny. The whole movie was a joke .... PATETE AFTER movie making, which shouldn't be given to the clock. Peter Jackson really thought this film was so good? What movie did he look at? <br /> <br /> ZERO * **** stars .... if I could give it a lower rating. Please, ladies and gentlemen, IMDb'ers, do not waste 1 1/2 hours of your valuable life watching this "movie" abomination. This is one of the worst films I've seen.
