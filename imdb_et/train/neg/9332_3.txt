In fact, this is not a terrible film, Glenn and Keitel are top performers. In addition, they work with a very weak script. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting turns. What's more, I understand why these participants and the team made the film, they are professionals and get paid for it. But I don't know why studios spend time and money on making a movie and then don't release it to the theater audience? Even if the movie is a flop in your inbox, it's definitely money. If you're a fan of Keitel or Glen, rent a video or get it on TV as I do. This film does not help to solve the immigration quandary with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of the standard TV fare today.
