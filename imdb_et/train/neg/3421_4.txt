ATTENTION: ***** Works **** simply forget the ***, which is a bit bit ** between the * behind * Lace <br /> <br /> Some plutonium is missing and some very disgusting people now exist tools to develop a bomb capable of destroying wholesalers, such as Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his stormy young defender Deke (Judson Mills, the second actor of the previous film) with the help of Que (Jennifer Tung), daughter of Joshi It was another film about terrorism a year after the September 11 events. Norris himself filmed in 2001, commenting on how hard the line-up of the film resembled the events that took place in New York that day, so there would have been those who would have liked a movie where Norris and his side kick kick some terrorist ass other. Other than that, it's as interchangeable as Norris has ever been. This will make you think about the original start, that it would be another, and whether it could become President's 3, it may soon come out. <br /> <br /> If you have seen a Norris movie, you have seen them all and there is really nothing new or unexpected that happens, but at least you know what you can and I said it might have been some of which need to drain the steam. **
