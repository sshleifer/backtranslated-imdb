It's a crappiest movie I've ever seen, but it's fairly traceable and pretty funny. I don't think filmmakers would want this to be your typical Hollywood quality of fear. It's just a stupid movie about a serum killer that gets into a toxic waste load, causing a reaction with him and the snow (as it is in the middle of winter). Then he becomes a snowman that is enough to make you laugh. This movie is really stupid, but it's funny. The killings are fun. I wouldn't recommend you to buy and buy it (as I did - the cover seemed good!), But if it happens on television for one night and you're laughing, then paste it on.
