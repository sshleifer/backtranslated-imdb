Interestingly, how 90% of high-voting reviews consist of "* random user *" from "United States" (not a pride of the state?), Who all say exactly the same exact grammatical style and precision. all with exactly the same lack of complete taste in movies. I would deepen this suspicious trend, but unfortunately it is a review of the film, not a review. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a real enthusiastic film fan. That means I have seen a lot of movies, from good to bad, and I can wholeheartedly say that a giant face is NOT a good film. He has good intentions, but it does not meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with high quality film experience. <br /> <br /> Action: Mostly terrible, delicious at best. Listening to the fact that most of them were probably volunteers would not surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> Dialogue: clumsy, cheesy, the script comes out as a long version of some of the cheeses you would see on Sunday school or in the youth group function. Rave Review Robots are in the absence of "meaningless words", but the cold hard truth is that such words are part of the real world and its complete absence is felt. Let's just say that the national team's average team coach would say much more than "OH NO!" if things don't go their way. <br /> <br /> Plot: Mind-bogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this movie is "not a Hollywood clich√©", but it's like it was drawn directly from the Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including a mandatory quas-romantic sub-block for women) and it is the Christian-themed paint. I am not lying or bragging when I say that I had almost every major detail on the plot as well as the sub-site, which will be tied right after their start. Only someone who has never seen a decent sport movie throughout their lives would be emotionally blended with the story here. <br /> <br /> Managing / Editing: It was also patterned almost exactly after the general Underdog Sports Film Model. Still, if left unoccupied, there were not many noticeable graves so that at least the giants were technically competent. <br /> <br /> Message: Ask Jesus and He Gives You All Your Desires. Part of my hope that this film will end with a possible defeat of the team to really emphasize the whole "If we lose, we will praise you" because in Real World you are unable at one moment or another and it is good to be ready for it. But if you can't face the world, if nobody can, someone will win or cheat. Another interesting question is, what if the eagles met another team who had received religion? Would they stay in the chain of infinite amazing games and last minute savings, or would the universe just explode? The bottom line: hardcore for the conservative crowd of Christian parents who complain about Hollywood's evil, another mediocre-best-Christian film facing giants that keeps making a contemporary movie as a pedestal as a preferred model. For all others, the effects range from boredom to the desire to see something else. And the warning: Every attempt to show it to non-Christians does not change, but hits. I give it to two stars, one for a scene where I didn't have my eyes, and the other for a low technical budget.
