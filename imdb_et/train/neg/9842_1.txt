It seems that everything in this movie is directed by Woody Allen. They beat and pause and beat something. Only for DeNero truly dead fans! She tries to appear nervous and artistic - but it looks like a very small budget for very students. The most commonly used word for a movie is "hum". The film is in the late seventies at the beginning of the seventies. If you like movies where people are constantly talking to each other, terrible lighting (even if it is "in the interest of art") and makes you feel like sitting in a flat political meeting, you might like it - but you really have to be bored. I found this CD dollar in the trash and now I know why.
