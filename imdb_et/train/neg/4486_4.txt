What the hell was that all about? I saw the matrix and was surprised. It was once made the most remarkable film. What Wachowski's brothers are doing in this movie is mine. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can't argue against it. Basically, all this movie was a talk and not get me wrong, I have no problem with talky movies, but all the talk about Matrix Reloaded was a useless burden on the tachograph. Then there would be a struggle that lasted too long, meaningless, then another fighting scene that would last too long and that would ever be the biggest anti-climax. A small beard man who speaks 20 minutes of incomprehensible bull load. <br /> <br /> Also, Keanu Reeves gives you the worst results. I knew he wasn't a good actor, but it wasn't fun. If you look at his films in the order he was, he seems to have gradually worsened when they went. God knows what his presentation is like giving something! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden board ever to become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the glory of the first movie, it came as a massive burst. If you haven't already seen the first movie, I suggest you watch it, but don't waste your time on this perfect pile. <br /> <br />
