I think it would have been a much better film if Cajun were depicted in a more credible light. My family comes from the southeast of Louisiana and I live in the southeast of Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I've never heard of people I grew up talking to like these people. The Cajun were depicted upside down. Most of the known cajunans are well educated, proud people and not at all educated when they talk about how these people did. All in all, it was an OK movie with great landscapes and music. I understand that the writers were near the lake on Lake and have knowledge of the area, but on the love of all things in Cajun, we ask the participants to learn this language, live among the people you imagine, and understand how they are before you try to act like they. In my opinion, if the actors believe they are that person, this is a much more enjoyable film!
