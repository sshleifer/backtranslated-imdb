To be honest, they made five shillings as well as a sixteen year budget, but the dialogue was over 9 pounds of emmental and CGI was now a small old hat. Suddenly, if some actresses were not cut as perfectly as granite, she would have made the film a little better. If you say that it was terrible, it is a misuse of the movie if you want to see something that is completely executed, you have to sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching "sickle", which makes it so amazing that it is amazingly terrible, its really good (many big alcoholic drinks are still nice. Any way, I enjoyed this movie and it's worth seeing if you haven't seen it yet, just don't expect anything from "yazassi park, lost world" or "apocalypto".
