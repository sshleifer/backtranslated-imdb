The first lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just 'style' doesn't sell. I think Tashan's translation means style. Secondly, if you are in hell to sell a style, it will not save you from having a decent story. But it's not slippery. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points. However, this setting is not used correctly. Their stories could have been better and matched. The sequences of operations date back to the seventies. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the movie is terrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just walked through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar has created a good score, but it doesn't belong to this movie. Why is Tashan a Sufi Song (Dil Haara)? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not Anil Kapoor when he's English crazy? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is a sustainable film. But he's in his stereotype himself. You don't mind this movie.
