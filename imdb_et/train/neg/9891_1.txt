I think the biggest disappointment of this film was that until the end I waited for the actors to act as instructors to get rid of and apologize for how bad the actor was. When you consider a powerful topic, brilliant landscapes and efforts to create a wonderful set of great pictures, it is a shame that little attention was paid to acting. <br /> <br />
