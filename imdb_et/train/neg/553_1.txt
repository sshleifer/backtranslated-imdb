After an unexpected wait, I have to say that I would not have joined the whole series. The final episode was all about the previous seven years. It's all ruined. The trip was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the right to reduce it ... just seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? The crew members died throughout the trip. Why does he just want to save seven? Others don't read or what? The most ridiculous part when the team says that getting home is not the most important thing for them. As the saying goes, "the trip is more important than the destination". Unbelievable. And in the final scene, other Federation ships and Earth are in sight. Something about landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst end ever.
