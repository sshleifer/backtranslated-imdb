I must say that it was a bit embarrassing for a "cowboy king"; The picture made in 1948 appeared ten years after Roy Rogers' first pictures were starred. As such, Roy's character becomes a bit uneven with his female star Jane Frazee, who alternates her fidelity between Roy and Robert Livingston. The whole story seems to be confusing, not forgetting the opportunities that could have been an entertaining hour. Like the legend of the Hangman Hotel, which says that a hung man lives at midnight. With Andy Devine in Cookie Bullfinch, if you think this story could be a little bit of a runway. Instead, you have some complicated procedures that would be better served if it had been Bowery Boys. It was a sad attempt to haunt the hotel trick based on the poor old Genevieve, who is told the truth, ending up more on screen than Trigger, with whom the contract is in "Smartest Horse Films," nothing to say. And then you have Foy Willing and his Purple Sage riders who will replace Bob Nolan and the sons of the pioneers of your musical interior. I don't know about you, but it was already one and a half pictures and I was still looking for Pat Brady - oh! <br /> <br /> However, it was still an interesting element when you looked hard enough and it turned out to be Roy's Trigger's sporty dismantling, still in the hands of bad guys. OK, this was probably a double stunt, but I haven't seen it in a few hundred western worlds before that. <br /> <br /> Jane Frazee respects women as a picture of her four other films that matched Roy's 1947/1948. "Under California Stars," he released Andy Devine's cousin, Caroline Bullfincher. You are never quite convinced on what side he gets into this story, as he starts to pretend he is someone he is not, and strikes a good luck almost at random. <br /> <br /> Fans of old Laurel and Hardy films may be so surprised when I saw James Finlayson here as Sintown Sheriff. I would have wanted a little more comedy that was written for his role, but he played it right away. I had to think when he was all the time, why he and the old Vanderpool (Charle Coleman) broke the mining shaft with a cookie if there was no reason for that. I think it's just a way to figure it out as much as I thought it went to the rest of the picture. I hate this to be harsh, but if you have seen Roy Rogers enough, you need to know that it was not one of his finer efforts. <br /> <br /> Sintown - I don't know if it's the same place that grew up in Sin City?
