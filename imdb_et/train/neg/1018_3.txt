There is a great reason why Edison went straight to the video: it would crumble together in landed theaters. The film lasted too long and was boring. Just a freezer (lower) (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who probably had two weeks before their next films), the bad guys are ridiculous and act almost as non-existent as Justin Timberlake. I hate to knock the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better. The movie is not all bad ... just for the most part. I like LL Cool J being given what seems to be the leading man. He deserves it. And unlike his own music and his fellow citizen, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable (you see him several times when he chews the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to raise this flick to three stars (out of ten ... he's not good). <Br /> <br /> When all is said and done, the final mistake of this movie is that it is a daily and tiring poppycock of pseudo-action that can't keep anyone awake. Nor can anyone give any sign of any character. All in all, it's just boring. When you say that, rent it when you have insomnia.
