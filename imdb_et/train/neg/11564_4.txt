An Italian horror / intermediate campaign with a rich English lord traveling to red-haired girls and pubs, like her recently-dead wife, Evelyn. You know she must have really loved her wife because she brings them to her home - a large, rotting castle - and puts them down and then tortures them, whips them and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this movie for me was that at the end of the movie we see that this man is playing HERO by Antonio De Teffe. Anyway, De Teffe will soon live in the advice of her playboy-uncle Roberto Maldera with the girl she meets with her uncle. He moves and strange things start to happen with De Teffe's weak mental state. He starts to see and hear his dead wife and finally, look, look at the title if you are still curious. Family members and friends will also die in the most brutal fashion. Poor aunt Agatha (she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they are in a wheelchair and trying to look old) miserably fits her destiny. The second person is injected and then buried alive. And of course there is a complete explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some things quite well: the film's settings are well suited for this film, although they try to believe that England is at best ridiculous. No participant will see English. Many who have dark black hair and Mediterranean landscapes and wear clothes would not be an Englishman. Cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that happened, however, has been cryptographic games and I liked the resolution of the cheese. Of course, all the movies with the nervous, red head Erika Blanc are always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion; but I found a somewhat terrible idea that torture of women was pretty good and healthy to relieve one of his spiritual demons. C'mon.
