I bought it (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the heading "Gray Matter". Seeing Sherriff Roscoe in his new role as a non-DukesOfHazzard interested me. As other warnings warned, this is a rather boring story of the highly secret government experiment that has passed. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are lots of pictures, especially in front of the house with a swimming pool. Some characters and interiors are so vague. I think filmmakers are worried that we might forget who is who, so they keep us away, first showing the exterior of the buildings. It's actually funny. After some time, the pool image looks like a TV channel station identification that reminds us that we are looking at "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed calling two names. At one point, the angry test object frustrates responsible, calling him a b * tch! It's just a very inadequate insult. How many scenes later will the second issue let off steam as its scientific b ** tard! It just sounded very uncomfortable to me. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will disappear forever. Ten years later, it is probably impossible to find copies of it. Almost like it never happened. <br /> <br />
