This is the second Northeast Florida production that has been filmed mainly on Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was quite surprised that the company was able to take over the head of Fernandina Beach when it was necessary to achieve street scenes. The film is beautiful and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute but moving. Eileen Brennan goes further. Good for young children or those who like high doses. 4 Miller Movie Formula.
