"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who has won his rights, because Adam and Eve started a system with a loose leaf." When "Politics" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, which gives women the right to vote, was only ten years old. And the film deals with the use of women's political power as voting rights. Supporting the ban and closing call restrictions at that time was a major concern for women. eligible. He wants the sale of liqueurs to be closed; and has been prepared for the mayor, having given a powerful speech at the women's rally. Ms Dressler is supported by her tenants, the best friend Polly Moran (like Ivy Higgins) and her beating wife Roscoe Ates (Peter Higgins). Dressler's order to Mayor of City City draws answers from men in town; so dressler tells women to strike, denying them "everything" in the "cabin, bedroom and bath". <br /> <br /> Film sounds much better than it turned out. Frankly, humor is not too good; and it contains some pointless and moderately offensive situations ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to Amos and Andy's character). And shuffling and slapstick is not good at this time. Manufacturers could consider making the film more dramatic, focusing on Dressler and William Bakewell (like Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (Myrtle Burns) players. <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7 / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
