This is one of those films that are trying to be moody and tense, and ultimately collide around you. Having seen it at the film festival, I was interested in writing a "young college triad gone wrong", but the overall ended up quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> "True Story" because there is not much to do about the plot - but I found it inseparable, melodramatic and completely depressing. It is dark and almost sinful, painting seventy scary blinds that represent music and stabbing close-ups. It just doesn't work - some scenes where so exciting that instead of scaring off my applause, my audience pressed the scars and running eyes. <br /> <br /> The story is an interesting assumption, but it just spins in the dark, an unhappy spiral.
