When the Oscar Academy Prize Festival was a strange thing, it won the flick. It has all the gods, a great testimony, extreme special effects with extremely good acting skills and, of course, a celebrity superstar in every role. Well, it can be a scenario if the world was turned, but it is not. Instead, this is the worst horror flick ever made, not only by the bad actors who seem to read scripts on the teleprinter with bad dyslexia, but also with very low special effects. For example, the fucking costume (which by the way is black-and-see) is the most fun I've ever seen. When I saw this red black monster on the screen, I couldn't hold my laugh. And it seemed that the funny creature was transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake as me. Checking if IMDB saw that the movie was released in 2003 was less than five votes and thought: - "Well, it's worth shooting, can't be so bad." <br /> <br /> Yes, it may be. <Br /> <br /> I'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.
