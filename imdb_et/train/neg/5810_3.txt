SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Gettaway is mostly an action movie. And what action is needed !! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and more. He marks Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I haven't seen the original, but I really don't care about it, even though Bassenger and Baldwin have a nice screen of chemistry. But the film itself didn't do it for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway really got tired quickly. The plot is overshadowed by one struggle behind another and when violence prevents, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their excellent appearance, no matter what risks they may bring. In fact, in the end the film is almost better than the beginning. I don't think Bassenger's eyeball moves once during the picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but not, but it's not very good and no one has a movie clip that I don't really see to enjoy this movie because it's not just here much. Gettaway is also not terribly original and goes all the way from unnecessary to brutal. It would have been better than I thought. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give OK performances, but they don't have much to do except when they are pursuing and living. Sometimes it is less, after it is the same and seen again, it becomes old. Didn't enjoy that much.
