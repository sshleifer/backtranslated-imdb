The special effects of this film are especially ridiculous for their time and are used with excessive emphasis that you cannot deny your terrible existence. <br /> <br /> Again, the concept of "terrible overactivity" is in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff redefined "bad". <br /> <br /> Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Its fascination with this movie can be found in two things. First, Carel "Lurch" is Struycken's excellent casting as a mysterious psychic Gaunt, who can feel where and when people die and is always there. <br /> <br /> The second is the original findings, the SF-Western combination is obviously original, as terrible, but other findings are more original, such as Zack Stone, who is capable of knowing the pain of his people being fired (although his action is short here) ). <br /> <br /> Overal ... doesn't see this movie unless you love this hunky-brutal Carel Struycken, like every Dutchman who respects himself.
