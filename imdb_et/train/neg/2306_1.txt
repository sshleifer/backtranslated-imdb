It seems amazing to me what the people who gave it saw that I didn't. Watching and / or staying in this movie is very difficult. If someone tells you it's comedy, don't be fooled, it's about 98% odd and 2% comedy. All actors are turning to high performance, which cannot be denied, but it seems to have lost something. Don't know if the original script was good and needs to be edited or what. It had the potential and it was actually a flop. I would really like a year and a half ago when I invested in this movie, but the rental place for the video is not returned on time. Save your money and see something else.
