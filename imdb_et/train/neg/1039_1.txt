This "movie" is one of the most terrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please take advantage of yourself and avoid this incompetent cookie. <br /> <br /> Camera shaking and actresses take fools are not considered "direction" what this film needs droves. Not that writing was all wonderful, rather, we were left with a number of completely artificial signs directed to this most artificial way (the "style" of the pseudo-document, which is appreciated by those who do not know how to direct it). > <br /> This movie gives the impression that it has been cynically made to appeal to critics who do not know the first thing about making a film (which is the majority of them). <br /> <br /> Just terrible. It says a lot about Sundance and what it got there, that Victor Vargas was there.
