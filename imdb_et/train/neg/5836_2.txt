From the pen of Richard Condon (Manchurian Candidate 1962), this confusing story of political intrigue and murder comes. The story that was almost spoken by the comic book is hard to swallow. All the letters cast are weighed, this bad effort is not completely cast and team fault: the novel was full of the same drawbacks. It seems that sometimes the story actually strikes a commitment from "Manchuri Candidate". Disappointment for all the stories.
