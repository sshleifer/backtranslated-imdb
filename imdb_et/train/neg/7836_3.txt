The first episode set the bar quite high. He played William Hurt as a hit who has killed the killer. We are given very little information about our character or who pays him to kill, but this episode is remarkable because there is no dialogue at all. Returning to his modernist penthouse apartment, he is given a pack of toy soldiers that gives him a smile, but leaves it back and goes to his business. But he's staying in the hell at night, the soldiers are alive and intend to fight, flying jeeps, firearms and bazookads, and even flying helicopters! Special effects are good for the TV show, and it becomes quite tense when it keeps the apartment around, using its pointlessness to survive, sometimes getting its upper hand and not at other times. I'm not breaking the end, but it's enough to say it was a clever little twist. It gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all garbage and I lost my fourth interest. Stephen King's adjustments are always a mixed bag and they are no exception
