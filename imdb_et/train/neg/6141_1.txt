One night I waited for my friends to come back and "Gymkata" happened; I watched it too much. It's really fun and terrible. Think about it - if your work had the idea of ​​doing something bad and continuing it in such a terrible way as how long do you do exactly? Not as long as this movie. It's obviously black.
