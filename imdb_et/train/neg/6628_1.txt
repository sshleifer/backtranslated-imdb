If the scale remained negative, I'd be happier. See that Sushmita Sen was great and Nisha Kothar has a bright future, but the producer and director destroyed all and all the pleasures of this story. Choosing the corners, the choice of lighting and everything that is a story is confusing. Oh, if the songs and the dances have not caused your ears to come off your head. The film could have been done twice for 1.25 hours, and it was pretty good, like "The Seven Samurai", but the director and writer didn't go in that direction, even if "urban people" would eventually find their backbone and would like to help. This film does not succeed on so many levels: editing, writing, corners of photography, style, lighting, script - mentioning all aspects of this film - that was BAD - probably the food of the caterer was too bad. I've never been watching Indian (Bollywood) movies for six years, something that was seen to have been done badly.
