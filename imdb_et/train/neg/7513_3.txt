What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler alarm" and then "reveal" that they used the F-word LOT in this movie - like every two sentences. I didn't like this movie at all - too many clues about sexual perversions, evasion, and cheating. And this swearing was completely out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of them are Mira Sorvino's sexy movement on the dance floor.
