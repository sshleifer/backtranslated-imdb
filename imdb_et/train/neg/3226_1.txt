We have reached the ceiling of the unreliability of this film. Basically, the dinosaurs come to this ship, led by some strange old youth, called Neweyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Obviously, Neweyes hears the child's desires everywhere and decides that he should give the children the desire that dinosaurs bring modern time so that everyone can see them shamelessly exploited. Dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter (too bad that the scriptwriters didn't have it). By the way, does it seem strange that from all the desires of children in the world, Neweyes wants to bring dinosaurs to the present? Why not give children the desire to stop the famine? Disease? War? I mean come! Does Neweyes have anything better than he has this power? Finally, when the dinosaurs reach modern times, they start singing, dancing and destroying the devastation (basically the thing you see on a bad LSD trip, I mean, where else could you see the T-Rex playing golf and jumping on the balloon) ?). They reach the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) make kids who are friendly with dinosaurs sign a blank contract. Why? Why should children sign an empty contract? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some ... "Brain-Drain" To let the kids go. Dinosaurs, instead of destroying the evil Screweye limb limb, give in and accept his terms. What ?! It's stupid! They could just have threatened him, forced him to give up the contract, eat it, and then with the children. I think the filmmakers tried to show that violence is bad, which is debatable when the dinosaurs finally end up and a bunch of crows surround Screweyes and probably eat it completely. Oh yes, it's not violent at all! We're back, it doesn't make sense, it's not fun, it's funny, it's stupid, badly written, and contains some of the biggest movie openings. Even for a child's movie, it's BAD.
