Omen 4 had a good idea on the surface. It is nice to see that the devil child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as well as the exorcist, when girls are in possession or are hell, it is very effective. But Omen 4, it collided. <br /> <br /> Delia doesn't make me think she could be a fucking child, she's a child with problems. The questions that maybe only a therapist might be a priest could help. He does not see the scary or the devil. Rather, he sees dusk and mood. <br /> <br /> This movie was potential and when it was done by the same people who had done the three previous jobs he could work on. But it is rather offensive to do the next one of the most beneficial horror trilogues, as it is for a special TV movie. <br /> <br /> On so many levels, it's down. It is cheap looking, acts hammish and the effect is typical of TV drama. Characters do not produce any compassion and you do not route them. I recently looked at it after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it's out of date. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, I would recommend that you don't. Look at one another or look at an exorcist or look at a good son. Just don't waste your time on this brilliant!
