This film was rather disappointing. After a very slow, very intense (and quite large) start, the film will begin to lose. Too many parcels leave too little time to explain, and leaving the theater wondered what it was all about. The characters remain low, the story is not at all convincing, most are déja vù without parody, and some very fragile parts ... Like a young policeman, dig a body. Of course it is night and rain and he has to do it alone ... awake! Or the appearance of Evil is the Nazis and the "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, this is really original. However, there are some nice bits, such as the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (although Reno and Vincent Cassel are doing what they get), it's definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
