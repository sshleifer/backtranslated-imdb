First of all, let me say that this must be on the list of my boring films. Something, and I don't think anything about this movie is not even far from exciting. Most of them are very confusing and if it is progressing, you just want it to end! Some people want a movie that makes them all "think" to which I say ... "More power for you" !! On the other hand, I just want to entertain. That brings me back to the smelly entertainment that isn't. This movie is stupid and a waste of time. Here too, most seem to agree. Most of it didn't make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene, I thought the second flat scene would come around and .... well, I think you will see where it goes. Avoid this, it sucks .... bad!
