(Spoilers) It's a terrible movie. First of all, this man is average. I think he's made a career in playing super-revolutionary fathers. It was OK when he tried to scare his son for the first time, when you pretended he was a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they pursued it again! And it goes, this movie is moving in torture in real time. At one point I started shooting days later until I was reminded that the story was only the next day ... at the beginning of the afternoon! I'm not quite sure who this couple should be in real life. First, they are presented as a Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and was a boy. But they run the old blue Volvo. These species stopped Volvo for decades. Today they run bonuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they're not going to drive Volvo. The "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a small magical Wendigo shape and tells him his powerful magic. Are we still making ancient Indian secrets? Just to travel home, they put every Indian statue into a trap for their tourists in New York City. The American Indians are depicted in a way not seen in this film for decades! Oh, and Wendigo. He is not really the cause of horror. He did not kill the child's father, who is the most terrible thing in the movie ... he's just killed by the usual hick and high power rifles. Wendigo appears late in the movie to get his father, but to wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was crazy for his father, perhaps because he killed a deer ... so Wendigo must be happy that his father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so it goes ... offensive, boring and pointless. There is no reason to watch this movie at all.
