Anyone with a good knowledge of German cinema will surely say that in the past there have been many films about a young girl who have worries with both her mother and her boyfriend.If such a movie has been shown to people again, it would definitely click when it is today new, fresh and exciting for challenging audiences. This also applies to the German filmmaker Sylke Enders, because his main character, Kroko, has been mistreated around him, including his mother and boy. He is brave enough to meet any punishment because he has tried his hand in all kinds of crimes, including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot from DV to be later shot in 35 mm format. This technical virtuoso doesn't stop our joy when we learn that Kroko wants to become a policeman because he feels he is reluctant to get the grinder's hairdresser. If anyone were to say Sylke Ender's film on the positive side, it might be Kroko's involvement with disabled people as a result of punishment. joys and worries.
