I and my girlfriend went to see this movie as "Premiere Surprise", which we bought on a ticket preview for the movie before it was opened here in Denmark. We were sitting after the first hour and then we left! The idea of ​​the film seemed to be just a depiction of the era (and the club 54), but it took place at the expense of the character development lacking, and the plot of which there was little. <br /> <br /> Fear has been so indifferent to movie characters. <br /> <br /> The music was good. So if you want to hear good music and get that 70's mood, I think it's OK. But don't wait for you to get credible signs. <br /> <br />
