This movie rivals "Plan 9" as one of the eternal films. Always be concerned if the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western "stuntmen". So maybe it was a problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example of a movie: the sheriff has to be a witness to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys are learning and waiting for them. But what happens? The good guys sail along and shot the ring and hit the tree near them. If the camera shows us bad guys, they all just sit in the log, talk. What's wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I can go on. Maybe this movie was meant for comedy. If so, it didn't do well.
