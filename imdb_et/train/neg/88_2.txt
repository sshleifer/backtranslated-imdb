I was very much looking forward to this movie. His good family film; but if Michael Landon Jr's editing team had improved the work, the film would be much better. Too many scenes left out of context. I hope there is another movie in the series, they are all very good. But when the other is done, I ask that it be better to take care of editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to be in the middle. What's unfortunate because other series movies were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they are both great examples. In addition, the romantic side of viewers is always a story of good love.
