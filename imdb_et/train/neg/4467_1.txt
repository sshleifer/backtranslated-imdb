<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides which category the movie fits, but this movie is not a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but rather slow. I was particularly disappointed, though it ended. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why he is driving his uncle on the ground? He knows exactly what is happening at the moment, and he has a video tape to prove. Instead, he runs from there on and starts running and says, "I know everything, I have evidence! You didn't expect evidence, did you?" Then he will be surprised to see his uncle stand up and start walking over him if he hurts him. Well DUH! Of course he is going to harm you, you just told him you know everything and you have evidence to reveal everything. What a stupid ending.
