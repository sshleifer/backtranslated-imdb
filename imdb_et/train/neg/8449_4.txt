what is a superfluous story, murder writing, sexual accusations, gays and catholic church ..... absolute fear. How is it that most of the UK TV shows, seating combinations, etc., must include the obligatory Gay, which is really tiring now. Everyone accepts that homosexuals in society are just other minority groups, but we do not want it to hit our throat (I will pass it on) for each exhibition. In addition to the above, the drama of what could have been an interesting little story of a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile, and there are gays between everyone, oh yes, to be completely PC, one gay couple was black. I'm surprised to c ecclestone even contemplating it when he read the script.
