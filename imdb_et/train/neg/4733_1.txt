I can't believe I actually sat the whole thing. This movie is the worst of Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here's a short description of the plot: The movie is started by Jojo and the other chick who is sitting around the beach and hesitating over the skinny blonde hair "hunk" who looks like he hasn't been in the gym for a day in his life . Somehow, everyone knows her and every single chick in the movie wants her. UH OH! Here comes the competition! Stereotypical "hot chick" and his best friends who drive an ugly pink car. Soon we will discover that Jojo's mother got a lifetime job in Australia, which means that Jojo should move and leave his best friend (oh, I think I'm crying). There will be a huge storm and will fill your pool with nasty water. Somehow, for some apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool and comes face to face, yeah, you guessed it, MERMA This is where the "story" really rises. Basically, they want a mermaid to fall in love with a "hunk". <br /> <br /> This is a preteen flick that works so badly that 80s look like Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the possible clich√©s ... the best friends, the "hunk" who everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and his bitchy friends, the scary old man ... this name is, that's there. I took it for a lot of people looking at it. Think of your hour and 40 minutes of sacrifice for you. Please watch this movie. Don't do it so I went in vain.
