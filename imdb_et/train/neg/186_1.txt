I did not know if I wanted to laugh or shout about the incorrect presentation of Canadian history, especially what was the service done in Yukon, a police-raised history. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it with Pierre Berton. historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon and author of Klondike Gold Speed ​​Final History, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899, to express his surprise with this stupid movie: <br /> <br /> America's idea of ​​the core border looked at six heroes armed with six weapons, continued in Far Country, another story from a cowboy from the west of America, Wyoming this time - driving his cattle herd of pastures. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibility, but the real mismatch is the main premise on which the plot changes? that at the time of the gold speed, only one policeman was installed in Yukon, Canada, and that he could not handle the legality. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their livestock, the customs house is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where's the constable? Brennan asks. <br /> <br /> River. Chilkats' problem," nobody answers. He has a real hard job, this constable. He watches about ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he doesn't get home for two or three months. "The historical truth is that during the golden break in the Yukon territory, the police was the closest thing the British North American had ever seen. In the northwest, the police were placed in the territory for a long time before Klondike struck. all the routes to Yukon and they didn't make any sense. They collected customs, often newcomers, made batteries for navigating the river on the spot, and turned back to men if they didn't have enough supplies or they just looked bad. Dawson strictly followed the Lord's Day law, a crime punished by a fine to reduce his Sunday wood, and plump young women were arrested for what the stolen police called "giving a theater performance", generally more than dancing on the recommended stage too revealing tights <br /> <br /> In such a community, the weapon card was inconceivable. One notorious bad man from Tombstone, who tried to pack a weapon into his hippie, was personally armed from a young constable who was just out of the dead cabin to talk the innocent crime too loud. A bad man left like a lamb but protested when a policeman discovered that he was carrying a weapon, he told him to hand it over. "No man has ever taken me a gun," said America. "Well, I'll take it," the constable said lightly and did it without any additional resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated at Dawson that the police sold as little as a dollar at auction and bought it as souvenirs to keep it on the coat. <br /> <br /> Wasn't a serious crime? not to mention murder? Dawson. The difference with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless city led by Soapy Smith, a Denver Trustee, was remarkable. But in Far Country, Dawson is seen as a community that does not have the law of the nature of Soaps Smith in Skagway? is he in the picture of Gannon? can be easily checked. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border, all his equipment was confiscated and was hidden by the police sergeant immediately). <br /> <br /> {In a movie where a single Mountie says} "Yes, I'm a law. I represent the law in the Yukon territory. About fifty thousand square miles of it." <br /> <br /> "Then why aren't you more?" <br /> <br /> "Because yesterday it was in the desert. We didn't expect thousands to be poured. Now that you're here, we'll protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "Dawson has a post here in early May." <br /> <br /> "What's going on between May and May?" <br /> <br /> "Some of the time." <br /> <br /> "What's the rest of the time?" <br /> <br /> "Choose a good man. Do he act as a Marshal ??" <br /> < br /> Film Mountie leaves and does not appear again. His amazing proposal? that the Marshal of the American city, which is with a tin star, would swear by a group of urban peoples living under British law? has been approved. Of course, they want to make Jimmy Stewart Marshal; he clearly fits the part. But Stewart plays the role of Loner, who takes care of Number One and so another person is chosen to get off. And he does. Others are shooting. Even Walter Brennan gets off. Finally, Stewart reluctantly concludes that he has to stop all shooting with his own shooting. He's pinching a tin star and he and the bully, Gannon, will inevitably break at each other's western tip. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a profound knowledge of the north of Canada, the story goes through a rational belief. <br /> <br />? Extract from Hollywood Canada, Pierre Berton, 1975.
