I'm an avid fan of terrifying movies, my hair is all hair and ridiculous to the right. So imagine your spirit that I went to the local Rent Shop and found vampires vs. zombies. The name is just too much fun, you know that no one in the world can take something like that, it just has to be bad. After watching this horror movie I was literally speechless. I and my palm were sitting outside, not to mention each other for several minutes, both contemplating watching this movie for the future of our life. I broke the frustrating silence with the words: "... guy .... What?" Yes, I'm an appealing individual. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick street overview of "Plot"; "WTF" mode is never present at all. Characters; No development, forgotten. Music; Worse than porn. Vampires; Your Vampires? Zombies; Their Zombies? <br /> <br /> Finally; Everyone should see this film honestly, so bad I see it again. So do yourself a favor, check it out and get depression.
