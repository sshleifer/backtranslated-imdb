Heavy morals. Writers who use characters as humor speak for themselves. Predicted planking points (say five times fast). Child imitation of Britney Spears. This movie has all the signs of a lifetime special rejection. <br /> <br /> I believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo created a thought-provoking, emotional film on a harsh subject, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, so that one who is criminal may not necessarily be a bad person and that there may be mitigating circumstances, especially if the child's welfare is first placed. However, their seriousness is directed to dialogue with the preacher and to trite situations that are planted to move the plot. Decent product values ​​and interesting use of documentary camera material are not enough to achieve their goal when the script and actor gradually fall. <br /> <br /> Logic is often compromised to create tension: the first is trying to blackmail Pablo for his documentary participation in return to help them escape, and at the same time breath tells him he doesn't trust him because he doesn't help them out of altruism. Well, duh. And the man who is running is Pablo too amazing. Cristina's well-being is so important to her that she flees from capture and imprisonment or expulsion, but she is willing to risk everything to calm her if she doesn't want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk about excessive adoption. Third, when Pablo's employer Charlie gives phone to Detective Bright, he is remarkably unprofessional, especially considering his seniority - did he really think he was convincing? Oh, yeah, I would have turned myself on. CCH Pounder Detective Wims can wipe the floor with him. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I would like to list things I like. I liked the dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. There is cross-linking, always plus; juvenile cross-linking, not less! Harry is infinite as Cristina. But my favorite moment in the movie must be when Cristina gets a non-bright detective. In my opinion, it is also interesting that a strong minority (which I very much appreciate) is a black character racist. Too bad is just thrown out there and has not been studied yet. <br /> <br /> There is a characteristic, unusual score, but it is still largely non-specific, not an increase in mood or tension in any scene except pathetic, distracting enthusiasm every time the main character is in distress, as if they think his act does not show it enough: "Just in case you were not sure, he is disturbed and we have musical hints to prove it." <br /> <br /> A clogged, cliche dialogue leads to a subtle lack of subtext; everything has to be written out in the dialogue even when the body language was up, then simply transmitting it. For example, every pointless speech, Pablo, and Mrs Knight's regret that her child will not go to bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> 'Priest, tell me mom again' - a shameless, blatant exposition that introduces a generic dead wife! (She is always the most beautiful woman the widow had ever seen, what she ever wanted to meet. Why don't we see a man crying like a woman like Shakespeare - she may be greasy, ugly, disgusting, but her love for her is deep as the oceans? Now this is the story that would move me.) <br /> <br /> Police are literally one step behind them, giving many scenes the look of a French farce. The most boring footwear has ever been - Bright and Lightning are both in shape and easy to fool (it certainly isn't fast as lightning, and it, well, I don't feel the need to write things). Some men who dragged a small child on a bicycle with a policeman, with a macho-biker who chooses a fight, but then chopped by a child? That's so sad to quote Margaret Choi. Would we see it on "Cops"? <br /> <br /> Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: As an employer, would you really like to give up your green card just because you can quote an inspirational speech on your desk at your desk? <br /> <br /> Plus several scenes, including those mentioned above, threaten to go over to porn: "Well, I'll do it for you if you do something ..." I can almost hear the bowm-chicka bowm bow. <br /> <br /> When parents look at Pablo's regret, the sad mother's freak-out is the most realistic film the film knows. Unfortunately, it has diminished by the fact that it sees its emotional speech down to a full extent until the ballistic evolution. Even more ambivalent would be a more convincing look here. <br /> <br /> I am constantly scared of the foolishness of the main game, who is doing things about things of interest: keeping a neighborhood shop without a mask, visiting a dead girl's tomb. And why didn't she recognize her face when she saw her before she drove away? "You seem awfully familiar ..." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this totally unnecessary, somewhat free event with Soid and an artificially advanced bar? Character Development? Tch. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary features that never went away, the detective flash has to say that the skeptical detective Bright must be Scorpio, showing how little he actually knows about the hidden. And I do not believe that believing in fate qualifies for voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> At the end, when Bright keeps Pablo dying, wait, why is he now caring? His nature is the same as Soid. What, he must shoot him just because he said, "Stop or I'll shoot"? (He has cared for _so_much_ his integrity so far.) He was unarmed. There was no need for deadly force. What's wrong with recording him on foot? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's childish endorsement of her mother's death, giving Dr Knight peace over her daughter's death - so forced. And the family of the family whose child was killed became Cristina's new family ... It frustrates me that she can be a substitute for her little girl. It is also unrealistic for a white couple to take on the Latino daughter of a man who killed her daughter. I'm not saying there are no generous, loving people who would do it. I'm just saying that the signs here have never advanced enough to believe they will do it. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said she was a woman she moved to appear scenes. I am a woman who keeps her emotional movements in moments that do not make spiritual light in a way that is made. <br /> <br /> Co-author, co-director, co-star Nebot said he wore too many hats during this production. Too many cooks can spoil the broth, but one chef alone can ultimately make a post-school special. <br /> <br /> In summary, the title of this movie is a less related story and more related revelation has been a regret, helplessness, and loss that you never see your money again.
