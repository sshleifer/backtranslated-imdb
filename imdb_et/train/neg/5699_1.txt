WOW, this movie was so terrible. I'm so glad I didn't have to watch this terrible movie. It was like a history nut went to the coke to move! its previews showed it properly, but it was really bad. I say that the idea sounded good but came on. it was really very bad. If u sat down and thought about it, you would understand that it was a UNREALISTIC. come back the day u think they had all the things to work with. It was not like Ben franklin sat one day and made a fucking riddle. it was completely ridiculous and what you want to see a bad movie, look at it. All and all true movies can actually be my 10 best films I've ever seen.
