This film is not based on the Bible. It leaves the film of Christ completely out. They do not show the momentum of Christ or the second coming. Not to mention it. It does not quote the scriptures. The end time is called great effort. The film doesn't even show bad times. Seven cups, seven whistles and seven trumpets are boiled with news of up to 15 seconds that have changed from the sea, changing its structure. Anti-Christ was killed in misery for 3 1/2 years, and that's how the movie ended. The only part they got was two prophets. Of course, these names didn't use it because it would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst thing was that I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted people not saved to it. I feel the movie is bad. It's fake like everything the devil is doing. I hope that it will not take away the upcoming film based on the left-hand books. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the film is that it was just bad. Bad performance, bad special effects, bad plot and bad character development. I've seen better episodes of Miami things.
