Completely forgotten. Especially due to weak performance. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise he has been since the late 90s. I thought he was a newcomer because his action was so acute. I could also talk about Liv Tyler. Although I saw him well from other films, he gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Sand is not an actor who gives the character a fiery and emotional personality, as Diane Keaton could, but it was rather strange when she saw her lines whispering. It seemed that there were not very good chemistry among the actors and I think Diane Keaton felt it. He's a fantastic actress, but it just seemed like this movie from above. It seemed like he just wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I don't blame her.
