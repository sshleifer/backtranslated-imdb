I actually saw China's O'Brien II before I saw the original Chinese O'Brien. And I have to say that the first embodiment is actually worse. But: Worse = funny! And more fun = better. If you're a bad movie fan like me, it's a great material. However, if you are looking for a meaningful plot, ability to act, or film making, it's better to avoid it. The best part is how they filmed all combat sequences quickly. Hilariously bad. Watch it laugh, watch this frantic entertainment, but whatever you do, watch it on free TV.
