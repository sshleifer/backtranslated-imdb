Prayer Power of Prayer deceptive cover, title and very small hidden print cheat me on renting this movie. <br /> <br /> It really started well and pulled me in. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 the film has started to throw things that were not created and meaningless. My first thought was, "No one writes who knows how to tell the story." I finished watching the movie parts again, I thought I had something left. <br /> <br /> By the time I reached the last 1/5 of the movie, all that was BORING, ANNOYING, RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG didn't think, said nothing and was annoying to listen; I turned off the sound and made it fast forward. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this flick. <br /> <br /> Beware of DVDs featuring Whitlow movies and level path presentations And I'm a practicing Catholic.
