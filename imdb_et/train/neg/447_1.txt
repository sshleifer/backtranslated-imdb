Well, what can be said about sitcoms. There is often quite a flat, moral dedication and easy. That's the exhibition! It was boring, though Bynes is okay in a surprising way, the rest is just a stereotypical mess ... as always. We've all seen it before and we'll probably see it again when this show is canceled. The reason for this is that this face, mediocre and in itself a fair exhibition. Like most sitcoms are .... <br /> <br /> Well, briefly. If you want to see some good entertainment, you get a twenty minute break in front of the mirror. Have some faces and move on .... Its more entertaining than this show!
