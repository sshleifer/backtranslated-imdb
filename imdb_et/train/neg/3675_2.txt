Really, everything in this movie looks like they want to be elsewhere! No wonder the pain is not done on the left hand, but not at all. I have not seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone, who is an agent carrying a weapon. You don't use a corrupted city-brat image in this role. The only worst thing I imagine is pouring Doris's day as a prostitute. The other majority is also terrible, maybe with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you see him trying, but suffering. Did I mention that this is a totally crazy story? Endangering many people lives because you are divorced and you want to see your family? Well, this must be because the man (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography can be worse.
