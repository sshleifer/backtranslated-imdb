Oh, it really is. I've seen movies that I didn't like for some reason, but I've never seen a movie that just doesn't fit in every aspect of film art. He can't even fail to make a movie, in some ways one could say that New York Hercules. It's not the film I like the least, but it's the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Actors are the first thing to hit you. I've never seen a movie that has been worse off after pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic movies that are better than that. It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. Camera work is amateurish. Editing is pointless. I assume they can't afford the right audio device, and that meant that every car scene (and there are a lot of them) drives them about three miles per hour and every scene outside the same forest boards (and there are a lot of them) is actually dubbed in the studio, again lending more to a bad porn file. <br /> <br /> The plot is meaningless, as many have pointed out. I defend by the vampires walking in the daylight that despite the popularity of Nosferatu, it was never originally part of the vampire myths. <br /> <br /> Speaking of vampire theaters, the writer had probably read Carmilla or at least Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure how I feel how I feel the impressive impression that a movie that is terrible has at least some endeavor for the Gothic novel. or irritates his best slip references and worst of all desecration of the source material. At least "general" is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> However, these two stars will only get because I cannot vote for one star with a movie that has, or at least has, vampires and zombies. By the way, I watched Lifeforce (the second film with vampires and zombies in it) on the same day, and despite the fact that it is a bug with a film, it is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's not such a bad movie, it's good, or so bad that it's somehow enjoyable, even drunk. It's just a mess and it's not worth anyone's time.
