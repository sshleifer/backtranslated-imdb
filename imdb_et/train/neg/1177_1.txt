This movie is a complete mess! Avoid this cellulose residue, it is rambling and inconsistent. I am proud of the depths of the 70s sliding cinema to supply everything from Salost to Salon Kitty. I like to be shocked, but I need a united story. But if a horse companion sees you out of this movie, it's for you. The saddest part was that the functional wang dress was a werewolf. I mean, just to talk about this simple sitting, it's a terrible thing, and the soundtrack is badly dubbed. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (which looks like the hands of gorillas that reach the woman's bare ass) but don't waste your time or money unless you get back.
