I really wanted to like this movie, but I was bored and unbelievable. The first shot is a camera that feeds a robot moving towards the bomb and is naturally shaky. But then the rest of the movies in Shakycam mode, even in quiet moments of conversation, remain ridiculous. Have rental houses run out of statics and steadicams? The fact that it's done is 16mm doesn't help because the whole movie is grainy and shaky. <br /> <br /> Every effort made by Bigelow in precise vehicles and equipment has blurry flaws and contradictions that undermine movie credibility. <br /> <br /> - After one shot, the car does not burn with a flame and at any time it is not extinguished by a small hand held fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - One Humvee will not travel in Baghdad in 2004, but would support other vehicles in the event of a breakdown or attack. - It would be extremely unlikely that you would be able to catch a running rebel over a long distance, where the ball clearly crosses the target to reach the goal. <br /> <br /> - I believe the bombs were moved to designated waste management areas near the base or not at any random location in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - It is said that the oil tanker attack took place in the green zone, a very safe area with very few attacks. The zone is mainly offices and palaces with little residential space, but it is depicted as a dangerous dark alley soldiers and rebellion lurking. Strangely, James will never struggle to make a ridiculous tactic to order his two companions to make his alley alone by creating a robbery attempt. <br /> <br /> - Talking about this, the 3-man team always stands for clearing, rebel, etc., even though there are clearly dozens of soldiers there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does a team have to stare at a dead rebel hanging in the window to find out he hasn't fake it? <br /> <br /> The viewer was about the size and layout of the base or where Baghdad was linked. I had no idea who the EOD team reported, nor any other signs. These are the things the characters would know, so we should. <br /> <br /> Many "surprises" and scenes are completely predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist's colonel is struggling with the Iraqi people he is trying to move on, that the choice of cereal from home is huge and that your abducted driver will not wait for you when you leave. br /> <br /> Finally, there was almost no lack of character. The character of Renner is at home in the beginning, careless and adrenaline dependent. He's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What is this point? <br /> <br /> If this is indeed the best Iraqi movie, it's a pity. Just after half an hour that I saw it, I would recommend HBO Generation Kill instead.
