I had to watch it at school. In summary ... <br /> <br /> Talentless actors, talented scripts and talented director. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of your time. Don't even look at the movie. Do not worry. You're so disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. How wrong he was. She even slept through it a little. The film's actors were just bad. The best actor out there was an old man and it doesn't speak much. This is a terrible example of terrible characters. It is so unrealistic and I can honestly say that it makes no sense. The script was unemployed and confused. There were points in the movie when I wrinkled my fingers and said, "What?" There were just too many loose ties and plot holes. It was just terrible.
