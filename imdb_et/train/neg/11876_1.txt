I think it's almost all I have to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions. I have never, in principle, seen such army production and I mean the word in all senses. While the physical camera is working, the boom MIC and other technical aspects of this movie are ridiculous, unfortunately they are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike classic independent movies that are recorded by these scripts, there is a lot of characterization and plot. Unfortunately, this is a terrible script, terrible action and worst, terrible annoying signs. <br /> <br /> It's a crime that there are 101 other indie movies for each independent movie, which is divided into the Haiku tunnel. which died of silent death. I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers know about Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production ever spreads. I'm quite confused about why they chose it. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie that prevents intrigues is its title. But its cause is even abandoned. I hope this review will save some of the people who are watching this movie title. I've seen a lot of movies during my time, and I'm very much in the cinema, but it was too much. I will never forget the "tunnel" to mark an important point in cinema life. Shame it is such a low point. <br /> <br />
