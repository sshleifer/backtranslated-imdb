I recently looked at landscapes produced at Seattle International Film Festival. I pulled the film into a photographer because I'm both familiar and a fan of Burtynski's work. Although I believe that this film is a good job of spreading this message, I could not feel that it was made after full consciousness in the photographs and the subsequent popular Burtynsky book. This is obviously due to the smooth use of photos, which include their size and panels. Although it is economically beneficial, I felt that 75% of the film was just Burtynsky's book (which I already owned). This is probably an exaggeration, but so I felt. If you own your book or are familiar with your work, maybe it would be better to skip it.
