It was a disappointing film. People seem to have no substance, the leading protagonist Martin Cahil has zero values, each of which, including Jon Voight, provides hiding. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is meaningless, although it is artificially done. Filming is black, at least what I saw in this category. Disappointment.
