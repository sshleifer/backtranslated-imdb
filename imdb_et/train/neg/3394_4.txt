In this film, Ben Chaplin, in England, as an eternal banker, who orders a Russian mail order bride, receives Nicole Kidman and gets more than she wanted, when she does not seem surprising. The story is quite predictable, and Chaplin moves too much to a point where he becomes somewhat anoying. Kidman is pretty good in this role, making his character the only one in this movie that is interesting. GRADE: C
