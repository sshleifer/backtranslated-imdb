This movie was terrible. I've given him 2 higher scores, as I've seen worse but very little. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of Klis's beginning to the end of the movie, and at the end of the beginning, this film used everything in the box of tricks that was used to make a movie just like a child with too many toys. There was an endless, boring repeat story, slow motion, freezing frame, setbacks and connected pictures, etc. - none of them made the bolder movie better. <br /> <br /> This is called "16-year-old alcohol", but there was little drinking or intoxication and no withdrawal image when the movie jumped all over the place without a single sense. The story was poorly written and highly predictable, and the direction was equally poor and it is disgraceful that people have made more money for more movies from Mr Jobson, who previously knew they were in the garbage and television, as much as I found. a great fight to see it to the end, but in the hope that it will improve, I continued bitterly, but it was indeed a waste of time and I would have been better off.
