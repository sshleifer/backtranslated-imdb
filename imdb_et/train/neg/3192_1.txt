What the reviewers and MST3K left out is the best part of this otherwise terrible movie (and just a memorable scene): there is a very good rapeseed-in-the-shower scene that Maria (Ben Gazzara like) did. as mentioned, was later killed through the intuition of TJ). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, "prison mating ritual" may be more appropriate. Behind this opportunity, but a forced meeting is a mobile that hides Ben Gazzara, introduces him to the girls hanging in his pool. The 30-day-old blonde breaks her, but our villain must beat her, because the court is in this place. His first move is to try to sink him until his mafia producer tells him to throw it away. Like a high school girl, you didn't like it, but you still wanted to have some meat knowledge ... Let's say she's trying to go with her cabana later.
