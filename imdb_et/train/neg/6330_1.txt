If you enjoy the original SNL and show, beware of this movie at all costs. When this first of my friends came out and I waited for real over an hour to enter the sold out movie house. on the side of the movie, the theater was empty 3/4. We refused to think that it would improve. At the end of the movie we were the only ones who stayed in the theater. The film only lasted one day in all theaters, which then disappeared from sight. In "Mike" interviews, he refused to comment on the film. The film was an internal joke about SNL episodes that appeared one day after the release and closure of the films. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike by phone and mail to get a refund, but they were completely ignored.
