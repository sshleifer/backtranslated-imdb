When I saw this commercial, I was seeing it. Now forgive me, but it has been as long as I've seen it, so I don't remember how it went. Suffice it to say that the movie I saw does not resemble the "movie" they sold to me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and incredibly disappointed with this movie. And if it wasn't bad enough, they had to get even worse with this terrible reggae music. Not just mood music for horror, eh mon? I think if you never saw a commercial (or a trailer, I think), you might think it's a hot thing. For my money, trade was better.
