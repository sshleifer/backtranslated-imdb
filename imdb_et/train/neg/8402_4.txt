Three Stooges Function Length Western Western Comedy-Musical? Maybe "Rockin" in Rockies was meant to combine Stooges comedy with short western music, matin√©e; if so, it was a pleasant way to break on Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (Rusty) is a beautiful young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (blonde in June) and Gladys Blake (brunette Betty) are pretty women. Hoosier Hotshots is a harmonious group; their songs are pretty good; but it is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film is not exactly 'rock'. There are some laughs; but Stooges' humor is weaker than usual. The spoken horse is also underused. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'Rockies' (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
