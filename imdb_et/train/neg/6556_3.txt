I bought it on my DVD for my brother, a great Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to check it out this week. <br /> <br /> This is a reasonably fun part that contains two completely different stories. Michelle Pfeiffer's passage was more interesting than two. He plays a growing Hollywood actor who has had many short, outstanding relationships. He literally travels to Brian Kerwin (a regular wife with children) after driving his car to his back. After being hostile to each other, he offers his home to drive because he doesn't feel comfortable driving. Romance eventually develops into a tragedy when her husband discovers. The end result I was not prepared for, but the slow pace and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot. The second part includes the old studio boss, played by Darren McGavin. This part is actually better with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio master, but in the end, when asked to leave, they all understand that their career is not going to go. <br /> <br /> It's over time, but it's not all that interesting and I'm glad it wasn't bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she was really the only actor to be worth watching, and even in 1983 she was a decent actor. In general, if you are not his fan, hold it because it is very routine.
