The film starts to think slowly when it comes to the cinema that it seemed pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we all missed our mind and wondered what movie we saw, I don't like this movie and wouldn't recommend it to anyone, the best part of the evening was when the alarm and lights came on came back because the project stopped because we thought we could all go home. it must be one of the worst films I have ever seen, that we all would have missed or thought and most of the people living in the cinema actually were at the end of the RAN, because it was so rubbish. I'm surprised that nobody went out before. When you go and watch, make sure you have something that keeps you busy, even better. Don't go and see it at all.
