I didn't see the movie trailer when I saw the movie, rather than basing my decisions on a friend's opinion. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this film just falls on his face. <br /> <br /> During the movie, Rock offers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately, the film lacks comedy. The film seems to want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and it tries to fail. The film's love story is straight forward (luckily), but it reduces too much of the movie, making the Rock serious and blissful. After all, the main goal of the film is to be a comedy where the main concern should be laughter. Not much about it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is also quite uninteresting in its entirety. Some parts were broken. If supportive casting had to be funny, they certainly didn't do a good job. Heavenly couples tried to make a few jokes that were dry and dull. Rock's first few incarnations were also blissful. If there was one thing they did right, they made the Rock a lot more fun.
