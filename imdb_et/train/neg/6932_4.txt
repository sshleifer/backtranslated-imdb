I have been waiting for a long time to see DR TARRON TORTURE DUNGEON and after I looked at it, I was very disappointed about it. This is not a baroque I expected. The trailer (which I saw on a strange DVD) is much better than the whole movie, which is remarkably forgotten. There's almost no scene in it, and the look and feel is interesting, but it doesn't even come close to other Baroque films, Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are dull and almost nothing dramatic, although we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. - More than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood, or something, instead of seeing the main characters who talk indefinitely.
