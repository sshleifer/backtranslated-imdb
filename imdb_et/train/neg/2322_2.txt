I was looking for a video shop everywhere to find this movie, being the big Elvis fan I am, and I found it to be a big disappointment. The deaf Russell had most of the "elvis moves" down and the wedding limitation was great but the voice of the dubbed voice just didn't work for me. the voice did not always respond to the mouth of the rails, and it was hard for me to disappear from the plot because it disturbed me that it was noticeable. there were so many amazing discrepancies in the film, people who don't know much about elvis think they are facts. The songs are sung by her earlier than she recorded in real life, the time she got her first guitar, is wrong, I'm pretty sure her brother Jesse Garron was buried in an unmarked grave, no one with a huge headline reading JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV game, but they missed important events like back-special and dragged some scenes for too long. if you want to see a good movie showing elvis in your main rental, how it is, or another elvis concert. a unique opportunity to see your talent is to listen to and see the elvis preform. (a brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic.)
