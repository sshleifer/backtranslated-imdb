He only receives a third bill (Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but it was actually David Niven's first major role and he is charmingly foolish like Bertie Wooster, led by PG Wodehouse, who is Captain Jeeves (name only), which is the most painful . Adaptation is more like the 39th steps than a real Wodehousian trip. And it's too bad because Treacher & Niven's interaction isn't too far from the brand. Unfortunately, the B-movie mysteries and forced comedy even grow short for 57 minutes. The next year's follow-up (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more of a sign without Bertie in sight and Jeeves (all people!) Forced to play.
