You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you do not want to, especially, a man who fears less than budget enthusiasm for budget horror than enthusiastic receptions. But it continues the same. Even half-hearted praise when surrounded by their Camp Blood movies is amazing and I am as guilty as anyone else. Usually, Brad throws something interesting to blend, a pure idea, a kooky character, no matter what, but without the financial means to move it beyond the base level, he relies on the audience to relax and appreciate what it is and what it could be . Joe Haggerty gives a memorable and very funny performance like Ebenezer Jackson and his credit to Sykes that he may feel that this strange move is working in the film. Close to, in the parallel universe, somewhere.
