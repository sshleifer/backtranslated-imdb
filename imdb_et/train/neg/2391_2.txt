I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio productions. I love movies with letters and I love those who have unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action adventures, science fiction, secrets, west, any genre except horror. I love both foreign films and English. I love good movies and I even love bad movies because almost no movie has any level of entertainment or entertainment. Except "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues". <br /> <br /> When I attended "Cowgirls" in the late evening, I joined a 10-year-old audience. Soon, I couldn't even get upset with the disturbing mess that opened my eyes and I left. By now, "Cowgirls" is the only movie I've ever left out. lack of redemption value. Suffice it to say that it is one of the worst big films of all time, which is reluctant and unforgiving at all levels. He tries to be smart, but the concept of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. He's trying to be funny, but his humor is coarse and bright. It is one of the few films that succeeds in failing their ethos, depicting the protagonist so that you attack them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, see "Waterworld", "Ishtar", other than this. Except for the new "Alexander". If you choose this and between, read the book.
