I'm a huge horror / rust fan, I even enjoy horror movies that some people find foolish. I also like gore. The more it is better than the point. <br /> <br /> After reading other people's reviews on the site, I was sure this movie was a small pearl. But it was a lot of disappointment that it turned out to be one of the most pointless films I've ever seen. editing was probably done by someone who has died in the past 2 years. I usually find that all these features make a great b horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> To get this DVD, I got 11 euros. <br /> <br /> If you don't really use meaningful gores (like "violent sh * t" movies), avoid it at all costs!
