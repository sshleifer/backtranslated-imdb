George P. Cosmatos' "Rambo: First Blood Part II" is pure desire-fulfillment. The United States did not win the Vietnam War. They caused the country a picture of harm and this film continues the fairy tale of safe and innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the country that made the war. The nature of Rambo is perfect. He is extremely patriotic, scared that the US-Americans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of one soldier, but he has not only a mistrust of senior executives and politicians. Like any film defending the war (eg "We were soldiers"), it is also avoided that the reason for inclusion in South Asia is understandable. And that's why every US American soldier was there. Instead, Rambo gets revenge on the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with memories rather than suppress them. "Can we win this time?" Yeah, you do.
