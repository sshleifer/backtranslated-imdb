The theme seems to be dated today. Rona Jaffe adapted from a book to a TV; we travel and trip through fantasy. Four college students participated in the live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deep. His fellow members must come to his salvation and save him from the self-inflicted damage. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round the game for four. Support consists of veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this date, it seems to be wild and tame. However, the highlighting is to see Tom Hanks on his "Bosom Buddies" salad days and his big splash on a silver screen. The youngest viewer gets the most enjoyment.
