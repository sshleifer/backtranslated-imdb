Like many people, I saw it in the movie theater for the first time in '97. At best, it was below the average movie, not a commendable "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fans like. First of all, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter how you look at it. People just like him because of his appearance. His ability to act is essentially about talking a lot of hair lines and trying to act sexy. Secondly, the film had a rather boring and simple plot: the girl falls in love with the boy, the ships where they are sinks, and after that there is much love. Anyone with an IQ of over 50 realizes that it is not brilliant in any way. Nor is it original. In addition, the director felt the need to pull it out for three hours. I can lose this block without compressing one hour. In conclusion, "Titanic" is still the most overpriced movie. Why is it so much attention and money on me.
