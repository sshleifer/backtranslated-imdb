Hi, I am Paul Raddick, WTAF Panic Attack, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this pious film that drove Adam Sandler's film career, but was digitized in a short time. <br /> <br /> Riding on the bench is an ambitious comedian, played by Sandler, who works on a cruise ship and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler will meet a babes who are like World History 1 and Rebound. Babes had to be busy, but in fact they got by Sawtooth, the most well-known cannibal in the world. Adam Sandler went badly at Going Overboard, but was in a better father, Billy Madison and Jen Leone, for the first 50 days. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red, Goboard Overboard is not Dooley squat! End of file.
