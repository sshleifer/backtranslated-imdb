If you are not twelve, this movie is not really worth it. This is obviously a low budget movie with B-actors and a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that isn't good. I knew it would be bad if I rented it. I like to laugh at bad movies. I didn't know how bad it was. It is tolerable, up to the 2nd hour, it really starts to burn. Fighting styles remain the usual struggle that follows the laws of physics, and the fight against wires. There is no real explanation for the transition. It has a plot, but again it's a childhood. There seems to be clear moral lessons from the day that is being transmitted, such as Sesame Street or anything. It's tolerable. But much better than you are, for example, nine.
