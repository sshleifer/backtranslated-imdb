Not as bad as you heard. In fact, there are some funny parts, and Affleck and Applegatel have quite good chemistry. Applegate is particularly appealing and pleasing as Affleck's love of interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are perfect professionals. They are pretty good in almost everything. Finally, "Survival" is not the worst holiday movie you will ever see. Unfortunately, it's purposeful and a lot of comedy is forced. The aspirations of the dark humor come out as dull. Affleck is trying hard to be hopelessly spastic and over-understandable, but it is so upset. Beside the quieter, unbelievable performances of Gandolfin and O'Hara, the character of his comic book is viewed. Even according to relaxed standards for holiday clips, you will never buy a full Affleck by hiring this family for X-mas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that limit surrealism from their wonders. The X-mas eve scene is full of malignant humor (a son who looks naked, provocative pictures of his mother), which is not only funny and plausible, but disturbing. <br /> <br /> The colors of this movie are mud, almost non-existent. The house on which most of the film takes place looks step by step and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Survival" is mostly interesting for the fourth place, which is listed in the office duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and Affleck. It is still clear how the damage is permanent.
