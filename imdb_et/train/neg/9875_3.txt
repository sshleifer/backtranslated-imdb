Excellent technology. But what does it do when the content is hollow and stupid. I am left behind after <30 minutes of viewing, boredom and irritation. <br /> <br /> Theater management returned my money, but it was time and relaxation. I have had and are not thankful for the stars whose names were the main attraction. <br /> <br /> George, Meryl, Bill - I hope you were well paid. You may even have liked it. So I apologize for my limited mind. Many people also seemed pleasant. Look at reviews. Oh well ... <br /> <br /> I want to know - what a remotely redeemable story about Fox, husband, father, citizen ... whatever.
