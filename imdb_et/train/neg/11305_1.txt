This is very bad for the West, mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It seems to have been shot in the back of California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, in Idaho, Colorado and Montana. It represents everything that is known about its mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is terrible; there is very little direction and bad action. Dorothy Malone has been completely wasted as her husband. Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good director. His local townspeople were afraid of his hard drinking. When he drunk he starts to fight and poses other problems in Virginia, Montana. To make sure he could never terrorize them again, he was hit by Jack Slade when he ignored their warning to leave the city right away. It's a terrible movie. I can't recommend anyone watching this movie to see how Hollywood's boutique history wants, even today.
