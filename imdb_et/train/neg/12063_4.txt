The team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley's husband were big stars in Vaudeville, but they made very few films. As with some other era performers (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible film material for Fields and Seeley is the bio-head where they are portrayed by other actors: "Somebody Loves Me", starring Betty Hutton, and it's immensely singer and dancer Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> During their flowering years, Fields and Seeley were so popular that their second wife and wife's vaudeville law - - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - were almost as quick as almost the same act, effectively turning into another Team "Fields and Seeley. However, Offstage was very different in the life of couples. Fields and Seeley lived in the hotel suites, paying a room service fee for each meal and eventually ending up with money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested wisely, ending a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> In the first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone, there are two pianists carrying the spats. Apparently, these two men in 1930 had a little nominal value, even though I've never heard of them. Finally, the fields and Seely hurry and start. They both have a lot of buttocks and they are quite attractive. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that both performers are moving as they begin to break the dance, but they never do it before the third of three short songs. When they finally start silver, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing these two great performers doing their gut. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars of movie music. My assessment of this one: only 4 out of 10, and I would stay locked and shut down with Sully.
