Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies fall into two categories with a good (Gee, one happy pizza boy) and those who don't (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's Experiment remains firmly in the final category. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, a horror version of the hardcore porni. Almost complete plot with less 43-minute expectation of cash down. In the video clip in 1985, it consists of three relatively non-descriptive Japanese boys torturing a relatively attractive Japanese girl. Torture ranges from banal (50-fold beating, one hundred beating), foolish (linking it to the office chair and turning it around), a frightening factor (guts of the breeds and sheep), and finally the money. (Well-performed eyeball piercing). <br /> <br /> That is, there is no plot, motif, just Blair witch tree shots and torture. The girl seems boring and except shouting, "No one expects the Spanish Inquisition" office chair scene when I was bored. Waiting for buggy on the screen, waiting for money. Just like hardcore porn.
