Hammerhead is a combination of the mad scientist and the genre of killer film. In a little bit of type, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops the human / hammerhead shark creature. Happily, this creature is actually his son, who has become such a monster to prevent him from dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> The group's stakeholders are invited to the researcher's private island. Finally, they are used as shark feed or shark mat. For some unknown reason, the IT team leader is involved as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he turns out to be a heroic, albeit overweight, Ryboesque. I work on the assumption that he learned how to behave as an attack gun as part of his day-to-day work that works in the first row. A normal day for this IT man is expected to mean fixing someone's network connection, followed by an invitation to the gun to hell. Or maybe the call between the fixed human and the shark hybrid must be confirmed on someone's computer? Anyway, he's amazing and saves the day. She even gets a girl. <br /> <br /> Hai-man is a bit flat, but OK, I think the effect of this movie is general. And the film is moving at a decent pace. Of course, this is a complete hockey, but when you buy a Hammerhead movie and hope it is a difficult drama about the emotional conflicts that have arisen with a man who has become a land-based killer, you really don't have to blame anyone but yourself. As it is, there are guns, gore, girls and maybe even an explosive helicopter. It's garbage, but not as bad as some might say.
