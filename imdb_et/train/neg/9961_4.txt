Amelia and Michael are a couple who are cheating on each other. Amelia has a long-time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who doesn't answer her. Two smiles with their infidelity, but they will be able to connect at the end. <br /> <br /> There is not much in this short section. The direction is straight and dramatic, which is good, the actor is sincere, but the story leaves a little desire. Why do we care for these two people? It is a bit difficult to see how this story looks like any other sense of loyalty, except that it is much more pared and does not look in that sense (a welcome change of pace than anything). <br /> <br /> I don't know, it's possible that I won't connect these stories because I've never experienced them. But I have noticed that blocking these narratives is usually the same, that is, a couple who speaks together, avoiding eye contact, pretending to put in magazines. The nice thing about short films is that they offer a little more space to try something else and I would like to see a different way. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
