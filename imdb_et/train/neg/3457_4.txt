This film is made and cast from my home town. I remember this poison and the fact that Molly Ringwald was in the city ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> <br /> Basically 20 years after "putting" rest "in the movie, the group started to film it It seems that no one wants to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is thin. Characters are mostly transperal and little information you know about them, just don't care, it seems irrelevant, it is a strange thing that Kylie's accent is Australia again and nice to see the guy I went to school. knows why the creators thought they were going to Molly Ringwald, maybe thanks to the nature of the movie (it is reminiscent of the 80's movies / bad horror films), but the Aussie actor really did well. , it is a lot acted like a constipation. Some of these children (especially the two main chicas - they played "director" and "producer") seemed like they were trying to act. It's never a good look. They also had a rough feeling in their frames. Maybe over illuminated? Just not as smooth as you are used to. <br /> <br /> Killer. The Lord. Would it be less scary? However, there are some shock factors and a few rough scenes. I liked the movie, but it wasn't great. It went 90 minutes, but it could have gone less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script, it would have been better. They lost a lot of signs - but they were not killed. Perhaps they would have been better if they had killed fewer people and actually focused on a scary atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's comedy and the elements were funny. Or so unbelievable that they were funny. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
