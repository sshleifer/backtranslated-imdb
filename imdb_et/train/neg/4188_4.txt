I'm a great sign of Neil Young's music, and with that glowing praise the movie received from many of the bottom-indie media circles, Greendale's first example I found was hit. My excitement was short-lived because this market story and the weak lyrical momentum fell asleep or frustrated for most movie registers. <br /> <br /> They say the movie started as a soundtrack and characters in life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to understand the story. No character is really an arc, and if "important" events happen, the viewer doesn't care because the levels that disturb the technique of the film are so high. The movie is all the songs, and that's why the end of the characters in the mouth as they sang ... the technique works for the first stanza that has been made, and after that the nerves grab. It doesn't know reality or counterfeiting, it just seems unwanted. <br /> <br /> Dreadful action, finding one mood with characters, and playing it all. Poor lighting at times. The only movies I get to film are in relation to several scenes that have been filmed in a news program, but this technique is used today in the cinema so that it didn't miss it. Alright soundtrack, but something I can buy quickly. Bad movie.
