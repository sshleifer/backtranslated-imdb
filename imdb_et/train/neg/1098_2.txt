I got this movie in the $ 5 binary walmart. I wouldn't recommend looking at this move. I can give it to one of my friends when I get angry and want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and cut the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I knew that this movie was boring before it was turned on. It was my mistake to think that something was going on in this movie. It's almost one group of people who drive from one boot camp to another. The guards of the drills treat the soldiers very badly and the protagonist tries to help people in Vietnam fight. <br /> <br /> Okay, here's my movie about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and watch, because you want to turn it off, but you hanged on the line of hope that it can finish. This is not. After the movie was behind my T.V because I was angry that I was wasting almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.
