Janeane Garofalo has been dissatisfied with this film, including being feminist. He has also said in his radio broadcast that he hates making "romantic comedies" because he doesn't believe them. I totally agree with Janean here. This movie is the best. He does his best, but in general it was just one boring, incredible "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world. If there are some who say "stop your unbelief" then you will grow tired of having to stop it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. For some reason, Janeane's character is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her look, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter shades (which probably didn't like Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she despises this film). This is painful for the film if we want to buy the premise that Janeane should have better vision of the two. As many have said here and on other commentaries, Janeane is not ugly but really pretty. I haven't read one review where someone said that Uma looked better. Nevertheless, I believe that the character of Ben Chaplin is likely to remain with Uma, not with Janeane. Many men don't like truly intelligent women (and many women don't like really intelligent men) and, unfortunately, Ben would probably have been with Uma. And despite the director's effort to make Janeane attractive, it doesn't work. His natural beauty comes in any case. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with this movie because they want to think of Ben Chaplin's character and actually Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than what she plays here (real life is always much more complicated than Hollywood can imagine) so take the cold shower gentlemen. This is the role Janeane knows best, and it's a shame, because it's not really a movie.
