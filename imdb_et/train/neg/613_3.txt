Wow, what can I say about this movie? This is a sad piece. I'm surprised to find it as high as he did. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: what's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just a mess and a clich√©. Here's a lot of what it is ... A funny boy who doesn't have friends gets stuck, can be killed and comes back to a barrier. "Everything" is packed in a 86 minute film. If you haven't seen this movie, it won't waste your time. The other is not much better, so don't worry that either ... I appreciated this movie for three because I liked the clothes of peacocks, not because there was something good in the movie. I think you get the picture.
