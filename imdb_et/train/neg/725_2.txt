It was a terrible movie! Not the subject, but the supply. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the film came out), waiting to see a film about the victory of the human spirit against oppression. What we saw was brutally suppressed by the police for 2 hours, without finally having risen. No previews or ads mentioned! In addition, I remember my memory that he was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews do not talk about it! (not that you expect it, but it's just more of a problem). If I knew how this film was depressing, I would never have seen it. Or at least I would be ready for that. It was a feed and exchange campaign and I never see this movie!
