It is a well-made informative film in the PBS Frontline vein. The problem is that Frontline already did this work and managed to tell his story to L. Paul Bremer. Even more worrying is that the film's director, Charles Ferguson, a former think tank, was a supporter of the war until the occupation went south. What did he think would happen? <br /> <br /> The Polish invasion really did well until the annoying Nazis confused it. And this is what this film feels like - an apology for occupation, not a deconstruction of the state of war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems the war might have been better - as if every war was better.
