This is the only movie I've ever seen that has prompted me to write criticism on any website and this is an important statement from someone who likes the "Monolith Monsters Attack". This movie is suitable for anyone who wants an uneven film. For example, it lacks gender and violence. I believe this film is safe for children of all ages. This film is suitable for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged or stimulated in any way. Adults can easily catch their sleep in front of the television when the children watch this movie. Don't be surprised when you wake up that the kids have turned off the TV and started the board game. Like an entertaining adult who enjoys daily to fantastic realism, drama, comedy and action, this adult stuff that reflects real life on earth and / or stimulates imagination does not offer this movie.
