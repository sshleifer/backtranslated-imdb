What a powerful start to the film when Julia Robert's character is hit by the abusive and anal spouse played by Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to experience a powerful film at the same level as Farrah Fawcetti's The Burning Bed. Well, as we all said, I was wrong. This movie was not like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played a part of the woman you really knew and felt her pain and need to live. Sleeping with enemies bounced on the first excitement after the first action, when Roberts died of his death to escape from his wife and live in Iowa. His wife initially believes that he is dead, but he suspects he may still be alive and after him. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game where Julia gets a house in this small town of Iowa and changes her identity .... Of course it hasn't been mentioned how she got the money for that, but at that point a movie I didn't care about. He meets the boy (Mr Nice wimpy) and falls to him and his wife finally arrives at him, but not before he rearranges his supermarkets and straightens the kitchen. I thought it would give the audience a cheap excitement. But I don't care if she was an abused woman because the film, as I said, fools the audience. Had it been left, she could have known her and her situation. Of course, the husband is killed and everything is very small Mrs Roberts. If only in the real world was anything close to it ... See Burning Bed and you understand what the film assumes is like domestic violence.
