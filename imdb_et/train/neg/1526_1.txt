Maybe I've seen worse movies, but if I have, I can't remember. Or they are blocked. Who knows if I should undergo hypnotherapy, I can remember them with kidnapping aliens as a child or other traumas. If so, I'd happily exchange those memories for watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I should give the film some credit: it gave an emotional response. I really started to frustrate other movies and TV scenes that had been damaged by this travesty with an association. I'm afraid I can't watch movies like dr. Strangelove, without this film changing my mind.
