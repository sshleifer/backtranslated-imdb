I have not yet read Shirley Jackson's novel, which I have meant for some time. I'm sure it must be more sensitive to the film. I remember jumping once when I watched the second day, although I can't remember the scene. <br /> <br /> Special effects are great and I watched it on a DVD, but I'm sure it will be a fantastic sight in the theater. After the first few special effects, the story is expected to develop. , but it wasn't. I was committed to staring at the brilliant character of Catherine Zeta-Jones in the film, because there was nothing else to look at. Lili Talor was such a suck character. I didn't like him one, something about tiny people. The man in this film also reminded me of the voice and face of the comic Dudley DoRight. I couldn't touch characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did a marvelous job of trying to get through this type of actor. Scream Queenish movie! At least there is a certain type of entertainment value. If there is no story there, they will at least fill cozy deaths or attractive women. It had nothing. <br /> <br />
