If I have to give this film a linear score, I have to give him a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was fun and there are several good things to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist Candidate James Bishop is assigned to St Andrews Hospital for his resident and leaves to "change the world". <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie you know the hospital hides the evil truth, but Jacob thinks he can make a difference and not recognize it as evil. The story builds quite well, you know all the time that there is a truth about what patients are talking about evil, and don't know when and how James discovers it. Even when the break arrives, James is hunting by the evil, and you feel some tension until the "fight" is over. <br /> <br /> Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend who arrives at the worst possible times and other standard horror elements and you get the picture. <br /> <br /> The accumulation of characters is actually quite good, you will be introduced to most killed people, some of them you will know. <br /> <br /> The film sets an unpleasant scene, and it is doing quite well. There are mysteries that are disclosed - in an acceptable manner. <br /> <br /> The main character, James, is very believable - the story of an enthusiastic student starting a job is good on this device. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * stupid special effects - modern version of "Plan 9 from space" type bad (evil monster looks like red scarecrow) * Some bad actions (or probably very few during filming) - Main sometimes the characters act badly and sometimes good. * Sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I thought "I could make a movie with my home camera" throughout the film.
