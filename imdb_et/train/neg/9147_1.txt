I have no idea what would have been on earth or beyond could have guessed Sam Samovich believes it would have been a worthwhile project. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst films. In fact, I see no reason why it shouldn't be # 1 on the bottom of the bottom 100. a nervous wound, because even his coats of discomfort were at least professionally made by Baby Genius 2. In contrast, everything, and I mean everything, in this film is completely unprofessional. <br /> <br /> The film is intended to attack the expected hope and hatred of Christian law against gays. And I emphasize "intended". Not only can it fail completely and completely, it also leaves a ugly scar. Instead of creating an amazing and realistic portrait of the homosexual couple's struggle against society, which is largely against them, it creates tired and harsh stereotypes for everyone involved. Ben and Arthur, the namesake couple, are depicted as two crude oil, sex starvation and hopelessly romantic cartoon cuts that marry when the laws change to allow them to do so. It meets Ben's brother Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians (as this film should believe us), is loud, proud, stupid and violent. He's trying to kill Ben and Arthur after his troops come out of the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think it's terrible (that's), you haven't seen it all. <br /> <br /> Participants here (?) Can completely destroy any kind of credibility in this movie by saying that they are the ones who narrated the YouTube home video video. But not even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando, like the title characters, could have saved this clunker, because it would still be a totally ugly and ridiculous dialogue that fills the film every minute. Every scene has at least one awkward or wrong place. For example, Victor tries to complain in one scene that he has no brothers or nephews because of his brother's homosexuality. Instead of clearly depicting this idea, he spits out stupid, completely confusing, shining, sounding lines: "You know what, I never get any brothers or grandchildren, okay, because you're so F *** ED UP! "<br /> <br /> Even more striking is the lack of production values. Yes, I know it's not a Dark Knight, but even amateur filmmakers should know some special effects and editing. For example, a six-point red cake is not enough to produce realistic balls. People are not in the space between the TVs. And the objects won't let you go on shooting! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on Ben & Arthur. I don't care if you're 7, 17 or 107. I don't care if you're gay, straight, bi or undecided. I don't care if you're "just curious". I don't care about the pathetic reason why you may be tempted to buy this manure. Stay away, far away. This film's only quality of redemption is its ability to use frisbee.
