Nothing like a movie from a group of friends who not only dislike each other's reluctance but have little or no redemptive qualities to make * audience * similar or empathic with a few characters. There are so bad movies that they are good (la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter movies), and there is just bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This film is hardly tolerable even if you are a superbly talented MSTie riffer (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Luckily, if I'm pretty talented in this respect (that's how my mind works all the time), for those who aren't so naturally talented in MSTie's reeling, then finally * into this movie you just want to pull your head, painfully aware of the movie "Taboo" will rob you of about an hour and twenty minutes that you will never get back. Even my MSTie talented were barely at this slow pace, bored with the waste of time. The most striking aspect of this movie is that * someone * green and / or funded it ... I rented "Taboo" only to traditionally talented Amber Benson, who must have been filmed to make this movie. I'm another less well-known movie in my rental queue, which I would better read. Ironically, the best aspect of the film is its impressive maze mansion for its interior design.
