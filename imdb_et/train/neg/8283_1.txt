It is embarrassing to everyone and everything used to make this joke. I personally don't care about one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever many people find interesting about her. Just like a movie, it's not even a film school grade. The script is confusing, the behavior is cruel, and the fact that Luke Wilson ("Bottle Rocket co-author") made me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He made the "Old School" to shout out loud! It's not even in the same state as my "old school" DVD! Please for some reason NOT THIS! I see there is a remark that it is so bad that it is good, but it is, quite frankly, too kind. When we stop seeing the singers who are obviously unable to act, I hope to end soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent players (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this landfill. As for the plot, it is almost non-existent and so badly made and written (yes I know it's another rehash) I doubt someone remembers about it. Please, whatever you do, you waste your time, but if you do, excuse ACTUAL participants who are wasting their time making a bomb. Jessica Simpson you're pretty, but stay with singing, though I'm not a fan of it. And who made this movie, I wouldn't have written it in my CV. 1/10 because you can't give zero.
