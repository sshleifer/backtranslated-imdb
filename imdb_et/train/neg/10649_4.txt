Johnny Weissmuller's latest film, "King of Jungle," after a 16-year-old role in TARZAN AND MERMAIDS, is frustrated by all but his most intelligent. In the 44s, a former Olympian, one of Hollywood's most active party animals, had long passed his youthful sporting activities and seemed tired (although he was somewhat in a better condition than his previous TARZAN AND HUNTRESS) <br /> <br /> Weissmuller was not just too old for their role; Johnny Sheffield, the main "boy", had grown masculine (he was a 17-year-old comforter), so he was written from the manuscript as an excuse for being "in school". Brenda Joyce, at 35, appeared in her fourth of five "Jane" films (she gave a transition when Lex Barker became a new Tarzan, in 1949 TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as sexy as ever. <Br /> <br /> Made by Sol Lesser, RKO, with a low budget, took advantage of and used a cheaper workforce in films in Mexico. Although the seat firmly gave the Spaniards the air that was said to be darker in Africa, Robert Florey, the Veterinarian, used the country extensively, involving the story of diving and the Aztec temple. <br /> <br /> When a young island girl (Tyrone Power's future bride, Linda Christian) is rescued in the jungle by Tarzan, she learns that the local high priest (George Zucco, one of the film's most enduring villains) had practically enslaved the local population, threatening if they do not make their offer. The girl was chosen as the "God" bride so she fled. Faster than saying "Is it a stupid plot or what?" The girl robs by the priestly commanders and returns to the island and Tarzan, followed by Jane, a colorful Spanish character "Benjy" (charmingly played by John Laurenz, who sings several songs) and the government commissioner is ready to take the Deity and his priest (the poor Cheeta remains behind). After several discoveries ("God" is just a man of aatek mask who works with milking a rich pearl of the priest's island), a bit of beating and comic and Benjy's songs, everything comes in delightfully, TARZAN AND MERMAIDS is a musical result of an excellent filmmaker Dimitri Tiomkin and it is much better than what you expect from this "B" movie! <br /> <br /> Although the film would give Weissmuller time in the Tarzan Loincloth less (if he immediately played Jungle Jim, the more obvious variation of Ape Man in Khaki), the involved talent raised the whole product at least a little bit more than the confusion it might have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan started over and became much more sexy ...
