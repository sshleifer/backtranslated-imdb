This is "F.B.I". starring Reed Hadley, with all sorts of guests! The film begins with a random (comfortable?) Robbery that leads to one thing, and the other - which really does not mean the main story of "big house, USA". jail break story. The story is very unlikely. It's like a TV show, but more "violent" (for ages). <br /> <br /> HOW - The trip is cast! Picture of: Ralph Meeker sent to prison; his cell partners are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr, Charles Bronson (reading "Muscle" magazine) and William Talman ("Detective" magazine). Honest! You should know that the early scene shows what happens to the "missing" boy, answering the final vote. If you don't want to hang out, don't miss the scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian makes a disgraceful asthma). <br /> <br /> Great House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
