I saw it for the first time when I was about 7. I remember what I thought was a vague overview of what was happening. Now, 15 years later, it turns out that I remember everything very precisely because it seems that writers have never brought the story closer. There is no plot for this movie / drawing. There is no character development, no back story, no character arches, nothing. Good guys do things because they're good, while bad guys do things just because they're bad. One unintentionally fun part is when someone you think is important dies and nobody cares about it the least. They shrug and move on. There is also hardly any dialogue. If you cut out fighting scenes and running scenes, you will lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Look at this because you want to see good animation and no other reason. Or if you want to look at the little clad hot cartoon chicks (or the little clad hot cartoons).
