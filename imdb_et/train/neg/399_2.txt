This picture started with good intentions, scientist Bacon, to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue's role is normal. It all breaks down afterwards, it is your typical Hollywood thriller, which is filmed with special effects sound recording, without any humor, common sense or soul. In other words, don't waste your time looking at it. Get an audio ticket tape with John DeLancie, an invisible man, as well as starring Leonard Nimoy. Now it was good and HG Wells is well earned, unlike this confusion.
