What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing the vision and thinking "may be funny". ERROR! This movie is about 90 minutes too long. Participants are trapped in a poorly written script and cannot get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and even if Wilson doesn't look naked, this part can be redeemed from this movie. Special effects ..... not. I was half-waiting to see the aircraft and the wires that Uma kept on his flying scenes. And if the effects that people probably couldn't beat superhero faster on a hurrying ball or a scene, everyone covered the blurry screen with a rotating vortex that hid the terrible effects pretty nicely. Wilson's conjuncture was a man's excuse and Wilson had no one with Uma or his office worker. Sexual scenes were not sexy and funny scenes were not funny. I think I have been waiting too much for these participants. No character was really sympathetic, so I didn't care about flying bow to any of them. The only memorable performances were children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had chemistry. In general, super stinko film - I don't even recommend renting it - it would be a waste of money!
