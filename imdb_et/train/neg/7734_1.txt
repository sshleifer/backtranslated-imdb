This movie is the worst film I've ever seen. The story is weak - I couldn't even follow it. Acting at high school. The soundtrack is irritating. There are no humor attempts. Editing is terrible. Credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed that my name is related to this film waste. Don't waste your time even thinking about doing this experiment.
