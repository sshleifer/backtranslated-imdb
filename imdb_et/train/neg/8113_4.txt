POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE ENGINE GROUP **; USING POPEYE ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I used these kids, but I tried a series that consisted of three cartoons, that is, several years later. TOWARDS THE THREE THREAD OF THE RAIDERS OF RAIDERS THAT IS SEASI [1953]), I see how they don't keep it well! Popeye's character is not exactly sympathetic at first, Olive Oyl is obviously overwhelming and Bluto antics could not generate much interest? in short, the scripts were worryingly thin, quite awful and generally unsuccessful. They are strictly juvenile ticket prices, but I doubt that today's children would even have the patience to hold them! In addition, the animation style is inconvenient. <br /> <br /> Considering each short per se, I think they healed from each other: after the initial shock, it adjusted to mediocre quality, so that the third cartoon would result in a lot of the most enjoyable? Popeye has been entrusted with a mascot army, whose huge appetite causes him some end to mischief (hardly original, I know, but always a fun war). One interesting element was that the shorts were booked with Popeye, who offered the audience moral wisdom.
