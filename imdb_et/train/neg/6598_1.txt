This "film" is travesty. No, wait - abomination. NO, Wait - this is undoubtedly an ever-made movie that contains beloved characters created and created by other participants. <br /> <br /> I thought Inspector Clouseau with Alan Arkin (!) instead of Peter Sellers was ridiculous and sacred, but even dared to "make" the asynin and money out of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead since 1957 and 1965 respectively. Why would anyone even imagine that L & H's suitable updates would be in the personality of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain. I tuned in to look forward to being frightened and embarrassed, and I was certainly not disappointed. Anyone involved in this pathetic, moral, shameful stigma should be all about Hollywood and filmmaking. EXCLUDE THIS MOVIE EVERYTHING - HAVE BEEN INSURED.
