The director confirms in Behind-the-Scenes' function that he loves horror films. He loves them so much that he devoted the film to Dario Argento, as well as other important directors like George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically devoting this film to these great directors, it is that mother is given a piece of sh * t for the day. The first thing they did wrong was pouring. CAST PEOPLE WHO CAN COME. Also, do not discard a 40-year-old person for misunderstanding, an 18-year-old party. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. People's responses they watch for their girlfriends to hit their hearts are fun. Or, as a part, when a man gets his ear in his ear (haha), and his girlfriend just goes, "Oh ... my ... God?" The scarecrow itself is quite characteristic. Driving loses cars and calls people. <br /> <br /> The film has one redemption factor ... oh wait, it's not. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely have a movie to watch, watch a DVD from Rock and Roll. It covers everything and it really has a gnarly song guy.
