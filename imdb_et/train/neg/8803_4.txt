I loved "Anchorman, Ron Burgundy legend" and hoped it would be just as funny, but unfortunately it wasn't. However, some bits are excellent. I thought the champ, Champ Kind, who loved Ron Burgundy in a car filled with other news team members, was fun. Everyone ignores her, and she just gets louder and louder, and finally kisses Burgundy, which doesn't get appreciated. But the whole story is not a gel. However, it is a noble attempt to save unused bits from the first movie, including a whole plot of some rather benign domestic terrorists, called "Alarm Clocks". Maya Rudolph is Saturday night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically there is a good reason for using this first movie on the unused test line. The recordings of this album are pretty good, the best two are filmed samples with lots of improvisation comedy, and the faux comment with Will Ferrell and the "exec producer" who discovered Ferrell early was not even part of the film in any way, shape or form. It turns out that he is "just a man" who walked to the side door of the studio and pretended he was a manufacturer. It's pretty funny things that last about 10 or 15 minutes
