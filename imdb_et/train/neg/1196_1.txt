How's Amy, Posey and Raechel in the movie something funny? Believe it or not, "House Bunny" did it better and more fun. Hopefully the drivers had a good holiday and money - this movie is embarrassing for everyone. It is a cliché from start to finish. Clichés can work well with the script or at least with the idea. This film does nothing but uses clichés instead of clichés, not ideas or scripts. It uses the existing actors of actors rather than the development of characters. Bad, sad and garbage. Now, apparently, there should be ten lines of comment. Really? Why? IT ops manager is another example of sloppy coding.
