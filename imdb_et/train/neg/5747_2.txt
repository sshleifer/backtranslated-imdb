I love Zombie movies and I love amateur productions. And the meat market 2 will really respect the promising Fulci classic "Zomb". <br /> <br /> So I leaned back and waited for the impression. Okay, some of the makeups are big budget films, and some actors (vampirelady and chef) really stand out, but there's nothing else. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a new Romero here, but the whole movie doesn't have a single queue, even with a bit of a touch or shock. The director knows how to stack the body and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2, Gore rhymes with a cage - it's not enough for me - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** *****
