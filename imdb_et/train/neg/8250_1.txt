I ordered a movie from Korea because I was very extra in it and I was interested in how it looked. <br /> <br /> Having watched this, I can say that I am ashamed that I had a part of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who has been involved in mocking British "comedy". <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end of the movie, it is predictable, annoying, boring, monotonous, and deserves me to be away from the screen on many occasions. Until you actually see the movie, it's hard to imagine how romantic and romantic comedy might be. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, it's a badly made movie. In one scene you can actually see a runner or assistant director who shows S.A. I will give details on this in the "Goofs" section. <br /> <br /> Upside was it filled with emotions (disappointment, rage, embarrassment?)
