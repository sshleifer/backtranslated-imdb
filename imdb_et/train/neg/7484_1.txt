Within 15 minutes, my entire family tried to die of the character of Goldie Hawn or at least Steve Martin's character to leave. After 40 minutes we turned it off. In a year we only try a few movies that are so annoying that we can't even do it for a long enough time to create a story. <br /> <br /> Normally, I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and remember to enjoy Neil Simon's original. So I blame Marc Lawrent and Sam Weisman. Combine "Whats The Worst That Can Hainen" and "Miss Congeniality 2" writer, and I think that is what we are finally getting.
