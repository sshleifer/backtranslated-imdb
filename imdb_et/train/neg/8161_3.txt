Mary Lou is a bitch whose spirit is seeking revenge for those who let her come to her fiery punishment in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the film takes place mainly in 1986. / stupid special effects, including some strange dementies looking for swing horses. <br /> <br /> Mary Lou's spirit makes people feel bad and tries to take over one person's body. Whether he succeeds, you need to look to find out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is largely boring and based on a whole range of valuable characters. It's not really a sequel, the only thing that is common to the first is the name of high school. It's average. horror flick fall back, gore, nonsense nudity, knocking against catholic church. Basic things, boring film. <br /> <br /> Actors are decent enough to give him 3 out of 10.
