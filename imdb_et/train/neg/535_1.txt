Some of these comments from the viewer are simply ridiculous. Isn't it painful to look at your significant other? I apologized for all my movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly strange. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unsuitable for this, especially when Vanessa made this ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same wiggly-lipped uncomfortable girl she was in my Soed Life. He hasn't tried himself in any way yet. Girl, find a new way to pretend! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was the only redeeming part of this movie, she was on the screen for five minutes and I swear to God, she came out of the movie screen and woke up awake. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets every time I see him, better. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also two and a half scenes excellent. That is, it was a well-filmed movie, it was very beautiful, the settings were dressed up interestingly, providing relief for the intense boredom. <br /> <br /> I don't know, it's just quite pathetic if a movie with "Our Biggest Actors of Our Time" is so much. It certainly had more than some noticeable editing mistakes and the main character (Ann) was a big jerk. I was glad she died. But because I felt Lila, a friend of Anni, was bad - mostly because these two women were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD work, evening film. You were not entertaining and you hadn't even thought about it. I hope this book was better so it didn't waste even more time on people. 3/10
