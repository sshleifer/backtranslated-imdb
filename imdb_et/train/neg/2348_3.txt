Ashley Judd, in her early role and I think her first major role, shows her real rebellious character in this slow-moving feminist soap opera. Wow, is it political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> Being a true feminist, he must pamper this script. No wonder that left wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; it is also his political alley. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I am delighted that Judd raised himself from this moral, top-down role in the movies that the entertainment offered did not proclaim a liberal action plan.
