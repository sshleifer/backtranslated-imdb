While the original titles the intellect, this cheap remake is designed to purely shock the feelings. Instead of this sophisticated thriller, there are just sudden and seemingly random changes to complicated plots that only pass it on to every strange development. The worst thing is that replacing the original spicy dialogue is an inverted salt maker full of unnecessary four-point words, leaving a coarse but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was a promise - an outstanding promise. Probably an intriguing prospect is that Michael Caine pulls the completion of Katty-to-Sullivan, similar to Patty Duke. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor has only denied his reputation, first accepting the role in this terribly rewritten mess, and then presenting a report that looks only competent compared to Jude Law's amateur with a superfluous factor. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the classic, forget your visuals and tricks. Hunt it down, check it out and just enjoy the story and party. As for reprocessing, send this offense to the original.
