Okay guys, we know why we watch a movie like "The Invisible Maniac" (see picture, man!). T and A all over the place (much more than A). But ... shouldn't there be a story to go with it? <br /> <br /> "Do you hear you say -" it's just girls naked! Who needs a story? ?! "<br /> <br /> Well, if it is called" NAKED Maniac ", I wouldn't have a problem, but since these men are" The Invisible Man ", they need to know that you are thinking busy hold. "The crazy doctor creates the invisibility serum and, if it cracked, uses it as a nude female spy and eventually kills a lot of teens. And if you see teenagers with a smell, he'll be grateful. <br /> <br /> One star for T and A, but a little too much color for your skin fans, so proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - Yes, that's Savannah.
