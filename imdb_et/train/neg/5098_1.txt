It must be one of the best overpriced animations. And yes, I had even shown the "end of the Evangelion" and it still made me hate. Not to mention countless shows from this show! <br /> <br /> I don't mind psychological and philosophy, but Evangelion pulls this mud like nothing else! Not many characters seemed very interesting. The only ones who seemed interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. In addition, most of the other bunch of funny drinkers were mostly. They have to go to a psychiatric center, not to pilot giant robots against aliens called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even mecha and alien fighting didn't help at all. It goes something like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots and they are really cool because they bleed (!), When they injure, but they are not really mecha, but photographed angels, so sometimes they go crazy and don't do what juvenile pilots want, and they need to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm so sorry, but I just can't recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otac or not. For those who love this variety very much, you have the right to this opinion, I respect you. But for those who have a "sensational" obsession with thinking that everyone likes this series, you are more selfish. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" themselves.
