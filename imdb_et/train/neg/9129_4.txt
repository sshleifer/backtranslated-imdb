It's not around - this movie is terrible. I've seen old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I know the characters and the beginning of this series, but it's still godawful. However, the Peter Sellers genius continues to emerge through the portrayal of Nayland Smith, which has the echoes of the power of simulation through sadness, tragedy, and stoicism; it is a performance that I put in parallel with Peter Cushing's idea of ​​Van Helsinki, but which took a tenth of the cumulative time of all Cushing's "Dracula" films. If the film was made on the 1960s AVENGERS TV show like BUBBA HO-TEP, it could have been something special. If you are Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is something you need to see, but it is a passage to someone else.
