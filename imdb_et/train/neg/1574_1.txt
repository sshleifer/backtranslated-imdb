No story! The plot is hopeless! A movie filmed with accelerated accelerator, brakes and fixed automatic transmission cannot be good! I would have stopped this car for a minute, I was there or the police car constantly after that. I'm sorry for the participants who had to shut down such a bad script. Few scenes, similar to action, were heavily over dramatic and far from reality. In addition, there were many mistakes, such as a robbed car hood that jumped 100 mph. First he just folded on the windshield as it really was, but then it blew out. The car was later on with a movie that was hooded ... <br /> <br /> This movie was nothing but annoying, away from it!
