Do you remember a movie that seemed like you enjoyed in the past that didn't match the same feelings to adults? It happened to me when I went back to school .. National Lampoon's Class Reunion. The film has a great chance to laugh, but surprisingly moves with determination when we see a strange set of characters like a woman who sold her soul to the devil and is able to shoot a fire from her mouth, a man who seems to be a vampire and a woman dressed and wearing bags over her head . You have a class president who believes he is the best for sliced ​​bread (but as we see in the movie, he is a coward and a joke), a couple of pot smokers who don't even know they are in their class reunion, and the man whose name is was Gary, who knew that she even knew it (and no one could remember her name. That's what I enjoyed). There's a plump pervert who loves to grab women in inappropriate places, deaf and blind women who call their dogs to invite, and cook (you know him "goonies" and "Thama Mama From Train") who loves to put food on their plates! The film is basically about a walnut tree that is (or at least tries to) revenge its classmates for pulling her (they arranged to sleep with her two sisters!). The film follows the symbols when they search for old high school dark corridors. They were told by the killer by his psychologist, who seems a little strange. The film has some good gags that work (pretty much early), but the film slows down slowly every minute. The real problem with the movie is that you don't really know where to go. The film is pretty much a prerequisite for fun because it is a safe way ... if it really is. The cast is enthusiastic enough, but the material they want to make funny is not in any way of interest. This is a curio for fans of comedy sources from the early 80s who are forgotten (rightly so).
