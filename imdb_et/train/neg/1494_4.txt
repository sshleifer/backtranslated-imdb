Yes, definitely better than watching my Death Tunnel. In fact, some deaths were quite original and the gore was decent. It was sort of like the wrong gear for the eyes of the mountains. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) "Children" (high school or college?) discuss kitchen horror movies, everything Shae says is an almost exact quotation from Scream (1996). The thing about big-breasted girls etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Was Steve NOT a launcher for Scream Randy? 3.) Besides being in October, what was the hell associated with Samhain? Quite unnecessary when you ask me. I find this humorous when I see the 80's fears that explain the ends of the fingers with the druid or the pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow they made Sam Raim's reference !!! 5.) Why was Gary and her sister in the movie? They have nothing to do with anything. And he's so psychic that he didn't even see his death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at this point were the deaths of just Troma-licious), how did she hear the screams when she was downstairs but didn't hear them when she stood outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis, which is mainly Scottish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is when you're like Shae and you don't have any fun or smile at the whole movie, are you the one who lives? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like Chili con carne walking places. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, did they forget that Steve HAD was out there and didn't know where he went? 11.) Wasn't there more than one killer? Shae won it, but never caught them anymore. <br /> <br /> 12.) What were the setbacks with these people? Half of them Shae didn't know if they were dead or alive, so what was it with? 13.) Why didn't they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why didn't anyone call the police? And probably all those KNEW people lived in the woods, why didn't they ever arrange an attack? 15.) As far as I know, they weren't zombies or vampires, so how would he eventually become one? I am a giant "ah?" With other people. At the end better. I still do not understand why they even placed them in Ireland, given that Samhain had almost nothing to do with the plot.
