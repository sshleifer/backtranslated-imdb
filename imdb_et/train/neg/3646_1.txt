Oh ... my ... god ... this is definitely an absolute cheesy movie I've ever seen. The action is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker and the whole movie doesn't make sense. Connect it to mediocre control, with genuinely strange scenes (such as where a child reaches the river and mysteriously falls) and a thoroughly abysmal dialogue ("Look!" "Black Beet on your pants!") Failure. Not to mention that the only thing that Mr Atlas looks like he could win is the chocolate plates. But it's part of the film's charm. Sit and watch it with some of your friends to laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's just so good!
