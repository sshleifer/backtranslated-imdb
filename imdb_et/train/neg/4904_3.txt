Teamo Supremo has three kids composed of their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battlecry (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And clothes and movements. They work for Governor Kevin and they were recruited after the desire to be heroes and play in this game. They also run a normal life and have family and school responsibilities, but most of the activities are done by anti-school villains. The roots have quite unique and unique features, such as Mister Vague and his men, who never seem to know what their plans are, but they do it anyway. From the evil robot to the evil baron, these three must come into contact and stop their evil and often strange, intend to gain power, revenge, and so on. <br /> <br /> Animation itself is pretty nice and smooth, but style seems to be practical. Backgrounds have overlapping colors and buildings look futuristic. The music is pretty nice and the show is not too bad even though the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> Plots are almost always absurd and ridiculous, but in the end it is a comic and cannot be blamed. But that wouldn't be the same as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
