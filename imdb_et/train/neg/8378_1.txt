This movie is probably the worst film I see in my life! The plot is ridiculous and the whole "Little Man" mess is just so stupid. The whole movie is unreal and stupid. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy." It is just a nonsense terrible piece that should never have been put into theaters. The jokes are not funny and the actress is terrible. Please, please, save your money if you see this precious mess. I had to spend hours and one and a half hours sitting through a small Mani, wishing my eyes bleed. I'm disgusting to think of something like that! Who writes this mess? Does the actor have any talent for getting these people into Hollywood? They make money for this spam!
