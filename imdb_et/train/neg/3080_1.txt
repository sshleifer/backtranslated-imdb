Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks a lot of time. I remember the day I saw it for the first time in MST. The sun was shining, it seemed like a good day. then I saw this Rick Sloane product, which consisted of terrible plus dolls that destroyed the 80's generation. Kevin, smart, extraordinary, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages the assistant's security team, fights his arms and much more in this very poorly-made series of pictures. No plot or story is needed. Obviously no proof of the film is necessary. The army boy and his fellow girl make you jump out of the rock and a dorky friend who gets his sex game tells you, "He has some nice red pants." Plus, I hated the old security guard and wanted him to have an accident at his supermarket trolley. If you think it's over, wait until the Club Scum scene. Ask for a road rash. <br /> <br /> I recommend that after watching the movie, it is a good month to restore your senses and peace of mind. And when you see Rick Sloan, give him a good clip to show you how much we value this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.
