After the first release of four very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has succeeded in scratching the core of the core with BLOODSUCKER leaders DANCE. I didn't find any blood purifiers in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. The mysterious number invites several actresses for a small holiday in their castle. After a few sexual sexual shenanigans, girls get one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herrings here than on the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pace is scary. The story is stupid and skin scenes are not so terrible. <br /> <br /> Give this one.
