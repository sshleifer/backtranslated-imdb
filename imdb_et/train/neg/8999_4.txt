Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV alumni are sometimes in a funny sketch movie. <br /> <br /> However, it is very interesting to look now at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after this movie is supposed to happen, look at how much their ghosts have become completely true: There is a nice trailer for the movie, which probably wasn't even smart, called "The Pregnant Man", which brought Arnold Schwarzenegger's stupid movie "Junior" Is There a commercial that was probably not even smart, was Sammy Davis Jr and Jackie Onasis, called "Celebrity Wrestling", which has now become a popular show "Celebrity Boxing". There's a nice movie trailer that probably wasn't even wise, containing John Candy from the movie about the broken head. Check out this trailer and see how similar the shots and plots are to the Frank Hellenlotter basket! Finally, there is a late late-night documentary "Dead Dream, Only Two Left ...". The name of the documents is ... LATEST HIPS! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four Prophecies!
