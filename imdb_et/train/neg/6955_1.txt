I do not see this series of complaints (which should be sci-fi). It's really just "let's do what soap operatively this week happens" and oh, Cylon is involved through setbacks. <br /> <br /> Cylon "babe", which keeps the woman's second guy, is pretty flat, it is quite obvious that R & D was added to the show. Every time he opens, I'm confused that WTF should happen. And do not even try to say that I am told a "story about the arches". <br /> <br /> This is a soap opera with some CGIs. This is not a fictional fiction beyond the original assumption. <br /> <br /> This series is not all that worked. If you like trendy, sharp, angry, nervous, vague editor-to-crack camera, it may show you. As the notes seem to be screaming about this show, it is a clear sign that the vocal notes have changed from Picard TNG.
