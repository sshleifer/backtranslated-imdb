Please, even if you are in the worst mood, beware of this flick. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie was right. On a friend's suggestion I watched it and I literally looked 1h and 48 minutes along my life in the closet. Poor performance, stupid direction, weak storyline, and pathetic sequences - and if you mix it up, you get "Double Impact". Even the least expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I think I learned one thing - never look at Van Damme's activities. They are a waste of time!
