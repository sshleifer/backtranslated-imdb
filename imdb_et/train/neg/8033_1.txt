In a college dormitory, someone kills a rainbow. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers and tries to commit suicide. He's institutionalized. A year later, he stepped out, has a new boyfriend, Hank (Joseph Lawrence), and he plans to spend the Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in BIG's beautiful apartment in Florida. Of course, the killer (without reason) opens and kills again. <br /> <br /> Lousy Slasher Thriller - A textbook example of how not to make a low budget horror movie. For starters, a big part of this movie is the endless filler of these six idiots in the video itself, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, acting stupid etc. etc. Also, there is no nudity here at all. I'm not saying the horror film needs nudity, but NOT that it would have helped to revive it. No death is really shown (you hear them), it's just a little bloody and not gore. There's one REAL gruesome one - but it's not over yet. <br /> <br /> With some exceptions, breastfeeding works. Dorie Barton is terrible because the main woman and Tom Jay Jones are sad as Oz. Chad Allen opens like Brad and he is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good - beautiful and hunky and gives her everything. And Jeff Conaway will appear in a small role that will do a good job. Baston doesn't respond funny to seeing a friend's killing and what happens to Lawrence? His symbol disappears without traces! Blank, stupid, no gore, no nudity - skip it.
