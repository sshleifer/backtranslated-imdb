It is written on the poster: "When she was born, she could live for 6 years ... at 34 she takes a lifetime journey." Ami is an American born Israeli who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at one year of age. At the age of 34, after his love for his 22-year-old caregiver did not go well, he decided to go to the US for a doctor who said he had only six years to live. He wanted to tell the doctor that he was still alive and weighed 39 pounds. Why? You probably are as good as me, even though I've seen this movie. who diagnosed my disease 34 years ago? His doctor told his mother that, on the basis of medical history, people with his illness did not live for a long time. What is his vision of an old doctor's door? Why is this old doctor watching in the US his lifetime journey? We have so many things that Ami would be interested in: how can he make these animations with just one finger? How can she live through everyday life, completely dependent on others? How did he live his doctor's prediction? How does she emotionally deal with when other people look at her like watching a strange creature? The film didn't tell us anything. Instead, he became a filmmaker and made a trip to let Amil show his old doctor on the door to show him that he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
