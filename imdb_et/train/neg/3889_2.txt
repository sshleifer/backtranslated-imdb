I've always wanted to see it because I love cheesy horror movies and with such a title I was sure that "incredible melting man" would be very fun. <br /> <br /> It wasn't really. I mean, it was a joyfully bad thing, the script included some classic bad lines, and the special effects seemed like someone had been sneezing the whole actor, so I should have loved it. Unfortunately, these highlights are really brash. I decided to check the last half of the movie when making my tax return. So this movie is boring. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, if you love bad movies, you'll enjoy the dramatic exit of fat cover and dr. Star of a man playing Ted. To be fair to a poor person, he has to give some amazingly intuitive lines with a straight face - like a conversation with his wife about tracking an IM-man: <br /> <br /> "I find him with a Geiger counter." "Is he radioactive?" "A little bit." Yes, there is Dr Ted on the plot, who says he's trying to find a super-comfortable zombie killing machine that is armed with just what looks like a mini-Dyson. He's a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan fails if he finds that the tree has a lot of hands. "Oh God - this is his ear!" says Dr Ted to the audience. I'm so glad he canceled it. <br /> <br /> I understand that the sound of this movie is quite fun. It would be if it was just 10 minutes, but unfortunately it goes on and the incredible melting just leaves a sticky confusion if I think I should eat more people. I think if you were really stoned, you would probably love it, just not pop-cakes during the film because the leader's actor really is close to the end.
