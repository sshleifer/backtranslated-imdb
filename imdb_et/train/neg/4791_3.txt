* spoliers * will not read further if you have not seen this movie. <br /> <br /> After getting depressed "Phantasm II"; The high man robs Mike, while Reggie and the new boy Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back, not as a slave on the Tall Man's Red Planet. It becomes really stupid: the shelter of the trio in the bright red heart was only a comic, and the black karate chick (not remembering its name) was so irritating that I couldn't wait to see if Tall Man killed his character. It makes it almost look like it is the character of Timi, who arrives late and finally hero, but ... it doesn't work that way. At the end of this story, the killers of Liz are killed by the Middle Ages, Mike gets into his skull with a silver sphere, the spheres get Reggie and the dwarf Tim and there is no one to stop Tall Man. Bad guy wins - now, how is it at the end of the surprise? <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1993 and wasn't released until '95, and its ending was final and although it was disappointing and anticlimactic it was also a suitable and appropriate end to this strange little series. But the fourth changes this end and adds something new but more bad jokes and worse and more meaningless ends ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out ****
