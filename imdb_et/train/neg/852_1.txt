I keep it short. This wonderful "customization" of the king's book is a bad joke and nothing else. Of course, there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this site, and as a result, this film has mysteriously found its way Jack Nicholson is ridiculous as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall. The story that has nothing to do with the book is inconsistent and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are full of fun. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who hasn't read the book and want to understand the characters in this story: Stick to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and people who say Kubrick was right to destroy the king's story, is the king ... not a good writer who should stick to "masterpieces" like "wide eyes".
