This film is another example of East Asian cinema: two or more separate film rolls. Other reviewers have obviously accepted it because there are several "first part" and "second part". How can characters and story be characterized or deepened in such a short time? I enjoyed the first part until it suddenly stopped (it didn't stop, it just stopped in what seemed to be the middle of the story) to replace the man and the absolutely incredible second part that seemed to focus on the girl rearranges and cleans the man's apartment (wow!) I'm looking forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai is given a decent script to work!
