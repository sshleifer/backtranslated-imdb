I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, which was attended by great Dr. Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> The film is simply, very bad. And no, not the usual Uwe Bollil "so bad that it's actually fun", but just bad. The plot concerns a man who drives a terrible life (due to earlier criminal records, probably), can't get a job and a terrible 900 pounds cheating on his wife. This man is turning to his cult leader-uncle to steal a toy truck containing avian influenza virus. Al Qaeda also has toy theft designs and the following is just under two hours of incomprehensible sex and violence. ), the jokes never rise above the children who are slowly released during the chest, and the people who take the poo. It should be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think of the "plane!", but that's what South Park's creators do and joke about.
