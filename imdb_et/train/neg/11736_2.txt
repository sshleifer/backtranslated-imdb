A week before I saw Iowa, I saw an art school confidential, where a pretentious student makes a film and can't decide if she wants it to be art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the film he did. I see many better movie elements in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. But in addition to artiness, both films had a good character and a coherent story. Iowa. This film stumbles upon an insecure end. I have to admit that this is consistent. This movie is bad from start to finish and not particularly worse or better. The participants did everything they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why does he have to show this ball to the ball.
