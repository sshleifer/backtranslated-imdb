The previous comment made me write it. He says Muslims are blond and the Serbs are blind (because our blood is confusing). This comment simply says that this opinion can be made racist. Look, race is nothing. I'm colored blind. I see like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. I could add that I am not a 100% Serbian, that I have some blood from Austria and Croatia, but what is this point. Am I a dark, half-breed? Anyone who uses such bad will racial prejudices as Lantos (producer9 and director is racist for me. Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman, they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my homeland, Yuggoslavia. I hope they are all in hell, but it doesn't return our dead relatives back, I'm proud to be Serbian and I'm proud of my cousin, austria, croatia, moslems, hungarians, arabs (yes i am from Serbia and i have a diverse family) does not show the suffering of the Serbs or Croats in Sarayevos, the terrible terrorism of street gangs, the Muslim extremism.I add: I kneel and pray for all the innocent sisters and brothers who are Muslims, Catholics or Orthodox who were killed in this war. It doesn't help Lantos to fill their pockets any more, forever!
