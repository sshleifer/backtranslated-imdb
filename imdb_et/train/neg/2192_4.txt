Another film based on the lost trick of a mad scientist. At the heart of the film is a surgeon whose life goal is to bring the dead ... back to life. I know, I know ... you never heard of it! Of course, as all these films go, the experiment goes very, very wrong, and creates a manic, bloody creature. In this promising setting, you think it would be at least a bit stopping. Wrong. Like many movies of this era, the idea is nice, but filling and scripting are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but none of the gems.
