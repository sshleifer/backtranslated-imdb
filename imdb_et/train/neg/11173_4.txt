If it wasn't for bad dialogs and script. I mean, the direction was really related to this topic. The actors did a good job of bringing their characters to life. Finally, what was really missing was a solid script that keeps all the pieces together. I would rather not look at it. If you're not an Al Pacino enthusiast like me and I look at everything he plays. Even if the last result is pretty bad. This is a very bad film for the actor after S1m0ne, knowing how to choose roles.
