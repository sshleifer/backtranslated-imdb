This movie is trying hard, but there is no full fun of the 1960s TV series that I'm sure people will love. Although I am 17 years old, I have been watching some series on YouTube for a long time and it was enjoyable and fun. Unfortunately, this movie is not very fair for the series. <br /> <br /> Special effects are more of a non-standard and not supported by flat camera work. The script was also boring and lacked a miracle and a sense of humor. Other films with scripting parallel are Home Alone 4, Cat Hat, Thomas and Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now I say I liked the idea of ​​the idea, but unfortunately it was badly executed and evaporated too early and I'm not sure that for this reason it is something for the family. And I was disturbed by the talking suit, despite Wayne Knight's voice work. <br /> <br /> But the thing that most angered me about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels, and Daryl Hannah. , all very talented participants. Jeff Daniels has previously featured some good performances, but he didn't see what he was supposed to do and, unfortunately, Elizabeth Hurley's character was so pointless. Daryl Hannah is a cute actor and is generally ignored, and I liked the idea that she is in love, but unfortunately you see her very little (not to mention the Monster attack that scares the children when tempted). Shawn is a government. Christopher Lloyd learns better and as an actor who likes Lloyd much (he was in two of my favorite films, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I love the future), but he was given a little work and had a tendency to join quite wildly. <br /> <br /> In general, as much as I wanted to like this movie, I left the impression. Instead of being fun, it became meaningless and disgraceful because it had many potentials, some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor performance. 1/10 Bethany Cox
