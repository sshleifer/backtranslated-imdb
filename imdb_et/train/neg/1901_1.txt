This inspection may include some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The classic 1974 movie "Gone in 60 Seconds" reprocessing begins well. In fact, it works well and the plot is moving quite well. But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more plausible. For those who don't know, the initial plot was theft as an insurance inspector. Who would suspect them. But even in almost every H.B. Halick's original, remake is a very good movie until we reach the final chase scene, part of 74, which made it great. In this version, only 10 minutes are steeped and culminates in a monstrous special effect that takes all the beliefs out of the pursuit. When the original chase was very plausible, the leader of the star stunts, who did all of his stunt, dropped the remake over the last 15 minutes. If you would like to watch a classic car chase, put a fine trash on your local rental contract and leave the new remake clear.
