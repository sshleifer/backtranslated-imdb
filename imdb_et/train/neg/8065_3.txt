Steve Carpenter can't make horror films. First, the casting of this film was very wrong. The only dignified part was Buffy Vampire Slayer's hot brown haired girl. Such films do not have gore (usually the main component of the horror film), do not, do not act or have a relationship (also an essential ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actress, but she's so dry and clear that it's sad. There were some parts that had to be funny (continuing teenage horror / comedy films) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought this film was rated R and I didn't pay attention and realized it was changed to PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie if you liked to know what I did last summer. This is the only person who finds this film even frightening. And seriously, this is for you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
