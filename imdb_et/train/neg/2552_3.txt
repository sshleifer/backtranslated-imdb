It's listed as a documentary, it's not, it's filmed like a documentary, but I suspect it's just because they get off the shaky camera and filthy filming. It has recently been released on UK DVD as "American Pie Style Comedy". That's not the case either. <br /> <br /> Basically, it will move around the youth group on the spring day when they go cheap to Mexico. and the pursuit of reaching a virgin friend there. Throw a couple of dwarfs, as well as the same endeavor and you have an unpleasant story about drunk teens trying to get girls. <br /> <br /> Considering 18 ratings, it has very little nudity and virtually zero sex scenes, and I think the rating is a horse with a lot. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass with no sense of humor, it may be your thing if you have brain cells then I probably missed it!
