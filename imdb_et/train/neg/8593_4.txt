I finally saw it. I didn't go when it came out for the first time because frankly I was afraid. Fear how bad it can be or how disappointing. Although not as bad as it is better than clones, it wasn't particularly memorable or satisfactory. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the indexation of the opening to the final credits, it was a film experience I never forget. An timeless story about a boring peasant who just knows he was meant to be more, saving the princess of the princess and the galaxy when he is guided by smart wise, fake pirates and various comics - all in the room-opera setting. <br /> <br /> And this is not to use Lucas in its old form. This is an old formula just because it works. And for his credit he gave him a new twist that made it very special. <br /> <br /> Then the empire came and the story got more than just a fairy tale. The darkness entered the picture and we learned that one of the great movie speeds is all the time. The great villain, Vader was Luke's father. Oh, no one saw it coming. Of course, Lucas is not convinced that it did not appear in the script. Go back and check out Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in the light of the first three episodes, see if it is really your eyes. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the problem. Revenge is an entertaining film - with tremendous impact, plenty of action, good fighting scenes. But the film still lives or dies on its plot - the story he is talking about. Certainly, a really good actor can save a weak plot, but a weak plot with bad behavior - this is the burden that no driver can overcome, certainly not as bad as I'm compelled to realize that George Lucas is (man managed to direct some the worst performances of the career of the very finest participants - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * Content. The Lord. Understand that it has already happened in the first two films, so it's an incredible burden. One too much to overcome him. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have absolute absurdity in the background. We have found that Anakin is a child in Tatooine, the result of a virgin, wonderful birth - "selected". Well, this detail will never be clear from remote control. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. Well, well, then. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> The same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, that's coincidence. And he comes back to Tatooine and never knows he was there? Wow! How about it. Testing for stopping the old incredible stop there, George? Anyway, we have this dirty boy, desperate, petulant and young man, who must somehow become the biggest villain in the history of cinematography - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - a good boy who falls from grace to finally achieve redemption at last. <br /> <br /> How, pray, does that happen? Why, he is a dream that his wife dies in childbirth. Now, he's sure he's living a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity as we treat gasoline, but does that happen to be "dark" so maybe check the doctor's cause maybe, maybe, this futuristic society can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think of is to go to a child to kill, because a bad boy who has been persecuted by all two films tells him that he has a secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, he does it. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How does Lucas expect us to look at this kind of stupidity and move it? How can anyone wait for us? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed first. I wanted Kenobi not to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. By the way, Amidala finally dies. At delivery. Why? Well, they don't know. The doctor who is a droid and himself, which shows the incredibly high technology that this society has developed, offers only the conclusion "he has lost his will to live". Well, oh, of course, he's. Maybe he finally created him what he was sleeping on. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We're all over Kenobi. He knows Luke and Find the birth. Knows who their father is and knows what's going on with them. It also knows the role of both R2 and C3PO. And again, after several years of Luke's approach to masculinity and appearing with 3PO and R2 (curiously wiping out the 3PO mind but not R2 - why ????), saying, "I think these droids belong to you," Kenobi who knows that the protocol droid is built on what he thought was "chosen" and the emperor himself was a apprentice and who says just about building this planet, "says strange, I don't remember owning. droids". <br /> <br /> Oh good mourning. <br /> <br /> Lucas just passed it. When he introduced VAder as Luke's father, this story began to regret, because he didn't know what was going on. The scheme of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine made any rational sense at all. And none of this relates to the story he originally talked about in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This is aftertaste and looks like. <br /> <br /> I can't give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun movie to watch but completely forgotten. Star Wars is in my mind forever. Fortunately, it and the two will soon disappear.
