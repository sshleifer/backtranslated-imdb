I saw a movie today in a free preview screen and, despite not paying a dime for seeing this movie, I still felt a gap. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and when you see this movie, you leave Benjamin in place. Action is best; Kiefer Sutherland's handsets in Jack Bauer's and Michael Douglas's worst recognitions show that he understands that he made a bad choice, leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones to throw this turkey.
