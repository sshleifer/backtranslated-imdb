I saw the "Deathstalker III" MST3K version and loved the movie so much - even "unmystied" - that I decided to watch the entire "Deathstalker" movie series. I bought I and II and started laughing. <br /> <br /> There was nothing funny about "Deathstalker I" and when I rolled credit, I was embarrassed and regretted having bought it! Too much ugly and nudity. I think either "DS 3" was much cleaner production, or MST3K really changed a lot because I was expecting something similar, that is, foolish and trouble-free and simple. I was wrong. Even $ 6.99 seemed like a waste of money. I didn't even open "DS 2" when I send it back tomorrow. Now I just throw this DVD off because I can't send it back and nobody wants it - I too! So don't worry about it. Even nudity (much of it, btw) is uninspiring and icky.
