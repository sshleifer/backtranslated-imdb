What I can say was the theft of my time that I saw this movie and I have to say what is a terrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actor and not convincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a refresher. To put it less, the plot is thin, the Canton dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie for your threat. <br /> <br /> David Tang from Shanghai Tango should be after the movie for the small or missing income that this film produces. The banal plot attempts to compete with other Roma and simply blends into the landscape. It was like drying the paint. In short, this film was a complete waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on youtube.
