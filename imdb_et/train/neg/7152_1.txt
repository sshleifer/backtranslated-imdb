Based on a one-time girlfriend and F. Scott Fitzgerald's own novel, this poignant story was written by the telling columnist Sheila Graham. Gregory Peck continues shamelessly with excessive force as an alcoholic; inconsistent with the gentle and soft spoken by true Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the era of Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing, he was a highly respected author in his later life, living in a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to slip his slip tracks to support both his wife (mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving with a second hand Chevrolet's life was 180 degrees different from that in this film. <br /> <br /> Almost every 20th-century Fox film made by Daryll F. Zanuck, as well as almost every film by Henry King, was a top-notch work. The beloved Infidel was an exception.
