This movie was positively the worst film I ever watched. I couldn't sit the whole thing. I also think the writer must have some strange fetishes to make the women pee and beat ... I mean what it was! I can't believe it was even done and I've been disgusted when I got a rent for # 4. The quality of both the picture and the sound is terrible, working ... well does not exist. It was a bad excuse for the movie and the scenes of pee, crap and cunt resemble 2 girls in 1 cup. Urghh ....... ALL COSTS! The girls saw that they were taken out of the street and would only get the part they would like to take off their top ... Although these girls have a nice body, it certainly didn't guarantee that their contempt was terrible it wasn't convincing and hurt me to the ears. <br /> <br /> It was similar (maybe worse) than formal school production without the right direction and he doesn't need a set because it all seems to rotate around the car! <br /> <br /> Not sure people would buy people. I'm sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I didn't find anything positive and I would think I can save someone who is wasting my money as I have.
