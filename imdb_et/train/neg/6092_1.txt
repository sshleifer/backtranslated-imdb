Somebody has to be serious about making this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's absolutely impossible that this movie was made in 1993. Fashion and music require it to be serious in the 80s. My guess is that it has been sitting on the shelf for a long time before a crazy distributor took it and released it to the unbelieving world. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. Something similar. A strange loner meets a casual man with a beard telling him that if he meditates when singing his favorite song he can turn to the one he chooses. Here I feel obliged to note that the individual's favorite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is it his favorite song? Because he's an idiot. In the film we are only a minute and the film has already reached monumental stupidity. It's even a stupider. <br /> <br /> An individual is a nose-catcher. I can only assume this if there are two scenes in the movie where she sees the nose. This clears the title. She decides to go to the girl to get close to other girls. And kill them. It's more or less that. <br /> <br /> Operation is universally terrible. The single performance of each movie sucks. In fact, I would like to go so far as to say that acting is a pornographic film standard. It's really terrible. The nostril appears to the audience as a nostril. The film's characters see her as the girl she's been singing with. London Bridge is falling. Man, I feel like an idiot even when I write it. Anyway, it's a kind of strange vision of the Middle Ages, hanging with schoolgirls. And not well. There are even extended assembly scenes where the nostril is in school with the girls and the song plays up. This is probably the worst song ever recorded. I don't even describe it. You know it when you hear it. And you agree with me. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are scenes of violence. And there is a Benny Hill-style tracking sequence that includes a transsexual. There is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nose-catcher tells the prostitute: 'I have money when you have gash'. Cute, I'm sure you agree. <br /> <br /> Don't mess up.
