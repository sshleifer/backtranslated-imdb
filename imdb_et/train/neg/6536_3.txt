This DVD seems to be targeting someone who simply puts it in and plays it with an endless loop. It is hosted by a number of Grand Canyon music videos placed on various Tangerine Dream music pieces. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD music is boring and the transmission to the DVD is rather blurry and dim. Too expensive DVD what it is.
