SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies ever made - it's that simple. There is no redemption of the quality of this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite complicated - they really lead you to believe that this movie is shocking and takes you to the edge of your seat. Instead, you spend 83 minutes without an organization while watching stolen and badly done scenes. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. The characters show their far-reaching teleportation capabilities, such as Alex Thomas, who falls into the lake (drunk), and then reaches his boat in an impossible place. Angie Harmon made Kate an evil result, which was worsened by the space-time continuum pull dialog that seems to have been written by the fifth-class at the last minute. An example of this would be when he said, "Flashlight!" so stupid in that it shows the threshold of how much the human body can before half clicks. Finally, editing this movie was far from the odd and terrible thing I've ever seen. It was like a cameraman had a number of reflectors that the scientists got for the video cameras. An example of this would be when we suddenly get the headlamp of Alex's car. I bet there was no time to edit this movie. The end was completely pathetic. The writers were obviously trying to create a mysterious plot line that made the viewer say, "Oh yeah!" Instead, we've been looking at some spider painting that fits the story line. Unfortunately, there aren't millions of prospects that could save this movie because it's a scary piece. <br /> <br /> I'll give it. that this movie was recorded on film instead of being a picture book.
