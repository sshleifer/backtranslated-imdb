Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn! : = 8O <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ ... <= 8. <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry, sleep asleep there. Now where was I? Oh yes, "Predicted man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <br /> <br /> You are sorry. Yes, "Predicted Man". Well, this is a British sci-fi who wonders something. Some orange-headed men predict themselves with a laser, getting a touch of death. Finally, it disappears, finally. In fact, the film is not so interesting. Bored, droning, starchy, rigid, and breaking boring, "Predicted Person" is not 77 solid minutes, not anyone. Empty like water. Empty like a door cap. Dull like Ethan Hawke - we're really talking here, people! But wait, MooCow now makes a "Project Manager" for our dull cousins ​​who are all over the dragon: <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............. <= 8.
