This movie wasn't nearly as big as I had expected. In this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy a few seconds shine. Most of the actors are mediocre, but in the 1970's style, full of pregnant breaks. The photographer and the model know some strange forest rides and will soon fall victim to the same events. Flying plates are noticed, more people are disappearing - but is it an alien or an ultra-secret group of our own government that is hidden? Soon, the reporter and "UFOlogist" (apparently as an example of the character of the writer-director) will be drawn into this devastating fiasco and become the target of highly secret agents who are as threatening as they are unlikely and harmless. Then the fun really begins. A film that is predictable will do as much thinking as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but it should be praised for having taken it so seriously. Camera work is a low budget movie OK, this pace is pretty good, the script is stupid and absurd and there are consistency issues that are fun to watch. What are the seconds of shine I mentioned? Honestly, I can't tell you much without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the movie is at least worthwhile to direct it quickly if you can't reach the center.
