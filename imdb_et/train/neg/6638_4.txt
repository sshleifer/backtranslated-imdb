Note to all the promising filmmakers: Explore this movie. If your dialog reads this movie as a dialogue, break your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I had no great expectations but were interested in the description that shows that the Christmas decoration was a secret factory. The mystery is solved very early and the film becomes a straight romance. I almost stopped watching it for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and the first break. My husband, a fan of Hallmark & ​​Lifetime, gave up his first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a city of business - its core business is Aikens Ornaments, who make all kinds of holiday arrangements. The patriarch of the company has recently died, so the future of businesses may be questionable. Soon we will meet Noelle, who would be on Wall Street rather than Main Street, and mysterious Justin, who gets a date with Noelle after the big snowman she pulls into Justin's car. When we meet Alison Aikens, with due diligence on the board, we have a story. <br /> <br /> If you can't go all the way rounds with the first commercial break, you haven't seen enough of this Holiday movie. Maybe it's good.
