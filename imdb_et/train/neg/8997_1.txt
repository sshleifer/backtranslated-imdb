This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and except for "They saved Hitler's brain," the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV, and so I was expecting what I thought would be the most fun movie that could be produced because it had no restrictions that TV improvisations had to deal with. <br /> <br /> Writers must have thought that we are throwing some harsh, some flatulence, some cheap sex and hey, we have a risky side that shares a ridiculous comedy. The game show skits are nothing but cheap unimaginable attacks with foolproofness. The seat competition with one girl and her boyfriend was just a bad high school humor. The stun gun advertisement was a humor for Seasame Street. The LA subway skit was tasteless humor, using delicious bleeding. The French chef, who walked the dark circle constantly, speaking "no difference" with the French accent, was my point. <br /> <br /> The only funny skit Chevy Chase that lasted a whole minute. This means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes, I have read the comments about rock stoning in the whole country in the 1970s, and you like this film if you're high. Well most of the country wasn't stoned in the 70s. If inert writers were stripped of stones, it must be drunk in sinus medicine. There were 4 more people in the theater when I saw this movie. Of course, the word didn't get how bad the film was.
