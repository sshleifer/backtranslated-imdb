I was attracted to the headline ... I was expecting a straightforward and intriguing journey of alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story of dirty Scotland. <br /> <br /> Widget is not much psychological depth unless you want to categorize cheesy teen-like poetry into psychology. <br /> <br /> It was disgraceful because the core of the story could have been a good, better effort to portray the inner feelings of a man who had to live out of his youth for alcohol and violence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be "I am as I am because it is the way I am". And the ridiculously bad attempt to give a lower class person a poetic edge makes things worse. Using the "poète maudit" over-the-top cliché is an inexpensive way to make a dull movie look smart, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16-year-old alcohol" is not much wise, artistic or meaningful ... The guideline does not change at all, and the weak change attempt fails without a good explanation. Just like the original experiment happened blue. <br /> <br /> The film borrowed strongly from the classic, such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but ultimately it can't recover its size, even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and left the rest unnoticed, giving us a film that is pleasing to the eye, but meaningless to the brain.
