When you read the book - don't set your hopes high if you haven't done it - read it and never look at the movie. It is strange to know that Toby Young actually did a lot of script writing (as he says in the letter of the book). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the film seems to be aimed at is rather a thought-provoking and entertaining part that combines philosophical ideas with ordinary funny sarcasm and simplifies it so that everyone can understand it - it will achieve perfection. The movie is full of bad and cheap jokes that fit for sitcom and has lost any meaningful message he could have. <br /> <br /> You are better off seeing.
