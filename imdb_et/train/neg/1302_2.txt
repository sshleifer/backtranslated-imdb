This movie is like every other Dutch movie, so if you enjoy movies like a fur tree and a de kleine blonde. then maybe it's good (although these two have a lot of better stories and actors), Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even that one good scene will get you something to do. There's a lot of nudity (but I and others just couldn't find this girl attractive), dialogue is ridiculous (because we made a lot of other filmmakers' outrage) and some scenes are so totally random that it's more involuntary comedy than anything else (like casual a scene where an owl hangs on someone's eye ... he has nothing to do with it and just refer to it once in a sentence, saying, "Did you hear what happened ... I was there"). the only reason I gave it is that some places where they are beautiful are so. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the hidden preview (here in the Netherlands there is a strange system of hidden preview, you pay less money than a regular movie and you don't know what movie is that you know that is a new movie that is not yet in theaters.I'm advised to stay away from this movie if you really want to see a good Dutch movie or a zwartboek.
