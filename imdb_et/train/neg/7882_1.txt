After stopping movie recording to find something to watch, we stumbled upon it. All in all, it was at least attractive, so we tried to try it out. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's really enjoyable! Wait, wait, talked too fast. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the film, the film was reluctantly becoming a basic, right-hand, Christian brain wash. Not sure what happens, but I think the scriptwriter found that God is somewhere there, has finished writing this script and he didn't have time to change it because he had a meeting with friends of Westboro church and his hood was not clean. <br /> <br /> Can they warn you about this? I refuse to support this religious idiot. Like video games, evaluation systems, films need some sort of symbol: perhaps a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that the film is getting worse. <br /> <br /> If you don't share your feelings with any morality of your story and your Bible opens on your lap when you look at it and plan how to convert neighbors, don't waste your time. It's some of the worst junkies that have come out for a very long time, and radical religious nuts no longer need funding.
