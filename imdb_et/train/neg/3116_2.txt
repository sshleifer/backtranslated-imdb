Most of what is said about the negative aspects of the film is true. <br /> <br /> HOW .... If I have to sit through the movie, then: <br /> <br /> Director <br /> <br /> Photographer Director <br /> <br /> Delivery <br /> <br /> Don't leave the frantic microphone hanging in and out of almost every movie chapter on how I can enjoy the story and focus on it, as well as believe in darnis when I recall the technical features of making a movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Waiting for a DVD or DON'T ANOTHER
