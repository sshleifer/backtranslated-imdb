This film describes a couple of men (one of Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two dragging kings in a matter of hours overnight in Miami. Convergence lines ultimately bring all people together in one place and time. The film was a little entertaining, but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally too little to see what was going on. In some scenes, you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the development process to save the images. Nobody knew how to use the movie. Amazingly, this movie was even released!
