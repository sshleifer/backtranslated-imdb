All Internet offices were left aside, this movie was terrible for God. I was expecting the film to be more farce than anything. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie and they were completely lost. Samuel Jackson was just some good parts and a few good lines. In addition, it was a bunch and some badly animated snakes. All the fun of the internet was better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. Don't waste your time or money on what's over the mortgage trash. If you are looking for something that is funny and fun, just go to the Snakes blog.
