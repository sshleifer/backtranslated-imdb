Burt Reynolds came to his career where he seemed to be moving through the movements. He showed up at the party with his friends at the movie and takes a big salary home. It seemed he didn't like the product he represented was a nonsense. <br /> <br /> No movie gave more than the "Stroker Ace", which makes "Cannonball Run" classic and "Cannonball Run II" watchable. Some races to record a scene are worth nothing. Even beautiful Loni Anderson worship it as halban as stupid blonde it is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If the idea that Burt grabs it with Jim Nabors and dresses like a chicken, it sounds funny, so it's your movie. and it is not worse.
