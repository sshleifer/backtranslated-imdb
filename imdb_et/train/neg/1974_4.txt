Some people have been thinking about distributing this film because they doubt the credibility of the black people in the old west, the Asian people in the western west, or the weapons of the old west. Get the grip and read the book. Asians (Chinese) were rather small, there were many black (freelancers) and all people outside the Gentile class had access to weapons; this is the second change you know. As for the use of modern language, none of these Western people is nostalgic with the language actually used, which is in line with the time shown. The Americans had different accents, used different inflation, spoke at very different pace, and used many words and phrases that would be recognizable today. Don't blame historical inaccuracy for simply not complaining about it. Be honest. Maybe you are just uncomfortable with what you see.
