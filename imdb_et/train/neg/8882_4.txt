To make a movie about a ghostly ghost that involves revenge outside of fear and inanimate, would be too ironic, but here is the indisputable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); Being independently monitored, it is a clich√© to provoke chills. But thanks to the terrible strait where the British film industry was in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script, like this one, was able to attract ten stars - Cliff Robertson (as a husband), Jean Simmons (title role), Jenny Agutter (like Robertson's artist half-sister), Simon Ward (mysterious driver), Ron Moody (as a bad doctor), Michael Jayston (as a Robertson business partner), best friend of Judy Geeson (like Simmons) and Jayston's husband), Flora Robson (housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as a notary reads Simmons' will) and surprisingly Jack Warner (tombstone sculptor) - though most of them don't really have anything, I'm sorry to say!
