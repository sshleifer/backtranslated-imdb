Please! Don't waste money on this movie. It is really something other than every boring German Blair witch made by high school students. I couldn't look at it and I usually like to watch all kinds of B movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for that? !!! Funny, however: see Wikipedia in the "dark area". The guy who wrote must be completely in his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. The money that should have been spent on the actors, the camera and the editing. Even this would not have helped because there is no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately, too much attention has already been paid to the dark area. Please, the director, producer and author of this movie, making STOP from such movies ... you are not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better movie without this movie.
