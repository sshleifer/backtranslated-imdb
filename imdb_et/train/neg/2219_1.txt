Perhaps one of the most amazing horror classics ever made, Halloween has memorable Michael Myers and some of Jamie Lee Curti's big actors. <br /> <br /> But this rewrite factor is very close to zero, as the real events take an unforgettable time for boredom / culmination. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that can be walked away from the microwave popcorn and nothing left. <br /> <br /> How it created so many sequences, I never understand. <br /> <br /> God thanks Rob Zombie for that. And generally hate predictions. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he compensates for any occasional time-related gaps with some peculiar points of interest that were originally lacking. <br /> <br /> This is a movie we know as we have, as we teach, that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Don't think it's classic.
