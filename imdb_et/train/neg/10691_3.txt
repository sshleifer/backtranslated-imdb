I told myself whether to rent it or not. I'm always afraid to rent something I've never heard of (don't remember it in theaters). Big cast ... it's scales. 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching it. The first few minutes are fun to watch but incredible. After that it gets worse. Writers of this film could do little research on future projects if they wanted to make their films even a little better. Or they could just try something a bit plausible. I'll give him a letter to write 3 ... 1 (just because there are words) and 2 to get so many good participants to accept this movie, even though the script has read. Oh my god, this movie sucks.
