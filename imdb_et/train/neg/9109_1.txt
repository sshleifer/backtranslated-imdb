The first cruel intentions, the original, are my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth could they continue so badly. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first film. Amy Adams sucks on it. He's terrible. And could they find a chick who actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean come. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian's first film is dirty, deceptive and much more evil than Sebastian's prequel. And what is the story line. It basically goes so ... <br /> <br /> 1 - Sebastian has a bad report in his first school, so the movie says, though he doesn't mention anything about him and his dating life and how he's girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York and suddenly he decides to turn around. He "falls in love with Danielle" (maybe I'll remind you that the original, Sarah Michelle giller says you quote "you broke for the first time you ever loved because I said - so how can she be in love with prequel and she is all nice and charming and all "good person" when he goes off a sex chick whose dad did. <br /> <br /> 3 - He makes a full 180 and ends at the end of the film in the thirties and then cherry. I think it's terrible and I loved the first one so much, I've not seen the third yet, I hope God is better than this prequel.
