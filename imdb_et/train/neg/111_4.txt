My interest in Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Although they had great actors / actors, there were too many sub-blocks to preserve their interests. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. The dialogue was rigid and confusing, and the story just turned around to be credible. I was quite disappointed with what I thought was one of Audrey Hepburn's latest films. I always love John Ritter for the best. He was just too pathetic.
