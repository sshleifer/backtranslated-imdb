Some may say something like "Baby Geniuses" with their giant robotic infants or "Dumbo" along with their psychedelic drug-related nightmare sequence would win the prize for the most annoying film ever made for children. You can say that too, but you would be wrong. Look and see, because I bring to you: Santa Claus, which is the most helplessly mixed family film from ... well, ever. <br /> <br /> Scenes that show children from different parts of the world who sing their unpleasant works (seriously, this segment is almost 20 minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot)! The conclusion that Merlin opens out and saves the day (do not forget him, he is Barcelona), this is a childhood trauma at his finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... can't ... get ... those ... reindeer ... laughing ... out. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this thought-provoking trash as you want to avoid the starved whale during the mating. However, if the burning gay demons that have a serious case of infected flu are something for you, I think you should try it. But this film is not worth your time and mental health.
