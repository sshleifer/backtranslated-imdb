I'm not a film critic now, but I hated "11. September ”. This movie was generally bad. With the exception of the Alejandro González Iñárritu segment, which was the most effective and direct on the subject, short films were the best and worst offense. The worst, in my opinion, was the horrible segment of Youssef Chahine, in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers with American soldiers, even so far as to assume that suicide battles fought for a greater cause. The segment was completely on the subject, and given Chahine's seemingly lacking dignity, I wasted my time and patience. The idea of ​​becoming a director from eleven different countries to make a film about their tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
