This movie was the worst film I've ever seen. It was like the "homework" of the film class. It leaves a signal of the message he is talking about, completely lost. The characters are exaggerated, bad acting, and if the plot ... it's totally ridiculous. The cover image is what made me think it might be a decent film, the co-actor is beautiful and there's something about it. The morale of this movie: NEVER CONFIRM YOUR YEAR! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you're much better than me. It was painful to look and, frankly, I am surprised that someone would spend money to do it and distribute it!
