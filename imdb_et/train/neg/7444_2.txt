If you are not tempted by Russian-speaking people or wild boar, this movie is snorefest. In fact, I was swimming for about 40 minutes and I had to fight to just leave the theater. I wish I had. Perfect lovely Saturday evening waste. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was worse. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was worse. I'm still unclear about what should be scary about this flick. <br /> <br /> First of all, I am very gentle on films that use "pidgin russian" as it was on the original credit. It is embarrassing for me because I brought my group of Russian friends and we all shook. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, luckily (and probably you), this movie has already escaped your brain and I stepped out of it one hour ago. So I have no specifics, just dark visions that don't go anywhere and some glorious-now-dead hopes that something will happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw a completely corrupted version of this movie because I can't believe it, I got such great comments (which is why I saw it) and ended up so completely not only with horror or effort but with also the overall value of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I give him 2 because yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and didn't leave.
