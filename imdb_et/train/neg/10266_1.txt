1st reviewed on 11/07/2004 - 1 of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): The overall resurrection of the 70's anticipated horror shots like Friday 13th (versions 1 through all?). I can't redeem a lot here except (or do I think something?)? The story revolves around stupid people who listen to the radio program one year after some children were killed in the forest as "respects" allegedly. But look, one fool of people is related to the actual event, because his sister was one of those who was murdered (again, how stupid it is that she would even be part of it). Guess? The murderer is back again and we start from the beginning who it is (so any secret goes). And besides, where are the "police officers" and why no one calls them. I can't believe anyone funded this movie. You think that by now American peoples are considered to be a little higher, at least in their film experience, but not that filmmaker.
