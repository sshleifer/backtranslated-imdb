Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underestimated comedies in the past, such as "Greedy" and "Clue". It's not one of them. Similar to the "Police Academy" movie as his inspiration, it marks Steve Martin in the role of old Phil Silver as a military sergeant forever, deceiving his superior nose. But Bilko's idyllic life and his lazy team are shameful when an old enemy visits Bilko's designated fishing base. Nothing much happens. It's all pretty boring. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple to laugh through their endeavor, but they are all better off and it is quite painful to watch them working with such thin material.
