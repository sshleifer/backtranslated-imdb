Sholay: considered one of the biggest films. I've always wondered if they would ever be classic because it's classic. It was a time when RGV proclaimed this movie and I was somewhat excited to see it. I always thought it might be a good movie, but every week we would change something on RGV. And the movie is a very B-class movie, something I didn't expect. <br /> <br /> I really tried to look for positive ones, but I let Sholay out of my mind. Cinematography is fantastic. The film is trying to be your own. But it's up. The sequences are weak. The scenario had potential. The biggest mistake is editing. No scenes excite you. For example, comedy sequences felt very inappropriate and forced. Chronic because comedy was the same fun in the original. And no characters have been developed. And no scene is left to the end. And the end was very disappointing. <br /> <br /> The biggest question is. Amitabh Bachchan was good as Gabbar Singh, something big. They seem to focus too much on their appearance, that the character just looks threatening, but you won't let out. Mohanlal is hardly in the movie, but he impresses on his few scenes. Ajay Devgan was decent. It wasn't so much a show, he gave it all, it was a weak script. Prashant Raj is very confident and has the potential to do it with better movies. <br /> <br /> I had the most expectations for Sushmita Sen, who was probably the best in the lot. He was expressive, but it was not enough. Nisha Kothari surprised me. He seemed mostly interested, but his emotional scene after his friend's death was pretty good. He seems to have to find a director who helps talent, not his cute look. But what cheated me the most was chemistry. Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj didn't look like friends. Ajay-Nisha wasn't a strong couple. No passion was found between Sushmita and Prashant. And Amitabh and Mohanlal did not lead them to hate them. <br /> <br /> For songs, they absorb a lot. Urmila Mehbooba was too crowded and I slept through it. It was nice, however. Holi's number was enjoyable, but not memorable. The same went for other songs. Someone waiting for this movie was very disappointed. I had great hopes for RGV because of my Jungle, but it seems that she would have lost her talent while shooting this movie. But hopefully he will restore his talent to Sarkar Raj. But this film is best forgotten. Not all positive ones still reflect a boring movie.
