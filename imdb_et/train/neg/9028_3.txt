I just watched this movie and I have to say that with this great assumption and great talents this turkey is just there! My friend lent me this film and I looked at it openly mainly because he had such a great praise for this story. Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot who retired ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He had probably got Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot ... well, we never see Costner closer to the rest of the movie plane! <br /> <br /> Costner gets into Texan (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a large Mexican businessman and Costner label. Without knowing what happened, Gammon almost kills and Costner leads him to a meeting with Quinn. But there's nothing ... nada, zilcho! Why did they have the character of Gammon? Why were they selling Quinn horses if nothing came from it? <br /> <br /> Even after they leave Costner to death, they become Madonna Stowe's character whore, then she attacks one of Quinn's men who turned in turns ... and the next thing she moved to the monster! There is no explanation as to why he moved or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent wastes both a weak script and bad editing !! I just looked at it because my friend had it and let me look at it ... I'll throw it at him for two hours, which I wasted in my life, looking at the broken thing!
