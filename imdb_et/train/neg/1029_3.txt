My father is a fan of Columbo and I always liked the indication. I always show my contempt for the show and tell her how bad it is. However, he is watching it. It's his right as America. But my senses were tuned to the series when I found out that Spielberg had been leading the main episode. Then I was grateful that my father had bought this exhibition that I really can't. I went to my DVD collection and jumped this thing when I came home for a visit. My opinion on the series as a whole was unsuccessful, but I got respect for Spielberg knowing that he started as most of the lower level directors. And it makes a little drift until the big fish come (get red, HA, HA. As Spielberg did. It's like Jesus before he became a man. Or at least what I think it would be.) Columbo fan if this is most likely to be liked, even though it contains little Peter Falki. I attribute it to the fact that it is the beginning of the series and nobody knew where to go with it. The culprit of the crimes instead of Columbo's investigation, as many later episodes would do.
