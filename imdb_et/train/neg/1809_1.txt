Nothing I hate more than a self-expressing claim. Kevin Smith deserves to hang his toenails to inspire each white middle class to stack up to make a film about why they can't be put. I don't really know about inexperience and low-budget productions, but if it's obvious and appealing, it really burns my potatoes. The money placed in it could have gone to a real combat filmmaker who actually has the opportunity, like John Gulager. When you look at the Greenlight project, you will immediately recognize a talented seer who fights against the system. Everyone can grab the camera and talk about a story that can't say anything. When will we save the world from Smithonites and Whedonets? The revolution cannot come fast enough. Go for a real first time effort by purchasing Desperado or looking for friends. Thank you and good day.
