This movie is actually worse than most movies I've ever suffered, and I've suffered a lot. Absolute Nonsense. It's a terrible, forced dialogue; pointless plot development; really drawn out "scary" scenes that look more like a high school art project than a horror movie; 5/10 most attractive women; long, boring sexual scenes involving women (forget what you know about virgins! somewhat confusing, difficult to understand from some character; but it is not. Veden Fell is the worst bad guy in film history. <br /> <br /> Absolutely skip it.
