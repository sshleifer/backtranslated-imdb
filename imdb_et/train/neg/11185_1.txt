Yes, MTV is really an opportunity to market Daria. What started as a smart teenage angst - "comment on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better for his happy teenage life," became a sitcom now "how you should deal with your problems" - the flock. I looked at Daria all the time and loved it. Now, sitting here watching the "movie", I can only wonder what it was all about. Daria tells us how to live in college? Excuse me? Isn't Daria doing every episode you want to do, okay, if it's with you, no matter what the rest of the sick world thinks of? This whole thing reminded me of the "Reality Bites" scene, which shows the documentation for the first time.
