I could no longer agree with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowski. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be totally boring and forced to be "meaningful". She can produce eye-candy (and I like candy), but her pretense and basic artistic emptiness simply reduces all the joy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid many people do not distinguish similar (but actually only on the surface) Jodorowsky or even more linear filmmakers such as Tarkovsky or Kubrick (I love the 2001 Odyssey and have never been bored by the Finished Scenes). .) Art such as Barney does add confusion and displaces viewers who might otherwise appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And check her interviews. I'm just not buying it, sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I've never been bored with Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies, but drawing 9 was a complete disappointment. Especially at the same time as it offered something to actually say something in a nonlinear unusual way (such as the beginning and the great choreographic dance and preparation for sailing. The "meeting" of ships at sea ... The ideas of the value of faeces as an object of value (if it was faeces). "pearl" divers ... Anyone could build a somewhat large, surrealistic movie with a certain content ... How vain and fake and philosophically pretentious, but empty? <br /> <br /> I have some great scenic scenes, but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and completely empty and fake that it made me physically ill. <br /> <br /> It does not have a good pace. I like slow film but it was boring in some scenes - because it was horrible and fake - so I was just forced to have long-lasting scenes of artistic eternity ... <br /> <br /> Such movies are killing art and spy t, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
