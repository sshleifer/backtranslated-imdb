Dear dear dear dear ... me! I had the strength to see it ... But why?! The first two movies with fun and actually a little good. But it's so bad that we had trouble seeing the whole thing. It was some shaking for the kids. I can't believe that the movie was made at all. It's like the props taken from some bad western series (for kids) and they did just what they did with it. <br /> <br /> What audience is this movie? I mean just 12-14 years old. If you are over 14, you have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow but it's so boring. The characters are superfluous (not just a little bit) and so stereotypical are some fun for a while ... but not long enough that you don't want to throw tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that happens, yes ... you have seen this BILLION times before every hero series on TV for kids. I picked all the survivors and all tremor feeds that the other character got. It's so bad .. so wrong ... well ... crap. <br /> <br /> But OK, we smiled now and then. Not only at the holes of the foolish plot, but in some scenes where it is worth taking or two ... or one scene where two baby shakes fly into one of the obvious tremor feeders. It's really a great scene that made us repeat it again and laugh and laugh at the heart. Still making me think about it. But this happened only once more unfortunately ... and that is when the "badass" gunman appears and crosses his part wonderfully ... this and one comment "They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point we have to almost cry with a laugh. But after that, there was nothing like that ... (?) .. so it's pretty much downhill. <br /> <br /> So the tops here are demonic trout and exaggeration. If somebody tells you it's a good movie ... he's either a "plant", a vegetable, or someone very bad. This movie must be the worst tremor. I look forward to seeing Tremors 3, but that's definitely what's involved ... it's ... * goosebumps * no. I'll leave it on.
