Two years ago, at the Berlin Film Festival Panorama, we watched the movie "Sue" by Amos Kollek, whose leading part was the great Anna Thomson. This is a film about loneliness and sex and how the other thing is compensated. At the same section of the festival, we now have to sue Sue, "Extension du domaine de la lutte" as an overwhelming contradiction that is now trying to convince us that loneliness and not sex are the same problem. But, unfortunately, we do not make sense to our "hero" (how he is called a storyteller) because he is tired and incomprehensible from the company and himself. My mistake, I'm sorry. I can't understand him. It is not enough that the writer / director / actor wants us to acknowledge that it is not his destroyed self-consciousness or the inactivity of his personality that has brought him so far, but the rotting society and its sexuality. Yes, there are some deeper insights into gender relations, but we still don't follow him ... And the idea is that there is some sign of reflection on his part of the fate that has no gender. Who hadn't noticed yet, this is a rather depressing film ... <br /> <br /> At first, the situation had begun to draw more accurately. The "hero" talks about the obstacles to buying a new bed. Maybe it's getting up the stairs too wide, you have to stay home for half a day ... It's a satire character who doesn't know life and heart, does something ... No movie`s follow this path, but deals with his characters helpless . Nobody believes that our "hero" can incite Tisserand for murder. Too boring, too kind, too passive (not to mention Tisserand's complexity; he has inhibition, but he couldn't naturally be a murderer of women!). Finally, there are women and the world, it is not a device of modern sexual society. Help you, if you can, but do not follow the messages and "wisdom" of this film that announces bankruptcy in human relationships without real conflicts.
