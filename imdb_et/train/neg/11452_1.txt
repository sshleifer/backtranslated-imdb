If I had to rate this movie 0, I would have been! I see some ppl in IMDb saying it's a more fun movie, and so on. do you hit an LSD or ........ There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie N O T H I N G! I really want my 27 minutes back from my life so I spent that mess. I read someone sitting on an airplane looking at this movie in 30 minutes, I fully understand that I would actually have watched the snakes with a 2-fold plane instead of watching this movie once! <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie, do anything else that is useful in your life, make dishes, walk the dog, hell ... something better than spending time on TV.
