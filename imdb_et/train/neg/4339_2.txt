this movie wasn't exactly what I expected. <br /> <br /> When this movie was named something else, no one even notices the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> Its very strange because I don't see this point. Prequel and Sequence allow you to simply say that it makes no sense, even doesn't fit. maybe i'm naive but not vol 1 & vol 2 intended to fit. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in the first jail and dies in the original and prequelis lives and doesn't go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was OK, but they should have changed some of the participants and some story and movie name and it would have been a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end like another. <br /> <br /> If anyone has an opinion on this post, please.
