... and that's the movie. I imagine that, if there is a negative consequence, the devil's souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie with a constant eye for all eternity. Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, the Fate of Fate" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a tough B movie, bad movie art is the best (or is it the worst?) The thing I really disliked about this movie is the moral duo they threw for comedy relief . Now, the comedy relief is good, but most of the film focuses on the adventures of these two mores, not the "heroes" of the movie, which actually have less time than them! To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and working poorly. But to be honest, it was probably a bad film at first, so Crown couldn't really hurt that much. <br /> <br /> It really has to be at the bottom of the 100's. I wouldn't want this to be my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> It's actually a B-type campaign for me. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my one star.
