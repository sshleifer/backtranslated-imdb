I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a small child. I started early in the morning, I started watching HBO and The Raft (segment 2) terrorized me well. This time I still enjoyed The Raft, although I couldn't say whether it was for a nostalgic reason or was it really a good short. The other two segments were a full trash. I can't believe that some manufacturer paid for this junk. All I did was destroy one more childhood memory. Creepshow 2 now joins Radi in my list of corrupt childhood classics. 4/10
