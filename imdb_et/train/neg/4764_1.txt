86 minutes of my life wasted. I fell asleep when I tried it for the first time, and I have to say that I never sleep in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a nonsense plot in such a tendency and compulsion, and I can only assume that the actors were so harsh when the protagonist was supposed to be filming himself. <br /> <br /> All this terrible adaptation is superfluous. And if it's not wood-working, just as you would see a television set, it is enough for yourself, being up and running in totally unnecessary ways and overwhelmed to the utmost extent, to put the entire farce out. a person who does not see this - and the rest of this ridiculous plot - a telegraph illuminated year in advance, check their eyesight <br /> <br /> Poor performance and two very decent players, with the hypercoded Branagh brand oversupply, are enough to make rather, the actual bullets, not to empty themselves. In addition, this homoerotica is a completely valid base that is elevated at the end. All I hope is that it was such a flop that people are not trying to mimic this cinema level again.
