This is a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do this much better (acting, writing and directing) 2) It's so bad that I have to comment and warn others ... <br /> <br /> It seems to have been done with my flip video. I also believe my friend who said I was looking at it. I've noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; Team members or people who have something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. hopefully, writers and directors will leave. not even talented enough to make advertising !!!!!
