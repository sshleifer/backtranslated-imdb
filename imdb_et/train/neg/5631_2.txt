The photography on the DVD is so dark that I thought the screen was dead. I think I didn't see half of the movie. However, it was poorly prepared and interesting. I didn't find the story titled "Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or thriller but did not participate enough to take care of the first few frames. I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and I was sad he gave his talent. I don't think Giada Colagrande has learned to film for long enough to develop a big movie. She is attractive and can become an actor, but she took too many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they have no chemistry on the screen. Their relationship didn't seem credible. I do not understand why other characters were even introduced to the plot.
