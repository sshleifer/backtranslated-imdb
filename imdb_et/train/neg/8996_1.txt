At the 1985 hearing, the Howard Hesseman-led government commission is organizing a first uncensored network on TV. They try programming that plays a series of skits. On the one hand, I can name good skit movies instead of using a thumb. "Amazon Women Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "Meaning of Life" and "Mr. Mike Mondo Video". Notice how I didn't mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for this is that this "film" is the death of cinema. No skits are far from funny or even the least wise. For filmmakers, there is a need for a greater non-existence that will not even laugh at me. <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn goes full front
