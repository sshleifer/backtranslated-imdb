This is one of the worst movies I've seen so far, the best part was Christian J. Meoli's "Leonard" who tried to jump up and down outside the bar as I wanted to do on the DVD. the rest of mankind is tormented by watching this movie. It's great cast, so you look at it waiting to get good, I mean Sean Astin "Andrew" (played his part perfectly, did a great job, was too bad this movie), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad ", Ren√©e Zellweger" Poet "(they put their name on a cover with a total of 1 row and less than 4 seconds in the whole movie ... <br /> <br /> If any dignity was cast, they would go out and buy everything copies of this movie and burns them with Writer / Director George Hickenlooper and Writer John Enbom
