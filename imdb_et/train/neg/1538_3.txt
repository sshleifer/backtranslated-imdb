What a shame that a truly competent director like Andre de Toth, who specializes in slippery, shifting alliances, didn't get this concept first. He could have helped to prove the real potential, especially William Bishop's interesting character. As the film is standing, it is a big mess (as confirmed by Chipe Chief). The main problems are direction, cheap budget and bad script. Strength consists of a superbly painful and interesting general concept - characters drawn by contradictory forces into different directions. It was necessary that someone with a vision pulled the positive elements together, transforming the script into some kind of a single whole, rather than the scattering, uncomfortable confusion it has (try to find out the motivations and synergies if you can). A larger budget could have matched the contrasting location and studio frames and got locations out of all the obvious places near the LA. The real shame lies in the waste of excellent cast waste - Hayden, Taylor (before tooth finishing), Dehner, Reeves, James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their premature death. Few movies illustrate the importance of an auteur vision more than this little hidden western, which could have been so much in the right hand.
