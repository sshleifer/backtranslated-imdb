If you've ever seen this movie, you would know it! If you haven't done that and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie because it's in the worst order. So, if you're really bored, go for rent. If you want to know what it is, here is my little summary: Adam Sandler has been hired to work with a giant cruise ship with some Ms. Universe models and five other people. Adam doesn't like how one traveler gets all the babies, and he tries to take over with jokes. AGA WAIT! It only gets worse! You have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
