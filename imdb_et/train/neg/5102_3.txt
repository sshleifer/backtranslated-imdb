Nicole Eggert was called the star, although Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach are much larger stars than her. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays a girl who regrets that an alien is driving by the army and takes her sexy disguise to a robbed creature. A bit of nudity and partial nudity, meaningless sex scene, characterize the way. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles through some obvious kits and plays jokes about playing photos. I liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and really got a cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It was quite obvious that Stacey Keach was able to take over and the film had a rather weak end, it would have been nice to show exactly what foreign alien passed on to Eggert.
