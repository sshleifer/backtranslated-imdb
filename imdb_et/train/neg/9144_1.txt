This movie is just really terrible, the Ben-game that plays Beni can just make up for anything else that's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Writer / director / producer / leader actor, etc. It was probably a good idea to create a film that deals with gay marriage, family adoption, religion, homophobia, hate crimes, and almost all other issues affecting gay men of their time, but tries every problem with such a badly designed film is drawn to little justice for some of these reasons. <br /> <br /> The script is poor, casting is very common, but dialogue and action are just awful. Homo-hate brother plays the most camp participant and there are absolutely no chemistry between the two leading players (I think I've seen more passion in corn flakes advertising). Acting is rigid and dialogue forced (a scene where a brother feeds a detective on his lines). <br /> <br /> I am pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed for any other garbage, and when he thinks about it, I have some tips - NO YOU.
