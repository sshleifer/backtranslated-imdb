"Magnolia" is an unpleasant, amazing play that adds very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a purposeful series of episodes that do not cause concern for coherence. The camera moves through the corridors and corridors, trying to look at the sad signs. Where is the reason for taking care of these people? The common theme seems to be people who scream a lot who can't take care of others (except John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour's Hoffman characters) and are self-destructive jerks that fall into pieces or die. I was reminded of how much I did not like "Shine" because Armin Mueller-Stahl played his father's irresistible monster. Here are so many unpleasant, unpleasant symbols, why would we like to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> Having said, "Magnolia" hasn't been detained. Paul Thomas Anderson's idea is sprayed on his canvas. Especially this bomb has two ideas. Both take place in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. The camera is moving from one label to another while everyone is singing folk songs from Aimee Mann. Sweet, but ineffective, because we don't see what they all put together. The second idea I refer to has not emerged to say that it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Magnolia has a lot to do. Especially Tom Cruise, who fires the show that I didn't know he had. And John C. Reilly might play the most decent and truly good cop in his recent memory. But it all gives something. When a secret unexpected event happened, the girl behind me in the theater couldn't hold on and said, "It's stupid!" My feeling is that most movers agree.
