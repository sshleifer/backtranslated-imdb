Couldn't believe it! Truncated sentences? Good sadness! You know what? Everything is true! Real people speak like that? Don't think. Good girl! Stout man! Stronger upper lip! The only reason why Gary Cooper is instead of movie 2 is this dish. The film as a whole is ridiculous if you do not like watching endless biplane tours. Anyway, it seemed endless. Think of all the Franchot Tone dialogues. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to get the British, they come in Irish. Handy tip - Brits clip words, not sentences. And somehow we manage to empty at the same time. But this is only when we have been to a really good public school.
