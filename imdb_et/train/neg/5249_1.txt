I'm 13 and I hated this movie on her worst movie on earth when I completely wasted my time watching it and I was disappointed because it caused a film on the back and on the back that looks pretty good, but I was wrong with halban. but when I saw the delta, she was a completely different and bad actor and I really didn't know if the old 2 girls were trying to be so confused. the movie was in some parts confusing and i didn't enjoy it at all, but i watched all the movies to see if it was getting better, but it wasn't, it was boring, boring and i told BORING.and i don't think many other people I liked it, as well as boring boring boring me
