Ladies and gentlemen, please don't be fooled by Stanley Kubrick. This is a very bad film that has unfortunately been one of the most frightening films ever made. people should tremble their hearts with a real horror movie. There is no real horror in Shining, but instead of what we find it is just a naive, silly attempt to create a cool horror. Everyone knows how good trials are when they differ from reality. Everything that is good in the film is a view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were shown also looks good. The word actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul who is never sure what he should do. A colorful actor who is mostly busy with a child's actor. There is no need to blame the tragedy for bad weather. It cannot be avoided because the film is made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make changes.
