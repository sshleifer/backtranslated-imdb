The Christmas decoration was talked about as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold the VHS and DVD copies of the movie when it was over, which makes me think the manufacturers were very proud of the project. I myself felt like an actor on the screen that most of the shows were played, even though Beau Bridges, like Nick, had moments or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I wouldn't put this movie on to continue my fine. It was embarrassing. I was a fan of my Waltons days, but I have found that I do not want to look at my later work, so poor was this offer. <br /> <br /> In defending the participants, the board was masculine, I hope it is not considered a critical review and negative assumptions regarding my qualification for the critic. I turned the movie on because it was a good cast and I was ready to enjoy the movie. But I would challenge someone who would look at this movie and wouldn't want their money back, although it was T.V.
