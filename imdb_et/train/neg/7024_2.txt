I borrowed this movie because I was interested in not only the idea of ​​this homosexual theme but also the role play. I was pleasantly surprised that it was in San Francisco because I lived near SF. And of course, it was nice to see the pictures in Castro district (although my castration is really more gay male than female). But besides, I can't really recommend this movie. The characters are not carefully developed for me, and when they finally started to play the role play, I missed my mind already. And the role play scenes I saw were a little embarrassing to look at. Functional leaves something to be desired. Needless to say, I didn't finish the movie. I'd miss it.
