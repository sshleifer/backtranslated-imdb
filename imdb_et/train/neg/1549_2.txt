Although Leon is cute with SNL, he's only one minute. Like most SNL movies, it can't fill 90 minutes. It has some lovely moments (the ones you've seen in the trailer), but the participants are largely wasted. Tim Meadows does his best, but there are not many high points on the plot. Does Farrell have a little part. Farrell can be the funniest man in life ... but not in this movie. What a shame.
