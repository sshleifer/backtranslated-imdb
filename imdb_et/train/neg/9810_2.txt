It's hard to criticize this movie because I don't like the story itself and no good actor would have recorded it. Think of "raising Arizona" as average. The actor is satisfactory, but Jennifer Tilly is overall (but not enough to make it a nice camp film) as usual, somewhere between Misery and a sarcastic DMV employee. For the rest, their eyes are constantly woven, whether they are stressed by their parts or the stress of all the useless use. A real humiliating few hours movie. Darryl Hannah spends most of the film that is too hard to understand. I would like to say how it ended, but I went out, sorry.
