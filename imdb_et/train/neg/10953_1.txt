This garbage apology to television is the only adorable-terrible trash that has hit Australian television. Home partners are boring, uninteresting, ridiculously unpleasant, and chosen so that you are likely to try to kill them if you live with them. As far as I am concerned, the great brother of Brazil is the fall of western society, showing how we as a society are on steep slopes to become the brain's dead moor. What happened to television, which was not the lowest common denominator of society? It cannot be classified as entertainment. I think it is true that the Tenth Channel can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who was once a venerable comedian and when he moved to channel 10, it becomes terribly inaccurate. Except for the Simpsons, which is very intelligent.
