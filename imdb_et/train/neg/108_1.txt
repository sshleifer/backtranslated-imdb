Pros: Nothing <br /> <br /> Cons <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: A female reporter travels to an attacker who talks about the deaths of people killed in zombies. > <br /> Review: I've never come across such a bad zombie chronicle in my life. With a filmed budget that seems to be about 20 bucks, the TZC is a totally horrible horror film based on flat, unforgettable actors who couldn't save their lives and whores, which is more frightening. How does such a movie work? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents: the humorous filmmaker Brain Damage Films. They have really had to damage the brains to hit such a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (if it were for me, this movie would send a negative rating) bajillion)
