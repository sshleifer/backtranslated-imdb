It is unfortunate that you can't go under one letter. Before I watched the Wicker Man, I had read aliens 3 as the only film that really deserves negative stars. Frankly, The Wicker Man does not diminish the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact that my cumulative movie enjoyment is reduced when viewed. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick often used in Hollywood, when manufacturers are too passionate to hire good writers or hurry too much to bring the plot to a satisfactory conclusion: a blow at a shocking end and hope that the public is wrong with something artistic or meaningful. This is a gambling game that rarely succeeds and in this case, only a fine actor can be tortured and ridiculed by manufacturers. What's more, the conclusion of a "carefully crafted" (though they did) does not seem logically to follow the plot (which of course cannot be developed without using a spoiler) and instead denies the value of the plot. up to that point. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that can logically turn to the fans of psychopaths, pedophiles, and probably deadly Nicholas Cage, but only to some of the main audiences. If you really want something like this, I would recommend my heart to the village of M. Night Shyamalan. No memory erasing pill, I think I need to look something better to force it in my mind, say, Killer Tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?
