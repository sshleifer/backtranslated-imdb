The book on which this film is based changed my life seriously. But saying that this film was a disappointment, it is an understatement. Action, leadership, cinematography, and storyline were all terrible. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I've talked to countless people about this book, but now I am telling them all that they will not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they have left out too many basic components of the book. The film tried, but failed, to give a powerful and inspiring message and only lowered the central theme of the prophecy. If I put myself in a position that hadn't read the book, I saw Celestine Prophecy as a hoax B.S. I'm deeply disappointed with Redfield how this movie showed up.
