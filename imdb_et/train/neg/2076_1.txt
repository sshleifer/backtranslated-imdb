I have to say that this is probably the worst film I saw this year! The jokes were extremely rough (didn't expect it to be a PG movie) (Rated PG in Canada) and they weren't funny! With this great pain, I was expecting at least some good deeds, but I didn't even get it. I'm a huge fan of Rainn Wilson and it was the first time I was very disappointed with his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn nor Uma Thurman's characters are the least pleasing and I could have taken less care of what happened to one of them. I didn't expect it at all because in the past I really liked other films by this director (for example, six days, seven nights). This movie is not worth $ 10, which cost me and I suggest you not see this movie. I guarantee you are like me who would pray for this movie.
