Boy oh boy oh golly gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was the fun of bluescreen effects used to create the mother's "invisibility". They looked like they were cheap videos, and it seems like a totally unrealistic and not a good way to make it so funny that you finally love the movie ... <br /> <br /> I didn't end up loving this movie. "Stability" tests were also very pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a small budget gift, that's good. However, you can make a great movie with a small budget. But BAD movie and low budget and impact. This makes a bad combination. In this case, such a dead combo created a craptical film "Invisible Mom". If you have children and your children have no taste, they can stay awake all over.
