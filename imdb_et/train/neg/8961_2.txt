This movie was still a waste of time ... Why oh, why am I renting such a mess? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh. back to the movie: Cube Zero is probably worth it when you really enjoyed the first movie (as I did), and I just want to watch what's in the last (hopefully) filmed to keep the poor actors and scriptwriters, but of course it's a movie for you . But if you are looking for a good movie with a good actor and a fantastic plot ... * to smile * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK I lie ... Best of all, this film sucks. Okay, I have to admit that certain elements were cool ... well ... cool ... and I laughed quite a few times, flawed wrong things, but still I was amused. :-) But of the few things that barely "ok" do not do, it is not enough to value this movie at all. If you don't read "Manos - the fate of hand" as one of the top ten EVER movies!
