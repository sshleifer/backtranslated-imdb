My wife and I rented this movie because some people had made a parallel between this and the "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even had a "recommended" option if you liked Office Space. <br /> <br /> Now I have probably seen the office space 15 or 20 times. I love it. This is probably one of my 10 favorite films. Funny, humorous, and characterizing characters that remind me of the people I've worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" because they are both movies. There ends the similarity. We were probably sitting for the first 50 minutes of HT, giving him some doubts, hoping he didn't, * praying * to get it better. It wasn't. We couldn't take it anymore and stop it. Thanks to God it was a free rental. I would have been p *** ed if we actually paid for it. We should compensate for having to sit through it. Now, because we didn't see the end, maybe it would marvel at how it collects and redeems itself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The Haiku Tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe it's ever produced. This movie is so weird that it is painful. Just write your friggin letters! The presumption is asinine. Jokes are terrible. We got as far as the "printer did not work" and had to stop. We couldn't take it anymore. This movie is EMHARRACY for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Office Space ...... don't waste your time with it. 0/10
