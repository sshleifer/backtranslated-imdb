My friend's mother used to work in a video store and got previews of movies before she appeared, so when she brought her home, horror movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Given that it should be scary, but it is really fun, I can say that I like this movie in a very strange way. yes, the action is bad and yes, this is the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so fucking funny! "WHAT TO GO TO CA-RACK!!" I did not know that the film was even ever released ... I thought it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... in general, the movie is pretty bad (you have to admit it a lot at least) ), but I promise you can laugh at it. <br /> <br /> * This movie sucks, but it's good to laugh ... especially the guy with "despair" .. DESPAAAAAAIR!
