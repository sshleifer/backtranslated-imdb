I can't believe this film was made as recently as 1984. It has some ridiculous acts, not to mention one of the stupas. Who ever asks Texas fat sheriff Joe Don Baker from Italy who arrested him illegally in Mexico? Not to mention the fact that the title of the movie does not talk much about it - in fact it is such a general title to name a wannabe action / policeman movie as I think. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see it only in MST3K with Mike and robots. They note that the female driver is similar to Seinfeld Elaine ("None of them is spongeworthy") and the reef non-stop Baker weight. This movie is probably not worse than Mitchell, but Baker's reputation is definitely the one here: when his title appears at the beginning of the movie, Tom says, "I wish I was illiterate so I shouldn't read it."
