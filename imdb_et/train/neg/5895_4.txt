Is Miike similar to Chabrol, with alternating art and dreck, sometimes mixing the two? Does he meet the fifty-fifty rate for Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike here? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I can just fill in ten lines, simply quoting the stacks, clues and clich√©s of Chakushin ari (one missed call). Others here will hit most of them, though not the Ochiai family (hypnosis) that causes supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi takes a zombie-like mother, did I make a little missed call. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi Audition's Abusive Society and Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki, a drowning volcano, can be the most convincing actor of the evil character I've ever seen. So here he is a cop.
