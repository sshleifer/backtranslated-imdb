I liked it, I really did. Please don't think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. I was expecting it to be crap, it was crap, but sometimes it was OK to relax and watch the ugly movie you didn't have to focus too much on, didn't you? I did not expect any hidden meanings or morals, and there was no one, but it doesn't matter because I looked at it for entertainment and it amused me. Such films are the reason why Ben Stillers (apologizing for something "Mary") and Vince Vaughns (but you don't write your surname, I couldn't control) are not jobs. It's OK to watch a crap movie as long as you don't expect it, and I stand for one, strikes, maybe run, but not drive because I don't have a car to Blockbuster Video, or even choices and rent a bunch of these lounges are pampered movies and stay one night watching them. Good day for you reader. P., if you do not say that this comment helped you, then I do not like you when you say it helped God bless you, then you go to heaven.
