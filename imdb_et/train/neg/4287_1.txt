I gave Timecop a perfect 10, gave it 1 <br /> <br /> This story is very boring and the original Timecop is just a little bit. Many things from Timecop were demolished, and instead they placed new stupid things. This story will happen in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason timetraveling is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> And the scenes of action are not happy, most of them are not ... only the first is great. .. and there are not many scenes at all, and they are all pretty short <br /> <br /> The story in one point, the main character goes through about 5 times in a few minutes ... don't wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short, don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
