Usually I don't have a bad movie, but it was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I was actually sitting on the whole thing almost praying because it would have one minute of good movie time to justify one and a half hours that was wasted. Needless to say, I was cruelly disappointed. At the seaside, where the college friends group celebrates holidays, this film suffers from many problems, so it's not worth it. First, there are holes in the plot. Secondly, very few of the C list (I did not even dare call them B) can act for the devil, so all scenes with potential failure are unhappy. Thirdly, the speed of the film is very uncomfortable and uncomfortable to watch most of the time, making the temporary building very complicated, with very little surprise for the audience. Fourthly and most importantly, the end is partly anti-climate because it ends (setting / killing) and partly because dialogue is simply cruel. For film credits, this is the only movie I ever say is the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Just like a bad joke that you would have been happier than you ever heard, the next time someone asks if you want to know the secret, you won't be screaming, you won't really do it, if you run in the opposite direction.
