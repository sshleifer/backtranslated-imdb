There are some elements that record this movie as a complete disaster, but overshadowed by bad actions, plot holes, deus ex machina thrown, foolish dialogues, weak script and predictable clichés ... <br /> <br /> What we have here is is a horror movie that has a story that won't go most of the time. It seems that the group of unlikely heroes, including the black boy who gets it first (so that the cliché still seems to be alive in Finland), seems to have problems with mysteriously leaving an empty hospital. There are despicable ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought that at least they didn't use zombies, but they came), and the Finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on their way. There is also some time-shifting doodle, but it doesn't give a root. The autistic girl and hobo seem somewhat deeper, but they never write to the viewer or their confused friends. Their rows consist only of deep lessons, such as: "What happens ..." or "Light cannot live in darkness ..." or ominous "I need a red pastel ... a red pastel." So all these characters (including the worrying father and the kind of dear doctor) end up running around their dark floors and mistakenly demons. Sometimes a spirit or group of zombies appears, and if the demon keyboard seems to be unable to meet a group of six people who come towards it by sliding a flashlight and talking, it was just pretending. And apparently this daemon can go through the walls without much hassle, but opening the door to the lifts is beyond its capabilities. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can even "this was all a dream" sequence. Or maybe it wasn't. Oh, boy, I want this movie to be, and the one that makes time seems to be moving faster so it's all playing in just 10 minutes or so ...
