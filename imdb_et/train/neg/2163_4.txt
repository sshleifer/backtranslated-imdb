Shame really - very rarely look at the movie and I'm finally disappointed. I have seen quite a few of Ira Levin's adjustments - "Rosemary's Baby" and "Stepford's Wives" - and they both liked it, but I just didn't like it. <br /> <br /> When I read the plot review - the award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and sharpen his script to succeed - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet's good director and Ira Levin's work are generally good. <br /> <br /> I do not break it on anyone who has not seen it yet, but all say that there are LOADS of twists and turns. It is so difficult to explain in detail the drawing of this film without giving it away. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes before the turns and revolutions began to appear, and at that moment my interests and pleasures began to disappear. Although I have to give Lumet credit for a very amusing end that made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> The main productions - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all excellent in their roles. Although Worth's obvious counterfeit Russian accent got a little bit of my nerves (something from my personal Irene, I think every actor's fake accent is irritating to me). Not sure if Cannon's character had to be annoyingly funny, but Dyan managed to annoy and entertain - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading it - I don't want you to look at it because my views - give it a chance, you may like it. That's all the opinion.
