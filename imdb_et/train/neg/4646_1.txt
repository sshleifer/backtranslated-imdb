Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little bit of heavy metal, you saw jokes all over the place. If you know anything about porn, this cozy documentary will leave you cold. It's all wrong. <br /> <br /> The spinal cord touch was funny because it took the familiar world and pushed it up. This movie is probably not funny, because it paints a picture of how porn is done, which doesn't touch the real world. <br /> <br /> The action here is even terrible, but it wouldn't matter if the main idea was good. But that's not.
