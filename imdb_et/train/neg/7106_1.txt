I'm not a big fan of fear films and I've only seen a handful of them (and no "Halloween" or "Friday Thirteenth") - but I appreciate the scary horror film not because of gore. And I'm pretty sure it's not scary. <br /> <br /> What's so little sweet about a small plastic skull that appears everywhere? All the frequencies are far away, so there is no real surprise in this movie. (Not that the skull itself is scary, but ...) <br /> <br /> The plot touches Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries Donna reed. (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances) who will see the skull and listen to the mysterious shepherds from the group of couples in her husband's mansion. Did I mention that his wife lost her first woman's mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH !!!! Wonder who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> It's the same old plot where a rich boy tries to kill and / or drive his wife crazy. If you would like to see a well-made version, try "Fortune Reversal." And BTW, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> MSTing was okay, but nothing special; However, good viewing is associated with the "Gumby" short. <br /> <br /> Two Stars "The Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now, paraphrasing Mr Von Bulow himself, "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
