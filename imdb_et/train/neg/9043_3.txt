I went to see it with my wife and 3-year-old son. He seemed to him much more than my wife and myself. Writing is surprisingly bad for a pixel / Disney tour. In fact, it was very difficult for me to pay attention at all. The film does not look amazing, but the story becomes so strange and for a long time that I hoped my son was asleep so I could walk him up and down. <br /> <br /> Not to say that film is not an interesting concept, it's just that weird (bad scenario?), especially when we first meet "family". I know we should create the impression that the family is crazy, but a good master, they could have shortened this sequence in 15 minutes (it seems that I didn't actually do it). By that time I was looking for my head when I was looking for an exit.
