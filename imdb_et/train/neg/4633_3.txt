As is often the case, films from self-explanatory characters usually do not produce good drama. "Nancy Download" is no exception. It is based on the supposedly real story of a woman who has been murdered by her own request by someone she meets on the Internet. <br /> <br /> The winner is Nancy (Maria Bello), married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game that his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bars / restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has virtually no positive qualities (except for his ability to be successful in the business world). Throughout the film, Alberil has a gloomy and harsh expression on her face. He has no compassion for his wife, who has all the emotional problems, and attracts them to prostitutes. When her husband asks for sex, she punishes her by masturbating her presence. <br /> <br /> Nancy is the same character as the character. Not only has he loved 15 years of marriage, but his uncle has sexually abused when he grew up (luckily there is no feedback on this attack in the film). His self-confidence is a form of self-harm and result, he is forced into therapy. But he has so despised his therapist that no progress can be made. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed to contact Louis via the Internet. He is a kind of sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money, causing a huge amount of pain. This showed that Louis has two children but no longer sees them (the mother of the children no longer wants to do anything to her). <br /> <br /> Nancy's first plan is to have sex with Louis and then kill her. Particularly unpleasant scene, with Louis having sex with Nancy, sliding his waist with broken glass. These scenes are shown as setbacks after Louis visits Albert, who binds him and hits him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has twice a plan to see Albert: 1) turn him for Nancy treatment and 2) enjoy him beating. It will take some time before Louis appears first in Nancy's destiny, forcing Albert to make him a loved one's relative, so someone will take care of it in the future. Of course, Nancy's fate is that Louis finally killed him (but first showed hesitation when he explained that he had some feelings for him). Soon we will learn that Louis has been imprisoned for his life for Nancy's murder. <br /> <br /> What are we removing from a movie like Nancy? Should we suffer from the victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is this the main point of the movie? Is Nancy's sympathy justified? I do not belive. The film's writers create a stubble of Albert, who is cut off from emotions and is responsible for Nancy's fall. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I don't think so. They have a reluctant Louis, a man who makes a living, causing pain, coming over and turning Albert's Nancy out of ignorance. Moreover, the expression of his love for Nancy (before he kills) should show his "sensitive side". <br /> <br /> Finally, it is important that filmmakers have defined where their sympathies are the characters of the film. They are so curved to match their audiences with free violence scenes that Nancy's downloading becomes something other than performing poor taste and soft pornography.
