This movie is about what it looks like: Futuristic version of Cinderella legend, but songs and (quite tame) sex events! The film is not sure what he wants and pretty much gets confused. It's more expensive than most of the director's films, Al Adamson, but it's not on the same budget level that viewers have been waiting for sci-fi movies. The actors are pretty bad and, unlike most Adamson movies, there are no big names or B-participants. Some music is OK, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
