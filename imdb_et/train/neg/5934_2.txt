I do not consider myself the greatest fan of Leonard Cohen. However, he owns an important poet / musician in his literary / musical heritage. The most valuable element of this documentary is to hear Leonard's thoughts about his life and career. Warming and humility. <br /> <br /> Most of the musicians present at the concert do not speak of Leonard's musical / literary nuance. Exceptions were Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker & Beth Orton, although Leonard values ​​Rufus Wainrights' interpretation of his songs. <br /> <br /> In this documentary filmmaker, in particular, failed to see the viewers who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect with him. There is much talk about this, but the viewer is not drawn to Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly evident in interviews with Bono and Edge. They see Leonard as a special icon but can't translate Leonard Cohen's exact value. Cooperation with U2 is a farce. The whole live registration looks like a rushed job. And just like in the whole movie, only Leonard Cohen will play his part and can talk about his part. <br /> <br /> The entire assembly and scenario is similar to the high school outdoor project. Using effects such as echo, slow motion, or flash images is poorly positioned. Some camera work is bad. Some of the scores hardly resemble any connections I can expect. Sometimes the filmmaker seemed to add psychotic elements to the film. Maybe a reference to his repeated use of LSD. <br /> <br /> Some unintended humor ... at some point, Leonard tells us how he influenced the musical genre. Initially, he can't remember the genre name until he finally says it is punk, really punksters on his music. The next scene of the movie is the cover "I will not forget" ... <br /> "And I will not forget I will not forget, but I do not want to remember who"
