Maybe I missed an unanswered meeting when the meaning of "B-Movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good summary of this movie? Take aliens, replace xenomorphs with vampires, then remove all that was good and that's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes of movie, "V-SAN Team" (this is the darkest abbreviation) I've ever heard of the "base" that the vampires have killed massively, and then they climb down (DOWN?). What?) To a ladder that is apparently attached to a bench that has an obvious modern train in the background. When should this happen? 2210. Okay ... (Hold on, I'll go back to it) <br /> <br /> Yes. characters. Wow, there's also a symbolic lesbian Asian chick, red necklace wannabe, weatherproof captain, goth vampire / hot topic part time cashier and wussy noob second command. All of them are played by their respective actors in the absence of similar ambitions. It looked at me that Michick Ironside saw this flick. Does he get enough money when Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cellis? The only thing about Vampire Wars is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Looking at the birth of this movie, the only entertainment that I had in making bad events was entertainment. Since PCI computer cards are counted on the wall, is it ready to ship? The money needed to make this movie could have been much better used.
