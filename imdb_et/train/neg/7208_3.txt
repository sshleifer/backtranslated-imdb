I grew up looking at the old inspector's widget comic as a child. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can not solve any case and all work is done by walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard that the live action film was decent, so I checked it in the library. I rented this movie for free and I felt I should have paid for it. <br /> <br /> Broderick doesn't come anywhere near Don Adams, who was the voice of the gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penn didn't look like Penny. She is a brunette with a cartoon blonde with pigtails. But he does a decent job, given what he was supposed to do. Dabney Coleman gives a good result as Cheif Quimby. She'd never hid in an odd place or exploded with messages that had been unwanted by the gadget. <br /> <br /> The gadget mobile was wrong. It never spoke in the series and he did well. Why did they do that? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too smart in this movie. He had a complete idiot at the show. Here he had a half-hearted intellect. It would have worked better if it were embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Also a fully polished vocabulary. Borderick says "Wowser". This is and should always be "Wowsers". It sounds dark in 's'. I got confused when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> Only decent gags were on credits. Claw's lack of a support group for henchmen / sidekicks. In the audience, Mr. T, Richard Keil or Bondi film celebrities jaws, Herve Villacheze, similar to Oddjob, Kato and others. It's the only part I laughed at. <br /> <br /> The other one is at the end, where Penny controls the gadgets here and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams says the dog says "Brain is not present. Please leave your name to speak." Of course it is not a laugh loudly funny, but a nice piece of nostalgia to hear from Adams in the movie. He would have had to proclaim at least a foolish car. <br /> <br /> Kids love it, no one over the age of 13 can. <br /> <br />
