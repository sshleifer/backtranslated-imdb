It could have been a fascinating look at the life of one of America's most notorious killers, but unfortunately it is not even close. Terrible editing, direction, bad behavior, you call it. This film is literally a plot of about 10 minutes, reaching 100. The only quality of redemption is Bruce Davidson as a father, but it's not nearly enough to save that smell. One in 10.
