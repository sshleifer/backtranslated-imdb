What is the load on the left-hand Hollywood piles. This film is rebellious and bold when it is pacifist. The fairy tale ends with a pacifist character played by Danzel Washington. What are these Hollywood tools? Is it still a payback period for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> When I get cynical, it's because I'm tired of political agenda movies. The military brass of this film is depicted as, what else? Gung-ho soldiers. Sound familiar? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not bad? Think about it. What's more, Crimson Tide points out. Hackman's character, U-boat captain Ramsey, is like a dirty lunatic, until the end, of course, when he reaches his mind, gives up the complete 360, gives up his blood lust, refers to promotion to Ron Hunter, and improves his departure from service. The guy mutinies, takes the command of his boat, puts the United States in a serious risk of getting the first strike of a nuclear attack and you're advertising him ???? What a hogwash!
