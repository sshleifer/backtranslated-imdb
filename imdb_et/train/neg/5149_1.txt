This film talks about a victim of female rape / comic book from New York City, who decides to get away from this terrible big city and a slippery little town where she finds refuge from a lot of dirt with a large trailer in the mid-12th century and somewhere. The townspeople are mentally ill, but they have called crazy men in their trailer. It is irritating that he has the ability to do exactly the right things to put a dangerous situation in dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was the best high school. He's one of those cute young actresses with a sweet stack. Unfortunately, the career has not been kind and the mother's character has been right. To the previous commentator who said that the action was "so real", I agree well. In fact, it didn't work. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and able to make a mature, healthy decision. In short, this movie sucks like no other, rent it laugh. A real crime scene? Trailed wood panel trailer - enough to make me murder. And finally, she is an artist / writer so she couldn't afford a double trailer and nothing other than the sunny Chevy Chevette for God's love!
