You want to see Dead Gentlemen Productions' The Gamers. It's not the movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All of the good comments here seem to be written (badly hidden) by wrong third parties. The people who made this film seem to be trying to synthesize the fake interest. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well done. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are offensive. <br /> <br /> The film is so meaningful that I can't imagine someone being familiar with what's funny about it. It is important to smile to yourself, but if you are under the lamp in this way, you must hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive to the big satire of taboo subjects, but because of its constant patience.
