Violence is either real or not always affected. In this movie, violence is about the same as you might ask. In Great Ecstacy, the director has successfully demonstrated the extreme violence. But what was that? Violence looks like NoÃ« '' irreversible and 'Kubrick' watches orange, both of which are remarkable films. Don't do it wrong, I'm not against the general view of violence, and I've seen some disgust in my film years, but this film as a whole is completely minor. The story has never been developed enough to provide any reason for extreme violence, the thin cause of the rice paper that we have died for Robert is his introduction to the drug. Danny Dyer plays a character who is partly responsible for Robert's drug death, but he's on screen for less than 5 minutes. Lesley Manville is Robert, who can't cope with my mother, I'm not sure what one of these actors is doing in a low-caliber movie. Actors are wood, for example, a kitchen with a TV set and her husband is so painful to look at as much as the shocking finale who wrote these dialogues? Some of the comments the boys make ... "looks like he enjoys it" are so thin to tempt anyone to laugh if Clay's eager desire to bombard us with images of harassing female organs. Why do we have to show a detail that may be the director's obsession with a director's pornographic imagination ... can only marvel at the psychology of this young man. <br /> <br /> The "political meaning" of the film had repeatedly brought our attention to the number of scenes; In the bar, outside the TV cook house, the war in Iraq reports, I think it was probably too clear. Yes, war is violent, social determinism leads to disappointment, we are all inclined to terribly violent acts, whether you are in politics or on the street in popping. is the meaning of human violence. This question is that we have still not been able to grasp this film and certainly not. <br /> <br /> My opinion: derived, badly done, and meaningless.
