I don't know anything about Iliad that you can't comment on the accuracy of this story. But as an independent film, I found it very boring. The battle scenes were trying to be big and remarkable, but they were just obvious CGI. <br /> <br /> The actors are bad and no doubt Brad Pitt had only attracted the ladies. But he doesn't make a good warrior, too fearful. <br /> <br /> Good points are design. This film looks impressive with the landscape and castle buildings / walls. I like a movie that tries to accept at least characters, but this film seems to ignore it completely. we hear American, Scottish English, but what can you expect from a film about ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not recommend sitting on this family. It's too long and the young are getting bored. <br /> <br /> It is OK for adults if you don't care about the lack of reality.
