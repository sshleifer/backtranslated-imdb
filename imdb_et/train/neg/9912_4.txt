I totally agree with another reviewer here who was pleased that "birds" won the Oscar "Best Animated Short" in 2002, not the sick material that is at best pretentious and, of course, tempting to anyone who is not a heaven or hell of faith. <br /> <br /> Animation was good, but there are also many animated shorts. And by the way, I love dark humor, but it was unpleasant from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Here is a story: a boy who is walking around and surrounded by something other than gray (symbolism here). TV (appearing every few hundred meters) that he is in the sky, in hell, or in a cleaning station. Every time he puts his gun on his head and lets himself go after the news. I think it would be funny in three cases in two cases.
