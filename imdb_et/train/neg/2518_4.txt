Think of one of these kids as a darker version, like "Power Rangers" and you have this movie since 1990, "Robot Jox." A movie where you fight giant robots, two men enter the arena, and anyone who leaves their country wins. Robots are big and look like slightly better versions of the show, mainly because they are less colorful, so even though this movie is not good, it's not all bad to look at. Here I recall that in this robot two robots are fighting, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There's a twist on the plot, which is partly permeable because the betrayal appears, but in the end, the plot is not something that will stick with you at any time after the picture. The struggle itself looks like giant toys, but it's still a bit fun to watch. This film also produces a couple of other movies with similar plot devices, such as giant robots and a tournament. So it's worth checking once, but probably not more.
