This expelled piece combines so many ridiculous scenarios that it is finally a ridiculous government with absolute fun. Too bad when the assumption is promising (as is so often the case in Duhllywood), but it is la la landi in the hands of this scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in jail to serve DUI who killed her mistress. We see he has nightmares so we know he feels real in this respect. Then the neighbor of his cellular partner hangs himself. Or is he? Lowel has doubts, but falls quickly. His doubts are so weak that bad guys are not worried. So why are they being killed? That's where this story can be interesting. From there, it falls off the track, and once out of the rail it decides that the attention of the viewers for the next hour is offensive. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> <br /> I am not endless reading about this consistency, but consider this end. Lowe is involved in the bad guys on the train. They want a tape because they have their boss and them. So the train will come to 3 cops, weapons that are ready to save Lowe. The bad guys kill the police, half of the passengers and then ... continue to track down Lowe. WELCOME !!!! 3 The killing of the police in the public will take you to a deep doodle to hell with tape. But they go through the shopping center where the place is growing, as if the public wouldn't be there as witnesses, and finally seize Lowe and the bad guy still wants the tape !!!
