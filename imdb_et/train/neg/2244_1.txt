I have two points that I have to make clear right from the start. First we all know what this year's Oscar really was all this year. The Academy's way to show people is that they are not racist and have never been. They wanted to erase all premature ideas about themselves. Secondly, it makes no sense to comment on this exhibition because, really, what's the difference? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year I got the Oscar up with the kids! I'll never look at this example ever. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor", if they really winners should be for Ralph Fiennes "Sunshine". If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out and agree. "Eyes Wide Shut", when released, did not carry the candidates. And when you go this year, the bad choices were all over the place! Baz Lurhmann doesn't get the best director! Are you kidding me !! "Beautiful Mind" for "Best Make-up" ???? "Training Day" Will Become a Candidate? The film was terrible and it seemed that Washington wasn't even performing, but he proved he knew how to use the words of the four stars! That's what won the prize! Remove the tongue and bet he's almost playing himself! I liked Gosford Park, I really did, but why 7 candidates? And how on Earth they wouldn't get it in Altman! I mean, if you give people a prize to find out all the bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years and not Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscar, but I live with it if I don't have to look at another show yet! The high point of the show (and ONLY ONE) was when Woody Allen made his premiere for the prize game. It falls as one of the greatest moments in the history of the exhibition.
