My personal vision of hell is locked in the room without being able to close my eyes or block my ears and play this movie forever on any existing space in this space. The whole notion that Streisand is playing a boy / man will only make this film ridiculous. Whatever the most important thing about watching a movie is "stopping the incredible readiness". . . it is impossible to do this in this movie.
