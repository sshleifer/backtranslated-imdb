When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was sent to the United States, I was excited. Then I was in trouble to look at this thing. I adore Beaton's books on the wonderful Scottish constable. The characters in the book are fun and well written. The authorities responsible for this mish-mash probably have never read any Beaton books. Just called "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. In addition to the lack of acquaintances, I find that the whole exhibition is loud. It seems the actors feel they have to yell their lines and yell at each other. If you love M. C. Beaton's adorable Hamish Macbeth will not waste his time on this garbage.
