It's just one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It is not frightening or any of the other drawings. This film is agonizingly slow and I missed almost 98 minutes. Though the actor is at best mediocre, the biggest problem is a script that is poorly written, slow, and perfect, without any real focus. Sometimes a meaningless mood is only set for some uselessness or event. I'm not surprised that the whole thing was sick and shots were missing, they did everything to try and cut the terrible script. Like a big fan of big fears, I'm always upset about something bad. Save yourself for 98 minutes if you never get back.
