Confused confusion from start to finish. As they said before about the Beatles, there was a secret message when you played LP back. If someone were to suffer from the beginning of the movie scene to the end, you would like to lose the same disappointment. <br /> <br /> Apart from all this psychedelic hodge podge feedback and false start, clearer characters were movie supporters to retaliate when the movie was not sorted. Nothing like these two. Transfer, shouting and threats were given in the comic book. I think the one-dimensional was superfluous. <br /> <br /> Okay, so apparently the artistic types will open their eyes, because unlike them, we didn't get the plebels. Well, I'm afraid nothing could be done. And for every bad movie, two cardinal sins that began to end. An insignificant and pathetic story, if you want to call it, and worst, no sign you care about the least.
