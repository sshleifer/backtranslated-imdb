In this film, supporters of Chávez (either Venezuela and non-Venezuela) lie in a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict began with the announcement of Chávez, where he burned many of the best PDVSA staff for political matters. <br /> <br /> They didn't say more than 96 TV interruptions that were only transmitted by Chávez in 3 days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (confiscation of privately owned television signals). Each of them has been around for about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> They did not usually tell us about the published publication of General Inspector General of the Armed Forces, Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. Even now, despite his announcement, he is Justicia's Interior Ministry. After returning to Chavez, he took up the post of Minister of Defense (equivalent to the US Secretary of Defense). <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Chávez's orders concerning the pacifist concentration of people in the elections. br /> <br /> They didn't say anything about the concentration of people killed by Chávez's supporters (either civilians or military forces). <br /> <br /> They put some facts in the wrong order, they did not say anything about Venezuelan civil society, which is now even for election, to resolve the crisis and Chávez's measures to prevent elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm telling you .... This movie is just a lot of lies or big lies.
