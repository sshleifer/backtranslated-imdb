I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered a movie from Amazon.UK just so I saw it without ever coming to the US. I really had to save my money. What about Anne for Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. He's not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, does she suffer a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal, nor was her walking normal. There were no chemistry between the two main characters that made their "romance" completely unbelievable. In the last scene, they even have Sally Hawkins, who wore the same dress for Amanda Root during the scene. The same clothes do not make the same film. In my opinion, they did not look at the 1995 version, which was a mistake, but remained close to the book. The book, I don't even think they read it. It's like Cliff's commentary "Persuasion". Hit all the higher points without explaining anything.
