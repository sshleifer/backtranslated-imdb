The only word I can think of to describe this movie is: Conventional. <br /> <br /> Plot's plot of Gary's blue character, trying to try suicide, is a ridiculous premise and life ... as lively as a Salingerist party or a party on golf courses in the ocean because he couldn't live a lucrative pro / am golf community? cry me to the river. I want them to be my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Blue, but this movie was probably a bad choice or Blue payment check. A scene where another club member is verbally abused by another club member during the tournament is so upright that I look at it
