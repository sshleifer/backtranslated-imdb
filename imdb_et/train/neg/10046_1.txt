I was not terribly impressed with Dante's 1st season offer at "Homecoming", it wasn't much of a horror, but rather a smart political statement with Undead. The Screwfly situation is the story of a virus that has been triggered in the world, causing men to replace their sexual journey with murdered women. This episode begins well with a short film explaining how the scientists killed the helicopter. Then there is a short scene where the man is arrested when the woman's bodies are discovered in her home. I assume that this should indicate the onset of the outbreak, but it is unclear because it has never been reviewed. The episode continues for a while to introduce blah blah blah. It seems cool and mysterious, but episode stars get worse and worse when it strikes forward until its sad and dissatisfied end. The worst episode. Well, except chocolate.
