A typical thriller has been done several times before. Easy plot overview; police officer Liotta is obsessed with Russell's husband and tries to defeat Kurt so he can get him. It's beyond predictability, it's not even trying to guess, the plot is a plot and there's no point outside the box. I think this is the only reason to see how it develops, but nothing is done initially or interestingly. There's really nothing to say about this movie, it's not very bad, but there are no good points. Russell plays Russell and you know what you get when you see him in the movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowel is a tedious Cher-esque voice. I read the plot's vision and I saw the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I looked at it and rolled it in my eyes exactly as I imagined it. I didn't feel an emotional decline. I have no sense of this movie, as if I had never looked at it. Given this, it's a pretty useless movie, isn't it? However, I will give it 3/10 for some reason.
