It is almost certainly the worst western one I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is particularly common in Western countries and martial arts films - the hero learns that the family / friends are murdered, so that the hero puts the exact revenge, fixes the ineffective lawyer, rescues the kidnapped loving daughter, and kills the expert's archetype in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it wouldn't be the formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophisticated exercise you'll ever see. Scripting is cruel to understand and offensive; it seems that the college has written a dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. Sound is bad; sometimes it seems duplicated. Cinematography is flat and the kits are sometimes just facades. Operation is pathetic; sure some artists may blame the script, but others can't use this excuse. I hope I will never see Chris Lybbert in a talking role; Every time he says a line that should fret or think, he does nothing more than humiliating his voice and he just sounds like a child trying to act on the machot. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this movie). . If you like cinematic ticket prices that only serve the imaginative magnitude of Hopalong Cassidy, get it, but if you have more than two neurons, look at something else.
