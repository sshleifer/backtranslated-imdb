The story relates to a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) hired by her Estee Lauder cosmetic queen aunt. Her aunt (we expect through marriage) is trying to find her long lost family in Europe. All they have to do is take a photo of young girls who stand in beautiful music boxes. Scientist leads to Europe and searches in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The terrain is a real thing, and it has actually been placed (unlike the murder where he wrote that Jessica should visit a remote location and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, he meets a young man who is also looking for solving his own family secret and teams to follow the clues and threatening bad guys. Dialogue, especially romantic dialogue, is terrible. I looked at it because of the landscape, but the script was so bad that I just looked at it if it worsened. It did. Operation was also out. I understand why the career of Mel Harris never went after the thirtieth time, but he is enough (it seems too old). But supporters are directly from the community playhouse. I also lost how many times they say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, it's pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know okay? I realized halfway through the movie that it was going to be one of Harlequin's movies and that's definitely the case. Guess what says it all.
