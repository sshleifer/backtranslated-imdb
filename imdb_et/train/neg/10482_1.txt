One of the worst films I've ever seen. How to define "worst?" I'd prefer both eyeballs to be pulled out and then they would be forced to dance if they ever saw the merciful dreck again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a film that at the same time offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay vendors, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents, and the rest of humanity who have a futile and sloppy farce that is so forced to be abandoned. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could be allowed to use Elvis's song rights in a film that has a central premise that seems to be "The Only Good Elvis Presley Imitator Is Dead" is outside of me. The worst part of this confusion - and it takes some work - is a confusing script: in 1958, Elvis's words and songs that he would speak / speak in the 1970s are quoted! The worst special effect? The fact that the Oscar would go crazy, who decided that the tomb of Elvis, which is potentially the most photographed / recognizable tomb in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold plate that is glued and located in the middle of the park. Potentially, this film's biggest audience is Elvis fans. But the striking stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA mark, not the FBI credentials ... and I can go on and on) actually underestimates the wisdom of THAT. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. It's a terrible, terrible movie.
