I knew there was no moment between me and the D-Wars when we met. First, its title was lazy. War D. As the dragon wrote it was too much for them. Also ... you can't be bold with your title as your blue monkey. The blue monkey can do what he wants. <br /> <br /> Another sign of the rocky relationship between us was the story of crazy progress. Here is a movie that is a dreamy reporter who talks about the big snake paths, flashes back when he and his father traveled in, which must be a competition from the gremlins shop and the dreamy child reporter finds a box that burns. The old shop keeps many terrible truths. This Bauraki supposedly evil snake cheat on his ability to be a god. tells the child that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in LA he has a reincarnated mistress and gives him spam. The store also keeps it from being 500 years old in Asia, despite its obvious light. 15 years later, a dreamy reporter remembers it perfectly and starts acting half-mad, trying to find this random girl. cgi hijinks follows and closes my nose in the last ten minutes. Why? Continue with expensive readers if you have balls. <br /> <br /> so that Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own setbacks. I benefit from Asia's best friend and scene, where he starts worshiping and poster with a lot of Asian characters, telling me that who made this movie has no idea what they're doing. His Korean legend and he is reintroduced from the Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later that evening his dragon tat will injure him, he calls the police that he seems to have a heart attack. Look, in this blended madness world, they obviously behave differently with heart attacks because next time we see him locked in his room, the guard outside and his sister says he's crazy. I now have a new phobia and the fact that when I'm ever in trouble, the first respondents assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another dispute with my harsh lover Dwar. There's a scene where Patrick Dempsey Jr. (Dreamy Reporter) is in a coffee shop with a sassy black friend. Before the events near Miffed, divinity has killed the elephant in Baurak, slipped through the suburbs and killed one of Sarah's friends. Look, people were afraid to come out after 9-11, but we need to tighten everything after making coffee and pastry decisions worth the risk of our lives. As usual, a giant snake doesn't let me turn on your caffeine. When I'm inside and I'm afraid of my life, terrorists and serpentine deities will win. <br /> <br /> After giving the helicopter battle a satisfying dragon, my brutal lover Dwar treats me with a pi $ $ and vinegar-filled scene. Baurak has his fortress and his right under LA. They don't really say, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah can get out of a car accident that would kill fewer men and when they wake up, share a dragon palace. some slowed down dialogue later a good dragon snake god jumps out of somewhere and the snakes wrestle / love it. And I'm not kidding a good snake anywhere. Maybe you think I'm talking this proportionally, I haven't mentioned that thing in the movie, maybe ... there! A few seconds later and a good dragon becomes a dragon god, Baurki turns on fire, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with a dragon-god, a dreamy reporter who stayed somewhere in the middle. Thank God <br /> <br /> Now, our relationship is as rocky as it was in good times. There was a man who saw a turtle breaker and spoke like an adult soldier. I call him Shawder of Tusk. He could do what he wanted when he wanted it just not to be useful. He could walk through the wall where it was not useful. He could go into his dreams if it did nothing good and could illuminate ten random soldiers in the event of a fire, but not when it was important. He was also allergic to touching junk jewelry. I like being hit by the car twice in the same scene and making fantastic pains. <br /> <br /> The participants were, to a large extent, big ... how big was somewhat terrible. Jason Behr, whom I thought it was fantastic at Roswell, can slowly find out that I can only act in one way and it is pretentious, cosmic and Patrick Dempsey "ish". One of the things I love about this dirty prostitute Dwars is his main actor, Bauraki. This giant snake acted through his heart. I would dare say he was better than playing the evil serpentine demi-god, then John Barrymore played Richard III or Hamlet. There were emotions in every scene, stealing thunder from his smaller mortal supporter. When he ate an elephant, I felt that no one would ever be excited about the past, present, or future. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature, and he put his heart and soul in the second place of every damn project. Yeah, this fucking, my favorite actor in this movie was cgi snake. I have balls that testify to you? <br /> <br /> Here is the hope that Bauraki will get more work and that it is not the type that Jason Behr finds different emotions after dreaming of enthusiasm and that I still don't have to look at the Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> So, D-War is the end. I want my CDs back and just be friends
