It is a low hedonism and / or social commentary packed in a tragic story about a jealous young woman's scheme to travel between her father and her fianc√©e. Is it an incest or just a view of her daughter's Electra complex? Who cares? All characters except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are empty and whistle. Seberg is poor (I agree with the "boys' breast" comment on the previous review). Plodded plot. This predictable material was enough for a 30-minute film, which unfortunately was stretched in one and a half hours! If you want to see great gowns and jewelery in Riviera, I suggest "catch the thief" - where you get extra fun fun and pleasant characters. <br /> <br /> I like movie entertainment. Personally, I don't care about where the film is set. Regardless of time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some pleasant characters. It's not hurt if I can communicate with them. Poor Deborah Kerr is usually a good result and David Niven has a despicable role. black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinema in the world cannot save a bad story that has no pleasant signs. Emise's ear is still the sow's ear. Consequently, this confusion was a waste of my time.
