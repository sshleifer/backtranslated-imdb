I was ill while watching the movie. I've grown with Pipp and every time it was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden, she looked at the old men and had a real laughter. but this American version should be renamed and not shown again. it is terrible from start to finish. how can they make it bad. Well I think somebody blames ha ha ha .. but they are never near Pipp. has never seen and ever sent this movie again. Burn the movie and save the kids. if you want to watch Pipp, check out the original movie and laugh. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, excuse Tami Erin for never staying against Pipp. Oh yes .. when you read the "spoilers" explanation, "spoiled" surprise and robbing the viewer of the movie break and enjoyment. "well i guess the director is celebrating it ... you watch this movie at your own risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
