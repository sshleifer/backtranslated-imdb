This is one of the films you think the artists refuse to release because it's so terrible. They probably thought the kids were foolish and fit to absorb endless ads, and they thought they were entertainment because it's funny. What is it with talking car buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M&M and Skittles? There was no car in the drawing. (Dr.) Claw should be evil, not beautiful and charming. Why is Rupert Everet 'Claw' anyway? Were the writers writing these scenes? It seems they were (badly) blasting Robo Cop, making the fight against a human crime an android. I tried to get my money back, but there was a policy where, if I watch a movie for more than 30 minutes, you won't get a refund. I'm sorry I watched over 30 minutes of this heap. After I wasn't given a refund policy, I decided to look at the rest of the foolish rubbish called the Inspector Gadget.
