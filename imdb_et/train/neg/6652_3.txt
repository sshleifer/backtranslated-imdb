It was a strange film about the low life of New York and focused on the main character (title title played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he is a Ricky Nelson-type musician unless he has a real talent. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch until the picture and busy are a sharp tough New York-type woman who's a terrible accent. It destroyed my movie. It has to have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays harsh and trashed women. <br /> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> I can better play Johnny Depp's role in this role. One last remark: it is strange to hear the film made in 1992 (except for Woody Allen) only unanimously.
