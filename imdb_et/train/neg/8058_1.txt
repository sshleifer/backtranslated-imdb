Having seen a hot Eliza Dushku at a pretty wrong turn, I decided to return to this movie instead of living dead. It has not been seen yet, but given that it is one of the most famous horror films, I can say that I made the wrong choice. Just nothing to suggest this movie and I'm talking about a supposedly better killer. It wasn't even a youthful sexual complaint about average poor movies, as I know what you did last summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It just didn't make sense, there was no excitement, there were very few interesting activities or compelling writings. Obviously, the date of appearance appeared several times over a year and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes out as a heap of pointless scene, put together randomly and meaningless. If you want to see Dushu, go wrong instead. I would like to see her movie and a movie with hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I don't think it would have made this movie look like. Casey Affleck, so good at hunting the will, is terrible - he seems to lack both intelligence and guts. That's enough.
