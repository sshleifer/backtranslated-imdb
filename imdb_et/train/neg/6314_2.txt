I love Seth Green. His performances at THat's 70's are always worth it, but last night I felt that the exhibition needed updating. Four single young men inherit a New York apartment that most of us die. The grandmother must be the primary heir of such space. So I felt the need for realism should have come out. Anyway, the plot was not about the four best friends who got this apartment, credible. I would be glad if they had to move with one of their parents who would have given a great sense of humor and dysfunction. There wasn't much humor in it. I only look at it because it falls before my name has won Earl on Thursday night. I think they should go back, break this series and get started. We need more family-run series. How would Seth and his friends move with their unpleasant parents in the suburbs after the fire was burning. You could have a Dabney Coleman, who would play Dad and Christine Estabrook, mother and dysfunctional siblings. The list of options like Seth Green is endless and the network is blowing it up.
