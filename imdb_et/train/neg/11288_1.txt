In recent times, I am under both film and "King Arthur", for whom others have chosen to be "entertained" for the evening, and together they do not achieve anything more than the ever-growing understanding of what a modern film-watching public is completely without discrimination and that is as long as they get "action".

And when you look at something that is vaguely "historical", whatever happened to try to measure some accuracy, some realistic idea of ​​a "political map", even some of the taste of the era, especially in its social sense. attitudes. Why do they all have to show a set of American values ​​of the 21st century? I have read on the irresponsible bulletin boards that little is known in the dark age. Not so. Significant amounts of money have been learned in many ages, but these jokes could not just be done at home. <br /> <br /> I just want to vote 0/10
