Although I use this site quite often to see how other people appreciate what I think is a challenging or simply enjoyable movie, after watching this movie Four Four last night, I felt compelled to write something, even it just helps me clean The movie was still the lowest experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who is always Scully like Leonard Nimoy is always Spock) wasn't their on the real content - I'm not sure if the first half of the movie didn't make the final cut, but it was definitely a revenge movie you would want with victims of empathy ... here I don't care less. In fact, it seemed that the only character was a dog whose stag came in second place. And both animals did Dire (Sic) and Scully, who were frankly terrible. I think that while you are just as good as the script you were given, and I would like to thank writers, manufacturers, directors and all those who waste 90 minutes of my life and some very good electricity.
