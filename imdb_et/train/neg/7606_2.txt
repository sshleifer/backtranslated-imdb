Beverly garland was born at the wrong time. He was an actor before his time, bringing power and grace to even flat flicks like the Corman movies he played. In Gunslinger, she is a sheriff woman in the city. She goes down so she takes her job to continue her killers. It is better than the material with which it cooperates far. The film is gray, convex and mostly boring. There are some (involuntary) humor rings everywhere, people who run behind one building suddenly in front of another (I've heard of the wrong boys, but it's ridiculous!) A sheriff who loves to kill her. Even if she hadn't loved her husband, it was just one week or two because she was dead! And he finally ends up dying down. Not luck with men, that's it. <br /> <br /> A piece of villain is another woman, the owner of the sedan. He wants to buy a line of land just when the railway passes and makes him rich. His action plan, if not quite flat, steals as much as he can and slips out of town. Hell, it's just her and her hired weapon against the whole city. Are you saying these people aren't armed? See what happened in the real cities of the West-West, when the bank robbers got into the robbery of the bank, the people of the armed and dangerous city were cut down on the ball path. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of meaningless talking and riding around, somewhat confused with a couple of flat shoot out. The end is as regular as the Corman flick, although due to goodness there is no moral advocacy that was conquered in the world at the end. The Sheriff turns his mark on Sam Bass and goes to sunset, although the film was so gray that you never saw the sun.
