I totally agree with jamrom4 .. this was one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. It was terrible shit .. I was warned not to see it ... and stupidly watched it still .. about 10 minutes of painful experience i totally abandoned watching cruelty .. but sat down to the end .. just to see if I could ... well i did and now i wish i wasn't .. it was disgusting .. something happened and the end was all preachy..no movie that bad is the right to survive .. i want all you save yourself from terror fats bus .. if only i was the same warning .. please save myself in this movie .. i have the feeling that those who appreciated it very much participated in making the film .. and everyone should be wiping out the face of the planet.
