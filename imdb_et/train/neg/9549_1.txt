I was wondering why John Wood didn't play Dr. Falken before watching the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad performance and general bad film. Please don't watch this movie. Rent "War Games" when you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I also didn't like the plot bending against the idea of ​​a terrorist threat. The first film, W.O.P.R, was built because Russia had 1,000 military heads in the US. In this movie, the idea behind the computer was to kill the terrorist before they were in danger. Alongside politics, one of the first films of one good thing was to emphasize that even a stupid computer might mean the end of war. Such a film is not offered in such a film.
