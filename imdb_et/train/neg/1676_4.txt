Val Kilmer, strong performance. Dylan McDermott, strong performance. Josh Lucas, strong performance. Three very interesting participants who give decent performances. The problem is who cares about the plot? John Holmes. The infamous for his good donations, drug addicts and boys, who, despite the conclusion of AIDS, continued adult films, simply does not make an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the events that lead to the consequence of the witch-mass murder in Los Angeles in the late 80s, which Holmes was bound to, arrested and accused of murder, and who was finally acquitted. As with the EU, the offender, despite the result, was quite high in the zone "He did it". <br /> <br /> Nobody recognizes compassion in this movie as everyone is a self-serving criminal. There's nothing interesting here.
