Jim Carrey is one of the most funny and talented comedies of the film today. His hyperactive spontaneity and his rubbery face can make him crazy and we love him for that. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (area Ace Ventura) and turn them into decent comics. Or, for Liar Liar, make some of the most fun contemporary comedies. Carrey has also proved himself capable of dealing with dramas. He was both "Man on the Moon" and "Truman Show". The boy is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce Almighty comes, which is the perfect vehicle for Carrey and the premise that should have worked; Carrey, when he complained to God and how his life stinks, is permitted by God's authority. However, the script is pure recycled rubbish. Now, no matter how bad the script is, Carrey improvisation alone is sometimes a funny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few ways to unleash for Carrey, because so much comedy is based on a stupid special effect, some of which are fun. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because she has to work on special effects. Writers probably thought that all these special effects and superpowers were funny because the rest of the movie is just a filler that gives Carrey something else to work on than the funny character who is absolutely humorous. It looks like he is more than 5 years old for our attention, who wants the viewer to find what he's doing funny if it's really just annoying. <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston's Friends and she was a great "Good Girl" of last year. She also has a gift for comedy, but the script is as linear as she is, but she just gets a bitter girlfriend. He comes as a nervous, harsh and there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> "Bruce Almighty" should have been a comedy that works. But it does not even have the courage to deal with a topic that it amuses; religion. Some small giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it just turned into a comic comedy of superpower. Not to mention that this tone sometimes shifts foolishly to a heavy hand and even to a black comedy. The film does not work on almost every level. That doesn't mean it is completely laughing, but it's close. Problems are all films that feel the need to involve a dog pee in order to make it laugh. But hey, if you see a pee funny, go to it. <br /> <br />
