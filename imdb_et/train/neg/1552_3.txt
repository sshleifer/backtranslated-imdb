This movie was advertised very well. I am an avid filmmaker and have seen previews of this movie for several months. Although I was somewhat skeptical that this movie would be funny, my friends thought it was big and jumped over it. Then I went and saw it, I fell asleep almost asleep until I remember paying for this movie. I made myself laugh at most of the film's stuff so I didn't feel bad and would destroy the good mood I was, and I wanted to get my money out of the movie! I always go to an open-minded movie that doesn't try to go too far with expectations, but this movie wasn't that funny. Now, this was not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth the wait for HBO. If you don't see a lot of previews for a movie or you like a very slow and dirty comedy, you can enjoy it, but fans of real comedy Id say. Maybe even watch the comedy kings again. Something told me to go to see my parents !!!
