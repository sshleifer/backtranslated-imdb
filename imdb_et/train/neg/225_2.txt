SPOILER: Young lover, Jed, spinned out of a spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because he mistakenly believes Jed has a girlfriend with his two girls. Kate thought he was catching them under the flag. Kate throws Jedi's shoes out of the door. Jed reluctantly leaves behind and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on. Then he gets over the truck ("broken", meaning one title). And dies. <br /> <br /> "And then he gets over the truck." Can you imagine a scenario that actually presents a script with this schema element? So far, this is a comedy that is going to be foaming, but there is no real beep. Everything except Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jedi and everything is sad until the end where the gals learn to love each other and be supportive rather than destructive. I'll give her twice.
