Watch the great talents that have been put together to make this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even Slezaki, Lange and Plimpton. They prove in spades that a good lie cannot be saved in a bad script. The story needs so much faith from the audience that its improbability should have even exceeded Hollywood standards. It is not very original and "twisted" is completely cruel.
