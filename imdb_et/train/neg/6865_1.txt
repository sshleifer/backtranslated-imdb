This movie was so bad that it was ridiculous. However, I couldn't see it. The plot is standard, acting pretty terrible (casting support like a nutty neighbor and a lawyer friend were better actors). Definitely amusing if you have the time to waste and see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> Kathy's headquarters was simply exciting because I couldn't decide whether his death, the flat was affected by a bad operation or just a bad operation (I decided both). This leaves the script to comment, which was quite terrible. Pat notes, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity for every character in the movie. Maybe it was so riveting; I do not know. I just looked at it to see how bad it might be. (In fact, dialogue is not even called "clich√©" - but it's almost completely naughty.) <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very bad, cheaper film. Sets, the same scenes (house, building) appeared over and over without artistic or actual connection; more similar props that were accidentally taken off in a bad game. Any minor in the stock or old school could have done a chase scene: badly shot, cheap props, minimal action .... and I still wanted to see the end. Get your finger off.
