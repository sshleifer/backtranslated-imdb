I remember that some Tuesday, 18/6/02 morning, is accurate. I was left behind trying to persuade myself out of bed when a terrible explosion heard. I went to the kitchen, where I have a view of several neighborhoods in southern Jerusalem, and I saw a distant smoke column, the vision of smoke was followed in a few minutes by casting the sirens. I remember rushing into my bedroom, picking up my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and putting a picture of a broken glass. The bus was still close to the pickup station, where a terrorist stop and one-click TNT device killed 25 passengers, many of whom were in school. My good friend's husband sat in the bus on the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and pointless decision that saved his life. <br /> <br /> I am sure there is at least one terror in every Israeli related memory, which he wants he never to have, and that was just a matter of time before anyone made a movie about it. As it turned out, the film began to become its own repressed memory. <br /> <br /> The film is a dry-running feature film, Haim Buzaglo (depicted by Hmmm, Haim Buzaglo, who also wrote and directed a film), which spends part of his day out on a blank word-processor page for Christmas competitions. Meanwhile, she decides to make a bonded ex-army officer, a commercial reporter for an Israeli commercial channel. Buzaglo, a boring and a bit paranoid due to what is medically known as "what the surface of this hot babe is looking for me" syndrome, asks the private eye to bring his girlfriend stakeout. <br /> <br /> Detective exploration is progressing, and its findings are invading the life of the game and later its participants. Meanwhile, the metamorphosis of the comic book is a charge against the separation of Israeli society. As far as the film is concerned, the film becomes the practice of film, which is in tiny cardboard characters and unreliable dialogues, while the miles drift away from what it was supposed to do first. <br /> <br /> When I say "carton characters", I refer to those characters that, under the obsession of the writer / director, did not have real dialogues and breakthroughs in the "meaningful" film. I'm not talking too much about it. Suffice it to say that I'm sure that homeless barefoot man prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With this aim to see the game, it is. <br /> <br /> According to Haim Buzaglo, this film is the first part of the trilogy of the current agenda. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from experience, such as what I wrote at the beginning of my review, unlike the isolated world of characters, something other than the existing and the plot that is something other than compelling. /> <br /> 4 out of 10 of my FilmOmeters. <br /> <br /> PS This movie was an oyster landmark. It was shot in ten days, all cast worked for free and the total cost of the movie was about $ 12,000 (no, I didn't leave zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). Wonders why $ 34,000 was spent on completing the Blair witchcraft project.
