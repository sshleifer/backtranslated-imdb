Video quality is terrible. Sound quality is pathetic. Operation is terrible. Dialogue is painful. Lighting is bad. Editing is ridiculous. I could go on, but that would be pointless. Snitch is a third-level amateur video broadcasted as a feature film. It is best to leave the dust in the bargain package of the video store.
