David Mamet is a very interesting and very unequal leader. His first film "The House of Games" was what I liked best, and it put together a series of characters whose characters have changed in complicated situations, and so the viewer looks at it. So "condemnation" is the title that tries to put the viewer in the mind of a normal criminal drama. The main characters are two police, one Jew and one Irish, who are dealing with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who turns out to be an old veteran of the Israeli War of Independence launches the Jewish identity in the sense and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> It was a movie error. are more obvious. The awakening process is theatrical and hard to believe, a group of Jewish soldiers is operative, and the way the detective finally runs into the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the movie is similar to that of Mamet, but disappears from the emotional point of view. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the story is too obvious to be easily compensated.
