The fighter ship is drowning ... The survivors hanging on a nearby life raft will sit there when we go into every sensation to get many long setbacks. <br /> <br /> Although Noel's cowboy name is the only one you notice at the time of the credit, it's all that is in the movie due to Lea's. And it is very good under technical conditions. David Lean just got KNEW movies get-go. There are many moments where Coward's research takes a second place and Lea's visual idea is central. Try the soldiers near the ship, and the whole scene; Tracking shot an anthem towards the song, a scene where we are inside the house that is bombarded. <br /> <br /> Noel coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He is completely wood, not emotional, character or human. You see it in his eyes that he doesn't really listen to what the other speaker says, he's waiting for them to finish so he can pull his line out. <br /> <br /> 7/10 /> <br /> This episodic, somewhat repetitive and rebound-dying story: there is no central story that they develop but give general knowledge of the characters. Nonetheless, this is an interesting movie to look at - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very deep or penetrating film, and it's definitely a propaganda film, but also a presentation of Lea's editing skills - all the way pieces are put together.
