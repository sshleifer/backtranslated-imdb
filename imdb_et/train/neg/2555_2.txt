This movie is probably one of the most terrible horrors I've ever seen. The length was not long enough to contain a good story. It was also ridiculous how growers died. A mother suddenly dies in a shower when she is rubbed over her face, and a father shoots a cop? I can see where some originality might have been, what they were, but it could have been better. The fact that all of this was joyful made me to finish before graduation. After hearing the whole name of Lucy and explaining that it was "Lucifer," I wanted to grab it. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a man's name. It should be given to a man. All in all, the film was drilled and could have used a better plot.
