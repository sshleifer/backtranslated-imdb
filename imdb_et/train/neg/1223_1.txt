With the weekend. Two days ago I watched "War 2: Dead Code" in the first half, now "being outside". I try to find out what was, in my opinion, worse in terms of pain. I think "though he was out" was worse. <br /> <br /> All other comments have said: unrealistic, illogical, etc. I started to know more about the bad guys than the women because I would have recommended her to Darwin when she actually died (I only looked at the first half so I don't know). Soon I had two Darwin Prizes (if it was possible) for his enormous stupidity. <br /> <br /> And Hi: Manufacturer Kim Basinger? So he didn't only know the script, but was also responsible for wasting money on people? I think that people who are wasting significant sums of money would be evil, because money could have been used by quite a few people to eat and dress, instead of 80% of them making cinema and 20% of idiots good. an opportunity to show how much idiot they are.
