The same difficulties I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" apply equally to "Oliver". Instead of composing composers during the stylistic period of the game settings, they wrote only Broadway-type melodies that were historically unidirectional and stylistically inclined. <br /> <br /> Excessive, dramatic blatant brutality and unpleasant action don't mix up some of the sunshine that passes the score. This is an inconvenient blend that drastically leaves a sour subtype. <br /> <br /> Casting a boy Oliver does not help: temporary and expensive, here's less than solid. Fagin performs enough of his usual routine, although the songs he is required to sing are periodically few. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me", he is given a striking transfer, a throat and a tense. Two big product numbers, "Who's Buying" and "Thinking for Yourself" seem to be overgrown with everything except the kitchen sink. It's one thing to go all out, one more to cross the line. <br /> <br /> The affliction of courage, despair, and a greater novel does not seem to be suitable for such things and choreography. While the novel is considered to be a classic, I have to admit that I have problems with Mr Dickens consciousness because his works tend to give negative vibration. This may be due to the prolongation of his personal life, full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all of the combined talents of this production, either on camera or camera, can overcome the structural nature of the basic material. All this causes me discomfort. <br /> <br />
