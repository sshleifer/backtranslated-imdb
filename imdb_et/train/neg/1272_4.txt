Did someone else notice when they are in the car every time the camera takes a new corner where they change their way. Like one scene, it is a lane with a lane, and next they are on a multi-track highway with a divider, followed by a two-lane highway with double yellow lanes. I understand a small budget, but it was just a sloppy movie. <br /> <br /> I also read other comments and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think if you're a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, you can enjoy this movie. But if you find your job / not funny, I would recommend staying away from it.
