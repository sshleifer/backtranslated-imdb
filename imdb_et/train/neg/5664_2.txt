I liked Boyle's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was superfluous to absurdity. Most of the participants spoke like you would think your 9-year-old nephew would talk when he pretended to be imprisoned, a rocky cop or an ultra-evil villain. Dirty voice commands seemed to me amateurs. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out a better opening. And what about all the torture of the 1984 police? It was completely superfluous and had no story of actual events. Cox added a lot of things that he thought would be really cool, but he had nothing to say. This is a great disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so good is his minimalism - they are closely related, without any extra detail. This movie is just the opposite. I ended up watching this scene where Lonnrot interviews a boy from Yidische Zaitung or beyond. I wasted $ 4, but at least I'm getting some satisfaction with writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake.
