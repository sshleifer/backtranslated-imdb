This movie is hard to praise. The Dragon CGI was well done, but there was no proper modeling of light and shade. The same frame is used endlessly from a dragon that pulls through a corridor that becomes slightly annoying. The empire acted in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg", it must be a nickname, and can be accused of using it when it appears in this stinker. . If you have to watch this movie, you go around and break your friend's house - it's enjoyable.
