I went to watch this movie yesterday and although I had no great hopes for this movie, I was still bitterly disappointed! I really can't believe I spent 96 minutes watching my movie ... it's bad! The story was disgraceful and the actor was terrible (although it had big names like Uma Thurman). This film was strongly based on its special effects ... but they did not personally have any effect on me. I honestly wished id had never watched it and I warn everyone who doesn't see this movie. It is a waste of money and eventually you will be disappointed. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this movie.
