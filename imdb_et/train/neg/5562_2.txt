This unpleasant film has little to suggest. Dolph Lundgren gives a result that is better than this script or his other movies are allowed. And there are sometimes fragments of dialogue that show that the film might have given some insight into the strange subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivations are either dim or tiny. Most of the actions are sub-par. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's unnecessary charm focusing on gore is disturbing. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who this movie is for the audience.
