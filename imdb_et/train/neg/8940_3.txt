"Craft Mistress" Celeste works as an agent for 17 London branches of Interpol's office, specializing in (guess) hidden criminals. He has an eye-catching eye, dangerous when someone else got it. <br /> <br /> Office 17 has received Satanist from California, Hydest (no relationship with Dr. Jekyll). LAPD Detective Lucy Lutz flies to England to return her to the US. Lutz is an association with earlier witchcraft that Stephanie Beaton has played before Witchcraft 9. In the 7th part, Lutz played another woman; 6. Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> The Lutz part 9 was not very big, but it is one of the main characters in it. Although he has high heels and short skirts left, he still has a revealing top. And this time he's naked and with sexual scenes. Beaton is quite tempting in his role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are also several sexual scenes. The anonymous club player has a deadly threesome with two vampires, a satanic and a major cape getting some confusion, Lutz finds English and Celeste and his boyfriend love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring character of the Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, is not evident in this, although Lutz mentions him as the 17 agent Dixon in a conversation about vampires. He also calls his partner Detective Garner (parts 6, 7, and 9), although we don't hear the end of his conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde has been imprisoned by a vampire group led by Raven, a Walpurgis ritual that has anything to do with Morsheba's god (I think). Hyde delivers all its lines very evenly, while Raven moves over campy degrees. Fighting scenes are terribly choreographic. <br /> <br /> The sound in the movie was rather poorly recorded and poorly edited. In addition, some dialogues have lost music or sirens. Also, cinematography is not great. However, when the film was set up in the UK and actually hit, it was at least novel for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good at Celeste; certainly attractive, but more importantly, it is just the best actor of the film (despite the bad fight). I'm quite surprised that his filmography is so small. If there ever is witchcraft XIV and I would like to bet, then they should return, even if it means he is driving to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available separately or on DVD collection Hotter Than Hell with Witchcraft XI and two independent movies.
