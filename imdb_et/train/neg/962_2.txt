Maybe when I looked at it again, I get physically sick, the film is so annoying ... ... if you don't believe in psychology, re-incarnation, and another extraordinary focus that fosters it for a long time. "The recycling of souls," they call it here. Tel-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been made many times before with films like "Heaven Can Wait". It is also much better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. This is the only quality of redemption of this movie.
