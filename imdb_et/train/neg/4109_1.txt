It can only be described as terrible. It's bad to get started and then it gets worse. When you start, you really have to look at it, because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but don't be afraid, because it is. Another badly written script for the director of the donkey who has not given earlier movie stars. It is difficult to decide whether a script is worse than behavior or whether management is worse than both. As far as the hero is concerned, he puts everything up, including one scene, where he wins the living daylight harshly, opening the wardrobe door and breaking it against the window. And in the second scene that he throws through the window and runs 20ft besides the concrete - not even blinking - then rises immediately and gets into baddies. This is a really ridiculous movie. Good luck that it cost only $ 1.
