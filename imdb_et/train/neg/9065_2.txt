About halfway through, I realized that I didn't care less about these signs; but I looked a little more. Unfortunately I came back the next day and finished it. I shouldn't have worked hard. <br /> <br /> If you know * anything about the movie, you know that the wizard is an anti-aircraft tool - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of ​​what's going to happen later - it gets your phone and calls people about it! It was almost as bad as a "snake on the plane" (another bad aviation disaster). I understand that this is an old film, and these days the exemplary style was much less naturalistic than today. But even according to these standards, action was embarrassing. These were not characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect that this movie was more than anything, Bette Davis's attempt to help her husband (Gary Merrill )'s career. However, I have seen oak trees have more real emotion than he did. <br /> <br /> Davis played a happy stroke (ie a non-glamorous role) in the apparently sharp and bold career movement. It wasn't. It was just boring. He was in the film a kind of Tiny Tim, making Trask (the character of the Merrill) the truth of love and forgiveness (though he was less stranger than Tiny Tim), giving peaceful life and relationships to wisdom without suggesting that his beloved husband had just died. The final scene where Trask called his wife back to Iowa to accept it was so affected and overly active at both ends of the phone line. I had to remind me that these people actually paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people felt the movie enjoyed it. If you found it up, it's great. But to be honest, I found it just bad. There are many old movies from the Hollywood goldsmith that were much better written and acted.
