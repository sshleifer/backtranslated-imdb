If you want to know the real story of Wendigo, I suggest you copy the original story of Algernon Blackwell. This film was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved this book when I read it as a child (EM Freemann's "Campfire Chillers") and was so excited to see the resulting film. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. The other thing is that for the whole movie, there were too many computers (politically correct) that were not on the film. When the book was written, the computer didn't even exist. <br /> <br /> My proposal is not to waste your time or money! If you see it on the video shelf, CONTACT IT.
