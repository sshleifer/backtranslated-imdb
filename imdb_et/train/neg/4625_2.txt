How could 16 of 16 16 voters give this film 10? How could more than half of the previous voters get to 7 or higher? Who is voting here? I can only assume that it is mainly children - very young children. The fact is that it is a bad film in every sense. The story is stupid; to act is hard to even act to think; characters are characteristic; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw it on a rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In a sad event he never transmits, I suggest you read the book.
