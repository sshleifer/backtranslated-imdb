This film talks about a family trying to reach the death of a mother / woman by moving to Genoa, Italy. <br /> <br /> The "Genova" plot sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists only of scenes depicting the everyday life of the family, such as swimming, taking piano lessons or making eggs. Most of these scenes are superfluous and tiring, but unable to engage viewers emotionally. The end is very disappointing, because it is not remarkable, moving or emotional. I can say for sure that "Genoa" is disappointed and boring for me. The only thing about the film is sunny weather and the beauty of Genoa. "Genova" can be a city of expanded tourism advertising, but not a movie to enjoy.
