There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one star or producer: actor Nichole Hiltz. He is an exhibition in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge. Director Simon Gornick, film film Joyce Hyser as a betrayed woman who decides to seek revenge on her cheat's husband. Oh, but not by conventional means. He is planning a complete immigration war and recruiting a bad girl Nichole Hiltz as his chosen weapon. She wants Nichole (on Tuesday) to go to her (beautiful but boring Stephan Jenkins, who should hold the music) to shame her and destroy her life. In his short moments, David DeLuise is not good at the former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison, but it is almost a fool. Hiltz, on the other hand, comes out at different times both sexy and playful, then evil and angry. He also deals with the vulnerable and "maybe a little psychotic" well. He is also quite hot (although there are no naughty bits) so you can understand how he might be able to reach any man he's targeted. But this movie is wasted in a movie that is not just too sharp or interesting enough to recommend.
