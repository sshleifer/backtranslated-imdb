This movie was badly said !!! The number of great cars is shameful that it has been shown in the LAME movie. It starts with L.A. in Las Vegas to end with 1HR 45min ... in Ferrari F430. I did it 1HR 50min in a small 4-cylinder 140 HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie doesn't justify these cars. Obviously, these writers are just like that and are likely to travel with your hand @ 10 & 2 hours. I remember the news that Eddie Griffin dropped a $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo move 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> <br/> the biggest SELLOUT !!! He is ashamed of his race. I don't know how many people he or she verily pleased to break into Hollywood. He participated in a film depicting Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian Women >> Cheap Money Grubbing Whores. Asian men >> lose compulsive gamblers and thugbeaters who beat all the time. What the hell is fear of asians? Why do you always have to imagine them in a negative sense? I'm so sick of how Hollywood ONLY represents Asia as a negative and false pretext.
