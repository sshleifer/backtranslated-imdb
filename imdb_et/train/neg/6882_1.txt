I hated how Mrs Perez depicted Puerto Rican! We are not all ghettos - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rico! I can't talk about educated people you've come across. But our language is healthy, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better economically than any other Caribbean island! I am pleased that we are not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from the influence of America? Free from poverty, not the US standard of poverty. We are not the victims we are durable, humble, honest and intelligent. Our ancestors include strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing to do with black Americans 9 research). </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> is no longer out of character. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero of a real revolutionary - honest man who saw the day when we were all free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro create Cuba, which is nowadays, why are boats full of Cubans risking their lives to come to America because Che was in such a better position? You had a great, fantastic, bright idea, but you politicized it too much. We have so many things to be proud of the people - don't give your people shame by sacrificing us. I'm not Nuyorican and maybe I can't share my views. I'm in Puerto Rican, I'm speaking Spanish, I'm not a victim and I've been able to meet many of my goals in America. If in the future part 2 - less policy, there are more stories about triumph - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
