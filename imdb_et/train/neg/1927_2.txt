(Possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someone asked Dr. Seuss whether they could stick to their 1957 Christmas classic "How Grinch Stole Christmas". He turned them down, demanding that nobody could do better than the wonderful Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (maybe it was a bitter experience that wrote the script in 1953. The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T). When a good dr died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still refused to sell film rights. However, with the normal use of CGI, Mrs Geisel's heart changed. Universal offered him a generous offer; he also accepted Jim Carrey's casting as a character. He allegedly was satisfied with the outcome. Well, Mrs Geisel, who makes us one. <br /> <br /> The film was given a budget of $ 123,000,000 (which is more than even the cost of the Gate of Heaven, including the adjustment of inflation), which apparently went into a very complicated makeup, set design, and special effects (which somewhat undermine quite blurry cinematography). Unfortunately, none of this money seems to have been left to get a better script than Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (who founded Roger Rabbit?), Which made a much better <br /> <br /> big budget) turned on. If the TV is 26 minutes without ads, this movie will try to get more background information about Grinch for a 105-minute ride. It turns out that as a child he was a ridiculous subject, including one of the eighty-eight years of humiliating experience. So it turns out that everything that our poor Mr Grinch has is directly about who it is. The problem is that it looks quite long for 105 minutes, where too much dead wood clogs the story. It may not seem so bad if only Grinch would be a little more ... well, Grinchy. Letter by dr. Seuss wrote and later animated Chuck Jones, a foolish fox whose slippery attempts to hijack the holiday period undermined his sudden change (and exponential growth) in his heart. Carrey's Grinch is a strong, hyperactive oaf, and sometimes a thug who, when making the "Cheermeister" holidays, hates anger at the town of Whoville. <br /> <br />). It undermines the script's attempt to make Grinch more sympathetic because all the evils on Whoville are so atypical (at least with such an interpretation). <br /> <br /> Dr. An honest people who knew the true meaning of Christmas in their hearts. The Whoville movie is a rather noisy and crowded place where ninned, selfish, and materialistic ninjas live; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumption. It's insulting <br /> <br /> hypocritical, as the film industry has benefited a lot from American consumption, and because this film has contributed to this huge commercial campaign <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The film expands and redefines Cindy Lou Who, the small but decisive character of the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked on this fake Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the wrong values ​​and trying to understand Grinch's perspective (his big scene from the original back has been re-introduced), which makes it seem non-existent). He seems to be the only one who ever knew that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations that make him completely different and more annoying. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas should, in the morning of December 25th, receive a single portion of coal from their <br /> <br /> stockings as a copy of that long, overweight, embarrassing, annoying, tooth, raw to turn to children from the roof. classic feature film. It proves at the same time that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation and grudging are inadequate substitutes for charm, spirit, sincerity, and heart. People in the Universalis should get their collective knees down and thank God that this truly unfortunate $ 123 million stinking bomb received $ 260 million in their home country or wouldn't be here today. In addition, it made Mike Myers' hat possible.
