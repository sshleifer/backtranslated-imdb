I was really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I looked at the polyester and really hated it. The only thing I liked about this movie was DIVINE. He had a lot of talent in hell. I was really surprised. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie ...
