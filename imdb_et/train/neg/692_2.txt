One of the slashers that appeared at the beginning of the eighties is Pranks noticeable only for the early performance of Daphne Zun (The Thing, The Fly 2); his character dies quite early and the rest of the film is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> A group of students attended a Christmas party voluntarily in a furniture-deprived college building. A crazy killer throws a wrench into his work, grabbing the youngsters methodically in a variety of terrible ways. <br /> <br /> Using every 'n' slash in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow gives a tedious and unforgettable horror that prayed for the characters to be killed so I could look at something more valuable. The majority of deaths (which, let us be honest, is why we are watching this movie in general) are short and not; the only truly harsh images come at the end when the remaining survivors discover the bodies of the victims (there is one particularly bloody broken body? The movie could have been done more). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the film shrinks with shame when I get the lowest score possible, with an endless end, but it's really just for graduates.
