Here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase "low budget" a terrible name. Our physics teacher, having about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular restructuring". Pupils are hopelessly killed for fake coincidences and vehicles in submarines sandwiches. It looks like the resurrection of classic B-films from the 50s, right? No! This is not an example of a high camp amusement, which is five, DETAIL. The glamorous exhibition of the breast and buttocks brings our desire for joy, in contrast to the horror that should have been 99.44% more. Barrel entertainment is best supported by red blood and dead student assemblies. Such malicious films would eventually make the GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) disastrous genius work with a master's degree in film production! It's automatic "F", so rest easy!
