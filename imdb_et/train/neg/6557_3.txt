Indeed, they wrote it for credits at lunch, not at BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they didn't have a spell check budget. All the money in the production went to big old cars. There are at least two packages here. One of them is Darin Convertible. Nice yellow Packard interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The film studio scenes show that money was spent on costumes and decorations. There were old cameras, Ciro, street signs and everything that was needed to make a visually pleasing picture. Poor written and managed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it will take about 104 minutes. It was more than 85 minutes. It ended without reaching conclusions. There was a collision, but no conclusion was made. The film was simply crushed by credit. 99 cents. I paid 99 cents for that. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and looked at my cat's face when he felt more excited. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds from Ciro's scene, when Darren McGavin gets a phone call, it seemed as if it was. ... this film would have a surprising twist that would make an interesting movie. Then he just sat there. <br /> <br /> A young Latin actress played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have been much more involved here. This casting could have made a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think that if they cut the Brian part and use Steven Bauer and change the script and keep the bands and lose the band and add Johnny Otis sound and band, they got something.
