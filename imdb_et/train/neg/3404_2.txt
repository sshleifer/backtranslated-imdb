I'm not going to wear this movie on all the numerous technical f | u | c | k | u | p | For s, it takes two days to describe how the whole thing is not even far away. Others have already pointed out all the stupidities involved. <br /> <br /> Given all this, I would still be pleased if only they had not added the entire maidlin, nausea, embarrassing, Disneyesque sentimental crap that is so far away, but no more than in a room where the slightest mistake may mean immediate death. <br /> <br /> The "team", but also the "real" astronaut, were equally guilty. puts all your funny mess on everything else. It completely destroyed the value that production could have left. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that NASA dumps this garbage so that so many people get so much false information about what's so important. If you haven't seen it yet, save yourself from irritation. Look back at Apollo 13. At least it was trying to be kind of real.
