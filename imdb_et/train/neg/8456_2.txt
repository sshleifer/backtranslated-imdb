I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I managed to stay complete. It has been a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked the jean hugs of the Angels, but I think he had to eat as we did, and he agreed to play it in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters and the rest can be called "art" or something that I could not express but which I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst film I saw was a crash, but I'm pretty sure I have enough experience to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Good luck! ; o)
