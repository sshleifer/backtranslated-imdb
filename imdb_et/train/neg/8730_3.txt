The thing that differs in this film (unfortunately) is the introduction where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) drives into the city. You see, his Mercedes goes through a winding road through a forest that looks like he is stripped of a Redwood tree. It's pretty pretty. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia, who plays the surname of Berlin, is fine ... Andy is just Spanish / Latin to be satisfactory. Maybe this story was married to a Caucasian father with his Spanish mother? Who knows. But I can tell you that if you put him in a farmhouse and a cage town, he looks like a painful thumb, especially his accent that burns when he gets angry. Yeah, I know, great thing? He's still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a successive killer shouting Jennifer to his victims. All the victims are blind and they will demolish them. The killer has taken the shame, but suddenly returns when a blind witness (not ask), Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman) appears. Thurman does a good job to play the blind, to the surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen Sgt. Freddy Ross I was worried. Henriksen played in some rather strange films, especially late. I still can't forget her in the Pumpkinhead bleeding movie. <br /> <br /> Berlin films from the small town of L.A as a detective. He starts investigating Jennifer's murders after finding local landfills. His glory in the discovery of one victim was blind, which seemed far removed. So did * SPOILER * Freddy's murder irony with similarities in recording and name. I was very confused by the logic of how eight "Jennifer" came. And the killer's motive, just as spoiled, didn't offer much punch. In retrospect, this film is probably more viable, showing an unsuspecting person who is able to murder, simply because they became small over time or may be looney toons. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich is doing an amazing job of interviewing Garcial! Although no police officer is legally allowed to force someone who is hard and eggless without rightfully falling out. Finally, it is a bit of a surprise, but it is very controversial, like Sgt. The murder of Ross. The killer decides to walk after the victim, choosing frolicki instead. <br /> <br /> And he has so many ways to kill him that it is ridiculous. I'm not destroying the end, because, despite being trembling, it's a good surprise. Later you would probably say, as I did, "the boy was he happy!" 4/10
