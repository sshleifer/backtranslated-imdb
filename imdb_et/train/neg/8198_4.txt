Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico. Get Alien Mixed Thing, Mix Contact, Mix All Things Beach, Andromeda Strain, Classroom Scene Raiders of Lost Ark and Throw a Little Stargate Boot. <br /> <br /> Even the movie doesn't even describe the derivative. Of course, the original plot is not wise, do they enhance gore and sex? Nope gore is flashing and you forget that thing and sex are temptation. (James Spader mentions that he needs a shower and the amazing Leslie Stefanson asks to join him? He turns him down. AGGH!) <br /> In fact, when the film needs a shower scene to liven up. that's it. I mean, if you are going to be impossible women in white baths that travel to the Antarctic research base, why not go break. <br /> <br /> About 30 seconds of real excitement in the whole movie Alien Hunter is a remarkable serious and slow sci-fi adventure. A much better plot is needed to enliven it and how the alien himself is a terrible clich√© and he has almost no screen time for anyone who shares half the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked what I look at with the children of corn in the corn motif. (Note that since Jason was the 13th celebrity on Friday, Hellraiser Pinhead and all Leprechaun has traveled into space to kill homosexual teenagers, why not spice it out to be alive and assaulted. <br /> <br /> The actor is mostly good when Spader repeats the role of his Stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Eser are the last Antarctic beach clothes, but John Lynch read the whole script and acts like a mad evil before he reads it <br /> <br /> An alien hunter is a frustrating slogan that puts me in the cosmos for the corn for the pine.
