This British / Spanish star cogeneration looks good at what you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and everything is terribly trimmed, so badly that the buildings seem to be talking to each other. Few films suffer from panic and scans as they see it, as director Robert Parrish seems to be so widespread that he used both sides of the screen at the same time, leaving the center off. Another user commented that we see that the entire congregation's inhabitants are at the beginning of the mass; not in any of my copies. There are some steep cuts in peasants that shoot their rifles, one Mexican officer, Shaw and Landau, and that is. We will never know why Shaw has become a priest (when he is), we never know what happens to Don Carlos (Savala), although I suspect he was called to the stars in Kojak, because his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange setback in which Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) dances in a hard hat and in a bad old English music tradition in the 1960s hit by BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, which Johnny Horton did not sing here, but with some lyrics that I have never heard before. On the plus side, this is a great place, a big old destroyed fortress with Escher-style stairs, where the nice scenery of Robert Shawi, and Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savala's good productions as Telly Savala. I didn't like this movie, but I haven't seen it exactly. I'm looking for a widescreen version and then decide.
