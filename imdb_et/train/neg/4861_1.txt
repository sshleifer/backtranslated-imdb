On the glorious days of the 90's (God is resting his breath), you can turn on a great comedy center every day of the day and see the biggest comedy show on Saturday night. The amazing exhibition, whether it was the original non-ready-Primetime players or the second golden age of SNL, which included worship - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then everything went to hell. For the first time a year and a half ago I was open to MadTV and I think I have to get out of shock. How long could this terrible show be? There are so many terrible mistakes. I think I'll start writing. Writing is usually terrible. It's nothing but nursery bath humor. Most are mostly talented. I have some sketches I have enjoyed, like some of Mrs Swan and Stuart, and there are some talents in the show, such as the great Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not just a comedian. Although there are few rare moments, it is not enough to redeem this endless frightening line of living idiots. Miss it.
