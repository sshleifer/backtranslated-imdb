This movie is a cooling reminder for Bollywood, which is just a Hollywood parasite. Bollywood also tends to feed from the past to promote its industry. <br /> <br /> Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this film on the grounds that the cocktail mix "Deewar" and "Waterfront" brings home the Oscar. It turned out to be a beginner's mistake. <br /> <br /> Even the title idea is inspired by Elia Kazan's classic. The original shows Brando as rising doves as a symbol of peace. <br /> <br /> Bollywood must step out of the Hollywood shadow when it comes to taking it seriously.
