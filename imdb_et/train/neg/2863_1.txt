I was happy to watch this movie for free because I work in the hotel industry and this movie recently came to our movie collection. Something about low budget movies, but this movie has terrible action and leadership. How can such a movie ever be done. The director should be blacklisted and for all poor players it is definitely not a career leap. Please make sure you don't watch this movie, it's flat, camera and terrible. There are just a few more movies that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this film should give it to charity, so at least it will be a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I'd look at another 10 (or at least once).
