It's rare that I meet a movie that's terrible, annoying and irritating. This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, if it is not confusing and pointless over flashy editing, is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a tough mother? Because his goldfish died when he was a child, and this "traumatic" event left him emotionally haunted and hated everyone. If the dialogue is not a clich√© or banal, it is full of ridiculous features, such as: "There are three kinds of people in this world: rich ... poor ... and all others". At one point, bounty hunters have some kid stuck behind their bus who is a combination of a number tattooed on his hand. Because of the confusing mobile phone call, instead of turning your sleeve up and just reading the number, they hit your hand with a shotgun. At the second point, the prize hunters take the bomb to a meeting with the mafia and threaten to put the bomb down when the mafia doesn't let them go! Obviously, getting to the meeting would not have been easy. Keira Knightley is not convincing and terribly failed. Mickey Rourke manages to save some confidence in this confusion. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed some of Tony Scott's earlier films, one of which is true romance, but all I thought was that this generation had suffered was that it had to be made completely idiot.
