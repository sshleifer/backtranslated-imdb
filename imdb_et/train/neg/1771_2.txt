It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only thing that is interesting about this movie is some of the great genre leaders and the king's own. The film has a great prerequisite, but it breaks the story for about 15 minutes. I made this film like Madchen Amick and I think she would have a very good career in the film.
