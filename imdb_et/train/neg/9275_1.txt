Apple IV (1991) was bad. Movie. In the late 1980s, I think leaders tested the forest (a medicine selected in the 1990s) because there is no other reason to explain it to the travert. Why did they even do that? T.v. Movie? What were they when the idea came to the disc? Did they even think for a while that this film was going to stick. Maybe they thought it could be a series? We never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason I didn't buy Omen's trilogy. They should have hit a few dollars instead of putting this "extra" plate out. Snot nosed instead of a punk boy we get a spooky girl around him. If the family had a stronger parenting skill, none of the demonic events that had appeared in earlier films would ever have taken place. These parents must put their feet down and make a real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best avoided at all costs!
