I had hoped that this film was a little entertaining, as did other genres. But it was flat and I couldn't find myself laughing. See it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rental and you need a movie to pass that time. But I don't recommend seeing it to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been funny, maybe if the script was better. Jason Lee can be fun and he will be here and there a couple of laughs, but the movie will fall. Just don't look at it. Leadership is weak, but what it is is that guidance is not so important. I think its main disadvantage is that it's not just very funny. Look at something else, don't waste your time.
