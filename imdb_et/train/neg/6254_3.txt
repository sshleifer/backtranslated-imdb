My friend was cast as an FEDS agent (not a resembling part). He brought it to the DVD to see it. It was "interesting", but it seemed very amateur film. Well done amateur film is. Really boring and poorly written. It was probably fun to do and be involved, but it certainly doesn't deserve to be widely released. Maybe they would enjoy it in Omaha, but this California girl was bored and honestly ashamed of my friend's involvement. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker has made or makes more movies, he should really try. You have a really interesting story and good participants. I'm sure it was a great learning tool for them. I wish them luck in the future and hope they can improve their film making.
