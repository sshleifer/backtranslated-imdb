"Mojo" is a story of fifties from London, a world of budding stone, violence and forced homosexuality. "Mojo" uses the 1950s filming technique, often seen in films that emphasize physical differences in our own time, but also represents dialogue in a very exaggerated way (due to the fact that speech was represented in films made during that period); I have no idea if people would talk out of such films, but none of the films made today and nowadays do not use such stylized language. Just like the stylish discourse of the 1950s scriptwriters would serve as a common transcript for the past, which thus seems to be a very distant country; and therefore emphasizes the concrete, not universal, nature of this story. "Mojo" has a strong performance by Ian Hart and is annoying by Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter is still struggling to create a post-traumatic career, but feels like a piece of the period, a modern film that is incomprehensibly structured in an obsolete idiom. .
