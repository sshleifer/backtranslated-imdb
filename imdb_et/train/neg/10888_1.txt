This movie is absolutely terrible. One of the worst films I've ever seen. The story almost doesn't exist, characters are full of stereotypes and Special-FX just laughs. The only remarkable thing about this movie is the appearance of Rapper Coolio as a police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie had to be a comedy, I didn't get that point. If you want to watch this movie, please take yourself drunk and prepare some good laughs ... especially when the first special FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like cheap trash movies: this movie is essential for you.
