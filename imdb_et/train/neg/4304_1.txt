This is a Serbian propaganda film made for television. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good; Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD." <br /> <br /> It's a message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to deliver a propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This movie makes it thick. </ br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs, General Draza Milhalovitch and his chetnics, rescued the Germans from 500 defeats in the US during World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to give Milhalovitch on Friday and set up a British Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed suit and as a result, after the end of the war, Yugoslavia was handed over to Communist Tito. <br /> <br /> US journalist Milhalovitch has been since the press. <br /> <br /> The film is part of an anti-Serbian propaganda campaign developed by George Soros and his international crisis group, culminating in the Kosovo War, during which NATO bombed Serbia by Serbia for totally false claims. "In Kosovo, the nasty Serbian" victims "are filled. The fact that there were no such mass graves and Albanians (Muslims) was not in Serbia in Kosovo is the fact that most of the media do not print. <br /> <br /> I chose to watch this movie because The description of one sentence on the video cover was interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine your disgust when I discovered that I was disappointed to rent another branch of the propaganda machine for Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead, this propaganda should somebody make a movie of the Clinton administration's unwillingness to come to Congress and the American people when it participates in the transfer of Iranian weapons to the Sarajevo Muslim government. <br /> <br /> I don't hold my soul in such a movie.
