I am usually a fan of the film in the eighties and early nineties, who now has a bee ... but this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was a true resilience test. Boys dressed as girls are made to die - but never so pathetically. Corey Haim's performance was usually abysmal, Nicole Eggert was not much better. It has no redemption features, even if you are the # 1 fan of actor / actor in this trash can - away!
