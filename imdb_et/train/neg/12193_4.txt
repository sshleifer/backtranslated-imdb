"Look, I know it can suck now, but the pain is temporary, the film is forever. Whatever you do right now, celluloid is burned all the time and thousands of years." ? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> It was originally Steven Spielberg's film, directed by several scriptwriters to adjust the scenario to better suit his themes. And so we have an uncertain family threatened by a fallen monster recently released from prison by Robert De Nirost. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "World of Worlds", dysfunctional family members to win the beast, when the beast is the father, are a lawyer who was unable to defend De Niro during the trial. <br /> <br /> In a typical Spielberg fashion, Dad kills a monster that undermines the family and is then immediately released from his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise, and almost every "father" figure on Spielberg's land, Dad calls for his father's commitment in the bittersweet code Spielberg enjoys. <br /> <br /> Finally, the picture was abandoned and the project was transferred to Martin Scorsese, who at that time tried to try his hand more at a commercial price. The result is undoubtedly the worst film in Scorsese filmography and ironically, its most enlightening. <br /> <br /> Artist failures or attacks are often very revealing, revealing the inner workings of their art. If the story does not work, the characters are not merged or the images are not nervous, we still have the inner core. This ?? The remaining carcase - this is the director's cinema. <br /> <br /> Now Cape Fear is an impersonal film, so we can't find any thematic link to the rest of Scorses' filmography ("You've already sacrificed me!" . What the film does is what his filmography depends on. See how Scorsese's camera whispering whispers back and forth, how it bounces smoothly on doorknobs and windows, trying to force tension and how its characters are hard and screaming for attention. But more importantly, see how the film has no spatial meaning. Completion of the film at the end of the boat is obviously at the sound stage, the street parade is claustrophobic and takes place in a larger context and the family house does not seem to exist anywhere. The picture doesn't just have a geographic idea, Scorsese can't create a movie room or create any spatial environment. The reason for this is that the Scorsese camera must always be related to its central character or closely related. To make the world around characters meaningful, his camera must focus on that character. You can take you around the French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you on the street and building up, Cameron can give you a chance to get to know Titanic, Scott can restore the city for a whole future, Lucas can give you an alien in the desert planet, and most other directors can create a textbook lesson that the textbook "closes the middle of the beat", but Scorsese can't do it. In her films there is no poetry, no real space. He's all about character. You break this gap, leave this boxing ring, taxi, look away from De Niros and everything collapses. He just can't leave this very documentary style of photography, which in some sense is a prerequisite for making a feature film. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to fix this problem with "New York Gangs", where space and kits become a central feature, but even this self-conscious spatial experiment sabotages by Daniel Day Lewis magnetism, the actor's Scorsese camera, a Scorese camera like a light bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10? Even if it's a general B-film, it's a ugly, vulgar look. Look at the matte land, unsuccessful tensions in tension, foolish rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown. However, we have Robert De Niro to get rid of it. De Niro, who gives his body to Scorsese as a tattooed Christ, gives the film the only great scene. Improvised in romantic order with young Juliette Lewis, she stays in her thumb and kisses her. Symbolic rape, the girl runs away, so awakened and marginalized for the sake of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so delicious from above, cannot be simply imitated by Scorses. To do this, you need a De Palma operative tone and baroque visuals. What about Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching one.
