This is a terrible disaster for the film. From start to finish, it's full of bad performance and even worse direction and editing. The only redeemable parts of the movie are some numbers from Streisand, because it is impossible to watch or listen to the parts of Kristofferson. The main problem with this film is that we do not see the character of Kristofferson at its peak or against the character of the strike. The first one should be seen in the fall and the second rise. The final strike number could have been one of the biggest finals in the film when it was properly targeted and edited. His face-to-frame story was a terrible mistake during the song. If there were wide images of the band, audience, and production, that number would have been dynamic and interesting. This film must be staged and edited due to the fall of the NYU film school. The only thing that can be worse is the wretched scenario. The ultimate musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even it is completely wrong due to technical decisions.
