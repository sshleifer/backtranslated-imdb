Do you want a great recipe for failure? Take the s **** y plot, add some weak, completely undeveloped characters and when you throw the worst special effects horror movie is known. Allow to bury for a week (the time that probably spent on this garbage). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that takes bad movies in dangerous and exotic low places. <br /> <br /> The film was completely blown. My words can't be passed on when the pain was to look. It's not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and joke about. This is not a 9th Space Plan. It's a long, boring and sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the greatest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. I depress me when I realize that people actually took time out of their lives to call this shit when you call it. But if again, if you have a bad direction, a bad story, a bad thing, to act is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a big, nasty turtle that you want to exist quickly, fear that a friend or loved one can see it somehow. In fact, I can somehow destroy a copy of each of these films, so it doesn't contaminate the thoughts of the filmmakers who want it. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me new respect for every movie I've ever seen. You've shown me what's really terrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are just dirty or boring.
