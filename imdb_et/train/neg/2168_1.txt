Reading the second review, I thought this film would be really good. I enjoy B-movies, but it can't even be considered like that. Photography is probably the only semi-decent thing in the movie. However, editing was much desired. It was very dirty and staccato. Who chose the music and the sound did a terrible job. The music was terrible, especially something about setting the atmosphere or the scene. If the actor had been better, they could pull out the film. Unfortunately, I've seen better action with porn movies. If you want to see a "B" vampire movie, see "Blood Ties". You have a lot more entertainment.
