It was a lovely movie until the end. One more despicable endeavor was to increase men and women at their own expense. The girl refused to listen to the meaning and logic and used her passive / aggressive character to control and establish her will to the man who ultimately gave her power and control over her relationship. It is no coincidence that he was sitting in the car behind the wheel of the rider when they were driving at the end after he had to beg for him and ask him to take him back. This film is a victory for all women who think they should be responsible for all people and control their relationships with them. For this reason, it was a despicable film.
