Usually I like zombie movies, but it was just bad. <br /> <br /> Good part: Girl's bottom girl swimming, Sonya Salomaa topless and Ona Graueri tennis when she ran in a dirty place. The bad part: too many video clips, too much slowing down the Matrix (it drags the action), it's not enough for blood and guts, bad actions, or story. The only other person in the theater was smart and left after topless swimming. Total waste $ 6 and time. I'll give him 2 out of ten.
