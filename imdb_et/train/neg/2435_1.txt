I warn you here: I decided to believe those reviewers who said it wasn't a movie in the usual sense, rather a psychological drama, so you should judge it and you're fine. I tell you that they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not completely; it is very disappointing if you are looking for momentum, they were right. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer wasn't too bad, I think it's not worse than usual; but what did they have in Billy Zane? Was it some sort of death for the producers? How do I make my movie a guaranteed flop? In this case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they really wanted success, why not someone who can act? Oh, and you can go to a scriptwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yeah, and the director who knows how to drive. <br /> <br /> Like the one who sat through this confusion, I believe he will redeem himself soon, I can assure you that he never did. Sorry, it could have been a good movie.
