This film was extremely frustrating. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. Mother, who is her main character, has everything but mother. OK, he was married unhappy and first put his wife and children. His wife dies. Then she goes to her son and meets the daughter who sleeps with her daughter and comes to sleep with her. Until the end of this part of the movie is fine. Not great, but it can be viewed. The boy is charming and who can blame him? OK, that your daughter does not sleep with a lover, but we accuse her of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> He's totally obsessed with the man. I think this is the part where I started not like the movie. She is always there who wants to rejoice her "old-fashioned" when she works at her son's house (I think it's the only thing she's ever learned), as if that was the only way she could get attention. The man is probably not very interested (in fact he seems to think he is sleeping with him for charity) and instead of being offended, he continues to fall asleep with him and he likes it as he becomes very abusive. "I want you to like it," he says desperately, if he offends him very badly. <br /> <br /> What I am outraged by in this film is the complete lack of self-esteem that Mother has for her. He tells Craig something like "I'm just a formless one" when they first sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to women. If it had been me, I would have bought a little item that would have brought me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
