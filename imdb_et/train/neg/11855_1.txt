This is one of those films that appear in the afternoon on the cable in two ways to relax the housewives when they iron. Action is the second rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to dream the whole movie. And God is helping Gina Gershon. His accent is too up. It sounds like a real English woman. It sounds forcibly and fake like his behavior. He should stick to what he does best, a lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays rock & role in the band and has a drug problem. Other characters are no better. They are two-dimensional. empty, coats and fools. How should we care for these people. At one point, Christy Scott has lost Cashman in Central Park. Really? Navigation in the central park is not that difficult. Just follow all of you. Not only do you care about the characters, but I hated them. The only reason I even missed this film was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor could not save this dying fish. Every scene is a typical romantic comedy price and nothing leaves us surprised. The script was terrible when it worked. If you try this fish, throw it back!
