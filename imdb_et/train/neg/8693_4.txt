I come from Dallas / Fort Worth and lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was so far away that it looked like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of one scene! Texas has no mountains. I think this happens when a movie that should be in Texas is filmed in Canada. Accents are also very bad. They would have had actors from Texas to play parts. There are many aspiring actors from Texas to Hollywood. But the film is really sad because it's a real story. I pray that the killer will be found and convicted. One good thing is that his death is now bc, now we have Amber Alert, which helps the missing children quickly after the kidnapping.
