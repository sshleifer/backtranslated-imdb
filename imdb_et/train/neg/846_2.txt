It must be the worst film I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw Michael Madsen was in it, I thought it couldn't be too bad because he's been in some pretty decent movie and he was a pretty fair actor. ERROR! No one should waste their time with this movie. I quickly sent it to 80 percent and I don't feel like I was left behind.
