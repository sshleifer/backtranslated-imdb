This film is probably a pathetic attempt to justify Mary Ann Letourneau's activities. To do this, they were 19 years old, probably not "to do it." There was no way they could have fired 12 or 13-year-olds because the scenes of love would have brought everything out (if they were even allowed to do so) - as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my nephew who made him a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of a pedophile does not have to include many children - all we need is one. <br /> <br /> I really don't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage. He had the responsibility to his students not to live. The reason is that he is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis and refused to take the medicine. So it is understandable that he did not think rationally. One hopes he will now understand his actions. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray she will have her medicine and thinking clearly. <br /> <br /> All this, Penelope Ann Miller was a completely convincing and perfect role for this role.
