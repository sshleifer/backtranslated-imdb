Finally, I have seen INCUBUS after waiting for 20 strange years to see and do well, it was definitely not time to wait. INCUBUS is strictly a fear film: an invisible killer / monster rapes and murder women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film goes like this: the movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; more blah blah blah; continuing blah blah blah; another killing (surprisingly ah?); blah blah blah etc. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red Baltic herring that was used throughout the film does not convince 5 years. And I thought the secret identity of Incubus was the moment I saw that character, so when the "shocking" surprise ended, I wasn't surprised or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept smiling days after seeing the movie. It's so stupid! <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is so numerous that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few extraordinary moments on this ugly flick. This is not necessarily due to the fact that it is good, but because it is so funny and pointless: the movie on the big screen shows rock-video moments with red leather pants, apparently having fake long hair. it was delivered with scenes from a girl who has been attacked in the cinema room by the cinema. The best thing I could say about this movie is the cinematography I really liked. But besides this, there is almost no value for INCUBUS except that it is unintentionally fun.
