The teenager, who seems to be all, commits suicide. It leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) to ask many questions ... and blame himself. <br /> <br /> Good idea, badly handled. For beginners this has been done before 1988 - mostly on television and After School Specials. In addition to some swearing and dialogue (hence PG-13 rating), it did not add anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve's efforts to act were really painful to look at. He's good now, but not in 1988. Apart from being dressed like a slipper and always seen as dirty, it was difficult to compassion. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring next to the movie. I saw the arrival of each scene and every "surprise" telegraph. I couldn't wait until this thing over. <br /> <br /> I have a vague memory of seeing it in the theater in 1988 and hate it (it was bombarded with BADLY). Almost 20 years later, it still seems sad. The subject is worth handling, but it has been done with much better action in many other films. It should be reminded of "ordinary people". You can skip this.
