I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh had to wear this incredibly incredible script within five hours (or long as it really was). Every element of this movie is incredible from the beginning. This film made me ridiculous many times, but they were mostly shocked that the director / writer assumed that we believed in many dirty scattered elements that tried to put together this film. <br /> <br /> The film's focus is Gray (Graham) and his questions are close. Things become interesting when he realizes that he and his brother are suddenly too much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, interesting. Instead of making this story credible and tasteful, director Gray leaves their ridiculous twists, which makes no sense at all. As an LGBT individual, this film seemed to be the coming of all heterosexual people. (I would insult if the writer is.) If there wasn't a nice chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which by the way was forced), I'd give it a negative 3-star.
