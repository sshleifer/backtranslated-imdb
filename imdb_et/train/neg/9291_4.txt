I can't believe that no official reviews of this movie would warn people that it contains two quite irritating scenes of sexual assault. It would be like our culture accepts such behavior simply as a sexual but not violent behavior. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks - as repeatedly attacked and pressured by a woman, these men are never held responsible for their actions or anyone else. One person is stopped from stopping the attack when someone throws him a dagger, but he is only reprimanding if "one cannot force a woman to love you", not "you should not force a woman to be sexually driven. The film is thrown by a woman. who let them be both qualified fighters and leaders, but the movie is defined by much more romance - characterized by the notion that human sexuality must include the imbalance of power in which men dominate the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use his fighting skills to catch He will never excuse them - rather, SHE seems to be excusing. In general, it is a frustrating and disturbing film with great cinematic art and some cool fighting scenes.
