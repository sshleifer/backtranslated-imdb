First of all, there are some good things about this movie, but it is all the clich√©s that are combined with teen movie. The advertisement of the movie I've seen has been a great emphasis on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actor and not as good a look as people are trying to do (not what it has to do with the film). And what about this view does he give to everyone? Maybe it's part of nature, but as I said, it works ... But writing is good. You know who it is during the whole movie, and you can almost predict what is happening but not irritating. I think this book, which is based on, is probably good when evaluating the plot line, but next time I read the book to find out rather than see it.
