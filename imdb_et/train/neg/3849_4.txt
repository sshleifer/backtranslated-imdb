Debbie Reynolds t-taps, jaws and yes, dancing their way through this ordinary thriller with a clearly made 30-hour atmosphere. Two women who put their sons in a murder attempt to start their own lives by launching a Hollywood dance school. The problem is that one of them suffers from neuroses. Can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier under the leadership of Robert Aldrich, led by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never have allowed Joan so much time to raise her things, and I can't imagine Bette Davis in her second role, dancing her heart. This is a purely fake piece of marabre written by sliding Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to attack the group!). There is no ounce of honest fun in an ash pack. * 1/2 from ****
