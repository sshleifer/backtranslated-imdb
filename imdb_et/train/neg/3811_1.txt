I hated this mess, every Friday it was a part of the tgif, and every week it sucked consistently into stupidity. If you want to see a funny watch "No On would Tell Tell", Candice Cameron and Fred Savage will play really fun, showing exactly why no one will ever go to a good film career after a terrifying TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate these kids and the bobsleigh has to jump to the bridge to make it crapfest. I've seen funner stuff everywhere else here. I'm writing 10 lines! See the "full house" to see how mankind offers art and entertainment the least.
