Probably one of the most boring films ever, badly worked and poorly written. <br /> <br /> SIDE Five students who were at the time of collective closure while on holiday, but one of them has designs and kills one, the main suspect is the horrible Groundskeeper John Hemmitt played Woody Roll, or it could be one of five characters. <br /> <br /> Doing so is not so bad not as big as Daphne Zungia who dies the way too fast and should have been the main heroine and the rest well pretty boring, although the main heroine Laura Lapinski is sometimes her charm and you won't lose him finally. <br /> <br /> KILLAD can't really why they banned it, mostly kill the fake, one man is sliced ​​in half at the beginning, which looks really fake, but others are pretty disgusting as one girl gets her head in the car by, one girl gets cooked alive and the other is burned alive. <br /> <br /> GENERAL Not very big slasher Ld has been much better
