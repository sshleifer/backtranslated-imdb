Richard Dreyfuss is indeed in this flick, but in a rather small part. He is not "obsessed" with the filmmaker - he is the business manager / accountant of the group. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke as advertised, unless the term "erotic" is used fairly loosely. I would not have considered watching a movie without Richard Dreyfuss without being of a greater character. Perhaps I could have realized that the famous 60th-century anthem Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne" had an artistic effect. Other than a brief drawing from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and an interesting visual reference to the completion of Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal", I found it a bad attempt to wake up to the symbolic elements and moods immortalized in "Last year's Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou . If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic troupe, there are many higher films from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" and "Cecil B. Demented".
