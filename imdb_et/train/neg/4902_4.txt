Almost in the same league as Yonfan's rather frightening Color Cake, Spider Lillies directs the point to a home that you can do at the cutting edge of the cinema without cutting or much cutting. This is a Taiwanese film that today and age is becoming a novelty at a worrying pace, but more than this tidbit, we find very little attention here. <br /> <br /> You should know that seemingly Spider Lillies is also a lesbian-style story, but in every aspect it is just plastic that easily attracts networked and gullible. In many ways, we have recently released Eternal Summer, freed from Taiwan. Then the gay men had a short shift, now we have the same thing. Zero Chou presents a story for your non-existent construction that is likely to thicken up to fifteen years old. They steered some of the attitudes of the art house, but ultimately it is the most ingenious, simply uninteresting idea. Hong Kong's corner is Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here's more sports events. Isabella Spider at Lillies is somewhat pleasant in her previous jobs, but most departments don't have it. Wasn't his heart turned on or the entire lesbian drama pitch didn't dare to his sensitivity. <br /> <br /> He is a Taipei tattoo artist who is shy, reclusive and responsible for the spiritual challenge of his younger brother, played by John Shen, who fortunately gives the film its only chance of blasting. The character of Isabella, strangely called Takeko, but supposedly out of Hong Kong, will soon capture the young Jade (Rainie Yang, who is pleasantly remembered by the Meteor Garden). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a number of complaints due to the withdrawal of her parents and general life. Of course, the grandmother's component works well and touches, but otherwise Jade as the protagonist is as immobile as her colleague Takeko. <br /> <br /> Two women share the past and much inadequately covered, Jade working as a webcam girl, while Takeko keeps her father's legacy alive with her unique tattoo attached to her hand. Jade also wants to get this great design that leads Takeko to explore the inner feelings of the problem with setbacks and a rather minimal discourse that is blatant. <br /> <br /> Are you at least interconnected? In short, no. They can be outraged and feel that they are making a nasty end, but just as the eternal summer reminded us of a long time ago, there is a gap between the display of sexual content and the perception of sexual content by ticket vendors. <Br /> <br /> This cynical seal of construction is the fate of Spider Lillies. With a weak story, ho-hum acting and a general lack of relics away from the theater with you, this one kind of makes the color of the flowers look good, think about it. At least there we got some Teresa Cheung mammaries. No, Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and should be captured even in the most expressive and meaningless list of GLB film festivals. inspiration. This is just as good as it makes it much easier to transfer Spider Lillies. Believe us, avoid this and you will not lose anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
