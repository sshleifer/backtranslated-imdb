"Visitor Q" is an unsuccessful attempt at black comedy that focuses on what may be the world's most uncertain family, including physical abuse from beating to murder, to ignite necrophilia on a nursing mother who cares for her husband and adult daughter, and so on. The film is so resentful that it has gained some critical praise and followed a small culture. However, for home video quality and slapdash production, Visitor Q doesn't even need curiosity. Genitals are blurred and sanitary facilities are clearly visible, make-up is terrible and everything else is the best. Waste of time. (C-)
