Well I think I know the answer to this question. For money! We've been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat's advertising and commodities that we almost believe there is something good about this movie. I admit that I thought the trailers looked bad, but I had to give it a chance. Well, I should have gone with my instincts. It was a complete Hollywood trash. Once again prove that the average person can be programmed to believe something they say is good. In addition to the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it was obviously starting with a moth-eating script. It is full of unsuccessful attempts with meaningless humor and terrible pastel landscapes. It jumps all over the universe without any destination or direction. Then it adds ............................ yes I say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel that I look every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the cat a medieval Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were also not prizes, but Mr Myers should go under the stone somewhere until he is ready to make another Austin Power movie. F, no letters, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save Your Money!
