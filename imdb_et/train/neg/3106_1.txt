When I compile a list of the absolute worst films I've ever seen, this movie is always there. He has no redemption qualities. He took all the will, and I would like to hide my blood when I have to sit it again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this? Let me tell you the story of your journey to see it in the theater. I am the only theater myself and I am loud, brisk, fairly restless teenagers who sat behind me. They were probably a good night on Saturday night and came up with some "laughs" on this "comedy". Before the movie started, laughs and jokes previewed and made loud comments with a great old time. It was extremely annoying; if they continued their unlimited enthusiasm for the actual film, I would have said something, but I felt tolerant and empathetic about my sensual fun, so I let him go. And they lived down after the movie. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" as a result of what it was not just me but the bunch. <br /> <br /> During the entire movie, one theater did not laugh in the theater. Not once. Not by itself, not tired children. Absolute silence, aside from the soundtrack. And when the movie was over and the lights came, we all, all of us, slowly, slowly, absolutely silent out of the theater. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the result of "comedy". Not laughter, no pleasure, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing film and not the smallest funny. Preachy, self-conscious, frustrating, but not funny. I think Mel Brooks "Blazing Saddles" is on the Funniest Movie Ever list. It is still absolutely blowing in my mind that the same gentleman may be responsible for quite possibly the least funny movie. In short: if you feel too happy, give this film a whirl; Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.
