(When do I ever study?) The NPR ecstatic reviewer made me think that this turkey was Kane another citizen. Allow me to let my spleen out ... <br /> <br /> I admit that the device, probably New York City, has never been so ugly and unpleasant. I am reminded that the 70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all smoking! If the plan was to get the marks down, then it succeeded. <br /> <br /> To make the movie work (at least in my simple rating), there must be at least one sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close and I couldn't wait for Nicky to finish. If the striking blow had hit Mikey, it could have created the most indifferent shrug. I think I'm a rube who doesn't lose "art" cinemas. Oh, well.
