what is under the surface, what is it? just a terrible movie is what other viewers rightly commented on, storms are just ridiculous. Shredding firewood chopped with growing rain? now it's wise. threatening? predictions? sexual tension? for those who read boring and viable, numb and viable and numb and ultra-pure. <br /> <br /> I want to tell the god mia sara about the shower room, but retrospectively I think film makers, having seen the confusion, realized that they had to put something in order to be half useful. so it just becomes another fight. do yourself a favor and skip it.
