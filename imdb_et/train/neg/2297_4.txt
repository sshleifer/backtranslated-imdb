I turn on 700 clubs once and only accept some statements - I am one of many believers whom most Christians are considered liberal and most non-Christians conservative. I vote in my mind and it is not usually a rep. or dem. - I don't think the 700 clubs tell people what to believe, but that it represents many older Christians who have grown up from a very conservative background. I think many people misunderstand what the 700 club is saying. it worships me to hear the name that calls either direction. I think 700 people in the club really love Jesus, but are so busy trying to vote people conservatively that they have forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus. Please do not understand Jesus, relying on ignorant individuals who believe in Him and also have our knowledge of them. Why do ARE people mean each other?
