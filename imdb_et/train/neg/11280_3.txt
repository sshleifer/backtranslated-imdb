This film is about the man's life wrong. His business has failed and he cannot impregnate his women despite several attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is complete chaos. It just doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes any sense. The story is so badly said that I just didn't understand it. This is a shame because the kits and costumes are well made and visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed throughout the film. But these redemption functions are still unable to compensate for the poor plot and the bad story. I'm surprised by the big names that the characters in this movie agreed to. It is a waste of these talents. This movie is very bad. Avoid it !!
