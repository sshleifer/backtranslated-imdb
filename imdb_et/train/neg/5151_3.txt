I thought it was a great idea, but boy, it was badly executed. We get a broad understanding of the complexity and complexity of the operations on the back of the exhibition, but there is virtually no difference in this. Manufacturers seem to have found no way to tell the story or "go through" the viewer. (What does not mean that they did not catch, but the presentation of the stages is related to the summary of the Ring Cycle, because the program narrative does not tell us anything about the physical installation of the operation.) <br /> <br /> We see a lot of things, but we are told little what people do and why. There is little point in who is who or how different production units fit and work together. For example, we hear a problem several times - then we expect it to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it will be resolved. But filmmakers usually simply cut down on something else (in general, the general footage of people pushing things or talking to headphones.) <br /> <br /> In general, the feeling of the film seems to be the image you want to see under the end of the credit, not something is worth its own value.
