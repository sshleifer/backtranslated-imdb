This movie is so so terrible that it turns the angels away. Shaq was trying to make other crossover efforts, such as his work with Shaq-Fu for NES and his range of unbearable rap albums and later epic earning terrible movie making that is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is no good thing to say about this movie. I saw it as a heap when I was very young, but I have to be an idiot because this film takes everything that is enjoyable for movies and tears it out. It's fun to mock. I saw it on Disney Channel some time ago and spent a few minutes in it. Although after it has been glimpsed, it is still astonished by its horror. <br /> <br /> When you see it on the TV, try it: check out the movie to remove all the scenes where Shaq uses its magical genie capabilities. When you do, it changes as a child who speaks to the child and kidnaps him to seduce. It's a little funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A terrible example of a movie. Don't do this movie if you don't want to mock it.
