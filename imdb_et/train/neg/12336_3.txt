I'll give it to five out of ten. All five brands are for Hendrix, who offers a very decent set on his last day. Unfortunately, the quality and editing of the camera is terrible! We have countless full-length frames from Hendrix, where he can do almost anything, maybe a pee? We don't see your hand on the guitar, which is the point! Are there also many pictures behind Hendrix? Hendrix seems to have three cameras, but the amateur fools are all working on them. The boy in front of Hendrix seems to be interested in slipping his focus on the stage, as if Hendrix was just disturbing on the guitar. While the back boy on the pair of chicks is more sharp than the actual work of the incredible guitar, which is the outflow of amps (sound recording thanks to Wally Heider), there are clips of student losers protesting Vietnamese and other tracks like a machine gun, a complete waste of film! If Hendrix had lived for another two years, Berkeley would be one of those things that would never have seen the daylight when full official release would go. One of the pearls that it contains is the incredible Johnny B good, but everything is pretty poor in a visual document that is a big man and worse for both Woodstock and Wight Island
