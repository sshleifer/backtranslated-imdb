I have two very big complaints about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. The fact that my local rental store is strapped, which is very clearly a soft core porn in the "temporary" category. (If I knew what it was, I wouldn't have wasted my time renting. And yes, this movie is a soft core of porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the film. No one in this film does anything that is either deviant or obsessive, not to mention the combination of the two. <br /> <br /> In fact, do three main complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. For some reason I watched the movie long enough to find another place in that list. Boy, I regret it. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This film is worthless on almost every level.
