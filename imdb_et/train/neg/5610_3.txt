This documentary begins with an interesting assumption - it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus, as usual, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, after we get to know it, the movie shifts completely and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity and focuses on quite a few simple targets. <br /> <br /> The writer / director clearly has some problems with the church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his release form. It would be interesting to see that the first 20 minutes are expanding, but the film as a whole is disappointing.
