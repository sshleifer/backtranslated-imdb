I was hoping for some in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other mission-related people who had been involved in a sensational voice overwhelmed by a jumping disaster over the worst tradition of television production. <br /> <br /> If you could express voice commands and make the program spin a positive test of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve the goal, it could have been great - but I feel like I have wasted around 60 minutes of watching 45 minutes of my life. I want them a minute ago.
