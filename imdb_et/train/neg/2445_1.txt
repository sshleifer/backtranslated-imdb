Hi, does anyone hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you are a companion to this movie, join the fan club! This movie was so incredibly bad when I didn't see it. I think it has to be seen, it is a bad way. Here's a clich√© invented for every horror movie ever. I am afraid it is very difficult to get a copy of this movie, but it should never be done in the top ten of the worst films.
