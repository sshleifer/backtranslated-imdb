Checking spoiler warning just in case. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen, Mazes and Monsters felt I was wasting 101 minutes of my life. The only quality of movie redemption was scenes that were trying to be serious, but just ended up funny because they were so bad. Evil dead someone? Unfortunately, M&M (luckily for us) failed to develop a cult and follow the trilogy. This film attempted to deal with a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks), experienced throughout the film. It ended with the fear of a video of stereotypes that helped fuel D & D in the 1980s with the Devil movement. /> <br /> PS - Even if the cover is interesting, so I think my brother bought it, it doesn't in any way happen in the fantasy field if you don't think New England or New York is such a place.
