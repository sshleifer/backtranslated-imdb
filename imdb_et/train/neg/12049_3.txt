"To Die For" box suckered me in - hissy hunky man and some laughter and sex promise. There was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon) who is eye-catching but not laughing and little sexy. enough to care for, so it's hard to imagine they care about each other. The error seems to be in the script, not in the shows; both parties do the best they can. <br /> <br /> The end is delicate and intact (well, not completely influenced; I felt it was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that is funny, "Parting Glances" is much better.
