Mix exotic tropical locations, babes in hostile attire, explosions, beautiful Dudley Do-Right clones, movie stars with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), little martial arts and sexy villainess (Tracy Lor. .Er, sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you think you're for a while. Not so! This is a tough TV movie, and although it likes to advertise it as a "Charlie Angels" deal, it's not nearly as good as the original series, or even scary, irreversibly stupid, recent C.A. movies. This abomination can best be described as a third-tilted Andy Sidaris film. Not so much fun as Andy's "hard ticket to Hawaii", although some fighting scenes are decent enough. Girls spend too much time posing and trying too hard to look at and it is annoying after some time. There are better genre things out there. Oh yes, and "babes" aren't as hot as they want to think they are. Terrible sound ... if that's there.
