You can't really go far if the original story is not that big. The assumption of a blood that needs a cap is simply buggy. <br /> <br /> The script is blas√©. Participants do not have much work to do. Costs were cut down in the desert to reduce costs. It is a trademark that if the background is desert, the film has no budget. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget is good when there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Champions of Blood" are examples of decent work that is not $ $. but this movie looks like they should have made their changes to buy a cameraman sandwich. Again, forgiving, if only the story doesn't suck easily. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie will commit all the major crimes: it doesn't end! It just ends as if it were on a business holiday for the rest of the movie. But the rest will never come. Just strange. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
