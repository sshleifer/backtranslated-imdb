really terrible ... head actress OK ... movie, plot etc was totally nonsense and inaccurate it can also be a sequel to well ... something it was little or no importance at Carlitos Way ... and should be avoided like plague any Carlito in a way like fans ... Gail does not really mention that he reaches another bird, does not mention Klienfelt, does not mention how he was caught, does not mention how he got to prison. .. they tried to make it original when it was lightning at the beginning ... but frankly I was looking for a zero sign ... unfortunately I had to appreciate it ... <br /> <br /> This terrible attempt to become the best film of the 90s ... usually it was about 6 and 2 hours wasted in my life ... for all this "action", it was really boring slow and predictable ... again for every Carltio Way fan to avoid this fiasco ...
