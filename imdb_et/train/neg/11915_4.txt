This obvious pilot for a non-productive TV series includes a young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesia who has some pretty unbelievable powers to use when a person's reversed demon is released from all over the world. CGI is equal to TV work and Appleby is OK according to amnesia, but it is hard to swallow as superhero. The familiar TV face of Richard Burg is passing by as an Appleby mentor, but he can't do anything to raise this staircase above average. From the very beginning, we see a bad sign of a flying daemon from the cartoon. The scenes where Burgi trains Appleby for battle are actually ridiculous. These are a bad copy of similar scenes in many other movies, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
