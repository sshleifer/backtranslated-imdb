It's not an all-terrible comedy, but it's very DULL. It barely laughs and wastes its rich production values. Close to the end is a nice moment when Fu Manchu offers his "nemesis" his elixir dose and tells him "You've been my worthy opponent and now we can start again". This scene, as well as Burt Kwouki at the beginning of the fun-filled camel, is the only memorable part of the film. (* 1/2)
