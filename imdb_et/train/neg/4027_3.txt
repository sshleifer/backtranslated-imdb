It must be one of the biggest Spanish films in history. The lack of this incompleteness and complexity and its complete political correction make it truly childish, only good / bad characters. The world is not like that, and good movies show complicated signs of opposite impulses, dilemmas, and so on. But what I hate most about this movie is Bola's friend's father. The director is trying to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys; Thank you, Achero. I'll give you a Nobel Prize for Literature.
