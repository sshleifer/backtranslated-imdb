This film begins with a harsh sense when a woman is tied and psychologically tortured. There is full frontal nudity, parts of dead animals, dogs licking nipples, woman losing control over the bladder. All are photographed in gray with cold color. Effective but a bit too much. Then we move on to see the BTK killer youth and the current and history of crimes. Tensions are completely psychological and the killer events that enter and talk to their victims' homes take quite a long time and it is horrible. Here, we don't see fancy or good images, it looks like taking pictures with your home camera. It doesn't look daunting, but so that seeing the offender for some time before their killing is quite unusual and chilling. What this film is not is no drama. There are some police scenes every time, but there is no excitement in finding them a killer. There is not much arc to this story. It could have been an effective psychological thriller, madness. Unfortunately, the movie is a real slaughterhouse film. It is scattered throughout the film and suddenly over and over again. Sometimes you do not know that it comes and there is not enough time to look at it. And I have to reject it. I'm all for low-budget fear films, but I can't tolerate animal suffering. It was unnecessary, excessive and comes without warning. I'm glad Lionsgate releases things that no one else is doing, but they should have passed on the film or delivered animal oil. Stay away from this garbage.
