The super sexy B-movie actor is another part, like the future of "Goodfellas" star Ray Liotta girlfriend in this office bomb. He plays Marion, he has only one line of dialogue, well, one word of dialogue actually. She shouts "Joe!" when Ray's character breaks the poor Pia Zador with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so bad, though it sometimes becomes funny, fun. Mystery Science Theater 3000 boys would love it! Check out the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia has a nervous break and all the hair edits and effects they do to show how bad Pia's character is. Pia plays an ambitious Hollywood scriptwriter in this regard. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah, of course. Pia can't hardly talk, let alone write! Pia is completely and completely confused about this silly role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen who is in the opinion of this cat! Rock is Glory!
