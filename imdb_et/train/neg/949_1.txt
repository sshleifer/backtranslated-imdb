I've never understood this exhibition. Action is bad (Debra Jo Rupp is a remarkable exception), the plots of most episodes are tiny and uninspired, the dialogue is weak, the jokes are awkward and it is painful to try to sit even half an episode. Moreover, the link between this exhibition and the 70s is extremely weak outside of the style of the dresses, and the landscape and background used at the exhibition seem to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old, funny scripts that modern laptops do. is dressed so that it represents an exhibition 20 years ago in the hope that it will get some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique much more efficiently and are actually happy to look different from this terrible pathetic pretext for the show
