If you like the usual Sly Flickas, which include top action, incredible stunts (incredible is not free here) and slowed down dialogue; you love this steaming mountain area. I had great hopes based on a trailer. I thought that Stalone would be forced to force the brightest people in his "outdated" days and to make an action film that would put a trusted hero in a credible situation where story, setting and (plausible) action would prevail. I desire action that is at least close enough to reality so that you can imagine the fear and excitement of such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects made at least one scene ridiculously ridiculous. Judge Dredd is better off just because you know he's going to the theater to see a comic book made in the movie. Character, setting, and everything else is not comparable to what we meet. Cliffhanger on the other hand turns the climbing guide to Rambos before you can say "yo, Adrian!"
