This is one of those films where I wanted to be at the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is, frankly, boring. What the story is, is very thin and you have to think a lot. The film provides prophetic camera techniques that seem to intend to produce migraine and looks like a student's film. Did I say it is already boring? If all the characters were suddenly dead at the end of the movie, I wouldn't care less because I had no emotional affirmation of any of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 4 minutes, but it was about it. This is the first time I thought it was going to be in the cinema during the production, but I thought it was going to get better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A movie that you could threaten naughty children.
