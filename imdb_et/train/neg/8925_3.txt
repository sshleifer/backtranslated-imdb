I never liked the Myra movie, I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at that time. Definitely, Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image, although I have to think about whether many people who really know the picture saw the movie and knew what it was - <br /> <br /> I looked at Myra FMC a few years ago and didn't think it would have been better over the years. Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books have a segment in which there is sufficient credit to place such large letters on what was then outrageous. But IMHO, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too foolish to be turned on and so busy trying to shock that it doesn't know, doesn't participate, or entertain ---
