Quite moderately even according to Monogram standards, this mystery (the Sphinx remake) has an odd fever that is not widely affected - you will see it in about ten minutes. The two wires have a nice wind-free dialogue from the start, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring because the villain (completely created by Lionel Atwill started out) and Warren Hymer's nitwit shtick is quite annoying. At the same time, Mantan Moreland, who is a caregiver, Nicodemus, is worth sitting for five minutes. You have to give it to Bill One-Take Beaudine; he wasn't much of a director, but he always strikes a routine programmer with some colds in vaudeville.
