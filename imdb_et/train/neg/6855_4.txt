Why can't a woman sleep in a movie without a strong man? The director of this movie dreams of running Tom Sellick at the White House. That's all he thinks. So why should he communicate with him on earth? It didn't add anything to the plot and served only the less well-off successful women. The only value that this tidbit had was "lovely we all slept with his wife". <br /> <br /> Also, the people who made this movie didn't follow the national conventions they were disappointed with? Incitement between the two main political conventions highlighted only their total ignorance of the application and election process.
