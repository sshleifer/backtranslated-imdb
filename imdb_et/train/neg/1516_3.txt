Though THE FLOCK has a pretty good way of working with veteran Richard Gere, and some of the right shots that can bring LAMBS days back to SILENCE, the film's breakthrough credibility and destroys itself against a failed plot. br /> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the safety department and is preparing to retire. His office is pulled by his substitute Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his work. And this work is not very fun. He monitors hundreds of sex offenders who have failed in their jurisdiction. Allison goes along with Erroll for many calls to check his "criminals" and learns that he is in dire need of retirement. But Erroll is good at his work even if his methods are not. He captures sexual predators and even has physical conflicts. Erroll justifies his actions by raising these deviant pasts. It is this "good reason" that puts the audience at some level of challenge, allowing us to see how brutal Erroll is and how it has touched (being too close to their work). <br /> <br /> When a teenage girl disappears from Erroll's "area", she immediately jumps to the conclusion that one of her flocks is being abducted by her. But how did he know? Is Erroll good in his work? Allison challenges her and Erroll pulls back. Their battles become so acute as Erroll needs this missing girl. <br /> <br /> Although the story was created, it didn't have any ustfit! I give credit to Richard Gere, who plays the character of Erroll very well. Fighting for retirement. Worried about everyone who is near her cattle. Frightened by those he is responsible for supervision. Frightened with himself, he has to do some things he does. The change in Gere's character depiction is quite large. But there's nothing more beside him. Some kits are okay (dark and dangerous), but so many other problems are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I'm the first to admit that stopping unbelief is a requirement when watching movies. But there are limits to this suspension. The greatest exclusion from these restrictions is the extreme crime scenes. Someone as careful as Erroll would know that moving the body would be a huge no-no. Or run through the crime scene. Or the evidence is moving. It went further and damaged the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Another harmful part of this movie is that we never get to Clair Danes' character Allison. At the end of the film, he is almost left aside and we can never say what his will might be: does he stay or leave? Does he get like Erroll when he's left? It's not a terrible movie, because it touches some awkward moral land, but the whole story has to be tightened.
