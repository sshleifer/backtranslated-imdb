How did it ever come about? I generally like sci F / Bigfoot, regardless of movies, etc. . but I still expect them to be written with no such cheese. The effects were sad, the lines were sad. Avoid at all costs. I just ended it because it was wrong (I was looking for a Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson - it's not seen yet). The idea of ​​the movie is actually good. There was a lot of potential here to make a very small movie. I just don't understand how it looks like. Go talk to film / art / English students at every high school and find people who can write a better script.
