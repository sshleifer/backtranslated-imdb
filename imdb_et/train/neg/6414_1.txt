It's a much worse cr4p piece I've seen in my life. It was barely worth it. It was not at all scary (if you were not screaming as loud noise and screaming?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar must stop with these sh1ty horror films. I think all the other cinema members agreed with me when I called "SHITE" when the credit rolled. <br /> <br /> This is my worst movie list: <br /> <br /> 1. Back 2. Salon Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> Reason I Made Silent Hill 3, is because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was absolute cr4p. Likewise, there was no point in having a cabin fever, but the return went beyond that list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever
