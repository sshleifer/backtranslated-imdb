My how powerful have fallen. Kim Basinger is a great actor, but he was sure to play this role. This movie is bad for one reason: logic ends. He looks like one of those films that would have been satisfactory for all the holes in the plot if it came out in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it just seems really stupid. It's the worst thriller I've ever seen, and I've seen a bone collector and twisted. <br /> <br /> Story Details Della (Kim Basinger) simply gets a gift from a shopping mall to buy a robber gang that eventually kills a policeman who came to help him. Since then, these idiotic ghosts have been sent off through the abandoned street, and they are released one by one with a toolbox full of tools. As I said that this movie jumps through the logic every step of the way, and except for Kim Basinger, it is bad for the TV. Hell, this pseudo-thriller is bad for the TV. How he kills all those politically correct thugs (1 Caucasus, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American who come together to steal a Caucasian woman. Do you just don't love America?) How he killed the Spaniard, made me hysterically laugh. The sex world, where the main hood was, was so outdated that it shook your head. I recommend it only to lovers of bad movies and someone else. No one else, especially the fans of Kim Basinger, could have this flick. You don't want to see the actor you respect in the movie, what's it bad about now? Of course not. You were warned.
