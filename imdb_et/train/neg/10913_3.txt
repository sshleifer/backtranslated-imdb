Marvin (Rob Schneider) has no ingredients to be a policeman, which is his lifelong dream. But his happiness will change if he has a car loop (very bad) and the doctor finds it. Your doctor must use organs to use for reuse. After that moment he starts to behave unconsciously and becomes the best policeman who could ever be. By this time he understands that the changes and instincts of his animals are beginning to take over his human side. Meanwhile, she finds a nice girl and tries to be the perfect gentleman, which means she has to control and behave civilized. I'm not Rob Schneider's great fun. In fact, it's his first movie I've seen. But I can just say that he is the best loser of the loser. (See his part Ally Mcbealis, pretty funny). There are some good parts in the movie, like her flirt with a goat. In such films, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is fine if it is not taken too seriously. But very sad to see that such films are very good at the cash register. The animal is not the worst film I've seen so far but can't get more than *.
