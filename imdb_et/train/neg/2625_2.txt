This film has worked terribly, written, staged and produced. But it's so campy it's actually semi-traceable. It's SEMI traceable. <br /> <br /> The story (little is) makes virtually no sense. The Barney drum character is the only true comic relief in the film and it gets tired in about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many Canadian supporting paints are available in TV commercials. None of them did anything else I knew. And, of course, Sly Stallone's even less talented brother ..... = <br /> <br /> Trivia: It was filmed almost entirely around the small village of Claremont and Ont. (about 20 miles from N. Toru) I knew many local attractions / junctions / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was now filmed with a broken "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was demolished.
