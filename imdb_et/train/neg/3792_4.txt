I've seen many nutcracker productions. Maybe I was watching this film from the striking point of the theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people in the ballet choreography for a particular business find that this production is impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective, I found everything from design to choreography to be a "film." No traditionally "weird" and impressive costume didn't look what they were supposed to be (ie, candies didn't look like candies, rats didn't look like rats, but rather chocolate kisses,) worked weak. too much for the screen, and choreography just didn't do anything for me. This will make the whole exhibition the best (at best) as if it were meant not to be set aside from other production. But remember, again, it's a theater manager, not a dancer or choreographer from an artistic perspective, but a straight male theater director.
