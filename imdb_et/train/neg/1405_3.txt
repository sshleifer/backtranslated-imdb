"Damsel in Distress" is definitely not a better musical by Fred Astaire. But even Astaire's bad movies always had good moments. <br /> <br /> "Damsel" is Astaire Jerry Halliday, an American musical star, who has a personal appearance in London. She meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heir who hops off the back of the cab to escape the astonishing mobile. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes that Alice is a rich aunt forced marriage. She is trying to save her from her family's country house, but soon she will discover that house workers are making predictions for her husband Lady Alice to marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), a busy butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), a bratty house boy, each time alternating and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> Music has many problems. First is P.G. plot based plot. Wodehouse (who wrote the manuscript). The story is slow, painful and nervous. When Fred doesn't dance, we have to endure endless tedious scenes (a) from Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert, who associate them and each other. <br /> <br /> Butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are the one-dimensional characters of the stock criminal, the guys you just want to hit. You want them to get off the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers in the absence of normal partner Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is the leading female in this film and is in musical form. He has little to do with his work, except for his lovely face and a beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are on the ride as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. Duo adds some essential chemistry to the plot and Gracie has some funny features, but she is also annoying occasionally. <br /> <br /> The direction of George Stevens's film is not well done. Sometimes cinema is terrible and out of focus. There are a number of trips on the extremely blurred streets to convince the audience that we are in London, not in Hollywood. (They have to use tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin are terrible and have become classical vocal norms. And, of course, dancing in the film is extraordinary, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But musical and dance numbers are badly used and poorly staged. Sometimes it seems that singing and dancing have been cast because they have the time to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers appear randomly inserted into the curved plot. (At one point, the polisher goes out of the manor house and breaks the operative's solo for no apparent reason.) The numbers include:  "I dance and I can't bother now" - Fred dances well in full blurry London street. He makes a cuddly "spinning" with a rolled umbrella - but the number ends too fast when Fred jumps on the passing two-storey bus. (Broadway music, "Crazy For You", Harry Groener made a much better version of this number with a group of girls in the choir.) George and Gracie are a step by step with Fred, but the number ends badly when everyone strikes each other for no reason. <br /> <br /> "Strong Upper Lip" (fun house number) - a fun house in the amusement park, Fred, George and Gracie are dancing with a rotating floor, a rotating barrel and a fun house with mirrors. This is the best number of the movie, but it sometimes becomes somewhat repetitive. <br /> <br /> “Things are looking up” - Fred and Joan Fontaine make the back of their country's manor house with their movie number. Fortunately, it is a very simple dance number, because Joan is not a big dancer. <br /> <br />  "Misty Day in the City of London" - Fred wanders through a foggy mansion around the day. when he first met John in London. Sometimes he sees that he is not sure how he is going to mist - like a musical number. <br /> <br /> “Nice job when you get it” - a great song that has been misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred pulls the choir of brightly singing singers who sing this song. Every time Fred joins, the other singers look at him if they want him to leave. (Again, Harry Groener made this song a better dance song "Crazy For You.")  "Drum Dance Number" - as Fred and Joan are attacking, Fred must stop and make one final dance number while the group drums. As usual, this is a great dance number. But there is no need for it, except for the movie extension. <br /> <br /> The film's most mature moment is when Fred decides to prove a great stone balcony in his terrain to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. When he jumps out of the balcony, he finds a trapeze that is comfortably placed - that's right, * a trapeze * - hangs from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather a cascade of Fred dressed up) grabs the trapeze and swings from the ground. <br /> <br /> You only need to have a DVD for dance numbers, but you owe the debtor who invented the Fast Forward button on the remote control. With the >> FF button, you can skip the movie between other boring scenes to access the dance numbers.
