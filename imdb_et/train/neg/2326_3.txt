Dr Mordrid is terrible. I do not recommend that adults or children see it if they have not already kidnapped the murderers. There's so much slag in this movie that it's my yes. Eyes are the stars in the sky. Only the devil himself could have imagined such an evil thing. I rented every copy I could from the local video shops and crushed them with a 5-pound crucifix. This film should remain in the basement behind the fourth dimension with all the other hellish animals in hell. There's this movie. I recommend that if you want some scandalous entertainment, go and rent all the dogs to go to heaven or angels outside. These movies are worth it. If you want to sin and love horrible movies, you have to look at dr. Mordrel.
