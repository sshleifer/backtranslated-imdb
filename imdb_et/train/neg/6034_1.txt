Oh my where to start ... this movie was just terrible. Writing was bad, acting was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in a mood for a scary movie, but it certainly didn't get it! I thought it would be decent enough, because I'm not picky. I watched several bad fears in the movies. In fact, my goal is to see all the horror movies, no matter how terrible they may be. At one point in the movie, I made a comment about "corn syrup blood" and the special features that they actually admitted it was Karo syrup (brand name corn syrup ...) The movie had all the things needed to be a horror movie (Blood, Nudity, Mad Killer, Fools), but it was just completely missing to make it really good. Writer should either take some classes or just give up!
