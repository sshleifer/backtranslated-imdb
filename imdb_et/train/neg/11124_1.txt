In general, I am not concerned about the film's violence or a large number of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All of this is very good with me and the film brings us a lot of the above. Especially beautiful pictures of the lake and nature, good characters, good direction. This movie can be voted as a good movie. But it has been broken for two reasons, and both reasons for this film are simply nasty. <br /> <br /> First, there is violence against living beings to make this movie. Not movie violence, I'm talking about real violence. This violence alone can be justified, if not, and this is the reason number 2; the film's message was not just self-awareness of the attitude of women towards women. Not that we all have real turns with women (men respectively). But the movie's summary destroys it all. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Our "heroine" finally dies, (here's your hand when I remember correctly that I saw this movie years ago and it raged me, now the boy with the new movie I I'm definitely not going to look at it) and is now more clearly depicted as a natural demon that grows over him, especially his sex. Of course, this is the leader who "kills" the female heroine. Women must die, especially when men are interested in their sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. ** At the end of the spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, all that maybe would be good for me if the director had had his own opinion. But to use great images, artistic trends toward living beings, to say that men can scare women and men are cruel to women. It's not just enough. I knew that when I saw this film, it would be a good critique of filmmakers, eastern and artistic, and any approach. But for me, this movie is just completely broken.
