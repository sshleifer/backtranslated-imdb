John Pressman (Micheal 'I shoulda named Ditech' Lerner) works correctly with the doctor. Her mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) is hypnotizing her to people who see her being abused. But it turns out to be a movie in the movie, but the line will soon be blurred when John goes to kill the cinema. Doing the man watching the movie, do the same. Lerner is right over it, but Zelda repeats the dialogue again and again. It quickly gets annoying. But not as annoying as the two girls who watch the movie in the movie. No, what we have here is the worst comforter: the art house. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
