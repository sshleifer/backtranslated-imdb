This film was a messy garbage. You never knew what was going on. The characters were badly written, and they were mostly atypical, except for Gus (which was mastered by George Eads). I hate this movie, but if compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula Curse) he should have won the Academy Award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and sticky film. Lifetime you have sunk to a whole new low. Someone has to make sure that this director never works in movies. It also had to be a horror movie because it was much more fun than scary. Shame on Life, for shame.
