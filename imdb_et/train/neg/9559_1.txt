I'm trying to use words to describe it .... <br /> <br /> I saw an original that was good in its own way, but then I should have feared the sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was "afraid" when I picked it up, but now that I saw it, I have to say it's even worse than I thought. Why are these movies still getting money, but my mindset. Let's start with the actors, they aren't all that good, but it has to be said that some are turning their heads because they are just terrible. But what can an actor do with a script like this. It tries to be a copy of the original only this time, when the places have changed, any story is lost and any attempt to actually come up with something that has not been done before will fail. In an effort to make it up-to-date, they try to make it exciting by using the whole "big brother" theme, but it's been outdated for a long time and offering something like a filler from the start and the end. An attempt was made to try to record a movie by making tons of references to the '83 original, but it ended up being just funny and sometimes a little sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I don't think about anything, do it ... look at it or play Frisbee ... with a DVD .... yourself. It offers you as much fun .. I promise
