"Don't Drink Water" is an incredibly bad film. It is based on Woody Allen's 1966 Broadway game. It stands for Jackie Gleason, a comic book "The Honeymooners". Director Howard Morris has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and has made an animation mark (he has expressed Gopher "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) What went wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is too effective to work. Allen's original game was linguistic, so it worked on Broadway and Allen's 1994 remake. R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock will kill the premise and make too many changes to the original game. Making Gleason's husband in this version, when she was the heady woman of the original, is just one example of why it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Operation is not much better. Gleason does the best with the material, but it doesn't save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a subtle actor, as he showed "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His abrasive personality could have worked here, but the sad script doesn't even give him the opportunity. Damage. The Estelle Parsons airy woman will drive you in 20 minutes. See how fast it takes you to strangle her. It is also a disgrace because he is also a good actor, having turned two extraordinary performances with "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel". None of the other actors are particularly good. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this movie so much that he made a film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson). They can capture all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. This is finally the video after a long battle for rights. Go out and find this version. All of the 1969 originals are good for removing unwanted visitors who cross their greetings. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of the four stars
