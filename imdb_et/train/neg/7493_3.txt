I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at Nuremberg on Dutch television yesterday. It starts very slowly, the background of the Nuremberg trials has become clear step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but in the first few minutes the spectators get the most shocking, terrible video I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is important that people see such material (although I disagree absolutely with people claiming that the age limit is not available to children for such material), but this film was completely ridiculous. It was only meant to improve the effects of normal TV series. It was designed for an audience that is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to torture us with well thought out scenes, an inspiring dialogue or an interesting point of view, the audience is tortured with the terrible images of the skin and bones camp detainees. It does not show any respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
