When I first saw this movie, I thought it would have come from my childhood - it's very fun and at times humorous, and actually it's a pretty good story, but it doesn't have the serious "romantic chemistry" shown by Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins able to provide. I have to note that Walter Matthau is part of Albert Einstein and his performance is extraordinary, but that is the only exception. This film seems a little forced, the board has no content and yeah, the music is ridiculously terrible, it didn't make me feel good. But if you don't expect smart, well-designed comedy / romance, it may be fun, as I said ... should be in the children's section. Einstein and his buddies are a timid, almost tense effort by Tim Robbins to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very controversial film, but as long as it is not taken seriously, it can be the right movie.
