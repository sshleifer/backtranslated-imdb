One of the films from the 1940s, starring Kay Kamer in the hustle of music. The orchestra leader and the radio star (and the eternal brotherhood of the college) is Kyoto, a forerunner of Spike Jones, who blocked his guests and was happy to support his joyful group of musicians. He has been hired for a birthday party to play in a gloomy mansion, a type where poison ducks imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. Shindig is a disguised judge, a terrifying professor, a malicious swami, a lot of giggly women, and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures. Songs (Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are not something to worship, and neither is too confident about Klauser who pulls it up with elbows, which turns ten years ago in 1940. * from ****
