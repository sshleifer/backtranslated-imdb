It is unfair to describe this film as a garbage. At least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby. This flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon is able to provide an excellent opportunity, so no doubt the IRS was settled when he agreed with this terrible scenario. The story of "Hollow Man" mad scientists has been said before, they have been told better and have been told without so much ridiculously expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects seem to have been built around transparent anatomical dolls for men, women and dogs that could be purchased in the early 1970s. In the United Kingdom, they were marketed under the title "Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)", which may have received the title of this film. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, terrible script, non-existent graph. <br /> <br />
