Watching this movie is like eating habits other than meringue. Initially, it looks good, but ultimately NO gives satisfaction - not. <br /> <br /> The plot is a confusing confusion about the toy factory and the forces of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic piece and Robin Williams this movie is still so bad? This is because the picture is a look that has no substance - just like the terrible picture of Popeye, Williams made his film at the beginning of his career. The film must cost a fortune, but perhaps there was not enough money to hire school teachers who had graduated from college. <br /> <br /> Film is a unique joke that continues and continues and continues. I really am not sure why it was first done - it was definitely not some sort of entertainment.
