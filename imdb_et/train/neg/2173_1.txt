If you rent a movie titled "Destroyed the Year 3000", the probability is good if you know what you are getting into. I myself were sold with promising descriptions of "nucleus mutants", "moto-psychos", and of course "destroyers", which are all around the apocalyptic shepherd on the back of the film-keeper. a graveyard that creates all sorts of chaos. Allow unpleasant hijink and low budget buffers - at least those hopes for this "movie". <br /> <br /> Now I like the terrible movie from time to time and if you read reviews about Exterminators for 3,000 years, you probably do. Nonetheless, I appreciated this movie as "1 (terrible)" - not because I totally hated the movie, but because it is one of the most legitimate terrible efforts in making the movie I've ever seen. Dialogue, actor, cinema, sound editing, editing in general, plot, etc. - everything is worthwhile, which must certainly be due to the low expectations of the spectators. <Br>> <br /> So what's really good about this bad movie? There are several that my ring gently expresses "quality kills". High-quality killing, for those few who are not familiar with this phrase, is not a hard and fast perspective, but generally it refers to a particularly frightening, creative or ridiculous fashion. <br /> <br /> Exterminators In 3000, the fair offer of "dialogue-so-bad-it-turns-funny", a big part of which is played by Crazy Bull, the leader of the unhappy motor-voice, headed by the head, who by the way kills the most quality if you hope the nuke mutants have big things, think again, they're basically playing a zero part ... shucks!). The crazy bull, however, is all you could ask for in the b-movie moto-psycho. Shakespeare's paraphrase and strangely PG-style insults are all he knows ... and it's terrible. <br /> <br /> Despite your high-quality killings and poor dialogue, if you are looking for a really fun bad movie, Destroyers of the Year 3000 are somewhat disappointed that its limited to things that are stupid and outdated special effects, high-quality killing and bad dialogue, no just enough to justify the complete property, which mainly comes from forty minutes or so, where the audience is forced to follow the characters of long and boring cars and sequences of long desert hobby ... All in all, it's a pretty terrible movie, but hey, it's not 2000 death.
