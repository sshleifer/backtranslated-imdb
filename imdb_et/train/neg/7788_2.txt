I've noticed how all the other comments in this movie suggest how it is "healthy" and "fun". These people have to come out of the house more often. I don't know why they shine on their coats of arms, meaningless and pointless. Pat Boone has no ability to act, and his failure is overcome only by his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (another reason to deny the cunning practice that causes talentless models to the unsuspecting moving public, a mistake that is unfortunately still present). Good support (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) tries to understand this somewhat, but without results. I noticed that the two directors shared the credit, although "credit" is not a word I would use (neither is a "director"). With regard to "healthy entertainment", there are many films that cannot be tortured by your loved ones, forcing them to sit. Find one of these movies and skip it.
