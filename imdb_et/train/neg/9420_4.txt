Subsequently, until 1973, much better is Cleopatra Jones' black actors Tamara Dobson, who returns to his signature role as a chic, super-tough drug agent, breaking the heroin cycle in Hong Kong. The Blaxploitation action-flick and the kung-fu B-film cross-stitching are fun at first, but finally flags. The fight is on the battlefield right now, and Dobson himself seems less energetic than before (he is still sexy and he puts his comic dialogue with a unique spin, but this environment may be too much for him - he is imprisoned). Stella Stevens plays beauty this time; he's good but can't fit his predecessor with Shelley Winters. ** from ****
