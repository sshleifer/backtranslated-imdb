"Guy Thing" tries to grasp the "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents" but goes beyond the editing of these two movies. Luckily I rented it for 5 days because I couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is decent and I liked scenes where other guys automatically cover Paul's mistakes (the savior-checker was great), but writing the script is absolutely terrible. Dialogue drops gradually from most of the time, and just when you think things will eventually lead to the track, it is useless to be meaningless. In addition, how many toiletries does one film really need? <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, slapstick's humor is great when it's wisely done, like the other films mentioned, but this movie just doesn't go unnoticed. Too bad when I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate was great), but even that didn't help me sit down on this terrible movie. Save your dollars and rent again for "Mary".
