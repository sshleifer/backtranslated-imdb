After I sat down on this manure, I thought my husband and I knew it was actually a test result to see if a computer program could create a movie. It was hopeless and formal. But the US film propaganda thrown into the face of the film proves - disappointingly - that it is human work. Call me a conspiracy as a theorist, but cite like: "We have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it," it seems like ways to justify such activities as the invasion of Iraq, etc. use the Declaration of Independence as a negotiating board, where straight face made me and my husband know if all Valium was cast before shooting each scene. The "justification" behind each turn of the plot and the new "clue" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a coin bonus flip-flop, where everyone who took part was Dr Whatever-Her-Name. He has clearly seen in the film, but they felt the need for "Dr." his character's title to give him some difficulty. At one point, Cage's character says, "Have you ever closed?" and the camera is placed in front of him so he can see his hand as he is a child. Really grotesque. The only advantage of this movie was that it was so amazingly bad, you could laugh at some of it. The really frightening thing is that most people who watch the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy.
