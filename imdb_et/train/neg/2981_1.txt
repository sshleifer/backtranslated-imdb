This movie was recently released in the US on DVD and finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find pearl. It was accompanied by an initial preview of the theater by other Italian horror classes, such as "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the previews of this movie were the best. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" is strangely connected to the notorious Lucio Fulci "ZOMBIE" franchise, which began in 1979. "," ZOMBI 3 "consists of a thread plot and a handful of extremely bad players who hold it in a" horror "trash can hardly. > <br /> At the moment, the plot includes some hidden military operation with a number of intuist scientists (i.e., an idiotic man and his stupid female sport) who develop some sort of chemical name "Dead" that should be animated by the dead. I do not even remember the study of "death" in REASON. EXIST seems to have only to destroy the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing this movie to laugh at the "star" of the festival. death one "dead body (whom I swear like Yul Brynner) and after injecting into his system he sits upright and his head explodes! Sound effects are also quite fun - when the body of the body turns green with a mucus, you may hear a "paper wrinkle" sound. The "Death One" toxin is transported outward and is a hidden group of thieves with whom one leaves them, but gets infected after cutting the exposed vial. <br /> <br /> The boy turns into a zombie, but not until he makes his timely escape to the cheap motel, infects the humble porter and murders the servant by pushing his face in the bathroom mirror (!). Its military fishing and immediately acting before "removing" anyone who is unlucky to be in the "contamination zone" and turn the motel upside down. They find an infected thief and burn their body just to infect the flock of birds that fly over the stack of chimneys (!). <br /> <br /> We cut down a group of men who left the army listening to the "stormy music" that came out of the small smelly boom box, while grabbing the slutty girls' load, leaning out the window and showing their cover. Can anyone say "zombie food"? We also have a girl and a boyfriend who drives by car, who stops to check the group of birds on the road ... the same birds that were infected with "zombie" smoke! <br /> <br /> Birds are attacking the boy and the girl is driving down an abandoned gas station to find water. It's one of the most incredibly fun moments of the movie. She walks around this old dirty, rusty, and obviously abandoned building where she still asks, "HELLO? ASKING HERE? ASK, I OR NEED WATER!" He meets a group of zombies, one of which is chained to the wall (!) And the other slides into a machete. After a little bit of hacking and falling to the ground, he escapes, but not before he blows with his lighter gas station. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, birds are attacking the hooks of a whore trailer and one girl gets tired and infected. They all pull into the same motel where the original infection occurred, and this is where the second most fun moment takes place on film. After a few hours (most of the day), the same motel is now crammed, wine-growing is all over it and looks like it has been abandoned for years. Anyway, what better place to refuge than this particular building? Needless to say, the group is starting to break down, as many people leave together to find themselves in an astonishingly silly situation with a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third most entertaining moment concerns a man and a woman who are looking at the abandoned village, of which a woman comments, "This place is DUMP!" Then he goes to get "push" the balcony by the zombie in pirahna (?) Infected with water where he has legs bitten and becomes a zombie within seconds! Meanwhile, his friend has returned to a motel who has received an infected and infected hour, still a Zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has too many contradictions that make this movie too foolish for words. For example, the "zombie" time of infected people is very different. Sometimes it takes seconds, otherwise it takes time. Some zombies are running, others are dragging their legs and really walking slowly. Some even kung-fu are moving, while others hide people as a hay surprise. Some zombies are even talking! The most fun moment is the infamous "zombie head in the fridge" that "lifts" the air in the middle and "attacks" the foolish man who is looking for food. Funny, her girlfriend pulls her throat if it's the "stop" counterpart (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me was the story of people killed by zombies. We never see them when they return to the zombies, in fact only those we see "zombified" are the birds and one girl biting their legs. Besides, I was at least expecting that the couple who were killed in the kitchen and / or who had been killed by the bridge came back as zombies. It is also amazing that these zombies only take "some bites" and then move on to the next victim. The most ridiculous moment was, of course, a zombie fetus. Pregnant women who are infected are in the hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" is trying to offer a child (!) And her face is pulled out by the zombie before her head is pressed into the woman's stomach, where the hand breaks and starts to break the rest of her face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all characters are the perfect stereotypes of this genre. Megalomanic Military Officer, pathetic useless lads screaming to kill, obvious characters who have been killed (ie, see how a man rides behind a chicken!) I think this movie is really comedy. There were a lot of ridiculous scenes, such as a hand-grenade-fired shelter (probably a scene where the entire budget was spent) and a weather picture where a man shouts, "I'm a threesome. VERI!". The costumes are really bad - the same zombies will appear again throughout the film, wearing the same "Asian-style" clothing that can be found in Bruce Lee's movie, and be with a blue 60's skirt, a motel girl. she and her boyfriend got into an infected person. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie opens the door as usual for an apocalyptic story. Radio DJ, who tells the whole film, turns out to be a zombie and warns its listeners from the "end of the end", while the two survivors are in a helicopter. Hardly "DAWN OF DEAD" when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie makes a lot of laugh. Gore is minimal and what is there is very convincing, not to mention unimaginability. Normal black blood, green ulcer and green moss "zombie make-up". "ZOMBI 3" makes a good vacation for a night of sleep or beer and popcorn. In addition, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
