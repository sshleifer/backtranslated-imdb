This is a story of a young woman she loved and married after she got pregnant; did he open himself against him and his whole family through black magic? which is not disappointing, but does anyone do it. Good product value of the horror shock in Thailand. But blissful scripts never create a relationship, the director approaches the material in the usual way, and the final act loses the sympathy of the viewers to the victims when logic is blown. At one point, the character has the primary opportunity to simply kill the dead and instead rises up and runs away without picking up a weapon. Bad Writing? you are in it! <br /> <br /> Some icky gore effects, including a truly tasteless late-fetal body and a man who died out of his stomach by hundreds of live eels. Recommended only for genre graduates who just have to see every horror movie produced in Asia in the last 15 years.
