The plot of the "Game House" is the strongest of it: a successful author and psychologist are connected to the gang of grapefruit, but when he discovers the part of his evil that enjoys what they do, he finally gets hold of it. It's about a pitch: but somebody has to take responsibility for having it done with dolls. It must be directed by Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a diverse and fairly stable TV and film career so she can't do it all the time. She should go a little, cool, controlled by a professionally computational, wicked woman with fun, as the beige dresses (which she seems to have been wearing for three days straight, including underwear) on the floppy blossom. But everyone seems to be telling their line the same truncated, exactly; I imagine that Mamet wants to make sure that his snapshot script failed to respond. The impact is disturbing and violates the atmosphere of mystery and intercourse that it is likely to try to create. Sometimes the game house loses all the connection between how people actually behave or speak, and it simply becomes a mechanism for withdrawing a plot. Also, the cumbersome vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn't help. The end result is that the only entertainment is finding a result and the sooner you do, the faster the bored robotic, two-dimensional performances. And they smoke too much !!!
