The film is almost ridiculous with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters, who have been convicted of murders. After a terrible fame after the trial, two women picked up and left NY for California to open and sing and dance to the Shirley Temple girls. <br /> <br /> From the start, it turns out that Reynolds has made a mistake when he took Winters to California. Winters play a deeply religious woman who seems to be getting out of her rocker. Even worse, women living together will get dangerous phone calls. Reynolds, who puts the blonde on a wig, will soon be a novel by one of his pupils, and Dennis Weaver plays nice. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of her latest films, is briefly seen as Sister Alma, who is Winters, is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Shelley Winters. He is hard here and the difficulty seemed to work better. Winters always did well in their nervous tests. <br /> <br /> The end is makabre and who can forget about Winters piano that bumps it with a totally mad look?
