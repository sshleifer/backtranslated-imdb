I agree with most Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change in format. Columbo is a unique policeman with unique police techniques. This film looks like a normal detective drama of another past. And this is a worrying point because Columbo is not an ordinary detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts to this movie that left me interesting. First, I can't understand the title of this movie. It's misleading. Perhaps a better title would have been a "lost bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo conceals evidence by providing (at least) a reason why it does so. <br /> <br /> I don't know Friday, just frustrated. I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbus. <br /> <br />
