The tremendous blow to the Australian audience may be funny today, but its top political injustice and blunt, nervous humor can make it a little fine. It goes too long; some of it could have saved a sequel, Barry McKenzie owns, which needed a lot of new things. His ocker Aussie attitude is funny, but it also becomes annoying when it comes to film comfort. Some say Crocker's songs are the best bits and they are definitely original but "fun"? Barry McKenzie's adventures fall as the landmark of Australian cinema, but we must do our utmost to ensure that overseas do not see most Australians as Barry McKenzies (or Mick Dundees on this issue!). Rating: 5/10
