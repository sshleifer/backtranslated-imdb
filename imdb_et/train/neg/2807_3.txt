Michael Callan plays the smell of a photographer who seems to be the perfect "catch" of every woman running over him; can it have something to do with producing the film together? He is a "hero" who is very difficult to understand so that the film is in trouble at the beginning. But that doesn't stop there. It has the value of TV movie production (check that the head is made of clay or something, the end) and finishes the scams in a way that I can't reveal when someone wants to see the movie (very unlikely). Let's just say the killer knows more than we know he knows. (* 1/2)
