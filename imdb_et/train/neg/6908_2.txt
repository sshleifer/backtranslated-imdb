This series had the potential, but I think the budget does not allow it to see this potential. Interesting setups that do not differ from "lost" fall after the first episode. A whole series of 6 episodes could have made a 90-minute acting film, but the makers decided to drag it on and on. Many scenes were intolerably slow and long without moving the action forward. Music was very tedious and didn't work in general. There were few signs we took care of because their characters didn't grow over time â€” well, one grew a little. The end was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only spirits here are the art department and the dressing rooms, they created an interesting look, too bad that the writer and director did not have the foresight to do something interesting with this element
