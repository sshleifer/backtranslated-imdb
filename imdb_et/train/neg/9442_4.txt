I liked this slip as I try to enjoy all the slasher movies. I mean meaningless killing, mixed with little nudity and some difference in how you can go wrong. But I think Unhinged is the wrong example. The main issue is the terrible action of the three main girls in the house. Just as if they had calmed down, it never prevented me from being interested in my situation. The purpose of the film is intercourse and curiosity, but the direction of the numbers slips from them and leaves the film quite boring. This is a shame, because if the film was done better it would have been an ace. The story and the characters are quite horrible and there are some dark and bizarre humorous moments between the mother, the girls and the daughter in the old house. There are some good nudity and occasionally bleeding sprays, just not enough to make the film a mistake. The final is quite complicated and frightening and gives the film a big lift, but unfortunately it's too late. So, in my opinion, one avoid if you really love hidden slasher movies. There are quite a few options, but the film does not give enough to value it.
