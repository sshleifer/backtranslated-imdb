Movie: About IMDb there are some very interesting comments about this movie. It's really terrible. Not enough money is spent on the film and how Spike Lee has done it seems to be combined with an indie movie and action flick. Characters / actors: Denzel has done "exactly" what he does in every movie, so there's no surprise. Here's a little thought game for readers. Think fast for 10 Denzel films. Now read how many of them were, where he played a policeman / detective / body guard. Clive Owen, this guy will soon need a better role on his album. His best results were in my opinion "Beyond Borders". Other than that, he did pretty much the same thing as he did with every movie. His tone and way of speaking was very similar to what he did in "Sin." Certainly this man knows what he does not know is a better way to choose roles. He desperately needs a better agent. Jodie Foster was great in the movie when you look at her for the first time in her life. He's done better. He has had better roles. So in Hollywood, even the biggest stars fall on their knees and pick up the role of the low classes, as Jody Foster did in this movie. Plot: The plot was not confusing, in fact, I can think of such a plot, actually the whole movie, having a nice big Chinese dinner at the mine. I mean, come on, **** SPOILER APPROACH ----> I'm sick of essential Haulocast and racism. The film tells about bank robbers, why put Haulocas and racism there, nice to try to play with people's emotions, worked with someone? DO NOT ME. Police promised bank robbers to think they were hostages? Riiiiiiight, please, let's talk here about US police forces and security. Nobody knew where Clive was. Who are we kidding? Conclusion: Of course, look at this movie, if nothing is, you have a good time to talk to your friends about how bad the movie was. At least people do not believe that you are stupid to watch this movie because they think you went to watch it because it has a big letter "MISTAKE".
