Carnosaur 3: Primary Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why barely watch this movie? Another silly dinosaur film, where secret soldiers discover these deadly (and very counterfeit) prehistoric monsters that run in the deadly sense of humanity. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. It falls somewhere, though not related to any previous CARNOSAUR movie. EVALUATION: 10 out of 10. Rated for graphical violence and gore, grisly images and contempt.
