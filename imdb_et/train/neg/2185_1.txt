... or audience. Making a quick summary .... <br /> <br /> So you have the doctor who has tested the stolen parts of the body for an indefinite reason. She wants to complete the perfect transplant, but she feels she has to do it in her basement. WTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately, and comfortably, his groom can break his head in a road accident for which he is responsible. Stunned by fear, he keeps his head in a lasagna pan (or is it on a stroke?) And pumps it up with "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then he wakes up, speaks with his head (so to speak), although his neck is clearly separated from the vocal ropes, and he has no lungs so he could not speak even if he had been. It seems that the ungrateful b * tch does not understand what his fianc√© has done for him. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then her grief becomes horniness when she sees the possibility of grafting her beloved head on the first slippery bimbo body she can take off the street. At the same time, a physician's assistant, a kind of dime Igor, gets into the head of philosophical arguments that have hit a teletric friendship in a "monster in the closet" (every crazy scientist is one). Ultimately, the scriptwriter understands that he cannot keep his resentment and fear of intimacy in the audience, so he kills everyone, so probably the money goes to the bank before the financial supporters of the film have the opportunity to stop paying for it. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that I think it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner classic movies to stop showing this edited version without gory stuff. Seeing an assistant with his hand hanging, pirating around the house, leaving a lot of blood somewhere, is too valuable.
