More mystery film with some awful elements; mediocre general. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman who has a nightmare where her sex partner goes out of bed, goes into the room of her crying child and kills it. She wakes up. Then this person dies in the hospital, bleeding. His stranger daughter arrives and he succeeds in contacting him through his dreams (I think), and he wants him to be clear who will kill him before his body completely breaks down in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not too much mystery about who did it or even how; Most of the spectators have long explained it. I'm not sure how he was really working. <br /> <br /> In any case, horrible elements enter through: a gentle autopsy, a repetitive dream of a man who kills a boy, a nightmare, where the eggshell turns into an eye that is then cut, and several pictures of a decaying man both in nightmares and in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised when I finally saw Fulc's commitment to Clive Barker! Interesting.
