No plot, crappy acting and pointless gore .... <br /> <br /> Should this be a horror movie? No fear or arrest, just BOOM BANG GORE, then do. Some marines are in the wilderness for some strange and unpleasant reasons, and they are mutated by their mutated wild animals from the first film that was good, and it should have been. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money and the use of meaningless violence like the "Saw" sequel. They know no matter what the plot is and the more they can add, people see it. I miss good horizontal movies. Come to Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
