It's a movie that had a lot to live with. The year of the legendary film critic Barry Norman considered this to be the worst film of the year and I heard nothing but bad things, especially about the plot that was criticized as too complicated <br /> <br /> honest that the plot is something red herring and the film is even more affected when the word "plot" is used, as far as I can see, there is no plot as such. There's something that comes with Russian gangsters, Pete Thompson, who is trying to get her wife Sarah pregnant, and an Irish break called Sean. How they all fit into something called a "plot" that I'm not sure of. Guy Ritchie's film plots are hard to explain, but when you watch some of his films, I'm sure we all agree that they all have one, no matter how complicated they look at the first time. Similarly, James Bond's film, although the plots are stretched out with action scenes. You have a serious problem believing that RANCID ALUMINUM has any type of medium plot that can be clearly explained. <br /> <br /> Watching the selected list is enough to alert you to what kind of movie you're watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films in the last 15 years and is doing nothing to get controversial. Steven Berkoff gives a bad name (and he plays a character called Kant, which summarizes this movie), while one of the supporting characters plays the television presenter probably because it doesn't see a serious actor in it <br /> <br /> The only good thing you can say about this movie is that it is completely forgotten. I saw it a few days ago, and immediately after watching, I wrote a very long critical review that warned people that they were watching what they were, but now I have forgotten why. But it does not change the fact that I remember that I don't like this barrel enormously
