This movie should be called "Plan 9 from Joseph Smith." I think its strangeness is underestimated. the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich's "Population Bomb (1968)" and compiled a musical response made especially for the Mormons. The whole point of the game is that as many children as possible are part of the "heavenly father" (god) plan. and all that stands for more children is very bad. <br /> <br /> This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. it is utah, so it seems and seems like 1983, the game was actually written in 1973 and of course theology is part of the 1840s, part of the battlestar galactica. some operations take place on the ground and some "pre-existent, purposeful romper-room, where annoying kids are waiting for their body to get down so they can come down, try not to let the door to missionaries, losing the heavenly shooting it is equivalent to when they come, but don't let poor theaters violate your appreciation for this demented mormon universe, where "cool kids" are all under the control of the population, (probably) counseling their parents no longer have children! this part of God's plan is kept, the church has since done 180 and has made family planning a choice for parents, and big families are now much less a cultural norm, so the whole doctrine of the film is for the mormon of today! it's really just as good as music, here are some memorable stories that just don't let this movie die in the 1970s. year of death that was intended. Brother and Sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if there's anything else there. and the harsh and cool kids are creating new blocks for the block like metallica. so happy everyone! Collect family, make some disciples and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
