In early 2000, TV shows were weak and poor. Before such brands as (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk), the TV didn't yet have the right hit that could have attracted the attention and interest of the 2000s viewer. Titles such as (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) did not encourage you to follow and monitor, or at least it was not an exciting and interesting time that preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, these men are black, who is responsible for X-file fraud! (As if they were a special unit 1). But even according to this excellent formula; it doesn't work well. It was promising; at that time, the "supernatural" cases had been quite saturated for ten years of many X-files, so the natural spirit would gently strike it (imagine Mulder as a female worker!). However, it wasn't the strongest or the strongest (Unit 2) when it comes to making a comic Sci-Fi exhibition. It was very ridiculous, for example, for every sexy situation to become an ugly nasty. It was this bad taste bad. (Michael Landes) was a non-charismatic and comedian mostly intolerant. His chemistry (Alexondra Lee) and any supposed sexual attention were all wrong. Of course, the show got a funny look, but in general it was an unusual job. It is clear that nothing was more interesting than its main idea. For other (Evan Katzi) other co-workers and co-producers (like seven days) before or (24) it must be low. Despite being a character person, he managed to fool around most of the time. So, if that was the goal, they did one of them! And indeed, it would be one of the rarest times to be grateful for the cancellation of the exhibition after it had only happened after 19 episodes!
