Laurice Barnett lives as a nanny for a young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole), who has recently lost her mother. But Rosalie leaves her dead mother much behind and constantly visits the grave (conveniently located behind the house) late in the night ... where she also meets her friends ... <br /> <br /> Starts with the tomb in the tomb ... it breaks down . The story is thin and the film is 85 tons long. Acting is terrible on the board (Cole is easily the worst). Badly targeted by some WORST editing I've ever seen in the movie. Scenes (and sound) are simply cut without rhyme or reason. The film also has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. <br /> <br /> As for blood and violence, forget it! There is very little and there is incredibly fake. I've never seen such a fake blood - looks like a ketchup! Boring, pointless - just a forgotten drive game. You can skip this.
