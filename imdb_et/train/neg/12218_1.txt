Very bad. Very, very bad. Like a champion who wants to do, be or at least sniff a board in a movie set, it's hard for me to criticize the independent, who actually got any movie made. But this movie ... oh dear. <br /> <br /> The realization of Frightworld is nothing more than using crude oil (a respectable thing in itself) and trying to make it more in line with more conventional standards. error. To be fair, it is more fun than - to say - the Red Zone of Cuba ... but not much. So I'm not trying to criticize, but let me throw some of the observations out. <br /> <br /> 1) If the movie is a movie point, shouldn't you see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you have hired three sounds with a man, make sure at least one knows how to use the device. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, the leading maniac must be worse than the smurf's doll. Difficult, I know, but really ... <br /> <br /> There are many talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most can be hired very cheaply. Get one who knows how to create a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs don't mean he should do it every two seconds. /> <br /> 6) Kudos to get the girls to take off their tops, but next time get the girls we want to see, take off. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help to tell the story or set the mood. At least in such a movie editing, gore gags should be sold. A chainsaw that suddenly appears in symbols on the stomach is not terrible, it is sloppy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all of them were bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid when he started to fight back. There were some clean pictures, unfortunately it was thrown on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like the Frightworld moxie. Next time, when they have a film under their belts, I hope everyone will get something better than Colman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
