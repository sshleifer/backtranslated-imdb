I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I haven't seen since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this film was a big disappointment. The actions of all parties were bad, except for Mr Lundgren, who was okay-ish. Kata Dob√≥ was a pleasant look despite the ridiculous clothing and make-up. <br /> <br /> The piece is not wise at all, it's something that has been repeatedly repeated in various films. The punches were completely stereotypical and Lundgren's character was not there. I did not expect the masterpiece of the film, but unfortunately it is not even a decent activity. The progress of each plot is extremely predictable and an incredible amount of unrealistic unreality and comic book, like characters, began to distract me very quickly. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to young people who want some comic action, but only if nothing is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average vote of 7.0 and 6 votes must have been influenced by someone who participated in making this movie)
