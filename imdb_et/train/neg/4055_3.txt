I have read the comments that you probably have to be a student in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand. Maybe it's true, if yes, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The end is doing as much thinking as all children who are anti-government and anti-corporate, without having a better solution that does not burn society with the Mad Max type. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters can leave, but they are not. The reasons why they do this do not make sense. There are not enough signs to explain why. What the capture of innocent people should mean is never explained or even hinted. It is said that war is the ultimate creative expression, most likely the only revelation that any character in this film is, and that makes no sense. they just kill people. I thought they would have used all the explosives to blow up a place or at least a shrine that would have made a greater symbolic meaning, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This film is a youngster's dream to fight the authority that grieves them, even though they really need it. He has no moral, symbolic truth or meaning; this movie just plays out fantasy to kill teachers and people who are upset you. <br /> <br /> If you think the murder break / school game is similar to Colombin or Virginia, it's a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions that you don't like, so I think you love this movie. If you are like me and you are working to make a life of yourself instead of a blind (very blindly in this film) rebellion against a "man", this film is minor and boring. <br /> <br /> You may also say in part that there was no funding and the story seemed to be a distraction. <br /> <br /> All in all, it seems to be a very rough draft of what might have been a okay movie, but no effort is made on dialogue, character formation or morale, but it's just ... badly done. <br /> <br /> If ... only I could get my two hours ago.
