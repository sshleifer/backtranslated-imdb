Terrible movie Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here, he is sitting with the dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome will soon be hired to find out what happened to the woman. Of course, this is a woman below the sea. His room-friend, Lainie Kazan, soon died on the floor. <br /> <br /> Aging Richard Conte plays a police officer and a friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, Rome is accused of engaging in an interesting tracking scene. This is how bad this picture is when you have to act depending on the timing scene. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays beauty up to her neck intrigue. His behavior leads to much desire. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son tries to cross him. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie you don't know why the girl was killed. Don't even bother to ask.
