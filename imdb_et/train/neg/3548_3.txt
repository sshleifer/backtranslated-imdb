For those who like movies and varieties with sliding characters, this is for you! From the New York atmosphere, which is an extremely gloomy and almost hopeless place, two different guides that have no great moral sense are a true shooting form. <br /> <br /> Why did the Academy win the prize because it was so shocking that Hollywood, a completely new freedom to show something he wanted with all moral codes, wanted to celebrate that fact. The filmmakers were then immature six-year-olds who had an unlimited cost account with a local candy store. So Hollywood (probably for the first time) gave rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homelessness and other wonderful sights and sounds that only his twisted brain thought would be tempting. jobs. <br /> <br /> It was also hoped that I had to target the mainstream target groups. Well, it succeeded at this level. The spectators were stunned about what they were saying and heard, and the Academy, proud of being able to bring out the slag and make money at the same time, could not honor this piece of gilded garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this movie exciting. But seeing again in the 1990s continued my bad taste in my mouth, which I never saw to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Action was good, but what? Action is good in many films. Nobody said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't work. Hoffman was especially good on his younger days to play wacked-out people. He was like Johnny Depp of the era, playing in a movie like "Ratso Rizzo" and then he gets "Rain Man". Yes, "Ratso" is a sign you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is the one you want to forget, but the story is so wretched, it goes beyond fine action. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an "art", and it's not worth its many awards; it only pushed the envelope for a long time in 1969 and that's why it is remembered in the hearts of film and critics. It is two hours of embarrassment and ultra-slippery, religious cheap shots, glorious strange glorification (Andy Warhol gets even an act - no surprise) and generally despicable people. <br /> <br /> I liked the memorable song, "All Who Speak", which made Harry Nilsson famous, but even it was fake because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better before Nilsson did it. ... and a few people have ever heard of Neil (what is their loss) And - as mentioned - the name "Ratso Rizzo" is with you! <br /> <br /> The film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I'm afraid it was celebrated this "official" that Hollywood had left off the toilet and since then has been in the sewer.
