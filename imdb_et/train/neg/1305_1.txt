"Demons III: Ogre" is not affiliated with "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 is a cool hip horror 1980 classic." Demons III: Ogre "is a very stupid, boring, and inexpensive monster. The confusion about the writer is" Demons III: Ogre "(Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a bad quality writer and a fool who bored by William Shakespeare as a ghost or demon on the Spider Web or what Huhuhuhu does very dull movie I bought a special DVD box "Demons" on three different films "Demons III: Ogre", "Other Hell" and "Black Demons" are not closed caption and subtitles cost $ 14.99 from the best of Downey city stores why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a poor quality writer who makes a stupid movie almost like "Halloween III" is not a monster of Michael Myer, but people wear Halloween. I am very confused: I really love "demons" and "demons 2 is Better dull stupid "D Emons III: Ogre" does not belong to the "demons" and "demons 2" to the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you to Juan Antonio De La Torre
