This is the first non-zombie subtitle review, but it's worth it. Dinocroc is generally a good movie, but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-film. Dinocroc himself seemed great, but I thought the film needed a little more weight, like action and violence, because if croc is shown or is in combat, it doesn't go very far except croc is shown and croc kills or repeats. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus and the action was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc seemed carnal, not like a comic cough * komodo * cough cough. I enjoyed this movie so I would be glad there is a sequel that is more than what I can say about some movies in general. Generally 3/6 stars and worth a look.
