After seeing the remake of 1996, I thought it was a more fun way to see Cruella De Vil punish the animals for torture. The whole movie was pretty funny and I think it's better than animated. But you really didn't need another. First, when Cruela returns, don't treat her and make her crazy again. Just put him in prison and that's a rap. I thought it wasn't very funny. It should be just one original puppy back. I thought it should be Lucky, because he was the most tempting and besides, Roger and Anita. At the same time, they decided on a complete recast and not a hundred, not even a hundred, but only three puppies and a parrot who thinks he is a dog (smart). The part of Gerard Depardieu was pointless. Finally, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. It is baked inside a giant cake. It was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first. It just doesn't work. It was too much and not too funny. I was really sorry for Cruell.
