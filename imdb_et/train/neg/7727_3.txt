I comment on this minisation for the person who first read the novel. And from this point of view, I can honestly say that although I enjoy, I see why it has not been recently reloaded. Specifically, this mini has serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's terribly failed. The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (at that time 45) played Natalie Jastrow, who was supposed to be about 26. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at that time) played Byron Henry, who was supposed to be about 22. Other Henry's children and Pamela Tudsbury, too played too old actors who were supposed to be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some of the actors were absolutely terrible. From time to time, Ali McGraw turned this mini into an unseen. I have seen more convincing performances while playing high school. 3) Management was bad. To be honest with Ali McGraw, badly acting and characteristic developments were likely to be the direction. Hitler's depiction was so superfluous. His character came out and behaved more than a caricature, sometimes charming, but always a devilish genius, Herman Wouk painted him like a novel. Some other signs have been made stereotypically (Berel Jastrow) that they do not get the depth of the character created for them by Wouk. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very dated. Hokey's music, pretentious narrative (it sounded like a story of a junior high school history) and the first mini-soap opera of the entire mini-region felt it comic from time to time. Too often, Byron and Natalie costumes are made to look like they were in 1979, not in 1939, because it will be "taking you too seriously" in the late 70s or early 80s soap drama, not a television version of what is definitely a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Older films and the like are sometimes badly made, but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director can make a very stunning, memorable and critically acclaimed production. I don't see this happening because the remake should be the same length (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and given the brief attention of most of the current American public, it wouldn't fly.
