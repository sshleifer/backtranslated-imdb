What a terrible movie! For some reason, research laboratories and office outlets always have internal, dirty, middle-enchanted, interior living things. Those people who probably collaborate on complex scientific projects do not seem to agree with how to survive the death of a CGI dragon. Spoilers: An extra-nasty scientist whose main operational skills are "Leering" and "Bad Foam" have cloned a dragon. Although the lab had to work on such a thing, the other scientists were shocked because they were probably attempts and they struck down the pants. The rest of the story is as it is, or ten small Indians, where the employees are hunting and killing when they try to formulate the exit and / or "drag". The CGI Dragon creature is a dark gray that seems to be a popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and dark gray tones make it difficult to see interesting details in the dragon's body. It looks like it's gray gray. Operation is less than terrible. These scientists act like a bunch of children who can't agree on something, and that makes it easier for Dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, and so on. Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the unknown actors in this movie. He seems to be sinking to his level of supporting casting. This movie is really daunting. Operation is bad. The story is stupid. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing commendable about this movie, it is not even a good time killer when you look at housework or other work.
