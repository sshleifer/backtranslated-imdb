Since I loved inspector gadgets in the 80s, I went to watch this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. The film was also unable to interest me for a long time. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an inspector gadget, check out the comic book. It was much better than film.
