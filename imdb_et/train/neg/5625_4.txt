Jack London's life was colorful enough to bring a dozen films from his various aspects. Unfortunately, it can be said that what was used in his life in the film was some of the war propaganda that had the best face on the most attractive parts of his face. <br /> <br /> Jack London, who barely saw at age 40 when he died, wrote some of the best stories. He wrote what he knew, but he wrote like everyone else who brought him his luggage of life. Part of this experience the other day and time would have been understood as racism. But it was World War II and London was a great believer in the "yellow threat" because it was called back in the day. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film covers his life as an author, we see him for years as a sailor, where he became inspired by the seaweed. We see him in Yukon's mining cab with a dog who was undoubtedly his inspiration for the Nature's invitation. London was able to stand on the adventure spirit that his own life was right on paper, so that the world could enjoy it ever since. <br /> <br /> The last third was his time as a war correspondent covering the Russian War. London was a socialist, but his socialism did not include people who were oriental. Like a few million others, he saw Chinese and Japanese growing immigration on the Pacific coast as a threat to white people. He supported a strict immigration policy for the East. <br /> <br /> The film puts the cart in front of the horse. London is introduced as a man who saw that he was in the war between Russia and Japan, what Japan's ambitions were and therefore it was as xenophobic as it was. In fact, there were no atrocities in World War II during the conflict between Russia and Japan. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but so did everyone else, including the US. However, the immigration policy caused by the pressure from our western politicians was a major contribution to the deterioration of Japan's relations over a couple of generations. London was part of a reason that wasn't a crying prophet burning in the desert. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first independent production by Samuel Bronston, who later made some films a bit more budget than Jack London. If he had got a little more money, Bronston could have been James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both of whom would be right for that role. Instead, they got Michael O'Shea, who made his second film after the Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is partly good, but it was definitely not a post office. <br /> <br /> Since London involves war, he meets Captain Tanaka, played by Leonard Strong, an actor who specializes in Orientals and played them in World War II. Since 1905, there are strong features of the best traditions of Fu Manchu in Japan's imperial goals until reaching the US. Must have gone over the crowd with a smooth change. <br /> <br /> A lot, of course, is out of London, including the first woman. Playing the second and only woman in this movie is Susan Hayward, who arrives only when it's halfway. I wish we had seen him more. Charmian Kittredge London lived with his wife for nearly 40 years, who died in 1955. <br /> <br /> O'Shea actually met and married his leading lady Jack in London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and married 30 years until O'Shea died in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we can watch Jack from London, which is much better than that.
