Young and attractive Japanese people are back on the wrong side of some curses, this time covering cell phones. Different people die until there is a shameful spirit behind it, so if you have seen more than two Japanese horror films, you can draw this movie in the dark when your hands are tied. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here is that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far, I've been impressive with his low key, like City of Lost Souls, but as one of the missed calls plodded, I missed his most famous envelopes dead or alive or heard too pseudo-Cronenberg style. Despite many of his films, which are essentially empty, they have at least features like at least, or at least something that keeps your attention like Tadanobu Asano, who speaks about shiny suits that suffer from Johnny Deppi. There is no one in one missed call; there is only very little credit: the actor is blissful and average, there is very little intimidation or intercourse (nothing, frankly), and sometimes it's just boring. <br /> <br /> There are moments where a sense of humor similar to Miike glacier arises through empty commercialism; especially in the case of a TV show aimed at filming the fall of one cursed object, and the television broadcaster worries more about his assessments than the lives of girls. But there is nothing that could suggest that Miike is behind the camera; in particular, his usual visual face has disappeared (and it also includes his famous gore), although it is more likely that he had no enthusiasm for the project, and I understand why. One missed call is not maliciously bad. It's just a depressing medium. <br /> <br /> Miike probably loves driving. With its huge annual output, it is obvious that it is not going to be 100% concerned about its projects. But even with that in mind, one missed the call that he was just paying the bills.
