I watched SCARECROWS because of this buzz. Well, I can't imagine anyone who likes this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> It is clear that anyone who made this movie knows nothing about fear. The whole story is an unfortunate marriage of two genres: an action movie (weapons and criminals) and horror (live peasants). When criminals are killed one by one by changing views, these two genres automatically cancel each other, because first they are criminals and who care about the criminals, and secondly, because they are stupid criminals who force! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesn't work here. Where's that horror? I wanted the criminals to die in terrible, painful deaths. <br /> <br /> But this story is so poorly designed that a genre of marriage that could have worked well was never gels. We are just left behind, there are a number of super cool criminals and a bunch of dreadlocks that are "alive" for any weak reason the filmmakers thought. Making things even worse is the fact that cinematography is terrible (TV-like), and in the case of worse attacks, CBs are talking about the whole dialogue, and we are constantly listening to a nasty conversation about unlinked images, as if we were watching some sort of radio broadcast. This part was really BAD. The director would have had to make such a stupid idea on the spot! I can't say how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I have already mentioned, the criminals in SCARECROWS are stunningly stupid. For example, if someone suddenly appears in a dish and with money and straw (yes, straw) in his large open wound, others ask, "What medicine is he?" after they shoot him a ton of bullets who can't kill him (he's "scared" by fear. Don't ask ...). Take an amazing clue to the mores. I've never seen such fools in the movie. And then there is the girl. I wanted one of the peacocks to kill him quickly because he was in the back. If he finds that his father is equipped with a scarecrow "cross", he actually blames the criminals in a scary scene (bad behavior), even though the criminals couldn't do it. What he was! But peacemaking is the biggest weakness of this very weak valve. They are not scary. There's nothing much explained about them. They are just a plot device in this plot device-filled movie. <br /> <br /> Mr Wesley, in the face of peacemaking in 30 seconds, does not stop anything but a feeling of boredom. And this scene with a talking head in the refrigerator. Thanks for the laughter. <br /> <br /> All in all, it had to be one of the worst films I've seen recently (and I've seen a lot of movies these days!) just as bad between SILO and KILLER or SCARECROWS, rather I look at SILO KILLER again. Yes, SCARECROWS is so bad.
