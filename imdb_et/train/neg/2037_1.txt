If I could give it to zero, I would think and give it a -10 instead. An absolutely terrible movie with no film plot doesn't understand what's going on. Just PLAIN BORING. Please don't waste your money. Pleaseee !!! This film could have been as good as it would represent the true story of the zodiac sign killer, but in the dungeon I didn't feel anything but disgusted while watching it. Take advantage of and rent some classic movies instead of watching a movie you've already seen 3-4 times when you watch this crap! I don't understand why people are still struggling to make such movies when they know they're not going to do it well. Zodiac killer should be called "Boriac killer"!
