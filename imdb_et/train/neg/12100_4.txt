Now don't get me wrong. If you need a concise overview of everything that has gone wrong with the history of human civilization, but also with the path of the flawless future of mankind, who would be better suited as a comedian and pop culture practitioner? If you need a full dose of all the definite, reliable reasons why religion has surpassed its utility, then contact Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER God (?)! That's good and good in itself. Maher leaves our religious past due to a neurological disorder that conveniently overlooks how his entire society, art, and science are rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, he relies heavily on a polished skill set in irony and cynicism to make his point when he tries to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect is not a task. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but probably not the brightest bulb in the box. For example, he responds to the interviewee (and I use the term loosely because they were clearly all "ambushees") to confirm that Jesus' existence is a historical fact with the "No, it's not", followed by a long foam designed to convey contempt for the subject's naivety (a device that used this movie too much). The problem is that man was right and Maher wrongly died in his claim that Jesus is only mentioned in what he regards as a historically suspected gospel. I think Mr Maher has never read modern Josephus. and guffaw (they definitely did my show). <br /> <br /> But it has been said twice that the strongest and most mysterious braying was about 70% of the time the film devoted to it anti-Christian tirade, while the audience was completely silenced by the 10% symbol that was dedicated to criticizing the peace religion he described. Hmmm. Both Islamic criticisms are the boundaries of the hip and liberal target group, or they were just afraid to laugh. Very narrative in either way ..
