The idea was fantastic, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was bad and there was no depth. I couldn't really get into this movie. I didn't know the characters, there were many climbers, and the movie was strange. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was that a sad ending? Again, I don't know. You leave the theater dissatisfied. The film had so much to give, but could not. Just because you can change does not mean you should, right? I wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say you left the movie feeling like it was ready. You're just confused. Trust me, thank you for not watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
