Over the last 20 years, most British movies have been about how terrible poverty is in the UK and how our youngsters can't live a good life on the middle streets of British cities. The British film industry is obsessed with the idea of ​​a "broken Britain". Trainspotting, England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Who and London from Brighton. <br /> <br /> Bullet Boy is just one British movie added to this list. The protagonist expresses the desire to go straight, but he still requires the killing of the dead who carry weapons and fight with gang members. I was never convinced that he wanted to go straight because nothing stopped him from education or trade. In fact, it would have been the breath of fresh air if it had gone straight and we had a character who turned around his life. Instead, he spends his time helping his friend to murder. I did not feel any compassion when, at the end of the film, he was predicted to shoot another teenager, which is sad because at the beginning of the film I really liked the whole family and their desire to succeed. I believe that the creators had a great opportunity to show the world that success belongs to those who are ready to really strive for it (like a blessing). <br /> <br /> I know that the purpose of this movie was to try and realize a realistic picture of life for black teenagers living in UK working class areas, but don't we have enough movies in the UK with the same plot? Isn't it time for these talented manufacturers and writers to give Britains something for young people what they want and show them a better life just around the corner? meaningless to try and succeed through shock factors (such as Kidulthood, Football Factory), but at the same time, this film does not offer a new list of British films that have an effective and depressing view. This movie or any other thing I mentioned is not a happy ending.
