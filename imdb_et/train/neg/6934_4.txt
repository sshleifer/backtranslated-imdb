OK, so ppl thought it was a good film in 1955. <br /> <br /> I regret the fool who still thinks ... His absolute rubbish. <br /> <br /> The story is fair. .. ridiculous. Characters are absurd cartoons - but this movie is not meant for satirization, im sure it's a serious drama, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this movie and maybe he played his part as well as he could have. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when making this film. Natalie Wood is proud, but Natalie Wood is beautiful at the early stages of the police station, where her crying and whining are very convincing. It sets a bad precedent for the film ... and for the rest, you feel like every one of those badly-acting emotional scenes comes. <br /> <br /> It may be a good time, but indeed its expansion. <br /> <br /> It must be just about the Dean's death, which has exaggerated the image of this movie.
