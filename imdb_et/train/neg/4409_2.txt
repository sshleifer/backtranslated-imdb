Strictly routine, western (headed by genre-main stage Andrew V. McLaglen, so is it any wonder?). Army Colonel Brian Keith spars with smarmy bandit Dean Martin, who has just been kidnapped by Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found his niche after playing "Pussy Galore" in Goldfinger). Fist-fighting, shooting, stagecoach robberies, and Denver Pyle's supporting role ... in other words, something new or original. Speaking in a low monotonous tone, Keith sounds like a prostitute (something is shocking after her TV "Family Affair"), but otherwise she consumes Keith's friendly talents for low-rent material. It's also bad news for Dino who doesn't seem to care. Hack direction, poor writing, and a number of minor attempts at lowball humor. * from ****
