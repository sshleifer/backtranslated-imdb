I looked at the Phat Beach cable for a while and I enjoyed it. Fat boy is the best character because he seems to be a nice guy. The remaining characters are simply stereotypes of young men and young men. I like to watch those low-budget movies that remain in the time, because they are almost like the attitudes and fashions of the year. Phat Beach is also funny because the little budget babes of this movie are strictly home-made girls. Most low-budget movies have this "local baby" quality and you can tell the child that these films were local removers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite that their bikini hung up, it was funny to see how "young" went beyond what was somewhat used, a big pass. Also there were some cuties. It is the charm of these low budget crappy films. You can see a lot of dogs and some real cuties! I checked one of these IMDbs and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Damage. It would be interesting if someone succeeds to ever make a "Where are they now" book of all the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then never again return. What happened?? Almost all films probably have one or two youngsters who seem to have visited them a lot and years later, when you see the movie on television again, do not know what happened to X? Anyway, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments.
