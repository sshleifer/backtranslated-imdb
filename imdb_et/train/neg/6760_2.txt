Well-known writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to conquer old addictions and start a new life like Baltimore, a publisher of the Maryland magazine. But threats, delirium and rejection threaten to prevent his efforts. He would also like to revive romance with old gold, with a noticeable outlook when things turn out. Mr. Redfield also led the dramatization of the mysterious recent days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield uses a lot of black and white, color and trick to create mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (Dr. John Moran) works relatively well. That's not enough.
