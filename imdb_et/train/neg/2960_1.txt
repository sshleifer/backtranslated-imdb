This is undoubtedly the only worst film ever created. There's no claim here. That's it. End of story. The story is a minor and a sub-moronic that looks like it was created by three-year-old dinosaurs fascinated. The whole concept is just plain. It is inconceivable how someone could come up with something so stupid and think it was fun. Jokes are also flat. If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself happy. If your sick curious how bad this film is, please don't describe me. Words can't express how this movie is very terrible. It's not as bad as a bad movie. Even they have cohesion, if not the value of entertainment. That's it. . . It is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever talked about and multiply your level of badness by 5000 and still not close to that movie. After Pokemon has given one point to the film, this film seems to be a charity in one point. It's so bad. Did producers and directors even take film classes? Because it's a great example of how not to shoot. This film seems to have made some color-thin amateurs. If you rent it, please take it back and ask for a refund. And don't even think about renting it again.
