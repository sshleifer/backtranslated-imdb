I just saw this movie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival 2006, and it makes me seriously wonder if people in the festival actually see movies before they're picked. The film was just terrible - I say it was terrible without hyperbole or rear motifs. Matthew Modine's days as a leading man are over. Gina Gershon played an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should shame her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a strange little guy in it - she should be ashamed. The script was terrible and we had no reason to take care of the characters. I very much doubt that it will accelerate, but then Hollywood people are known to have sometimes made mistakes. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious candidate for the worst film I've ever seen.
