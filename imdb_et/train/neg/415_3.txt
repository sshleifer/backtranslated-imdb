Leave it to Paul's "brain of the brain" Verhoeven to find a meaningless and juvenile version of INVISIBLE MAN's story. When he runs a Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would make it a big orgy. I do not mind sex or even slip (look at my other comments) on the film, but frankly, it is obvious that the director has one track and he did not see any interesting aspects of the story of an invisible person as the consequences of kinky. It is a disgrace because it could have been good if the film did not spend so much time with the invisible Kevin Bacon grope-women. The players who are made by the actors do what a single-note cheese script can do, but for some of them I felt bad, including William Devane, who has been completely wasted here. <br /> <br /> But what I can expect from a SHOWGIRLS director, which is btw, is much more fun than this tough and bad film.
