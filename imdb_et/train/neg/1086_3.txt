Despite its impressive cast and team pedigree, Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often. The plot has been unreally twisted, the participants sport with bad accents, and the participation of director Robert Altman means rewarding control. He has once again collected an impressive cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman) that this time the letter has failed. But that's just part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a high-power Georgian lawyer who is able to attract a mysterious catering company, who persuades him to threaten his former husband and loony father, on scenes that are difficult to open. Red flags are a smart lawyer everywhere who can even harm their children. Weapons and fists are fighting with the chase of the necessary car and if it is not enough, then it is thrown into a hurricane for a ridiculous finale. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with mealy and persuasive southern accent. Within a circle of trench coat in all sorts of weather he blind evident to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr is a bit as bad as P.I. but a little more emphasis is put on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as an old man at Boo Radely all grew up more than bedding that served a thick ham slice, but at least his twang is plausible. Female leaders (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are lean and unemployed. Even the famous lawyers who make the lights (Vernon Jordan) have a wooden pair of lines that they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to the little attention paid to his actors, the scene of the Altman Mass, dripping with a Spanish moss, is a comic book of his scene. It lacks his pristine touches and observations (he informs the viewer that stars and bars in Georgia are still stars) that make the well-made Altman so unique. Unfortunately, the gingerbread man Altman is the worst, even if the charge is the same.
