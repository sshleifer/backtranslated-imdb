In the first 3 seasons, fairly odd parents were both tasty and hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And, unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you need after looking at the latest episodes, where all the sweetness is replaced by insults and violence that does not laugh. Cosmo, one of the most promising signs of Nick, is committed to a malicious unforgettable cretan that Family Guy casts would not even know. Timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that fortunately won by Bart Simpson (and gave Timmy a shine that takes a lot of beating). And the poor Wanda ... the real charmer who has become the victim of his wife and cross teacher is now labeled "nervous" to take care of other care. Plus Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but he has never been punished for it, nor does he learn any lessons. It takes Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are raw, vulgar and not too bright. Thanks to God, this exquisite tone has been canceled with Butch Hartman's dear Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he earned - unlike Cosmost.
