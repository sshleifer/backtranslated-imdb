I recently watched a movie and it looks like a book. I blame it for a bad scenario and direction. Some parts were violently introduced (rape of gays) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after I first read it. It was hard for me to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many different ideas that have not been introduced at all, except for the temporal sensational part. Since it involves things that are considered to be slightly sensitive, I see during communism that it has been since then. This is no longer the case, but maybe I see things differently or a bit of both. The film tries to cover many aspects of the book, resulting in scenes that may make some sense to read a book. Even so, this is a movie that is hard to see and maybe never had to do.
