50 years after World War II, the United States was in a situation where military interests were dominant in the main economic segments. At the same time, all members of society had served or were associated with someone who had, due to the draft and the wars. <br /> <br /> This allowed a minigene based on America's sense of being in the middle of the concept. an inflexible army machine. Sometimes this machine was imprisoned by a non-US army, such as prisoners of war. After removal, there are stories on other machines: science fiction and businesses, but they always refer to this military genre and indeed testosterone operations even refer to their comic sister. <br /> <br /> You can track it, I think maybe the comic, which means Amrican, "The Great Escape," which immediately created TeeVee's descendants "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Herose" will begin. Then another wave triggered by "Catch 22" and "MASH", both of which were real, then books, then movies and MASH, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But before that, "Phil Silvers Show" was sergeant Bilko and it followed "Mister Roberts". A happy person who committed only harmless crimes and then only in response to an overly raw system that tried to limit his life. It was the day when TeeWater shows how important it is. You swallowed them instead of just putting them to work. It was not particularly wise in any way, except that it was found that what we checked and wanted for freedom was broken. <br /> <br /> One big zone where Americans worked out how they think about forgiving, even loving, is in a military context, a zone that has been accepted by one of our political parties. <br /> <br /> Because it's great, it's sometimes worth laughing. "Stripes" was pretty funny what I thought. It was a mess that actually attacked serious enemies, somewhat folding in some "Dirty Dozen". And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now, before the expansion of cultural rides. It tries to touch this sweet spot like other Steve Martin's handled remakes. It's so uncomfortable that you actually attack the army to be a stronger player. Another way to keep track of how societies work out military handles. <br /> </p>
