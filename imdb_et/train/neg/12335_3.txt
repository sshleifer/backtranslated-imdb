Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among the actors in this class who I am always interested in. I've always found that Mrs. Ryan is a charming and powerful actor in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth it. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" to a large extent, because First of all, Meg Ryan does not play a pleasant character, he plays with a weak willpower who starts to fret right after the opening credit and does not give up until several days later . This means that Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less pleasant. So, even if you usually like these two actors, I suggest you go through this movie.
