In the initial 20 minutes (I watched it on PS2, so I really have no idea how long it took) Alienator creates an interesting assumption. I don't think I've seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as a baddie. But the interests will soon become unbelievable if you realize that an "alien" is a great builder in steel bikini. Yes, the alien is obviously ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Don't think I'll hold it against it. The dreadful fear of the world can probably be ridiculous to be a good sign. But the blatant stupidity of this assumption is that the film is really for that. The alien is funny as hell, but it is also the highest-ranking screaming mammal. Actors are accusing attempts of unsuccessful serious exclusion, potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue stumble with inconvenient incompetence, and the direction cannot bring together even one or two decent sets. By the time the movie is over, you can hardly see the original concept through the entire floor of the team's discouraged. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that the "alien" simply kills people by evaporating them, as opposed to doing something like you are, and you have a giant rush of good ideas left to rot. You laugh at the Alienator, but AT, not that. If that's your thing, go ahead and look at it.
