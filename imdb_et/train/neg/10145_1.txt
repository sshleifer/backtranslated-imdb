Steven Seagal seems to be a sleepwalker through a terrible film that is almost completely close to concealing the budget and the lack of resources. In order to choose from the technical flaws - silver F / A-18s and F-14s taken from the carrier for an air strike, and the wonderfully embedded F-16 for a real strike - this film would be more reliable than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the film's most interesting is the credit titles that disappear and then disappear in the flash that is expected to be available to all Final Cut Pro users. Bringing all of his creativity to his credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
