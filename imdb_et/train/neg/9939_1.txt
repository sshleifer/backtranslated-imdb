The intellectuals of film students can let everything they want about the meaning (imagination) of this film, but it's just: intellectual drool. This movie is creatively bankrupt and some bugs are endlessly self-conscious wanking as a substance. Yes, yes. Of course, Godard Stones was not a fan. Too bad because it could have been great. He hits the birth of this timeless song and chooses instead to cover the music with some loyal one who read True Detective Magi or some. <br /> <br /> Then there are endless images of what looks like the 60s librarians are spraying on people's cars. And then there is a seemingly endless "interview" where the actor was perfectly trained to answer only hunting or not to all the deep and intellectual questions. There are some guys in the purple suit who read more crap that goes on, oh, only about 20 minutes. And black panther or something in spam. <br /> <br /> Is it almost intriguing? But that's not the case. <br /> <br /> But for the hipsters of an untreated film school who doesn't care about the lost chances of getting full access to the rocks that lead to the devil's world and hear some English guy, reading instead, watching the nudie magi, the true winner of this movie, cover . <br /> <br /> More specifically ... maybe Godard just blows.
