It's just a Saturday's matte series that I loved during World War II. I was under ten years old. And this is the audience for which this series is meant. Looking at it now, he must roar with his inaccuracy and stupidity. The budget must be something left behind because of shortcuts and repetitions. Acting? Well, it's the pictures of the Republic, 1944. They read the lines ... and no doubt they were convincing. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars.
