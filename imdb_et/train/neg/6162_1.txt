"Smokey and the bandit" wasn't exactly Shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it. It was a lowland, but he had a brain. It was a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrapper. People came out of the theater smile. "Hooper" does not give it anything. There is no reason to smile. If it were to be a Hollywood stuntman tribute, it would be amazingly lazy, offering something other than badly choreographed fighting scenes and one of the most convincing jumps I've ever seen. It all seems fake, almost filmed. Poor Sally Field (as a girlfriend who pulls her hand off) is given the weakest role, not with a funny or smart line ("If you jump on it, I'm not here when you come back"). Burt Reynolds looks at the camera and kicks, but everyone in the audience is sitting in "The Hoop". * from ****
