I stopped watching this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I am very disappointed with it. I'm not quite sure why someone makes such a movie. It was somewhat entertaining, but I feel people have a lot of disagreement about what they did. On Monday the writer was responsible; Tuesday, Director; Wednesday, a man who gets coffee; etc. It almost seems that they really wanted to make a few different movies, but they only had the time and money to do it. <br /> <br /> Someone commented that acting was really good, but I would not agree. And again, if the actors could keep a straight face while filming, they might be better actors than I credit them. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie is a mystery ... something according to historical law and order or national treasure. It starts like this, but then, somewhere, this Twilight Zone turns to a bad episode or ... what this second show was not so good ... Bad episode The Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played. There's a bad guy with white hair. There is a love of interest, who, when he first appears, winds blowing through his hair. Seriously. If you have realized that this is a Christian film, the end result is quite simple. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was badly done, especially in opening scenes - making it the best way to go. For most movies it wasn't terrifying, but the old lady was occasionally a ridiculously bad shot, praying her hands in a dark room, while brightness is striking - a thing that just makes you a little embarrassed to watch a movie.
