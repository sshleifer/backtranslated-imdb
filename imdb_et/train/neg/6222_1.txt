I'm not sure if users should be allowed to sit over for movies, but I'm afraid I couldn't stand for another minute. <br /> <br /> You don't have a late, big GP like his bike wheel, I doubt something else. <br /> <br /> A great review of the above-mentioned "Not a movie for Parsons fans" brings together most of my feelings. How a bold (second speed) director and writer tries something that they are so capable of giving. What did they mean? Where to start? <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: I thought I'd get a slice of bitter Americanat. What I got was poorly fillable without the cliche remaining around. Stupid hippie? Check it out. Stupid fat cop? Check it out. Amazing Sample? Check it out. Embarrassed female characters? Double check. Absolutely ignoring the story you're trying to imagine? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while you realize that what you are looking at is soap and not very well written. Scene with Knoxville. Scene With Ex Girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville, which hasn't moved much. Scene with Ex girlfriend, which was the last one. And so on ... <br /> <br /> GUIDELINE: My friends and I decided after some consideration to look at it as watching Quincy's bad episode, or perhaps a particularly bad Duke of Dawn. It was such a bad direction. Terrible jumping, terrible camera work, clumsy inputs and scenes. God, it was remarkable. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman who is the most remarkable recent work that is really sad for the BBC's Sunday night drama, called Glen's monarch (trust me, this is the lowest common denominator of TV). And then it was all worth it ... <br /> <br /> ACTION: Are we so critical that if some of the TV's random men decide to behave when he's not so bad, then he stinks, we praise his efforts ? Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to get through every scene. Bad Christina A. has no such luck. His performance is a car accident (although what you do with these lines, I don't know). "Hippie" in the hearing: oh dear, dear, oh dear. Have we not moved for Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go ahead, but I think you will get my drift. I would say that, as other comments have said, no one in this film clearly shows the fucking work of The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, or Gram solo. They didn't know anything about American roads, and they'd definitely give a damn about trying to do something, while admitting a reasonable story about rock mythology. This movie was low, could not look at anything and was jaw falling from the beginning ... wait, wait, I didn't finish. And I also suggest you stay.
