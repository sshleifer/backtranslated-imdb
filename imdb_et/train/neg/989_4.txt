Okay, I got to know about this movie and I watched the preview read almost all the comments and had a hard discussion about whether or not I should watch it. Before I watched the movie, I was emotionally strange. I was so sure if I was going to watch it and disturb it for so long. So I decided to risk it and watched it and me what I thought: the beginning started fine for me. It seemed that it was heading in the right direction. They went on a rape scene and I couldn't figure out why people were so upset or bored by the film. Don't do me wrong if the rape scene was just as sad and scary, but it didn't bother me dramatically. When it came to the middle, I understood the eternal things that happened. There was something like 5 minutes of shots, but people walking around or showing something! one thing is making a blow, where a person shows some emotion, but this movie didn't. It was about 3 of these useless scenes, where you can see the main character of Maya's sort of out of control, but it didn't show it right to want to move fast. Then, when he was engaged in hardcore partying, it wasn't so boring, but still a bit boring. Oh, and as a remark, Rosario Dawson still did a good job. Okay, so finally, after the mediocre period of thought, revenge is the Maya's attention. This is where it disturbed. I didn't know him bad or anything he got, what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I felt everything eck after that. I can't really say whether to watch this movie or not, because that's it ... I don't know I can't find the word to sum it up. But if you decide to look at it, you can't simply prevent it.
