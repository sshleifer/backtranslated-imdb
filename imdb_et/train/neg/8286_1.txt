- = contains spoiler from both original and film versions = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre Dame De Paris, I also read a book this summer and I watched the movie today, at first I was hopeful to watch a good movie especially when i saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good but i actually waited for the theater scene directly from the book, but it was normal but when esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something wrong .. they don't know anything wrong ... a kiss in a book, even in a musical .. <br /> <br /> There was a huge gap in why Esmeralda was judged by a witch, in the book she taught her goat how to respond to the clock number or write the word "phoebus". wait, was there phoebus? in this film he has something of a soldier junk something, the creators made Quasimodo love to show off and they even canceled Frollo's love. But Notre dame was a frollo. his thoughts in his struggle against God for love and love in a human life movie we can't find is nothing we all have, some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts ... and not mentioning phoebus not to mention the love frollo, not to mention jehan (frollo brother) who didn't mention Esmeralda's mom (maybe it's OK, the story would have split a lot), they didn't even mention the real story .. (the other PS: frollo was not opus dei or some of the cult members he's actually interested in alchemy is trying to make gold ... he was stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> Finally, don't watch this movie, it's a manager's release for a real masterpiece, and if you are before watching the book, God is merciful, because you have to read right away. <br /> <br /> This film is inferior to the Notre Dame II animated film, which spends time watching the music of Notre Dame De Paris.
