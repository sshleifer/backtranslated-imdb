I'm a very spooky fan of the genre! I LOVE ALL KINDS OF HORROR / Slasher / Gore Flicks. Some of my favorites are really "good" bad horrors. But this movie has nothing to look at! I'm not going to talk a lot about what's wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The script is terrible. Operation is terrible. FX is not even worth discussing. "Set" is the absolute EVERY !! The sad thing is that I think some of the participants may have real potential, but that vehicle didn't work for them !!! and I feel abducted! The time you look at WASTE would be better if your cat was flossing.
