The family of terrible people must stay in the house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance, which goes to the servants who receive the inheritance only if they agree to accommodate and keep the house in order. People are dying (and if you try to sit through it) If you've ever had the desire to see bad participants - many who have poorly fit dentures, or are trying to act in a bad movie, it's your chance. It's just terrible. It is so bad that I thought Al Adamson, one of the worst directors, was leading it, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I don't want to say more about it, not because it's not polite, but since I start, I may not be able to. <br /> <br /> Avoid
