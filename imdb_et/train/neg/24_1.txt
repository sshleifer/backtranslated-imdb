I have to congratulate the genius who approved it. Edward Furlong, you are not as good as you think you can't grab the pieces of the cheaper Amateur Sugar, the only purpose of which is to get bucks. <br /> <br /> Filming is bad and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would achieve the same result or better. <br /> <br /> The actors just say: don't go to supermarkets looking for actors. Usually good grades or at least nice experiences come! Director. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please look in your life when you just have to suck. Your leadership is bad, the corners are all confused (not in good ways), the lines seem to have been read out of toilet paper and the fucking music .. it always comes up if it doesn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And by the way, don't go to the writer. Making movies is not like going to a cafe, it requires art and skills, things I doubt you ever have. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you would have shot it back into oblivion and wait until something good came. Or just look for a job in a caf√©. You have less stress and you save the movie visitors money and bad night. <br /> <br /> Vote: 1/10 (My First)
