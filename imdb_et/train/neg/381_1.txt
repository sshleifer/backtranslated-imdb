This film is a traditional Bollywood price that concerns the power of stars, sentimentality, and the triangle of love of emotions. What bothered me about this film was the absurd concept of the creators replaced by the mother. A whore who is born to a child after having sex with a child (a family wishing to have a baby) is not a substitute for the mother. Nor is he a replacement for a mother candidate. I have seen Indian films and TV shows made 10 to 15 years ago, which dealt with this issue more intelligently. The whole film concept is ridiculous and absolutely unlikely. I understand that most Bollywood movies aren't meant to be credible, but they're not pretending. This film wants us to emulate the characters, but it cannot be done with such a ridiculous conflict. I would have expected better Abbas and Black.
