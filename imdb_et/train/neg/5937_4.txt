Of course, if you ask a mother who is the most beautiful child in the world, she says her son is the most amazing boy in the world. He's right, at least in his world. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers were biggie's mother and her good friend Puffy. Do I have to say more? I break it for those who don't want to make a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can just put a couple of biggie MTV videos together and call it a movie. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real life looks like a dog. <br /> <br /> I just don't know why he called himself big. Big Body Small Dick? Big Mouth Small Sound? Big Fat Small Eyes? Disclaimer: I'm a colorful person. So keep your racist note yourself.
