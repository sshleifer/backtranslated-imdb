After reading the first 5 comments on IMDb, I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But this is really a terrible movie, all the time an alien sees is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is a cheap stop), the actor is over the story, oh boy, what's the story? <br /> <br /> The story doesn't seem to be on the trend, first they capture an alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why hell they tried it?). Then the girlfriend, who works the most, wants to walk out of this madness, maybe she doesn't, then she does and then she is not. Then they come to the conclusion that killing an alien kills all mankind (and remember that in all these years no other people have seen them permanently inhabited by aliens) and what do they do? They torture it and blow a lot of aliens. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very quickly, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, don't watch this movie.
