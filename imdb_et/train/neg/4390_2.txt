The TV program described the plot of SEVERED TIES, so: "The aborted hand test goes awry", so immediately I thought it was about a hand that has its own spirit, as seen with BEAST WITH OR FINGERS or HAND or someone who gets a hand like transplantation. Both rooms have been tested and more accurate, tired and tested, so I was curious about how manufacturers would go about the story. I thought they used PI as an arthouse film to use black-and-white photography at the beginning of the movie, but the makers seemed to be tired after 20 seconds and decided to make a similar comedy for the same time. I have said very little about it, except that I did not like EVIL DEAD movies and I did not like SEVERED TIES and it really seems unfair that such films use uncomfortable gum when the third world cries condoms
