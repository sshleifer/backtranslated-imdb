Firstly, it is a low-budget film, so my expectations were very low. I assume that most people who watch this movie's information just wanted a blood shot, and basically it is all. <br /> <br /> Plot? There is really no one. It's basically saw, but in China and all hell is much worse. Create? None, period. Special Effects? Absolutely terrible in my opinion ... It was loose and blood was often completely unbelievable due to quantities, splashes, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe that the purpose of this movie was to be a brutal, shocking film. Now it had great potential in a bigger budget, but bad scripting, bad dialogue, horrible action that seemed like a video camera and just an incredible "gore" made this movie really terrible. <br /> <br /> There are films that deserve some review, even "b-speed" films deserve some opportunities (for example, blood was the latest I saw for the prices that were worth it), but it was just terrible. I hope people who are considering this film will read my comment and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I am all for brutality and shock, but the general unreality and the really terrible act is terrible experience. Save your time and money and the opportunity to do something else, you don't have to be disappointed.
