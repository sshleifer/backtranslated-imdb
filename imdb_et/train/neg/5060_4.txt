This movie is the perfect adaptation to the English flick's incredibleness. Ashmit plays Richard Gere, Emran's role for Olivier and Malika, who is Lane's perfect cheating role. They have changed the film from the other side to adapt to the masses of India. <br /> <br /> Even when the film has complete traces of infidelity, even though it was unable to catch up with the original. It was cheap for soft porn Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed much more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more of these roles and was even the nickname for the serial number. In the future, when Indian directors intend to revive the English film, they will have to examine the plot's feasibility with Indian censors. Although the film was bombarded in the box, the participants got too much recognition. In the future, directors should be a little more cautious about reprocessing an Oscar candidate. <br /> <br /> Everyone said it wasn't a family movie, so take it with special care when you watch it at home with your family.
