Terrible movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just stuffed. The film was bad. Why do I have to expand it, which I don't know. It's already a waste of my time. I wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Effective sucking and writing is just moral. Bad in every sense. The only nice thing about the movie is Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even this was destroyed by terrible and unnecessary rape. The film is a poor and completely incredible rubbish. <br /> <br /> Now I just have an IMDb towel, so this silly rule has 10 lines of text. First of all, you waste that time watching the offspring. You will then be compelled to warn others to create an IMDb account just to discover that I have to write a friggen essay about the movie to express how bad it is. Completely unnecessary.
