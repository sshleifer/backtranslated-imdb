"Influential" is such a worthless flick that just hangs between cable channels that take up space, like a public library. The tricky little trick and the first effort for mediocre director Seidelman is bad film performance, bad sound, bad camera and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many of the better movies don't do it on the market, and why such spam can never and never seems to go away, one of the great secrets of life. (D-)
