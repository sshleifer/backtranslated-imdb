I chose this movie to replace the unpleasant choice of daily television and go with my thirsty fatales. Well, the previous one, it's better than a day of television .... though I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It's your points, but after about 20-30 minutes, good points out and come to the conclusion that they watch a movie made for television that put together not much time to do something that keeps together . In short, it's a terrible Sci Fi channel type movie. <br /> <br /> It has points like the future is dirty, as the "Blade Runner" showed ..... of course it's not "Blade Runner." the person I would like to be. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately it comes to a bad "Andromeda" rhythm, where the team consists of bad copies of "aliens" smart footballers, the mystic is vampire Willow sexually intensified and the new captain may also be like Jan -Michael Vincent, running around "Danger Island" "Banana Splits"; he just put on uniforms with epaulettes, he has very little right to it. All of them run around with their power shift inside a ship that looks like Eureka Maru because they fight "people "With a class that occupies the universe and is divided into several different tribes or sects. Evolutionary qualities ....... just like" Andromeda "Nietzsche. <br /> <br /> with e, but after a while it will feel like it took part as a hoot! Apparently he had fun, but it didn't help much. <br /> <br /> It's ..... okay. Let the DVD be viewed once without turning it off; if they watch it with ads, they are likely to switch channels. You could look at it once .......... but a few hours later, think about what it was that made them look at it all. <br /> <br /> For me it was femme fatale. ............ when he fought.
