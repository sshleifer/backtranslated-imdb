Oh man, I know what your thought is: "With that headline I can't go wrong!" Yes, you can. I also loved the title, but I hated a foolish boy who played "Satan's little helper". I hated my mother and sister / daughter and her boyfriend - I hated all these people! Man, it was sometimes embarrassing! The only reason it doesn't get 1/10 is to take a low budget, they did OK. But oh I hated those actors, so stupid! I knew it was bad, I think they saved a lot of money just for the killer to use halloween masks, and finally the costume of Jesus was too stupid. Oh, torment, don't look!
