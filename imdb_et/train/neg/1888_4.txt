This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another film of the work of art is a violent and radical approach to human nature. I didn't like the movie, but I can't say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I am also reminded of "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where the inhabitants of a camp on the sea in Belgium have a number of low-class characteristics. The same description of people who live together, alongside their wills and all reciprocal characters. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was a writer of natural science. I didn't like the movie and I don't like the people who are in it. They all look so vulgar, without the basic good taste. One might ask why they live, they all seem to be a member of the great farce on this planet, forced to live against their will. Or you can say: hell is in this world.
