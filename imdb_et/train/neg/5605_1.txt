I was very disappointed with this movie. I was expecting more Thelma and Louise female criminal film. Instead, women flee in captivity to have no loyalty to each other. They were extremely vulgar hydrogen packages that beat each other, doubled each other, and even filmed the rape of rape against other women. <br /> <br /> Instead of stealing thieves who kept their escape planning and finding hidden money, women fled too selfish and cruel to trust each other for a long time. These women were not released in a positive way. They just ended up with a lot of loose cannons who couldn't respect themselves or each other. If you like movies of 70's female criminals, skip this bomb and watch The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which stands for Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
