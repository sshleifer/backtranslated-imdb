First, I saw this movie when I was a 7-year-old Christian Scholl, where I participated. Needless to say, I was intimidated. Not because it was scary, but because of the content. I ... I was 7. Anyway, cinematography was pretty bad and the actor was funny. This is very bad given that I was only 7 and I remember it. One thing that still haunts me is that the terrible song "I want us all to be ready" where the cream ends "... you missed". I wouldn't recommend seeing it. I probably just for nostalgic reasons. Besides, I'm sure the remake is much better. However, the best part of this film must be when everyone "leaves"; free cars fall, lawn mowers work themselves ... quite fun.
