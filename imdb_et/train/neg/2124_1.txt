This film is about the Eddy story mentioned in the title and the visit of his old friends in the seaside community. The plot includes a group of friends, as it emerges that Eddy left as a tool to deal with a friend's death, where he / she feels some responsibility. But it is irrelevant because the choices made in production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Scenarios need not always be "dirty", but they should at least help to develop the story. Here's one set of attempts, like "he just took off" or "I know you don't have love for the heart," just wakes up at something worth the audience. Even when the writer feels the loss to go to the next, he cuts down on the main character's music production, which passes through the indie mood music of the fields. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, then the type that just gives quality and content just by style is not the film for you.
