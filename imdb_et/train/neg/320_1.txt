With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about a cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) who wants to be a cruise ship comedian. First of all, there is not one funny or clever line in the whole film. It's so unpleasant that it's pathetic. There is no surprising amount of raw material or sexual humor, but there is a lot of f-word. The budget is really low and it also destroys the film. It happens on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had the money to rent a small boat and had only 10 extra cash, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Opening credits are animated cheaply and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else who sees it hates it too. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. rated for R language.
