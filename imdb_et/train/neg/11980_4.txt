It was a disgrace for potentially big matches that were cut short. <br /> <br /> The opening game was a waste of Doom's Legion, but I think the only way to eliminate Demolition was to double DQ. Otherwise, Mr Perfect would have had to work overtime. Then I-C champion Kerry von Erich was wasted. And that was the third ppv in a row where Perfect ordered. Remember that he didn't lose the game before. <br /> <br /> The second game was very good, maybe the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were great, while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights who helped Honky Tonk Man. Whole Ware continued his tradition to be the first to put a new heel (remember Big Bossman and Yokozun?). This was a predictive example of Bret Hart's career as he came back to two and almost stayed in the game. He and DiBias put a wrestling clinic, forgetting that the race was deaf with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the seers were the first teams that all of their members lived (and only the second since the '87 four survivors), this game was not a squash. It was the longest game of the night and Jake repeated his '88 performance when he was alone with four men and dominated. I think he might have been upset. These days, the race would be over. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS competitions was one of the most surprising. It is possible that the least underestimated wrestler is Tito Santana, an inspiring wrestler at night, putting in place a military color and Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even a warlord. It was so strange that he saw him so overwhelmingly, then go back to his mediocre career. Sgt. Slaughter was also good, getting rid of Volkoff and Bushwhacker, but it was just no surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only point in the survival game was that Hogan and Warrior finally won. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the races were too big. short. Undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana is the reason I remember it.
