Having seen people behind the sun, I thought I was hoping for a style and a technical development that would match the wider scope of this film. I was also very interested in someone making a serious fact-based fictitious picture of what happened to its most famous Japanese cruelty, but that is not the case. It plays like the bottom of the 70's European Nazi movie. SS Experiment Camp, etc. (probably as a Special Department expelled woman). It is allowed to have more scope and more people to move around, but it is just as cheap and cheerful as there are many unhappy non-participants who fall over the ridiculously fake fires that are spiced up by a randomly mistaken "shock" sequence. Probably a terrible documentary has been struck between scenes so that these real images are largely robbed of their power. Watch the channel 4 "Holocaust" (recently (still in progress?), June 1, 2006) on a real disruptive documentary about war evil (real video material is in a great context). This is the type of treatment that Nanjing's horror deserves, not the hackneyed garbage of exploitation (a better-made film, which has been neglected by the disrespectful use of earlier film material, but it is not even a very good movie). Assessment: 3 (5 as use, 1 as subject treatment).
