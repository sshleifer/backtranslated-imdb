Not a bad movie, but not a big one. Kirk Douglas has recently been released from a prison cracker who, after canceling Mob's offer, decides to pull up the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem followed. Douglas and Gemma will soon find that the mafia goon Romano Puppo will continue to function, and the infinite patient friend of Douglas (Florinda Bolkan) will cling to a truly cozy triangle of love. Directed by Michele Lupo, the speed is fast and there is at least one excellent and creative chase for the car, which includes Puppo & Gemma. Although it is Italian production, it seems that most of the films are made in Germany. Douglas is good, not just sliding it in the Giallo layer. The striking Bolkan gives an excellent result. Music is performed by Ennio Morricone and cinematography is a great Tonino Dell Colli, who managed to work for everyone in Italy (Wertmuller and Fellini, Pasolini and Leone).
