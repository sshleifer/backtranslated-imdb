I love movies and I watch all the movies all the time to give him a chance. Finally, I can say I found a movie that I can't watch. The action is terribly obsolete and monotonous, CGI looks like a computer geek that did it in its mother's basement with minimal software, and ..... a long scene just ... walking !!!! And this movie is three hours long! I didn't do it even for 15 minutes until the DVD was fast forwarded. The scenes of aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of calling this "World War", it's called "War of Distant Distances". It cost $ 5 million! What are they spending money on a dramatic opening song? Oh, but in a positive case, one scene you have to look at when foreigners first kill people. It's fun, not because people are dying, but because they turn to the skeletons, they're still stuck for another 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So ... as I said, if you're a boring fan, covert, less-acting movies, here's one of your DVDs. But I didn't write it for you, I wrote it to billions of people who hate this movie. It's not worth your time or money. <br /> <br /> I know it's a book, but the book isn't so long and I'm a complete book worm / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Just get Steven Spielberg's version, it's not that good yet, but it's 10 times better than that !! <br /> <br /> I'll give it a fat out of 10 with zero.
