I always felt that a good movie should get a plot. This particular film was missing and I feel it would have been more efficient with the plot. This was made worse by the fact that it seemed to continue forever; I was worried that it would end. I noticed, however, that it was only 123 minutes long; it seemed for four hours. There was no plot there, but the film had no significant conflict. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I said it was up to "Fast and Crazy". So, don't think my review comes from someone who needs something but action. I hate most of today's movies; it's just that this movie is on the other side of the spectrum. It really doesn't happen in this movie. At the same time, landscapes and costumes were nice.
