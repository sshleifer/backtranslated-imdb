You can't imagine how I look forward to the King of Ants. As a massive fan of Gordon, I waited for the premiere of Europe in anticipation of evil. Especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon's last achievement - so much. The King of Ants was premiere here in my country and Gordon himself had to present it. Unfortunately, I couldn't congratulate her later. Antside King is by far his most intrusive and mediocre film. Indeed, the quality level never exceeded the usual TV thriller standards. The plot contour is terribly routine, and with the exception of some poor scenes, the typical Gordon-touch never recognizes. In addition, the weak script already has more holes than Swiss cheese cheese! This includes a young wannabe crook hired for murder. So he does.and of course they don't pay him. And of course he falls in love with the victim's husband.and of course he avenges himself. mention and they are the only ones to remind you that you are still watching Stuart Gordon's movie. Performing performances are lower than McCenna's heroic low life, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as a chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as a good heartbreak. Extremely illogical things are constantly happening and the mood of the story becomes very irritating, while make-up effects are not enough to satisfy even amateur-horror fans. I read some other comments about the King of the Ants, claiming that this is Gordon's best because it is finally a thought-provoking and mature film. much. Well, I think every good director ends up with steam and inspiration. It's also bad for Stuart Gordon.
