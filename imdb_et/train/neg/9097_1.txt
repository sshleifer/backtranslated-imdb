Who actually created this girl's worst movie I've ever seen in my life is a waste of time and money. I hate how they create the after-budget results that include D-Lister actors and a story that is so similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in a favorable container that sat right next to wild animals 2 and death Supermodels $ 2.99, what fools I really think it might be good, instead of looking nasty when hostile stereotypes that are a hidden story and script from the first. <br /> <br /> Who thought this straight-line production video was actually even half a decent movie you need to be crackd or something because I guess what most of the people who have seen this movie thinks what ANIMAL CRAP !!
