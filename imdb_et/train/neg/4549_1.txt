Amateurism describes the adaptation of the film of the best-selling philosophical novel "Celestine Prophecy" that follows the spiritual awakening of the graduate in a mysterious village in Peru. The quality of home video presents the so-called characters that burn burned exposure and metaphysical hockey, while the film is moved by Armand Mastroianni with extremely heavy hands. While there are obvious attempts to measure up to the strongest fans of ABC "Lost" or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code", filmmakers are hardly performing the task. This film represents the spiritual propaganda of ill-conceived mass consumption, and the results are so terrible that they can find a real point through this confusion.
