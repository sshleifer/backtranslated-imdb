VERY cumbersome, obvious, annoying exorcist-rip-off with red-eyed Doberman. Richard Crenna is about as lively as a toy. A very 70-year-old dress and music only adds torture. You should sleep almost as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Blue Hand". Practically worthless. MooCow says eaghhh what smelly dog! : 8P
