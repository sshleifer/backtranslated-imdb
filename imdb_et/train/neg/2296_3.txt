Back of Beyond takes place at the diving site / petrol station in the middle of an Australian desert led by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy man who unexpectedly arrives at a place where some visitors arrive unexpectedly. We get what seems confusing at first, as a setback, where he and his sister (although their relationship with each other is better understood later in the film) are picking up through their motorcycle desert. Later he appears in the presence of terribly quiet and sometimes moody arrivals. <br /> <br /> We know that one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's kind of spiritual feeling, its foresight and danger. such - his sociability is only a little relevant to the story, most of which are related to the three diamond thieves who break the car and rely on Tom to help them on the ground without doing so. Of course, Tom falls on one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly she strikes all three unreliable allies against each other. But not in a way that really brings about a lot of understanding or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to want to build something important all the time, but it really doesn't. Even the end that plays like a staircase story (and what really reveals many narrative mistakes) is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may not be worth trying. keep in mind the terribly slow pace, but at least the mood is something that is a little different than usual.
