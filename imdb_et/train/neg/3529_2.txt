I heard that this movie was more stylistic than Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) before the problem was that it was too stylistic. In principle, Jake Green (Jason Statham) will be released from prison alone after seven years, and within two years he will play the money. He's ready to look for revenge on the threat of a casino owner who got into Jake's prison, Dorothy. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, doctors say to Jake that he has three days to live because he dies of a rare blood disorder, and and Macha makes him hit. Borrowing Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) require Jake to pay back his money and do some strange work for them. The film is full of Jake's narration through some setbacks, and in the last three days before the great revelation of Zachi and Avi and Macha, I assume it was what it was. Terence Maynard also plays as Paul Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. These are sequences that contain a bit of animation, duplicate lines at different angles, and become speeds for moments, all of which are irritating to confusion and boredom, making it a stupid criminal drama. Pretty bad!
