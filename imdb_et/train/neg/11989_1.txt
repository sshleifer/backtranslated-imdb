This movie clip creates a new standard for making bad movies. Jared Rushton gives an inadequate result enough to create a very badly created character, thus creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The main thrust of the film is how the boy's temporary excursion in the Canadian desert after the survival of the anti-aircraft deterrent allows unpleasant adolescents to deal with their torture when they discover their mother's marriage. Unfortunately, this bizarre collage of casual "survival events" (including two particularly bearish scenes) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this boy is just sitting in a bank that dreams about this movie (and what is a nightmare!). In addition, despite the listeners of some of the film's observers, there are several scenes that are not suitable for watching very small children or families, including the underwater graphic scene of a dead pilot, where one of his eyes exploded. All in all, there is a terrible film that no one should be subjected to, much less innocent children.
