I have rarely been in such a nonsense film that should be based on an historical line. The terrible joke of the movie, I threw it over. Terrible, trite, distorted and devastating direct lies and half truths. <br /> <br /> The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was originally a film consultant. At the same time, he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded that they end their name as a source (it tortured him to think that people thought he was involved). <br /> <br /> One scene shows Hitler's beating his dog. There is no single source for this. Hitler loved people over people. He brought the most stringent animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal testing. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> Film makes Iron Cross a farce with bribe. Don't lie. He got him for a long time for repeated brave actions. <br /> <br /> There are no historical records showing that Hitler has ever had a sexual relationship with his brother. None of them are. <br /> <br /> Hitler is depicted as such a garbage rabby simpleton. <br /> <br /> If he was even half of ignorance, demented and thick as he is in this nonsense movie as in real life you don't even know that he has ever been. Do not forget that this is the German leader. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Go look at the Downhill and give it a very wide place.
