I gave this loooooooooooong movie "2" because of the attractive actors and half-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you cannot count as a quick counter, you will never be able to get subtitles trying to keep up with Spanish speed! And what happens to the devil if you can't read the subtitles. Endless nerves and eyes and constant rejection. Just after an hour boring. Some good cinematographic works, but also some so noteworthy that your screen is burned. How did it win something I never understand. It's hard to talk about "ACTING", because the executives seem to be on top of each other if they don't push each other out. The person Geraldo is so attractive that it is hard to believe that anyone wanted to take him away. And what is his mother? I just didn't get the time, except that there were three men with whom everyone seemed to have a history, but never thought who was "EX".
