I didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring out the news and ideas that L'Engle brought out in his novel. We had read the novel in my English class and I loved it, I fear I can't say the same about the movie. There were serious differences between the novel and the customized version, and it simply did not give any recognition to the imaginative genius of Madeleine L'Engle! That's why I gave him such a bad assessment. Don't watch this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle's texts because you are very disappointed. However, if you watch a movie for entertainment purposes (or education like my case), it's a boring film!
