I was waiting for this movie when it came out because I was a big SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I went, we saw people coming out of the show early, "Don't waste your money!" But of course we had to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Although there were some funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most seemed to have been seriously altered by having a fun 1 hour show. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer came, many people rose and walked out. It made me laugh because I realized that O'Donoghue just looked at people's buttons with this movie. Or else he was just crazy. Whatever - you don't have to waste this time, it's so bad.
