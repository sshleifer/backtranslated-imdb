The original "Cube" is a fantastic B-film that is rich in paranoia, meat testimonials and fine top performances. It's creepy, secret and cool. And it is quite good in itself, without a silly sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third (!) movie in the Cube series is partially re-protected (most wedge traps are unfortunately recycled), part of the aberration. It takes a bold step to explain what the cube is - something that never appeared in the first movie - but because the explanation is happier, it was rather considered a mystery. There are some potentially interesting references to a society that exists outside the cube, but they never make any clues about some kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So, what is a small social comment that seems flat and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically something. Action is purely an amateur hour, the pace is slow (how much does this movie consist of two nerds watching the screen?), And the gore effects, while reluctant, are not convincing. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of "Cube" fan-fic, sloppy and sophomoric good movie clone, which definitely does not need a sequel.
