How does Scottman love the bonny purple heather? Very, very carefully. Now I have a clear advantage over many other reviewers that I was born in Scotland. Too many Americans take this simpler mess seriously. It's a joke, people, "four feet good - two feet bad" like Orwell was. Jessica Lange has the emphasis that Wells - next-the-sea Amateur Dramatic Society "Brigadoon" production will start to fall. Liam Neeson - apparently popular amongst ladies - carries his sledge with the whole man whose grandmother stepped out of Edinburgh's Waverley train. And Auld's enemy? Where would the Scots hate without them and blame everything? Roth, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed of such racist stereotyping. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems like a masterpiece of historical accuracy. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
