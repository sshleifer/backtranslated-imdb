Avoid this mess at all costs. Bad script, bad control, bad performance, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get the idea? This movie is trying to be western, it's not. It's trying to be a violent core, it's not. It tries to present a fresh image to the old genre. The actors try the best there and my heart goes to them. But it is hard to do any shine to work on this kind of material. For me, this is first a test of a "fresh film school" that will bring the world down. Fresh filmmakers often bite more than they or their budget can chew. The best they can do is take a few steps back, reassess what is possible, and work on your limited budget next time.
