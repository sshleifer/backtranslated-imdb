Terrible, terrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat the old episodes of this program, which is beyond me. It really sucks! Of course I'm talking about the first two seasons. The first two seasons were golden, and when I only talked about these seasons, this exhibition would have been eight out of ten stars. No comedian who appeared after the first two seasons, who were not in the original cast, is not good. They were and are terrible. Comedy isn't funny at all. TRANSFER !!! The original was cast with very talented comedies such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever his name is) who would all have been better off on leaving MAD TV. This exhibition is very overpriced and less worthy of your channel's surfing time than Saturday night live, another terrible show. Go on Saturday night and have fun and leave the MAD TV wither and die as it deserves.
