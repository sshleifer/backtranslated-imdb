Like many other Bachchan fans, I was looking forward to Sholay's remake. This movie wasn't it. Thank God they don't let them use the title "Sholay" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. The camera works, places, costumes, totally inappropriate dancing, a dialogue that everyone combines to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You don't know if the participants agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal paid for the majority. The only non-paid actor, Ant, was the only similarity to the first film. Was Abisek's role completely ridiculous, did he need money to pay Ash for the wedding? Save your money, your mind and your time, don't worry about this movie or DVD when it comes out.
