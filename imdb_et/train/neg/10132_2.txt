STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The American army has recently launched a large new stealth fighter aircraft that can avoid others detection. The renaissance pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to keep the US government from ransom. So they are forced to send their best man to John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him in return for his freedom from a detention center, where he had to sweep all the ignorant data he had learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I missed Attack Force because I can say that the cover and all post-production counterfeits that had occurred were crappy and when all the negative reviews and low user ratings poured, it just confirmed what I was thinking. But I decided to go to the FOF because Shadow Man (by the same director) wasn't bad and what the hell, Seagal was my favorite page once and maybe, maybe maybe he could make a great movie again. Oh, what was stupid. <br /> <br /> Doping, a terrifying covert anti-aircraft fighter camera job, terrible work, cheap product values, irritating, compelling combat scenes that have become Seagale's trademark and a boring sleep-producing plot that doesn't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, which was once in hood (which I skip), ended with the end of a contract with Sony, which means that it is no longer about these awful European objective films and his next movie Prist of Pistols can mark the return of the theater. Hell, he's done it before and Stallone has managed to do it before (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> It's not rage. It's not even a fun flight. It's a flight that doesn't even take off the ground. *
