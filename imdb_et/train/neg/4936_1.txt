I wasted my time and gave this opportunity. It must be one of the worst new shows. If they give a prize to show that this is a miracle, this category should be wiped out. Action is bad and the story is built. Now the dinosaurs were a bit strange, but at least it was fun. This exhibition lasted three seasons and was finally covered. This new exhibition, based on ads by insurance companies, is not funny and does not really have anything. It is possible that the original ads and the number of times they were and will be repeated are wrong for this show. It just came on TV and we are already tired of seeing "caveman" signs.
