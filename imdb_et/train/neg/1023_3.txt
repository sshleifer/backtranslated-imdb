LL Cool J dealt with this movie, which I was expecting, much better! He did a fabulous job as a "renegade" policeman in the "renegade" department. From the very beginning, he has done a great job of creating the viewer's empathy with his character and uncertainty. He acts as a "gentle giant" - a person whose harsh exterior can frighten anyone but whose heart is clearly the right place from the start - and he does amazing work. He was the best character of the movie. <br /> <br /> It was definitely a performance that didn't win Morgan Freeman any prizes. After filming like Shawshank Redemption, this movie is definitely a step forward. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor - and in the collection of characters he sadly returned to the burner. There are so many ways in which his character (Moses Ashford) could have played a more important role. The fact that he was not disappointed and real shot. I was hoping to see him more in this movie. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should have been in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was bad and inadvertent. This film is a typical feature film that (at least in the beginning) resembles corrupt police issues. LA has experienced before. Being an action film, she has a role in shooting scenes, blood and guts. These scenes are usually unrealistic and hard to predict. Looking at the beginning of the film, there is very little tension about what will happen at the end - think about what you usually expect in a good police / bad police conflict - and it's a little like the REAL police shooting -out. <br /> <br /> What shook me the most was how Timberlake's character worked during the operational stages. He starts and doesn't use weapons. When he finally gets around, he uses it as if he had fired his life all the time. Then it ends with bullets and does not have a weapon - and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything else - suddenly there are two more loaded weapons AND extra ammo?! Small plot errors like this really destroyed the movie for me. <br /> <br /> If what you are looking for is a fantastically fictional fantasy in a world where everything is right, you probably love this movie. Personally, it doesn't matter to me what movie it is, if it is realistic. Make me believe that the story is true. This story was so obvious in so many aspects that I came out of dissatisfaction.
