Movies about dinosaurs can be fun. That's how Whoop's Goldberg movies get. What about Whoop and Dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of Theodore Rex, I came to one conclusion: this movie is bad. Evil, whistle, evil and deplorable against this audience. Nothing is an accident; this is the visual equivalent of the torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoop doesn't make good action movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers don't "Take care - he's still a tough policeman." <br /> <br /> One million policeman friends during the week? Well, here's one million and one, pal. <br /> <br /> I don't like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs because of this Spielberg TV show? he is also a policeman! Stahl, Roundtree) is stuck in a movie that looks like a tax exemption? BIG tax exemption? <br /> <br /> And you read the end of this review. WANT to follow. Seriously. <br /> < br /> No stars, and if they actually follow "Theodore Rex," the Hollywood attack deserves a whole wisely flaky foam dinosaur flock. <br /> <br /> Now I would pay to see it.
