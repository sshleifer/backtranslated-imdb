I never thought the film could be so cruel, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible action, terrible plot, terrible effect. The crocodile was terrible and in such a silly sex / killing scene it was a bad move from the word. It was really shocking and it is not a compliment! How can someone make this movie, watch it back and then actually say, "Yes, it's a good movie. People are watching that" If you haven't seen it, then I ask you to NOT: - (
