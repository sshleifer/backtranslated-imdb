I never forgot to see this movie. We were on the North Atlantic Patrol Submarine and it was an evening planned film. We all gave up after the second run. They didn't try to show it at night at night. Instead of doing it again ...... That's all I really say, but they have the stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines. I shouldn't comment on random words, so I just keep going until I get my ten BS lines. I didn't find George Goble listed under the credit, but I remember him in the movie. Torture was terrible and the songs were even worse.
