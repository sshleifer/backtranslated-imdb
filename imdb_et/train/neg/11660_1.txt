Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors I swear he has no real knowledge of making movies. he has made one brilliant movie and this is a scary film. The scary movie 2 was also OK, but all other Keenan has made real disasters. Avoid such titles as there is no threat to the south central drinking your juice hood ..... I know what the title is! probably also this movie, just something with Keenans name credit. <br /> <br /> It was an hour and a half in the foolish sense of a mess that never made me laugh. just trust me in this, maybe women might like this movie somewhat, because there are some things that happen but this movie never likes anyone with a good movie taste ........ jd Seaton
