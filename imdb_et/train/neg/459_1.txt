I was looking for time for a cute and simple comedy, but choosing this movie turned out to be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can't write anything about it. First, the script is stupid and not at all funny, based on tired, recycled jokes and a ridiculous turtle. In my book, it's not funny, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low budget "effects" (if I even call these effects) with terrible cinematography. In many places, it seems almost like an indie movie that hasn't received money. <br /> <br /> Act ... I'm sorry for the participants. Is Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for the money they have been involved in? (looking at their recent filmography, it seems so.) Despite the equipment, Pamela shows her age and, as a whole, they are not even as sexy, not to mention funny. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even so bad-it-on-funny category. It's just bad, as if all the people involved were ill. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
