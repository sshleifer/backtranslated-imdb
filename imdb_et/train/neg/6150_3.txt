I saw this movie with the aim not to like it. I'm not sure. It is one of those films that seems to have been made only for the Oscars: music on the entire film in almost every single frame, almost any kind of intimidation, lost time, sepia tone design, pretentious title, NO SEX and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes sfx / cgi, so we (stupid audience) get it. One thing I was interested in was that they wrote NOBEL PRICE! Instead, they call the Nobel price (named after the real person called Alfred Nobel) a "worthy price" .. Jesus! How can such a big production make such an error based on supposedly true creation. What a Fraud! What did you and others think of RON?
