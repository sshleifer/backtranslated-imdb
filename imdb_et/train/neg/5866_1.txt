I remember this movie when I was 13 years old (it seems that many comments say the same thing AGE 13!) With group school friends. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in her first film and fell for the typical commercial ads that told us it was a great comedy. We suffered after about 45 minutes and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from Billy Crystal having to laugh at us, we didn't laugh. I accidentally hit this survey and decided to register to tell the rest of the world what it was a rogue explosive, now that you rent it, you deserve what you get.
