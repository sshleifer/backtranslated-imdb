Pathetic ... worse than a bad TV movie. I can't believe Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason, Morgan Freeman talks about his character constantly and says "pussy" when referring to NSync's boyfriend. Morgan Freeman, who called women "pussy", is just uncomfortable ... What the hell were the people thinking behind this movie? Too many plot holes to imagine a combination of fearful, confusing corner of the camera, flat script and cheap background music made this movie completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I rented this flop with low expectations .... but. .. well ... it actually suck.
