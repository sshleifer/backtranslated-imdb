How Grinch stole the Christmas was a great little Christmas decoration that everyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for the rework. Not to mention the remake made with people, the cartoon was perfect enough, what is the purpose of this movie? But Jim Carrey seemed to be Grinch. I mean, he's a great comedian actor, but he's Grinch? It made no sense to me. His presentation was slightly up and inadvertently ridiculous at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialogues, it was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou, who was over and not needed. They just destroyed the story, the period. <br /> <br /> Everybody who's ready for Whovill is still preparing for his best Christmas, where everything is perfect. But Cindy Lou-Kes is curious and worried about Grinch, who lives on them, and she's not going to be as good as Christmas. He strikes him out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this Christmas and that he should just steal everything for Christmas to show who is his Christmas version. But soon he will understand that who can find out that this is a bit more than what is a real version of Christmas. I really recommend that you stay in the comic simply because it is a rather annoying version, at least in my opinion. The whole structure and presentation of the movie was just over, not to mention how Grinch stole Christmas! was meant to be a comic rather than Jim Carry starring. But at least this version makes you grateful for every version of Boris Karloff played at Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
