He made this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival a regrettable mistake. It was well shot from the start, but this is the last positive comment I have about the film. The act was terrible, I don't know if the actual Gogo girls were hired? But it was a really ridiculous plot, in fact it was ridiculous and not boring, that's the only reason I gave it 3/10. I just want to mention some scenes that smiled the audience. badly. A true eye opener. <br /> <br /> Getting a bus ride: The girl gets on the bus. But the music ends with the world. <br /> <br /> Roll Rolling: Wow, it really shows the plot writer skills. In a room followed by raw meat and skill sales. Why not just get all three "sins" at once? At least the film may be somewhat shorter. <br /> <br /> Driving down the stairs of the mall: see how one of the girls is flying along the flesh that Dau eats, not waiting. he's just * walking fast, trying not to break his nails. <br /> <br /> Bloody Race: This is definitely my favorite scene and the end of the movie. Half marathon in red, plus a staircase and a bridge over the driving car. Not only this, but this suicide is made by the most self-assured girl in the movie, now it's characteristic for you. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was created for 16-year-olds and their companions. Unfortunately, this has not met with the judge at the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're a sarcastic mood and laughing with some guys, you still don't. even think about it.
