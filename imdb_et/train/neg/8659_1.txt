There are some things I never understand. Like this movie. What if I were to create a really cheap and outrageous Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya, and then I would continue to cut and paste it on an amateur video that people call and eat the same thing? How can anybody even believe that a completely unfair CGI dinocroc that looks completely outside would affect the events of this movie? I know that its B-class, low budget, and all but the manufacturers, could do better than do that no one can see or see. It just doesn't make sense. Are people really so foolish to sit through it? Probably so. Laughs? No, it's not worth it.
