Another famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) hasn't been filming for four years. When he is invited to take part in a new project, he asks the director's clumsy cousin to fall into his poor Latin neighborhood, Carlson, to investigate the work of a small grocery store manager. He sees a wonderful Spanish Scarlet (Paz Vega) and is interested in his ability. His leader does not return him and Scarlet gives the actor a ride. But first he has a job interview for the secretary of the construction company and the actor helps him prepare; then they spend a pleasant time in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> I'm a great Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega fan. But the pointless "10 or less" is completely disappointing. This low-budget movie does not seem to be hidden and is supported by Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega chemistry and improvisation, and in fact nothing happens in 82 minutes. The vague open conclusion is simply ridiculous, as Morgan Freeman returns to his world with his spoon of silver and tells the simple worker that they cannot see each other again. Was he afraid he would have a love relationship with him and would destroy his perfect world with his family? Or was there a class collision, and he understands that his fancy neighborhood is not suited to a lower class simple worker? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("Star in my life")
