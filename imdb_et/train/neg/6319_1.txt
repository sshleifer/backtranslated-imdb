This film reminds me of how college students protested against the Vietnam War. As President Cow Dung Collehe did without cheeseburgers, the president immediately began to change the entire US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that, although dangerous, the concept of politics. Based on whether the USSR and the US were fighting, this could mean the end of the world, WORK. The US and USSR never waged war. <br /> <br /> If we were just conventional weapons, it would be unthinkable to have another war, a "powerful" war in Europe and Asia, unthinkable. <br /> No that I think they should get rid of this movie. Film students should see this as an excellent example of "How not to make a movie." <br /> <br /> It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
