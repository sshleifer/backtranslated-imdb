Much has been done about using Rohmer's digital technology to "fill" the background. Sometimes it works well, a scene where Grace and her maiden witness are particularly prominent in the execution of the king. At other times, it gives the film a strangely amateurish look that resembles a home video. The biggest failure, however, is that the artificial artificiality of the scenes creates an alienating effect on the viewer. We know what we look at is not real, so how do we know the characters? Frankly, I don't care at all about what happened to Lady or the Duke. <br /> <br /> Another big failure, I'm sorry to say, is at the forefront of Lucy Russell. He is in almost every scene and for the success of the film or for any other reason, he is his production. OK, he speaks a foreign language, but he can't express a real emotion. His emotion in the scene where he talks to his friend Mme de Meyler (debutant Helena Dubiel's superb power), seeing his head in the head caused the audience a laughing laugh. See also his hand when he expresses emotions! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very disappointing movie, especially considering the positive comments on this site.
