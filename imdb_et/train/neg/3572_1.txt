The wonderful "Z" channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora movie about six months after "Butterfly". I had such great hopes for the actor, and then she goes badly out of this movie in the WORSE. <br /> <br /> Again, it was in the 80s and I have to tell you that Harold Robbin's work was smarter. . Jacqueline Susann pulled her in (she hated her writing), Irwin Shaw's work with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had a kingdom in the early 1970s and then came Jackie Collins, who made women stronger and more equal for men in every way in their books, even more. That's why this work melts. Harold Robbin's work in the 80s just didn't hit the audience. Pia Zadora, who worked in Robbin's work, was like throwing kerosene on fire. Support was not helpful either. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was terrible to watch and even 20 years later, it seems even worse. I had hope for Piale as an actor and it all hit when it was done. It would be difficult for Pia to let her act as an actor (although John Waters put her on a "hair spray" spark), although she has a nice singing voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go on a tour! Join the show. You might be the greatest return story. <br /> <br /> I hope they will burn this movie when you do.
