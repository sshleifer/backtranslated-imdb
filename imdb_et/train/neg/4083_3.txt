I saw this movie when it appeared, and my frenzy about it has been with me during those years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be to take every literary image into Tempest and make it written. If any sign would say, "My heart takes a flight," we would have shown the actual human heart to which the dove's wings are attached, flipping over the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes some lush tables, but ultimately it is a simple exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I am not forbearing what other viewers found in this movie, but it is worth noting that not all audience viewers were exhausted.
