One friend told me that during the film, there was an independent film where the audience was so angry that they were ripping before the cinema seats. Of course, my imagination ran, trying to create the content of such work. Well, now is my imagination to rest. <br /> <br /> I am a lifelong Andrei Tarkovky fan and an amazing admirer of his work. I have met many people who thought that Tarkovsky's films are slowly moving and inert. The opinions they have have found that this does not apply to the late works of the great director, made with meaning, beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. Listening to Alexander Sokurov as the successor of Tarkovsky, I was glad to experience my films. <br /> <br /> Except for the field fields (Stalker), this film has nothing to do with anything with Tarkovski. It does not seem to have the slightest meaning even at a totally pointless level. This is supposedly a "gorgeous stark" cinematography lacking any composition in the craft. There is no balance, no proportion, and the measurement of exposure seems to be low for cold-storage batteries. The main character is so inaccurate and indecisive; <br /> <br /> I am also not unfavorable for non-plots or stories that progress in many linear ways. But there's not even a non-story here. Watching this movie must definitely be a shaved head if no one comes out of it and nothing will be lost, because pulling hair would be the only possible response at a pace that could see Tarkosky's sculpture as Jerry Bruckheimer filmed in Charlie Chaplin in a short time. <br /> <br /> I do not exclude that it may be one of Sokurov's stinkers (Tarkovski Solaris), but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovski's heirs about this film - would call Paris Hilton the descendant of Aristotle. C'mon guys, don't be afraid to say it. No large number of impressive words will magically return this celluloid body. I do not admit that I fully understand Russian culture and I do not obviously have Russian values, but I immediately started Tarkovsky's work like magic, treasure and gift to the audience. <br /> <br /> If it didn't have the name of Sokurov, and it was said that he was living on Saturday night, I'm pretty sure nobody reads all those great analyzes on this damp noodle.
