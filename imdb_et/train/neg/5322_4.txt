There are two types of musicals of the 1950s. First of all, you have glossy MGM productions with great names and great music. And then you will have a smaller league with lesser-known, less famous musicians and second-class managers. "The girl can't help it" belongs to the latter category. Tom Ewell and Edmond O'Brien did not become famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for him. It seems that every decade has its part in Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is thin because it is not helpful to suspect that it is usually an attempt to sell recordings in Fats Domino, Little Richard, or other 1950s rock actions. If this music turns to you, you should look at it. If not, don't worry.
