This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It is bad even for TV movie-level standards. The plot is abusive and the known names of this film are wasted in confusing characters. I don't know how the director managed to keep this movie sorry - it's so bad. Settled as a "Psychological Horror Thriller" - it is definitely terrible. Nothing is exciting about this. And it can make you psychological damage! Initial opening scenes made such a promise - possible capture, whether the soul is just a brain aspect, but the ultimate fears after the car scene are incredible. No matter how hard you try, you don't care less about the characters. There are so many scattered ideas that the film is, at best, a collage of phrases by Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case, it makes Brain Dead movie! <br /> <br /> I have bought over 300 movies from the DVD, and this is the first thing I get back to my money. STEER CLEAR.
