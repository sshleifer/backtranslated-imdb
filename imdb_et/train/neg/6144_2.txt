Ironically, although he can "crack", Thomas is a full actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the most cheesy and incompetent movies I've ever seen in my memory. As such, I am actually against it. However, the only reason for it to become more than one star is that Thomas is in great shape and fun to see his small, muscular body that performs various gymnastics opportunities between strange stones and posts in the Eastern European countryside (including the infamous) Bomb Horse "A hump in the middle of the village, which Thomas uses on the face of a variety of crazy villagers to plant his feet). But let the poor man open his mouth and try to emulate, and any illusion that he may have a film career immediately breaks the bits. <br /> <br /> Thomas had at least an excuse for not actually acting. All the others in the movie - actors, director, editor, camera boys, etc. are at least as bad or even worse and most of them are professionals. So Kurt doesn't come out as badly as you think. I hope the poor Kurt took the money and ran. If somebody asks him to play again in the martial arts, I'll bet Thomas will hit his face.
