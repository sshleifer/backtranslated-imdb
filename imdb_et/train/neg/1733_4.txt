SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (black and white) <br /> > "Hornophobia" Ollie starts a "peaceful" boat trip, but he and Stan are mixed up with a fugitive convict (Rychard Cramer). Chaos followed. <br /> <br /> This feature-length comedy - OK Entry, which in turn unspools, just like imitating Laurel's and Hardy's best work, marked L&H and the producer Hal Roach for the ultimate collaboration. An episodic structure that culminates in a memorable voyage after boys have been hostage to a criminal, Cramer (who lets the log prove how hard it is!). The gags are right, but there is no inspiration, maybe thanks to actor-turned director Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for Ollie's first solo ambition for the sound of the day (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here is not pzazz. Fair, but something special. L & H's decent Charlie Hall and James Finlayson will present guests.
