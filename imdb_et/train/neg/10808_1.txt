At the age of 8, I got the version of Kazama's book and people always say that versions of the book are always better than the film, but this time they were wrong. At least with the film, it will soon be over. <br /> <br /> By doing this, it is terrible what I expected from a Shaq movie who plays a magical rapper solution that comes out of the old gettopaster (which was probably the good reason he got trapped there). The movie Max is a bright and terrible actor. She has been harassing the children of the neighboring countries I am not blaming them for because she is a small shower bag. <br /> <br /> The story is just stupid and extremely clich√©. One of the boys who has always been a father and never around who finds a new friend who will make his life better and eventually he will get back to his father again. <br /> <br /> Even at the age of 8, I thought it was a stupid idea. It is a surprise that any person who worked on this film was post-career because it was embarrassing and should never have been done. I could talk more about how this film sucks, but you should already know when to read the plot.
