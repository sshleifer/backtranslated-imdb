I noticed that this film has taken a lot of insults. He probably earned some of them, but it wasn't that bad. I'm honest: I never want to see this movie. It was a bad movie. But I don't hate this movie, he tried to tell the story. Drama can actually make this movie work well. I just think the filmmakers misjudged the path they did when they did (they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy). Rewriting could have been a great movie. But as a satire, it didn't work in its present form - many scenes didn't fit the plot's context: for example, there was no point in the story of the robbery. However, this was not the worst independent film ever made - is it the Top 10 worst? This is debatable.
