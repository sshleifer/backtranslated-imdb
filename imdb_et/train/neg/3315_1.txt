Bah. Another tired, hopeless recycle of non-copyright works that are never intended to be filmed. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Toni Collette is great, as always (being an actual actor, you see), and there are some nicely handled transfer cuts between scenes. There are even some really funny features and the film material, the score and the editing are competent, except for strange talking and speaking with the camera to make a conclusion. <br /> <br /> But, ah, but. Much of the downfall seems to be on autopilot and they are almost all very clearly old (and in one case too young) by their age. Worse still, they all talk about "Austinese", this peculiar falsetto herself is singing a song that can't be beyond how people actually talked about Austen's day (think of Yosemite Sam, I'm not a boy). This is especially sad, given that we finally see that the death of the equally farsic "Fakespearan" seems to mean that Olivier and his crowns were both in the lungs with their lungs. <br /> <br /> And the worst is Gwyneth Paltrow. He has played only one character in his films and remains here for ten minutes throughout his entire range of fun, then repeats himself for the rest of the long film. There is absolutely no chemistry between him and his admirers, as well as any obvious reason why they would be interested. <br /> <br /> In short, there is very little reason to look at Emma. This is a pretty friendly adaptation, but if you intend to wrap an anachronism full film (ie an amazingly thin lead that can't take a bow or handle a period accent), then you can do it just as well as much better "Clueless".
