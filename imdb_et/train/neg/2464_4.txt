The beloved first part, the Impossible Planet, but contempt for the second part of disappointment "Satan's Pit". Something that probably emerged from the well was not - it didn't come out of the well. Then the outdated openings in the air spent the story, the beast was a nuisance, so there was no doctor / villain I would have expected. The TARDIS is somehow inside the well, despite the fact that the well does not open long after TARDIS fell through the crust of the planet. And finally, another ready-made solution that existed for a logical reason - I wonder why not to penetrate the beast's hole as soon as the hole was opened? Why not force him in all these years instead of imprisoning him. Why not - I could go, but I lost interest ...
