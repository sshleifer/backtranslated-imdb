Anyone who saw the original 1970 film knows how great the cast, the script and the director can put together a comedy masterpiece. Similarly, it's easy to see how this opposite can create another amazing Hollywood-a-thon! This movie was pathetic! If John Cleese (comic genius) hadn't been, I would have gone to this terrible cellulose waste for about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Simon does not write yet another scenario for this version that he was unable to fix it for the first time, and I'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he didn't complain about humor! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did a great job for the manufacturers when they threw it? How could the director and the editor watch these scenes and think some of them were funny? I don't know, but one thing I know --- it's not surprising why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular .......
