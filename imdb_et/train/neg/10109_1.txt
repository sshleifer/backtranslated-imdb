BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; The man leaves out the absolute rubbish and the ironic thing he loves his mess. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Ulli Lommel's movie, but I was so surprised how everyone thinks his things are so terrible. Like the movies I said, it's not even six months at first! After reading the comments I was curious how bad this guy really is. He's the worst out there. <br /> <br /> Credits don't stop when a pathetic movie started and I quickly noticed that the dubbing was incredibly poor. The procedure was incredibly horrible and the same in camera shots. Editing is easily the worst. This movie didn't make sense, and I couldn't tolerate it anymore because it wouldn't end and I was in the movie for only 45 minutes. I couldn't take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life.
