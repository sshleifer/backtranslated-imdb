OMG is one of the worst films ever seen and iv has seen a lot of being a film student. I don't understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did he need that money badly? I love AJ and I have seen almost everything he has ever been so I watched it point out another. It was bad! not even bad bad. It was 1 or 2 funny moments, but overall it was a waste of 101 minutes. I can't even say that AJ seemed good at it because he didn't do it well. The plot is predictable, unless you expect to talk to Rome and Julia again. All the disappointment. Maybe if your 12 could be a good movie, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
