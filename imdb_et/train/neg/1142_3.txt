You are frustrated and beaten by my harsh statements about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals"! Now there is another breed in the discovery of disappointment: ninja movies! Many of those I have seen before and let me tell you that they are not all cracked! This is usually not the point. It is not originality among all others! What is Ninja related to nuclear weapons prevention in Russia? And shouldn't it also be a "martial arts" movie? Does a number of fires sound like an incredible action movie? Is blood the number one reason to love this death? Are you wasting some of your hard-earned money on the song of your song on your sight tank? Answers to these important questions are found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in your video shop martial arts section. For even more nonsense ninja fun, try checking out Godfrey Ho's films that Trans World put out. You get what you deserve, and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
