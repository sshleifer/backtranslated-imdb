I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I don't know what keeps me in my seat. I think I was just waiting for Gere's movie to have some value at last, but nothing came out on the screen. The story is a silly excuse for kicking off after bondage and torture. There is no real life in the film. Cutting "style" based on jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this aurid setup gang sadists probably works for free for years and SURPRISE driver is "victim" of condemned killer. I don't see how Buddhist Gere participated in this violent, sexist trash.
