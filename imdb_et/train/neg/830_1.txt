I really do not understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst film I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this movie. But I don't think it's his own fault, but the directors. He has somehow managed to make everything artificial; their action, idea, make-up, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is just a movie idea that was very bad. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this crap, look at Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
