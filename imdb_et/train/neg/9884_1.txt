I've been without a Trace fan for the premiere episode. I can't really express my disappointment last week. It is a real problem that too many African-American families have been engaged and continue to deal with them. A recent study has documented a lack of media coverage, which is a priority within 48 hours. Law enforcement, including local, national and federal, is also complicit. What was the purpose of advertising this topic and then terminating it? Television seems to be able to deal with almost nothing but RACE. It's disgraceful. Take it together or do it next time.
