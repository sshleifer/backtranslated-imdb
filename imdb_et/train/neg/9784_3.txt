Me, my friends, and I saw this movie only with the title. It's cute, though obvious, when it's on the plot and in the direction of the movie, where the film takes place in the first five minutes. My main argument with the plot is that although it is tolerantly consistent, they never explain much to the characters. Alcoholic father, superfluous mother, stressed the nurse ... this is a bad family, but aside from the occasionally mentioned nurse there is no resolution. I was also confused with the bottle scene ... it seemed quite random. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary problem ... the children were not bad actors, but their script was much desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a lovely niche movie, one was set aside, a special blaa effect, flat scripting, and obviously an obvious plot.
