According to IMDb, Takashi Miike's Horror Master Class, Imprint, was banned in the US. So I thought I'd translate the Swedish review I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> The Takashi Miike episode of the Ichi The Killer director was hard. series. And Imprint's DVD cover was really promising. <br /> <br /> The story is mostly in Japanese bordellos, for a while in the 19th century, and it tells a journalist who is looking for a como, a woman she has left behind and whom she promised to come back to. Tired and abandoned, he arrives at the brothel, hoping it is the end of his very long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and quiet girl knows Komom, and a desperate man tells him where he is and what happened to him because he has left. The story she tells her is just as regrettable as it is hard to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me on the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the vast majority of the Japanese spoke freely to America language. -English. But I leave it to it, it's not that big a thing. But what a big deal is, how unhappy this rest was. Miike's story moves so slowly that I couldn't watch my watch many times in 63 minutes. The extended rotation scene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the film seemed so unmotivated - and pornographic intrusive - that even the scene didn't become interesting. I felt it was violent just for the sake of violence - without style or purpose. The only scenes that made me any emotion were the images of the bloody fetus that rolled into the bottom of the flowing water ... and frankly, the only emotions they provoked were disgusting. <br /> <br /> A journalist looking for the love he left behind is Billy Drago, who is most memorable than Frank Nitti - Al Capones, who is Brian De Palmas in The Untouchables (1987). I've always found that portraying Drag from Nity is very icy (and I mean it well), and that's probably why I was almost annoyed when I found that he was so terrible (not a good way). one. His action seems to be not moving between any lesson or empathy to show some really bad excess actions. If his character should respond to terrible things, Komomo has been sitting on the couch, turning and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible workforce Drago has put out. I am grateful that most of the story has been said by Yuoki Kudoh (Memories of 2005) who is playing a deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> Finale is probably hidden, maybe even nasty and terrible, but I just found it to be ... you know ... "blah" (and I looked at my watch again, umptieth for the time, just wishing the crappy episode ended). Maybe the finale was a bit of a smile for me, but it's just because I couldn't think of the episode of the red dwarf and Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, whose eyes were muscled. they look like aliens ... Lucky you when you've seen this episode and now you decide to see Imprint, I've eternally destroyed your end visuals. <br /> <br /> My first thought when Ultimately came to the impression that the only thing that made it work hard was Edward Shearmur's main title theme (the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series) and that something - is a big friggin warning, don't you think? <br /> <br /> You can draw attention to Michiko Kitamura's costume design and say that there is at least something that is not in style and precisely lacking. ... but there are so many other movies and TV shows that are so much better than the Japanese "gay" fashion show. It's nothing but worse and I'm disappointed. Takashi Miike's masters of horror episodes are boring, uninspiring and meaningless. In other words; That's really BAD!
