How did Mike Hammer live - a penthouse with GOLF BAG that was placed beside the corner next to the large-screen cathode-ray television and snazzy fireplace? Nah, he would kick back the bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the inflatable sofa or floor of his airplane, or the scum of the Lous in the center of the city, wiping the dried red crust and the oil of the dirty mud off his face like that. Spillane certainly wrote in the trash, but how do you make it worse? Give some desperate producers a blank check, because he thinks that every film called Noir, a crap sells to the office, adds some hot tomatoes over the hill, and just hits the story through a retard, a drug screen writer, like that!
