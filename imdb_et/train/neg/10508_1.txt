I thought the lowest of the horror movie was achieved with the book of shadows, I was wrong. This film looks like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" as compared to the shameless, uncleaned feces that are terrible to call themselves a movie. I'd write more, but I'm still angry that I had enough idiot to spend Â£ 3 on renting, spirals. <br /> <br /> And were these people English? and where the forest is> I have lived in the UK for two thirds of my life and as far as I know there are no dark open forest areas in the middle islands. The whole bally thing seemed like a plant of conifers of national faith. These angels looked like anorexic pornstars (most of them, I did my research). But I liked it a bit when Judd hung up. <br /> <br /> P.S I love and admire Tom Savin, but he can't do it
