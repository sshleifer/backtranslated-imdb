Oh fun! Oh joy! Another bad movie is so good! Or so I thought. In fact, it misses the "so bad of its good" phase and unfortunately goes straight "may be as bad as it is good, but they turned it up and made it bad". <br /> <br /> Too long to get started. Cut half an hour and it could have been more durable. Then put such ridiculous plots as "a man who sabotages the mission to save the earth because he has all the food supplies and he is abundant if the mission fails!" Duh! Or "chat" plot device that was last seen in Dark Star. Guess what ... as in Dark Star, the bomb is broken ..... hmmmm. Add "we can't play in kindergarten" and add a brief summary of the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> You need to make the lighting in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants as we called him in this flick) whose only purpose in the movie is to guide the boy around the desert and call the child's father to call him out. ... in the end. Between driving and calling, Jack shares meaningless generations and letters and strikes a lot, but it does little to help the story as it is. In short, he is the best bonus in the movie. <br /> <br /> My prize "The Most Chronic Line Directly Directed" goes to Charlton Heston, who, with his eldest son meeting for the first time in a meeting, comments that his son looks a bit "out of shape" while he is standing there with its intestine, which swells over the waist and needs captain Kirk corset. <br /> <br /> Fun is also a bad guy. top hermanman with a bright white hairstyle that made me think of Andy Warhol for some reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to these funs, this movie is not recommended. The end is a sequence that is copied (but gracefully shorter) from the final sequence since 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips for enjoying this movie more than you are foolish enough to watch it like I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Every time a bomb speaks, imagine it is called Tarquin (trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. When Chuck Heston is on the screen and speaks, he will complain to him when he recalls a line Monkey Planet Like "Take your dirty paws out of me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. When a female driver is stressed (this is most of the time), hope for hope that she has aneurysm and will die soon. <br /> <br /> 4. The infinite "ship broke again" scenes with the hope that tech / engineering boys will pull Scotty like "You can change the laws of physics!" or some kind of mess. <br /> <br /> In addition, do what it takes. I went down and woke up to realize that I hadn't forgotten anything, nor was the plot (although ridiculous) developed. So don't worry with a few voices, you won't miss anything.
