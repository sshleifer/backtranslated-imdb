in this movie was the truth. I remember the story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fishermen who found the body in the water and decided not to report until their trip was over. I also recall that they were accused of mixing the body (or some of those charges). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside of Australia think we live in a country with rape and seraphic murder. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this understanding. The film reminded me of a simple plan. But if one of Australia's best films has ever been, as someone claimed, I can't be so generous. Put it this way, I didn't want to look at it again.
