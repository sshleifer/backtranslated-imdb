No matter how well his "message" - this movie is terribly done train damage - terrible action, flat camera work - I don't know why Carr agreed to try and fight - he's bad about it. You watch the extras of DVDs and how he follows the camera, he watches him - he just sucks it - he loves to be the center of attention. He's a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some of Carr has had this movie shown in the city's youth centers and New Age churches - where damaged people who are looking for reinforcement and attention are burning how the film touched them and maybe did it - but in the form of a movie it is inconvenient, predictable and delicate.
