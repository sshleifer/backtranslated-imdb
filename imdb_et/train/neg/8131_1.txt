If the title is not supposed to be some kind of spoiler for transforming a woman (races!). Anyway, if this movie wasn't Made-For-TV, it should have been, it's so remarkably low budget, undervalued, undervalued, and hits every 70's clich√©s after the disc. No one is pleasant, and you could be careless about what happens to anyone. Especially forgotten, except for bad, bad performances.
