What made me watch this movie in Vampyres, I thought I had to get the other movies that this man (Larroz) did, I was sorry I watched it, this is a weak test of the occult / satanic type sex and the only sex (this is an ugly actor and actor, this is an excuse to defeat. The only redemption factor was the device and the atmosphere, to avoid it, too much leap surrounded it, not worth it to find. I hope he has some other movies that live in Vampyres Everything, Oh and the goat scene was very boring, I understand that this is the one that carries a leap.
