This effort was like a luminous TV movie ... I never remember getting rid of it in theaters ... If so, he must die quickly. Looking at the DVD, it was obvious in our bedroom that this movie was not meant to be much more ... Ed Lauter is an art historian who has lines of greed? What a fun time that was supposed to be ... I have not seen Ed "from the longest yard" ... All the others, except for Bompwin's numbers, except Pompeo, acted quite a lot ... Pompeo's daughter was one dimension ... she played every a scene like a loving little puppy ... the slowest delivery to any 3-year-old I have seen ... <br /> <br /> Chase scenes gave my wife and me a headache ... too much fast cutting and angle Undercutting ... If you are planning a scene in Barcelona, ​​you may want some WIDE shots to take advantage of your background beauty, right? The whole story was quite unlikely and far removed, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
