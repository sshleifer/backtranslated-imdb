As long as you suffer! If you like to wake up, get up, dress, shower, prepare dinner, look at each other, have sex in the dark, then go to bed to sleep ... if you like sticky apartments, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, long quiet minutes. If you like two hours of getting bored, you will feel the excitement of "true intimate wrong art" then you like it. But if you don't, try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you're here," but do we want to stay? This German film received a prize from the Turin Gay Film Festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision because the festival presented many talented films. Maybe German would be good because they often don't get prizes? Well, "the lives of others" did ... but it's great, but not gay. So maybe it's fashion. Germans are they again? Whatever? Or maybe just a glimpse of some of the drivers?
