This movie was overwhelming. Many viewers who thought it was "amazing" have to be in the old school movies because the whole movie is over. First of all, I thought the film had just shown something from the past, so I was expecting it to be embarrassed like the illumination of characters, but it just goes. Basically, it was a movie that tried to mix the future with the past, and the two didn't mix it well, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen the participants worked on. There are too many movies that do what this movie did, so there is no reason for the critics to mortgage this movie, saying, "This is the biggest movie ever made". It's just a stick. It also didn't help that story was buggy. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to the creation of this film, and I do not understand how the actors / actors in this movie are ready to be in such a movie. It's almost like everybody reading the script and forgetting to read the fine print ... "It's all done on the computer". It was a film that should have been on the film network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm happy with myself to see this money. Whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
