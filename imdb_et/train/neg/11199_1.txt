The tense pace of this film tells us about any shocks it can offer. There was no real relationship. Most of the symbols were vague. Busty Irish priest was as flat as love. Interest is misleading. The girl they chose the sensuality of the film could be better. The central conflict of the main character did not participate. This film is not entirely positive. It's like an annoying workout if someone didn't want to go to the gym this day, but it did.
