Eric Rohmer's "Lady and Duke" is based on English aristocratic magazines who lived through the French Revolution. But this is a stylish thing, with its strange, colored backgrounds and a way to talk. Most importantly, this portrait of the terrorist age is almost completely removed from the actual activity; in this film there are very few ordinary people and little chaos, poverty and fear that opened up from the chairs of persecuted but corrupted aristocratic classes. The result is often boring and ultimately the unexplored forces that sometimes lead to the destruction of society; this is a film that is a disappointing filmmaker disappointment.
