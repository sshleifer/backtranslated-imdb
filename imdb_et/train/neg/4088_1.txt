It was a live event watching my movie. I went to the theater to see it when it came out. I was completely surprised how bad it was. Such films make you think who put the money up and who owes, who benefits - very much. Special effects are absolutely at the first level, as could be done in all the first classes. Toys rubber bats, without trying to hide the string, the arrows that are drawn to the movie, and see what the arrow you find on the street and the ridiculous story. Ed Wood did masterpieces compared to Conquest. Every film student should just see this thing so they know the definition of a bad movie.
