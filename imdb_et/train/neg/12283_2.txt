College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is afflicted by the nightmares of basement dwellings in Alcatraz. She dreams of interrupting her hand, spitting a worm, worshiping an accident and roasting under an open fire. After her friends saw her "6 feet" sliding over her bed, the helpful, covert obsessionist (Donna Denton) suggests they invade Alcatraz in front of her fears. Of course, they go in the middle of the night if no one gets away when they get hold of it! <br /> <br /> The group became tempted, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) begins to rule and starts killing everyone. "Mickey" fame Toni Basil will show Sammy Mitchell, the singer of the band "Bodybag", as a helpful ghost. He teaches Alex how to slip out of his body and make rock music dance with a recurring nightmare to pull out the working time. All victims appear as Griffin Dunne's characteristic fears in London. The script is full of plot holes, fun dialogue, and flat comedy experiments. Good FX work and cool opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that will benefit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
