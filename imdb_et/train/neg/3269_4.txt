Except for Meryl Streep's behavior, which is always remarkable, I would avoid this movie because it has a "Movie of the Week" about it. But it is worth looking at some of the concepts in mind: how a couple carries out media controls and how they are treated differently. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the question is their credibility. The Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically get into "strange" air. The couple involved are religious (different from most of the culture) and Adventists (different). So their lifestyle and way of thinking are suspect in the beginning. Dingos have different animals than other dogs, so again we are faced with strange questions. The real story is how society (and the world) treats different, those with different accents, different beliefs, and how we treat what they say suspiciously. <br /> <br /> It's hard to hear the phrase "Dingo took my baby!" without laughing and sad is humorous posts all over the web. But in the year that followed the story and the movie, it has been discovered (as you can find in web searches) that there are many larger children in the dingos. Studies by Dingo experts have shown that it was not only possible, but most likely that the baby was dinga (maybe a couple), expertly extracted from clothing and eaten for moments without traces. <br /> <br /> But what's left behind is the question why people defended the dingo when they found they were threatening children, not killing the dingo to save the children, why, because the woman's expression is so cold that he's guilty, and in and out. <br /> <br /> Bullying questions with or without a movie.
