What a shame it is that Alan Clarke must be involved. However, this does not preclude it; Get a group of guys and some Stellad together and have a whale that runs it over and over again and rolls to the floor with laughter tears. Great wasted night things. The homes of Al Hunter are well-publicized in the late 80s - the hooligans were well organized and didn't really care about football - often with respectable jobs (realtor ???). But how Clarke can convince us that any double participant who misleads other low quality (Grange Hill) TV shows or shortly ahead of Eastenders may believe in nanosecond that they are tough football scammers are ridiculous. Do we really believe that the ICF (naturally based on drama) would ever go to another city to fight only SIX blocks? <br /> <br /> ICF displaces subway stations and the like. SYSTEMS. Andy Nicholls' Scally must be read before we even think of such a story. The actor is terrible and offers most of the laughs - Oldman is so camp that it's incredible. Most of them look like they are in Matey's bath tub. Real inspiration for anyone with a digital camcorder who thinks he can do it.
