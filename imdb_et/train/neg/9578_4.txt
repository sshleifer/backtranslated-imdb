Can A-Pix ever do anything right? This movie was supposed to be visible on TV in mailbox format. Because A-Pix does not even believe in a pan and scan, we see a whole scene where the shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks on the right shoulder. Of course, not because you don't have much. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie with 80% of the characters screaming at the top of the lungs for no reason.
