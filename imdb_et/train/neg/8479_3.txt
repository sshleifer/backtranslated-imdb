Okay, when I came to the board of this movie, I was really expecting people to entertain. I was surprised that people over the age of 7 liked it. I liked the movie ... but only me and my little sister (who is actually only 10) have fun with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry about Jordan, but it was terrible. You know that there is a toilet in front of the film if the driver can't act. And he didn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very flat ... the pathetic of the Border Guard. <br /> <br /> Even so, I thought there were some good actors, such as Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, it's not enough to redeem a movie. <br /> <br /> There are two things in this movie that I just can't overcome: <br /> <br /> 1.) Spencer boy falls for him. Okay, eww. I looked up at the dates and although in fact he was only about four years older than his, the difference between "Go Figure" seemed much larger. Jordan is a very beautiful girl, but in GF she seemed like 10 or 12 ... she looked like a little kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed to be a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) Kristi Yamaguchi would be skating in any way for one girl. I know I know that Katel is good and everything, but it still seemed unlikely that Kristi would go to a school that wasn't even for skating scholarships, or that the school would have used such connections in a skating school <br /> <br /> everything is said ... it wasn't the worst movie ever known but it wasn't very good even under DCOM standards, which I find quite low.
