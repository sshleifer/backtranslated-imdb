I know some movies (I mean: European films), which are very bad films, are considered by some "critics" to be very big in the cinema, just because they are non-Americans. I saw the 8.1 IMDB score for this movie and I noticed that it was chosen for some big festivals. Don't let this fool you! If you are not one of those people who like such an entertaining film and call it a great art later, skip it! The movie contains one fun scene after another (similar, in Italian, the movie was in my opinion, terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer sea sound)). The problem with these films is that they are not just boring, like some other strangely praised films, but that they play almost like a camp. I mean, let's be honest, the actor is terrible (I mean: soap opera level), the story is not one surprise (it has been done indefinitely, combining several stories: SHORT, MAGNOLIA, BIRTH, OFF) much better), not one realistic character in it ( some real vision along the way, you notice a fun zombie-like daughter) and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> Like it's not enough, the film is 135 min. (read it!) long and finally opens the director's sentimentality. After a movie with such a so badly bad dialogue and scenes that screened the public in public, they laugh so much incompetence, well ... This is an insult to the cinema and gets only high ratings because it happens in a "second" language, in this case Spanish. The weird world where we live ... 3/10
