DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love good sports movies (not so much baseball, but hey, sports movies, right?). I was much more for this movie. It looks like it starts well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes I really don't like, is a good one as a spoiled star. Barkin's role for me was OK. He's a good actor, but it seemed inappropriate in this role. It seemed to me that they always hurried scenes and then dragged them at times. It just seemed like I was so uneven! Taking into account the cast and the parcel, could have been so much better. I rated it "4" and I was generous ~ I'm tough and numbered!
