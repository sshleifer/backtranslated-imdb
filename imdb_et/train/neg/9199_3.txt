The small town attorney Lynn Hollister travels to a nearby metropolis in the business of his friend Johnny's death. (Yes, Lynn is a man, despite the feminine sounding Christian name. Did the scriptwriters try to point out that John Wayne's birth name was "Marion"?) Hollister first believes in Johnny's death but will soon realize that Johnny was murdered. Further inquiries showed a corruption, crime, and election web that is linked to Boss Cameron, the leading light of the city's political machine. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a sharp criminal thriller that may have been made in a film noir style that began to become popular in 1941. "The man betrayed", despite his theme, is rather a romantic comedy than a criminal drama. Hollister falls in love with Cameron's attractive girl, Sabra, and the film focuses so much on her results as on temporary elements. <br /> <br /> This movie can only work if it was made for a simple serious drama. One reviewer argues that John Wayne is not a credible lawyer at all, but he was not able to play every cowboy of a movie, and apparently he would have been a serious, organized crime lawyer inside his compass. When I agree with this advisor, he says Wayne was not an impersonator of Cary Granti. Romantic comedy just wasn't on her street. One of the weaknesses of the studio system is that the participants may be required to submit their bosses to them, whether it was on their street or not, and as Wayne was one of the few stars that worked in the republic's pictures, no doubt wanted to get him so much mileage. as they could. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> Even Cary Grant himself could not have done the "Missed Person" work as a comedy. It does not reflect his comic talents; it reflects the complete absence of fun material in this film. I doubt if anyone, no matter how well developed their sense of humor, can find something to laugh at. The light color of the film does not make it a successful comedy; it just stops it seriously if anything else. It is one of those films that are neither fish nor meat nor birds nor good red herring. 3/10
