It is a typical 70's soft-core sex attack in the Russ Meyer genre, though perhaps less unpleasant than some of Meer's work. This film has greater "production values" than many of its modern ones, suggesting a larger budget. It's a plot, writing and acting out of Zone B. Later, this film has become the B channel (like "Drive In Classics") in the 500 channel universe. If the soft core is what you feel, it's as good as anything else in the B range. Don't wait for Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. Something more, not less. Jennifer Welles' performance as "mother" is probably the best. None of the film's participants is surprisingly surprising. The recognition of a young American housewife is far from the worst. It's traceable when it's your movie type. 30 years ago it would have been an avant garde and a risky film. These days, you will see more and less of the same things in the Showtime / HBO series for the first time.
