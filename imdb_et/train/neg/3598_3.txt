Do you know when you watch a collection of old video clips and realize that there are some that you have only seen once or twice, and you do not remember whether they are worth the time to watch them? Alibi is one of those films; I found it not long ago and decided that I could give it a chance. I'm not quite sure if I'm satisfied with my decision ... on the one hand, the movie is really bad, on the other hand, now I have one more free tape ... yes, you get it. The plot is predictable and not original. Stimulation is bad. Action is bad, but it is not really surprising to see that two interfaces are former soap opera stars ... they are used to overwork. The characters are badly written clichés. In the film, even the easiest way to impress (through the film) is the scenes of the court. Even they do not create any emotion against or against the thin letters of the board. The film has no real salvation property ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is that it's so full of clichés that it's ridiculous. And this is one thing that raises it above 1/10: the comic relief of many clichés and stereotypes (albeit inadvertently). I didn't pay much attention to this film, but almost every time I looked at the screen, I was laughing. One last remark: I thought the line "Tori spell cannot be used" as a summary of one line, but I think everyone knows it, so I chose the current one, seeing it is more informative. All in all, it is a bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and when it is on television. Good if the couple laughs when you can sit through it. 3/10
