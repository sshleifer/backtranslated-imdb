Sorry, but even TJ Hooker Adrian Zmed couldn't save that sequel. I went to the side of the movie, I thought it was an original fraud. Then came this wild and unpleasant motorcycle scene (note that this is the only movie Patricia Birch directs); and I realized they were trying to be serious. I was struck by the fact that the opposing gang, having lost its "wheels" due to its original fat gambling habits, was forced to use motorcycles on another film. Being ashamed of this putz by Carrington, I wouldn't want to see what they would use later: maybe Mopeds? <br /> <br /> I also did not buy a crazy theme: hunky-australia-boy-could- In-Out-Out-In-Dominant-school-ergo-go-for-rugged-man-with-fool-biker -helmet-look. It was a terribly awful story for Disney. <br /> <br /> So it seems you can destroy a good thing by placing a bubble color that strikes Michelle Pfeiffer's music. The only thing I took out of this movie was the idea of ​​how many points out of ten it was.
