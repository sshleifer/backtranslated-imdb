This movie was very boring. It should be at least 15 minutes. The images of killed children and animals were a little disturbing. <br /> <br /> Usually I don't write comments, but it was so bad that I had so many good and great comments. I think that in this case, we are one step closer to the honest evaluation of this title. <br /> <br /> What else to say? I sleep 3 times during this movie. It was about 4 hours after waking up for an 8-hour sleep period. I think this is the point itself. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between symbols except maybe 2 sentences. rewind and catch up because you sleep again.
