Andy Lau stars with another policeman hidden story. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for the police and is also at the top of the drug gang (Lau). The film begins when we look at the police trying to see the drug plague only to see it in pieces. Then we introduce the drug-dependent mother and her close to Nick and her crowns and policemen, and, after 45 minutes, shut up the film and put the news. Well done and great to look at it is when the movie is involved, as I've seen for a long time. It's not bad, because it just doesn't care. I mean, I don't care at all. I actually started doing something else, forgetting that I had a movie with subtitles, that's how much I don't care. I wish I could have hated the film, but the movie is such a nuisance that it did not make me any impression (it is not something I could forget to ignore). Come to a box called China Scarface, which after he was dead? This must be avoided.
