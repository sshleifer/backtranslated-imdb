I do not describe this story as it has been done elsewhere. We are big fans of Clive Owen, and when our Netflix suggested the movie, we were interesting to us. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder we never heard of this "movie" because it was a BBC television movie in 1992. So bad product values, grainy image, camera work and bad sound. <br /> <br /> But you don't really know mechanics because the story is sleeping. This is an interesting human story, but not at all convincing, and hardly the end. You don't care about the characters because their life is as boring as watching your life in this annoying movie. Save two hours and take the time to make the time more useful.
