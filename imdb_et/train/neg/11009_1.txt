I appreciated this movie on AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie might be cool. "Guaranteed to Offend ... All!" The trailer said. Well ... this insulted me because this movie really sucks. It's hardly a comedy because I laughed for about two seconds throughout the movie. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I have no problems with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay scenes to the so-called comedy film, when these scenes aren't funny? I think the director is a gay man denial or something like that. <br /> <br /> So my advice to you is: if you want to waste some good money, go for a good comedy you've already seen millions of times, it's better than looking at it for all the harsh comedy mom. This is really a complete mess.
