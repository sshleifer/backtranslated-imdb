It can actually be the worst film I've ever had. It would be a compliment. Even at the end there was no point, but it was a huge relief that it was finally over. I looked at it with some fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did. At the end of this confusion, I was sorry that any character survived and I didn't feel the actors were too charitable. If you want to look at the train wreck, I suggest hanging at the train station. Even on an abandoned train platform, it's a mess. Obviously I have not been enough to fill my prescribed ten lines so that I will say it once more at risk of redundancy. This movie is zero and it would be less if I had a word for a lower rating. How about minus zero?
