What? Didn't you know that Scooby-Doo was fighting with zombies? Well, you may not be aware of this little movie directed by Victor Halperin, who was also a White Zombie four years earlier. This would probably make it another zombie film. <br /> <br /> No, don't look for Dorothy Stone to expose your breasts as you expect in most zombie films, and don't even look for any brains. It's 1936, you know. <br /> <br /> So what you see is typical for a period - a lot to talk about. <br /> <br /> You see Dean Jagger (Twelve O's) Clock High) and Bela Lugos eyes, but that's it. Indeed, zombies in Cambodia!
