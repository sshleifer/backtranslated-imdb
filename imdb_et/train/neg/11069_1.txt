After that picture, I really saw the cheat. It seemed like I was sitting on this movie for 101 minutes. I don't understand what they thought when they did it. It does not go to the murder of Jeffrey Dahmer and it does not end. It seemed almost like they left for the movie to continue. It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos. It will end suddenly and you will know that next week there will be another episode. It also seemed to be just looking at a part of a two-part film. There are many ways that went wrong here; they were lazy, ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to do Dahmer. I watched Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the forest. Suddenly I hear it playing the music, then it is written on the screen and it says how Dahmer served his punishment for 2 years and attacked the companion prisoner and was killed at the age of 34. \ t in the woods his death in prison. How to show how he got there. How To Show Dahmer Trial. How to show more details. I can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. I found myself incredibly, "Is that the end?" I want to finish this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie. I'd like to tell the filmmakers if you do, do it right.
