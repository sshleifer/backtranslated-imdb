When I accidentally stumbled in the form of this script, I read it and maybe laugh. However, I wouldn't want to laugh at movie points where the driver seems to want me to laugh. Although I'm still not sure where they are. I don't care if it's Woody Allen, this writer can't write a dialogue, or at least he can't consciously write a dialogue, then pull actors out of actors who can laugh even on the harshest clown. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, I want to get a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, so it confirms, but frankly, do you know any art historian who would say it? How would you respond? <br /> <br /> "Really? Art Gallery? Who would have thought of it?" <br /> <br /> The whole script is full of natural quasi-intellectuality that I wouldn't have expected from such a reputable character writer. I admit that I don't know Allen's other work and that I don't want to start learning. The characters are extraordinary, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from human condition? Or really writing a very bad character? You're a judge.
