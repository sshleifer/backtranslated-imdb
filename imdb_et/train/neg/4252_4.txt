*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw it today, I had the expectation of how it would be, not too high, but not low. It was not expected at all, although it seems to me that filmmakers could not think of what to do. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it is somewhat mysterious and a bit exciting, but it will soon become ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I was still watching, I fell asleep a few times. <br /> <br /> The end is the most ridiculous though, almost squirting / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it doesn't have good scenes, but that the movie never gets "healed" . <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie-Man
