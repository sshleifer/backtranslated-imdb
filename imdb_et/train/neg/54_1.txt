The only good thing about this movie was the capture of Goldie Hawn, standing in his little French cut bikini underpants and trying to keep a dozen other depressed women removing their small cotton cup when he strangled and in the chorus. Ooooof! His back is competing with Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and this shot almost killed me. I forgot all that was, in my opinion, dirty in Roladex until I saw it the other day on television, where they actually saw their midsection in this scene, a good sadness, reminding me of what a woman Goldie Hawni smokes. was in the 80s. Kurt Russell must have a fun life.
