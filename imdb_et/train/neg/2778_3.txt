This movie seemed like it all goes with a good camera, sound, movie, set, music, costume ... but the drum roll, Gary Stretch told me! I don't know if it was his bad act or just a bad script, but would say it is both. Given his role in this role, I found it difficult to root even to the end. I wanted him to be in a dead battle or some sword / knife scuffles. Queen? Pretty flat. And to go extreme to kill your son? And then push her lover king? I see here and there two historical bytes, but the way it was presented was pharmaceutical. I read another user's comments on the sound that is duplicated, but I don't think he was dubbed ... then he's speaking English, right? It was really terrible. The lines were read at the coroner's table ... flat-line. It may be that he has no voice to fluctuate. <br /> <br /> In addition, I watched it to the end, so the film had "at least" interest. It could have been more than the script / lines and the pain would have worked harder. The landscape and the film crew, with a very good quality film, is what really surpassed this movie. The story and story were all secondary. I'll give the movie to the team 10.
