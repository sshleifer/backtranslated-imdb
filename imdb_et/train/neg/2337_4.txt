I can't find out what it is about ... It's really a bad movie ... it didn't do anything for me, the only landing is where everyone comes together at the party, and the nice song plays, beating and nice movie movies that make your move .... this was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this movie has nothing to suck in. There is no story, nothing to think about, as some people say, different stories ... it was rather an attempt to make Anderson's "Magnolia", which was brilliant, but it didn't obviously ... Okay, it's easy and easy to look but they are too small. Maybe write a story before making a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films
