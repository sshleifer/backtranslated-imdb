Although it would be a nice movie because I like zombies and horror films in general. But I didn't think it was a piece like it was. The only zombie in the movie is in the beginning and he can run over God's fucking car !!! A movie written by a pornography director and written by porn actors, I would never call them actresses! Costumes seem to have been stolen from a local school game. It seems to be almost a film without a movie, which has almost no monsters. This sh! A piece that is just a horror is not fun at all, but not in a way designed by the driver. I'd rather rape pedophile than ever to see this movie !!! ugh!
