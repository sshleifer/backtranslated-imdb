I saw this work at the CA Film Festival. My God, what was the director? Film professors should use this film as a case study of what NO does when making short films. Firstly, this project does not make any sense. The film is part of the "Waystation", which are some stupid coat bars somewhere in the middle where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> Action is bad. So bad I almost thought it was comedy. Leading actor Julia Reading is a step below the actor who acts in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including boys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's like the director had no idea how to work or use them. The only thing that was worse than that was a dialogue that limited absurdity. The writer (whom I assume is also a director) writes every character as they are in comic books. <br /> <br /> The overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest, when the movie is bad it is easy to forget. The production design is pretty good, though Waystation looks like a regular bar. Costumes and make-up are fine and I understand that the production worked with a small budget. It is just when the characters are talking, or trying and pulling the plot forward, the film is crapping. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is terrible for God. It's like a director / writer who looked at a lot of sci-fi movies and threw all the parts he liked into a mixer and came out of it. My only hope is that he used other people's money for it, because when he owns, he's the whole mammal.
