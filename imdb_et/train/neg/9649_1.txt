Who joked with them? There was too much in this movie that was difficult to digest. As soon as Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unknowingly wants his father to die when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri), he will only give up after a minute later. The only problem with this theory is that someone who has ever traveled to London Heathrow knows that it would be impossible to draw such ancestry and especially not India. But the film does not end there, there are the two main guides (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) who move along the rocks as a dream. I mean, yes, we saw success with Susan Boyle (a British woman who had achieved her dreams after 50 years of age), but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to stop my belief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just poorly prepared. They never allowed Madhuri Dixit and Sridev to play the same roles, why should we force Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men in their 40s) to desperately strive for their 20s? Don't even talk about the most self-conscious actor today, Asin. It's her second film (I've seen) and she's just hopeless as an actor, so she's aware of her look that she touches only with good and voguing instead of giving a good actor. It's just hard to believe that he returned to all these other movie roles to celebrate this craze, and then be as fluffy as an actor, not to write anything at all. And for all this, the movie just pulled forever. There's nothing special about that, trust me to predict every thing that happens in it.
