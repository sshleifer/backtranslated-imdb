The film seemed nice to me because it was a new type of Pokemon Celeb. But the plot was naturally out and not as interesting as the other films. It was a waste of money and time. Same funny humor and clich√© bad guys. The movie couldn't be done if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The film should not be better associated with anime like Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawing and settings do not rise to the level of the original anime standards. It's even a shame to talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans are disappointed with the result of the movie and give up Pokemon. Digimon is more anime and it doesn't fall near Pokemon. This is the second film to be released at the end of 2002.
