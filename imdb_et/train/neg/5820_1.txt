This movie is probably the worst film I've ever seen. I learned French at college and I understood all the dialogues so the language barrier was not a problem. I have to say that it is really difficult to understand the characters in the film. There's only one professional actor cast and I don't think there are professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Although I have rated it from 1 to 10, this is probably not a bad rating. This is just a futile attempt to reduce the current overall rating to 7.3, something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate assessment because film is a real event that is not 100 minutes or so long that you will never get back. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure a college student is hitting his nut, making the film twice as good and half the length. However, if you want to join a bandon that seems to be around IMDb, you can also go to "Lost in Translation" 10.
