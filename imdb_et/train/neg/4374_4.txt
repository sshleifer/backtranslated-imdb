Virgo precursors are so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying any meaning he wishes to his inexplicable sex and violence. If it were a deliberate feature of a film, it would be a creation of postmodern shine, but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without taking a break, we take a quick walk from events. Separated in the salon is undergoing an orgy that includes topless wrestling and diaper p *** ing. The ongoing orgy combines the load of latecomers, but they have been inadvertently followed by a monster that I like to call "muddy ninja". This monster precedes the killing of orgyis participants one by one, except for the proverbial virgin (if you do not read oral sex), who gets her seed and thus becomes so passionate that she will masturbate with someone's separated hand. Finally, he has pulled out his intestines, and then there is a scene that seems to mean he's pregnant with a baby ninja. Do I have it all? If you plan to rent this movie, it is better not to speak Japanese and you do not have subtitles. In a season where boring Hollywood cinemas live, it can make a VCR a cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. This is definitely something else.
