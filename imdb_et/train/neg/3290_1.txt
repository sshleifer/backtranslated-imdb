This movie was a miracle! They took me from childhood and raped it next door! This movie was so bad that I wanted to go home and keep my "Dukes" DVDs and cry in the corner. The cast was terrible! It wasn't "Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was Boss Hogg Evil? When was Rosco a tough guy? They were never! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke the pot? He never did! Now don't get me wrong, I'm very liberal, and there is nothing wrong with chiba, but there was nothing in this movie. The only thing that was good about this film was the trailers and the final credits in front of the film. It was a waste of money and waste. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
