Witchy Hildegard Knef struggles to isolate a group of people in an isolated hotel and chooses them in a twisted, disgusting way. I thought I saw all this until one unfortunate person here was crucified and then his head burned. Hildy is also quite a prankster: she takes a nerve-harp and sews her mouth ... then she hangs up in a chimney just in time for a roaring fire! "Witchcraft" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write this worst movie ever made by competent people ... to the finals. I have to admit that I loved this end. It includes the boy and his toy recorder Linda Blair at an angle looking fantastic for possession. The scene only lasts about a minute and the movie is over, but you know the old saying: "If you have a big ending, people will forgive you for something!"
