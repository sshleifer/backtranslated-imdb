This film was quite absurd. There were some funny parts. It goes straight to the memory where I think the movie trash, "Hmm ..... that this movie had some funny parts, but a general, pretty ridiculous plot (or absence)." <br /> <br /> I thought Ben seemed to be a little too hard to be a funny guy. And I did not understand how he was himself a multi-millionaire and still such an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He does some mess, but hey, I can forgive him. I thought I liked the Jersey girl, I didn't think Gigli was all her fault, I like her general. I think she's like a kid you know she just can't get it right. <br /> <br /> My recommendation would be to avoid this flick. It did not develop into a real plot and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. did not use as well as they could have. They deserved better. In general, this film is not alone at home, it's not a Christmas story, it's NOT a Holiday or some other classic. Forever Forgettable.
