All this pious "movie" was almost worth knowing that I could never experience anything so bad. Acting - 0, script - 0, fighting scenes - 0, male leader - 0 (cheddar bob eight miles as a warrior hero who gets a girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She's a proud and not terrible actor). I used this criterion to get an average of two. I lost the census, but I believe that there is ever a film clich√© in this film. If the driver who allegedly killed his father really came up against him at the end of the race, it failed the previous statement. In addition, it simply appears without reason. He had never been mentioned before. I don't know what else to say here. Just watch it out of the TV a few years later. At least this way, some ads are delivered.
