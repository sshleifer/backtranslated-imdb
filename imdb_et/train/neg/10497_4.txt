So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only ready to flow along a river that is clearly filled with crocuses, snakes, lizards, the above-mentioned pieces of reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm. She could never do me, but she was close to her wife. <br /> <br /> This movie is not part of my parallel film category - movies for people who have just drilled their teeth, have migraines, or have no film experience, and therefore like quiet mediocrity (now Disney movies are well populated). It's too noisy. Well, Steve is too noisy. He's always very happy and he cut the right teen (I hear it now, "this movie was both STUPID") or tylenol with codeine. I would say his enthusiasm is catching, but if it were, I would be full of snakes and it hasn't happened yet. I agreed they were beauty, but I'm not going to consider them as pets. <br /> <br /> The plot was indeed predictable. The bad guys were so bad that for a few minutes I thought I'd buy a consumer at an electronic supermarket. But the movie was full of animals, Steve and Terri, so I watched it. This plot (if you called it) was indeed the reason why one truck would throw another crochet. My expectations were low and stayed so far. <br /> <br /> However, I hoped there would be a bit of a step where Steve and Terri (having worked with their acting skills) had a real plot and more fur animals. I still can't believe we can't see Steve anymore. I hope Terri and the children will continue to participate in the Australian Zoo and Discovery Channel. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without a strong member of Irwin's family telling me how wonderful it is. Crikey!
