Ariauna Albright is really a good actress, but why she participated in this flat written travesty is a mystery. What could have been entertainment like classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can act as well as sexy as her partner Lilith Stabs, who looks good, but it is obvious that she spent money on a spa or cosmetic school. It was a production that cried out for some R&D and could have been achieved by an imaginative script writer in the flow of things. But Ariauna does what she can do in this situation and to some extent save her reputation. The company Tempe should know that if you wear two attractive women in funny fetish uniforms, the audience will be waiting for some fetish games & T & A. Nough.
