If it is someone's "favorite" movie, they need serious help. There is nothing funny about this crapfest, nor wise. I have not seen the original film (film of the 1950s), but it just has to be better than this newer bastard. special element and finishes teaching children at ROTC school. Unfortunately, the main Daman Wayans ... so kids are terrible, humorous for the world of affinity. Can Wayans shape those losers? Can they get him a little more humane? Film bombs, like most Wayans films, are just a few sparkling wines. William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time that is too small. This charming old man (which is best known to me as the "Talts from the Crypt" actress who is best known as your "Louis name" during your "Christmas holiday") seems at any moment when he is on a screen that's not here much. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also appears as a biker that fits him perfectly. I wouldn't want a little more Bam Bam, but I think he played the role of "biker" as much as it was possible for a military movie. <br /> <br /> There is also an attractive teacher who falls to Major Payne, although he treats children badly, has no social skills, and is simply unable to convert with someone you want to spend time with. He must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure what (although it feels "stupid", because the film makes it clear that it is getting out of the house often enough). <br /> <br /> Wayans had one bright moment: a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice robot) and 2 Live Crew music. This scene was enjoyable, but hardly anything else made this movie dog bad. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie seriously. If you want to see a movie, the loser who helps the losers to become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he is a loved loser and actually funny. Maybe if Major Payne had won the rotten, I felt better, but he didn't. Forget about Payne, forget Wayans ... you can do a lot better.
