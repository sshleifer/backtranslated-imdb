Martin Weisz, who led the solid "Rohtenburg", takes Wes Craven to heat the other "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an incredible story and a dog with a setback, will be permanently erased by this technically polished remake (only in the name). A number of national soldiers (and women) are sent to the desert in a research area surrounded by mountains full of mutants. One-week soldiers are selected one by one. That's it. There is violent violence and a reasonably brutal rape, but there are very few other things to get excited about. "Heroes" are common clich√©s and mutants that are far from Craven's original "family", mostly reminiscent of Brian Thompson's "Cobra", along with some of the creatures Stan Winston left "Wrong Turn" hot. Much of the activity takes place in the caves, "The Descent", and it is well done by Sam McCurdy. The ridiculous aspect is Wes and Jonathan Craven added a likeable mutant who strikes his cave like the original "Chainsaw" skin of the Cooper. Weisz is accused of this boredom, but he is not really guilty because he does his best to maintain the tension and squeeze the freshness out of established situations. Unfortunately, this is not a fan.
