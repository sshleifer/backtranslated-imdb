This is Peter Bogdonavitch's personal film. He relied on his own life, but changed things to fit characters that are detectives. These detectives are beautiful models and they have no problems finding them. It seems more than a millionaire playboy filmmaker as a detective, isn't it? All this film was written by Peter and it shows how he does not touch real people. You should write what you know, and he did it. And leaves the audience boring and confused and jealous of this question. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered immediately after filming. But Patti Hanson, who is married to Keith Richards in real life, was also a model like Stratten but is much better and has much more. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. He has no story that is quite complicated at first. All in all, the character of this movie is someone with very few people unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels during your call. For the rest of us, this is an irritating snake fest. This happens when you touch. You entertained your little friends inside jokes and wore all the rest.
