I've been searching for this movie a long time since it's quite rare to find it because it was one of the video nasties. Finally I found it on the DVD at the end of last year, this is a very low budget movie. The story is placed around the Amazon jungle tribes who are living for the devil. Laura Crawford is a model that has been kidnapped by a robber's gang while working in South America. They take her into the jungle Laura watches a ridiculous homeland who calls herself a "devil", she has to go all the unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens is busy. The devil shows the meat in a terrible way. Peter Weston, the fucking hunter who goes to the jungle to save him,
