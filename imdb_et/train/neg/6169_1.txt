As a huge fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and also gore I thought, Nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good. I studied the plot, read the comments, and even looked at some photos to make sure it looked good and scary before downloading it. So excited it was ready and ready to be scared and the recoiling fear of the amazing gore I was expecting I was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and was too much inexplicable, but the ghost was more fun than scary and what was the sound effects of comic styles? The actor was probably the only thing that was a little scared about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​a cactus and how the mother's husband disappeared in the marine environment after the flashing light, they left as inexplicably as they did because my mind didn't understand what I actually saw. I appreciate how it was supposed to be; shocking and a couple of scenes (strange cannibalism and kissing your mother?) certainly were, I think they went a little far and not even terribly that they were not convincing, which made comedy rather more plausible than I think horror. But this is a very entertaining movie and I have a lot of laughing about me and a couple of friends, but unfortunately we were expecting fear, not comedy, worth the worth of entertainment but don't wait for a dark, deeply scary and terrible movie; you just have to be disappointed. If it were horrible comedy / junk, I would probably think it would be about nine, the culmination of a strange scene when the husband climbed on his wife's stomach and closed his wounds, but as a horror I gave it to the disadvantage.
