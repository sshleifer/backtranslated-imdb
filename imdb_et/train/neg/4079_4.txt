I bought this movie DVD for my girlfriend who shares the same movie as a ghost girl and enjoys a paranormal movie. The film was completely captured on video so that it has a special appearance on PBS. Special effects are straightforward, but there are actually some frightening moments in the movie that started to jump into our place. Especially effective intimidation, which includes the statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> How bad it works, "plot" scenes are long and very boring, and I tell you that I have no idea what happened to the end. If you get a movie, rent it if you buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
