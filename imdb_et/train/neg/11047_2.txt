There are two reasons I did not give this film 1. One of the reasons is some actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) who tried to play at their normal level of activity. In many scenes, however, these scripts were somehow blocked. Another reason is the cyber idea and search, which is quite different from most other roles that have been seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as possible. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script work. And it seemed to be the first film for many participants. But it could have been an interesting story, but they failed completely.
