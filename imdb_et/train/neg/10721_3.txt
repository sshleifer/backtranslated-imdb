The expedition, led by hunky captain Storm (Mark Dana), drives the Cairo kings to find out what happened to the previous expedition. They meet the beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They will soon find that they are facing a bleeding mommy ... and only Simira seems to know what's going on. <br /> <br /> True snoozer. I got it late on TV when I was about 10. It made me sleep! Seeing it all these years later, I see why. It's slow to move, the mummy doesn't show up to 40 minutes (and it's just 66 minutes!), The number of bad (Dana) REAL bad guys (George N. Neise) and there's no violence and no blood is found. This film focuses more on second level drama (involving the silly triangle of love) than horror. <br /> <br /> It appreciates the three stars because it really looks pretty good, everyone plays it right, Diane Brewster has something good, it's short, and the mummy attack scenes (all three) aren't bad. They're not just scary. However, this movie is pretty bad. Safe for insomnia.
