The final of Weissmuller Tarzan's films is rather weak. There are a few things on the track about this film. <br /> <br /> First of all, Tarzan spends a lot of floppy sandals. In my opinion, Tarzan's shoes, regardless of whether they are sandals or boots, as sometimes shown, take away the character that should be anti-civilization and jungle. <br /> <br /> Second, Benji, as mentioned in the previous post, completely removes the movie as a comic strip. For me, his character is not necessary for a film plot. <br /> <br /> Also, although Weissmuller continues to cut Tarzan's command, it is obvious that he was not his best shape. Though his later Jungle Jim films had somewhat improved his body from this film. <br /> <br /> The octopus battle is a great idea, but I think it should have been in the Weissmuller movie earlier when he was his physical peak. Similarly, a battle that takes just a 30 second top will be much more exciting if it is pulled from 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and his companionship. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara is extremely pleasing to the eye, she will not be able to save the last Weissmuller movie - a disappointing end to a great character.
