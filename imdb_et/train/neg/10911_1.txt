I hated this movie so much that I remember it vividly. It's not even funny. All movies based on inhumane sex jokes and humor of racism do not deserve the money it costs. In the first half of the year, Rob Schneider drinks potatoes containing milk powder. All I thought was "he deserves it to make such a bad movie". Don't waste your time or money on it.
