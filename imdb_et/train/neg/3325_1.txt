I hated it. If you think all the southern people are stupid, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, religious walnut, or child molester, then this movie may be for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly unknown. In one scene, the two older men in the general store talk about being a moral sister before they tied their shoes. The man looked proud of his actions and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life. Very nice. A teenage girl walks behind the rear roads looking for her sister and no one offers her help - despite the obvious uncomfortable and inadequate food or water (without backpack, etc.). The character of Strathairn is not only thoroughly disgusting and sloppy, but it has been shown that he is a religious believer who (typical of Hollywood) reflects the insecure nature of Christians. The movie scene resembles the end of Cape Fear (DeNiroga) - a bad man with Bible Bible. I'm in the northwestern part of the country, but I found this movie offensive because of the great people I know who come from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, and so on.
