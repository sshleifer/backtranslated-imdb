Oh my God. The idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke for me. in addition to being written at the age of 5. filming, filming and filming a plot, acting, and even a movie, were all shameful. <br /> <br /> I am usually not critical of any movie because every person has their own style. But this film was probably the worst film I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this film is unknown and I think it should stay that way, because such movies make the thriller a joke. /> <br /> I recommend everyone who is a fan of thriller movies, or even just movies, to stay away from it.
