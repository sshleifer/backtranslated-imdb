This movie was the most terrible experience of watching movies I had ever had to endure, and worse, I had to watch it and had no chance to stop it because it was in school! Of course, this story was decent ... but I found a terrible dread! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was great. He was the only one highlighted without him, I doubt I could watch the movie. Every time I hear someone say: I attacked the client almost the other day because they said it. It made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if it has offended anyone, I only express my opinion)
