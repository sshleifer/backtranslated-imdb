This movie was recommended to me by a friend living in California. He thought it was great because it was so real, "Just like people in the Ohio Valley!" I'm from the region and I experienced the movie "Just like people in California think we are!" I have lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked there for a minimum wage. We laughed a lot, tied up and took a break with the people we were; the young people went out together at night. Older people had little free time after work because they took care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and it is not gloomy in the winter, somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Beyond "if you live at home, you have to be depressed," the story lacked charm, mystery or even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> Martha's character was the worst. It is doubtful that someone so repressed would have belonged to the church, but if he had been, he would probably have made friends there. I've read the comments that seem to suggest Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, more beautiful and slimmer" but if that is the case, it will not be shown. All we really see is Marta's learning that she doesn't like Rose for reasons that would have been the same if three friends were of the same age and sex. We see that Marta's feeling was left out during the smoking session, left out when social plans were made, used, but not appreciated, and ultimately bad and hurt. Kyle for murder because he had ever had a few panic attacks? Please. It takes the stigma of mental illness to a new level.
