For me, every artwork is judged on the basis of these criteria: form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to be committed to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting action. Long close-ups refer to a feature that the viewer can perform on their own. Due to the lack of text, the story becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests depth, but sometimes it turns out that he has nothing to say. This film acts like an introverted person. If you haven't read the synopsis, you can't see that it was a suicide (and why?), What makes Anna's position to life and makes her suspicious. "Why aren't you talking to me?" asks Sebastian. Anna doesn't answer, she's just gonna look for her for a while. What is the function of this image? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastian: What does this film say? What does this film mean? The answer for me: It shows us a handful of people with passion for water. Their life story is simple and boring. Their motives are not shown. The rest are: skins, residences, landscapes. Nice and artistic, but meaningless without the removal of "manuals". In my opinion, this film has been made for other artists, not for the common viewer.
