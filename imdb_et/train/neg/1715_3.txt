Although it contains facts that have not been widely reported, it is not the truth. They took a lot of freedom in reorganizing events except people, and used kits that do not correspond to the facts of the 30s. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. and these people had as much to do with the facts. Buck and Blanche went to Clyde to persuade them to go much earlier than one shootout, and in fact they dropped into crime. Some of the events in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much harder and didn't heal right. It was so bad that someone had to do it until it got better, and even then it stiffened so that it walked rigidly. Clyde also walked with the hips, because while in prison she cut off a big toe. I know I'm funny and it was a TV movie, but even without their "TRUE" story flaws without the movie moving from event to event too quickly and it's more than several separate biographies. , instead of being a single flowing story. <br /> <br /> I would like to read a book or see a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
