Looking at all the negative comments on this film, I thought it might be another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. I looked at the first two battle scenes, listening to the terribly widespread dialogue between Lungren and other thrown eastern actors, and I found the film so terrible that it was funny. Then the story of Brandon Lee enters, and the individual liners begin to fly, the plot is split, the script writers start to drink and the film takes it as welcome as it becomes the worst action movie EVER. <br /> <br /> Lungren wins his earlier efforts "The Punisher" and others, as well as all Van Damme movies, Seagal films and Stallone's non-Rocky films for this special honor. This movie has the absolute worst effect (look at Tia Carrere's face when she is in some Dolphi scene that is worth ridiculous), with the worst dialogue (Brandon Lee's comment on a small Dolph is the film's worst line), and the worst equipment in the movie (Dolph Japanese Inflation). Image of "Tango and Money" inferior, meets "Commando", meets "Friday 13th" (because of nonsense nudity and Lungren's performance, it is very similar to Jason Voorhees), a movie hour and fifteen minutes of fun. br /> <br /> Good (how not terrible) performances go to a bad guy (who still sees constipation through his entire performance) and Carrere (who somehow says he says his 5 lines are smiling). Brandon Lee is just at Lungren's sidekick and does it very terribly. <br /> <br /> A terrible, terrible movie. Scare it and avoid it. When you look at it, ask yourself why underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. When talking about underwater shots, look at the flat water fight scene that has the worst fighting scene ever. This film has a bad fight scene for those who have short attention and are filled with flashing nudity. <br /> <br /> BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
