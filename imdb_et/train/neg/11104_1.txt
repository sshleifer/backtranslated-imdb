I'm not one of those people who just enter online after seeing the movie and decide to call it the worst movie. If you doubt me, check out my other comments. But for the first time I've seen such a frightening movie that I wanted to write how bad it was before it was even over. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the most terrible fear film were good. But there is no good thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Land is basically non-existent. If someone who reads my report wastes their money to see it, they can see for themselves what the plot might be, but I suggest that nickel be worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> Operation is bad. <br /> <br /> Two leaders are attractive, but all of them are there. <br /> <br /> I am not a type of violation of anyone's movie, but INVITES anyone to send me a foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for their opinion about this movie before they spend a dime on it. I'm telling you something. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new inventions. I even love horror porn stuff like Hostel (What some reviewers said it was like, but probably they just thought so cause Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But it can be number 1 most valuable and stupid and dumbass movie EVER made. <br /> <br /> And before you ignore this review, it comes from someone who not only sat in the house of the dead, but actually bought a copy.
