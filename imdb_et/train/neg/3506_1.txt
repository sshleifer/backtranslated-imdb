I wouldn't be so quick to look at all the good comments and say that this may be a good show. This show is only good if you don't know what "talent" is. I don't even say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to many people) because it's not exactly what bothering me. It bothers me that people look at it and think it's funny. foolish and I'm afraid that this day will be led by people who watch this garbage. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is simple. Silvermen) passing through everyday life. <br /> <br /> It's like a million times it's done. In fact, almost every joke is either made or racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing ... I like her voice ... but it's not lyrics .. The lyrics are terrible .. what she likes to sing a lot of things .. <br /> <br /> If you want hot women to put everyone else down and make em feel like crap while farting and saying crap about every contest then this show is for you.
