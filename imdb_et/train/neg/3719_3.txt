Imagine pulling back a deadly murder mask and finding Barbara Cartland there ... it happens to this movie. <br /> <br /> Ava showed a promise, but soon all this thriller (or even imaginative love story) will fall, and the only reason they did this story is quite clear: fill the gap in their female market by creating another "misunderstood" , the innocent charming beauty of the impulse of the descendant bad boy (Andrei) ‚Äù(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of making time to create the original assumption, the filmmakers went straight to the money: the bad boy had tamed this amazing beauty. This results in a set of consistent and heavily clustered love scenes sprinkled with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrey's promise to be (eponymously) a "poet" is capable of reversing the perceived qualities of the Byronic hero, but even when we are told, he was still writing hard to believe - or care. <br /> <br /> In order for an official hero / antihero to work, this story needs subjectivity, style and innovation - all of which are completely absent here. This is not a phantom of today's opera, it happens just as a weak and rather silly woman (with loose dog elasticity) is a bad guy who, after his meeting, seems as dangerous as rabbit slippers. <br /> <br /> Performances could have recorded this movie if they had been good: the female leader was busy sexy and "vice versa", no matter if forced or ridiculous; and the poor Dougray Scott seems to have fallen into the drug when he's doing his part. It's not her best job. Jurgen Prochnow, as "Vashon" and Andrew Lee Potts, was a young photographer / brother. A better movie would have been a sister and kept her brother.
