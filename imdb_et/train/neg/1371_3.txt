I can't figure out how anyone can get bad money for this movie. It's like a television station is desperate for something, nothing at all. They are buried under a lot of snow, electricity is constantly blinking in and out, but magically there is a backlight that remains constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? This and all this stupid bullying between characters. They seem more interested in complaining to each other than trying to survive. He is trying to create this emergency and help people. But because it is such bad leadership and action, you can't fix your flick with your Florence Nightingale, sorry. I agree with the negative feedback and agree that this is one of the worst films.
