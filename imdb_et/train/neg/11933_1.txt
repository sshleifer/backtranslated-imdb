My child makes better videos of it! I feel the $ 4.00 spent on renting this thing has been beaten! There is no date on your camcorder, probably Wellspring; and worse still, there is no date for making any original text for the movie! The only date is 2002, the result of which is an unsuspecting tenant who believes he will receive a movie recently. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad that it was outdated and irrelevant for any time period, but just when it was done, I'm surprised that everyone takes the time and costs to market it as videos . Students may be interested in studying the counter-culture of the 1960s, in the anti-war, invasive, power-on, turn-off and drop-out cultures; But if you read the back of the videos, there is no hint that this is what you get. If you mistake it, if you rent it, it will probably be the best time for drugs, so your mind is better suited to the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your mental state while watching it, I can tell you that after the first scene it will not improve; so knowing I'm sure you've long before bedtime.
