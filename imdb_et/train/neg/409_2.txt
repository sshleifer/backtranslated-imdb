<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed it. He got himself killed. Again, we have a film that includes sexual and violent, immoral, female women, and lots of talk between characters and glasses. Because their movie is not in the film any action. It despises all its devices. All actors give Verhoeven a film presentation. In other words, they sacrifice action at almost every level. Starship Troopers got into this because it was a macho world where characters were located. In this, scientists act in the same way. Sorry Paul, but the soldiers and scientists are not really the same mindset. <br /> <br /> One of the main drawbacks of the plot was that after one night had escaped, Kevin Bacons made the character back to science. The lab where we've been spending more time watching these animated manniquins (except Elizabeth Shue) walk and talk. Why not show what nature can do in the outside world. How could they track him if he could be at all? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept in terms of story and characterization. Then look at what this film does and how you really did it very badly and believed that the whole project was really. Well one of the two isn't so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie contains nothing. Just as the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
