I saw this movie for the first time around twelve o'clock on Saturday night. This is the perfect time for it. I've never seen, ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and steeped in stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action film, don't look at it because you may lose the will to live halfway. But if you want to laugh, look at it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to our enjoyable Saturday night. What struck me particularly is that the years-long scene, which would be costly, was copied from the Discovery documentary or an old TV-special US Army. In addition, I was surprised by the fact that they did not make a small effort to make production real. Afghanistan is as far as you can remember, somewhere near the sea and one more click, Deke escapes from the terrorist sandal with its jet package and is taken away by the submarine (probably Discovery). Later, Deke filmed against the wall of an Islamic terrorist. In the slow motion scene, you can see the air of the long hair of the beautiful Korean stuntman valve when they are broken against the wall. I have to love it. I suggest you look at it with your friends and a good beer, but only then will you understand why I have spent $ 6.99 am crazy.
