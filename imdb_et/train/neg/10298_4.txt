Lynne Ramsey puts the pictures in custody and Samantha Morton can call the gesture. So, drag and drop to discover the waste of these talents in this way, pretending. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can't call life. His aspirations are too funny and oblique. He repeated the long silent shots of an actor who was agonizing his camera, as if Morton's lost look alone gave it a character. We have an empty Warholia self-hell: for a movie that has minutes to save all climbing on the floor, you might think it could get your main character improved. But how does he do when he rarely speaks? Without the monologue of the novel's interior, celluloid Morvern Callar is not someone. The little miracle Ramsey has often dislocated Morton. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes worked so impressively, shot and edited that my hopes were rising. Give the movie so much: he knows how to make promises, if not how to keep it.
