It was a disappointment to see this DVD for so many years. The main problem for me is the uneven script. <br /> <br /> Although some of them are witty and clean, it is quite small, boring and inanimate. Many gags simply sit there, lack sparks and energy. <br /> <br /> Mae West and Rachel Welch are well over. Roger Herren in Rusty Shine (too bad for not making more movies). But for my money, John Huston is too much, and the poor Rex Reed is hardly fighting. His character seems to have been left out to find out what he's doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> A low user rating should give an impression of this public opinion. Vidali's original gave a lot of potential, which was pretty much wasted. Even the classic movie clips didn't do much. All in all, it is rather a sub-par.
