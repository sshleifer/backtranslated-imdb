I didn't really like this movie at all. It wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely one of the most talented people, and although his actions were good, he just seemed to be a perfect waste. Means that there were some parts that were cute and somewhat humorous, but that is it. The only thing that drew my attention during the whole joke survey was that there were some very good looking women and I don't have to watch a movie just because it was the only doll where even the smallest redemption case was found. All in all, this pair was below the midline movie. <br /> <br /> Final Query: <br /> <br /> Theaters: so glad I didn't waste too much money on it. > <br /> Buying a DVD: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rent: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, why not.
