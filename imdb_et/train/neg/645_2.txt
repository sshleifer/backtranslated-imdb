When I saw this movie preview, I couldn't wait for it. The plot seemed good and the setting was great. I mean, slasher movie, what's going on prom night, a great idea! And a plot: a high school teacher who is sexually obsessed with one of his students, goes crazy, gets arrested and flees away three years later! Prom night, a night that should be happy and memorable, becomes hell! But I saw it and was very disappointed. It was not only the worst "horror movie" I've ever seen, but it was one of the worst movies I ever saw! First, it was not even scary. There was no moment in this movie when I jumped out of my seat. The scenes of the murders were also tough and dull. The whole slasher made a number of sacrifices on the stomach or created their throat. There was also no gore (rated PG-13). The most bloody scene was probably the killer murdered a black girl. He splits his throat and the blood splits on the hanged pages (they don't really show him the throat cutting). <br /> <br /> Next, you will see the killers first in the movie. He is not mysterious, horrible or scary. He's the man who kills people. <br /> <br /> Everything in the movie was so cliché. As an example, the killer finally kills the main game, and at the last minute the detectives shoot and kill it. Also, each of these films was so predictable. After the boy saw the knife, the victim sees his life, hides, thinks he's going out, and then the killer kills and kills him. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film's sequence was extremely bad. The man goes to the hotel, kills some people, the bodies are discovered, someone pulls the fire alarm and everyone evacuates. The main character forgets his room, he has a meeting with a killer, runs and flees. That's it! He and his boyfriend go home, the killer kills the house guards, finds the girl, then the detective dies. The film sequence was so stupid and cliché. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​seeing this movie is all because the preview seemed good, trust me, don't waste your time or money. No wonder this movie was shown in the smallest theater of the movie. My friend and I, along with the two girls who sit on the back, were the only ones in the theater. It should have told me something about the film.
