I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. By then, Thunderbirds was a great series and would have made a great action / adventure movie if only writers could have figured out where to target it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting this to be a romp, but I did not expect it to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, it would have been both visually stunning and exciting. It should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series ... rescuing people in need. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused on Alan instead of his brothers (who were also cast) as young as the original). The part of Breakout was Lady Penelope and Parker. I didn't care too much about the original characters, but I was very grateful for their movie. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I always enjoyed Thunderbirds for high-tech as stories, and even that didn't allow me enough time on the screen. I would have enjoyed more cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then I'm just a big child ...;)
