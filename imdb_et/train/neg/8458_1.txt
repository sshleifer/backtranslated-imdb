I bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery. It was to buy 2 get 2 for free and I needed one more, so I chose it. A terrible mistake. The box reads it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts like this big movie. About 5 minutes, that means. There's a young woman in the movie, Laila, who kills her bull, Jack, to save the bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a shepherd who is afraid of cities. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because he was afraid of this bull, and continues to hunt to find him. It was the first 5 minutes that is good. After that, only 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to be in some kind of acidic journey or something, because nothing else was thought of. Jack is on the go and finds this travel radio called DJ, who gives him a ride. I think Mary should be the type of Virgin Mary. You know, mother of Jesus. But who knows, I couldn't do it or tail. Because they run ... we see bad guys, magical visions, haunting encounters, setbacks, etc. And all these things are done so that your brain is painful, trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the movie back and exchanged something else. It's terrible, I say, terrible. And there is no bull fighting in this movie. If you don't read the movie in the first minute. I hope I helped some other people waste their movie time.
