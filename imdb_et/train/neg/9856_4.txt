In the autobiographical age plan "Romulus, my Father", Eric Bana, "Munich" famous, impoverished German emigrant, tries to raise Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in Australia in the 1960s. The main obstacle to family stability and happiness is her husband Christina (Franka Potente), who violates her wedding promises, blaming shamelessly other men. Despite his very untraditional behavior, Romulus refuses to give him a divorce, torturing himself in the hope that he will return to him one day. Unfortunately, it is a gracious and benevolent Raimond, who must prove this confusion of marriage - and his memory is the basis of the film (Raimond Gaita will later grow into author). <br /> <br /> While I admire "Romulus, My Father" for what he is trying to do, I cannot honestly say that I enjoyed it, because although the film has some subtle performances and serious intentions to do it just is not enough to discourage petty and funeral constraints, leaving the audience desperate and depressed when people are on the screen. One thing is a serious pace-of-life drama, but this unremittingly decline in adultery, madness and multiple suicide (not to mention suicide attempts) is something else.
