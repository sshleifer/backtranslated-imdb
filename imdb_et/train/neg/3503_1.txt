And when I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love peculiar, indecent humor. But this woman is so bent on B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and tempting. He's also completely humorous. He's dead when he tries to put his lines into action because he's just funny. I looked at the two segments of my program and was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Geez, my child (19 years old), saw his promo in Comedy Central and said he was a "stupid chick." I thought it was a compliment. That's where he says, "Look at my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually plausible. I know he wants to be a comedienne. He just comes up like a twisted walnut box. I just don't want to see her around my dog.
