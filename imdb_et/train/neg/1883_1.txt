I didn't think it could be done, but something has come and replaced Open House - a small budget horror that kills over high property prices - like the worst movie I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life. <br /> <br /> It was mentioned as the best film in the last film festival in Montreal, which makes me believe that every second entry must consist of blank wall pictures accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry. > <br /> Watching this movie was like a little hell. It comes from Austria, and it strikes in the footsteps of short cuts and Blue Velvet scenes of various suburban characters with dark undertones. There's a fat dog owner and a wife of her fat girl who strips her, a skinny divorce she lives with her in a house that contains her dead child's inviolable space, an uber-annoying woman who reads ten lists. The list goes on. Forever. Like the two hours I spent in this theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, characters interact, but not wisely or interestingly or even in an appropriate way. I couldn't tell if they would be acting as actors because, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were Austrian equivalent words "You're so flat!" They certainly didn't have to learn much because each time they repeated their same lines at least three times in the scene. <br /> <br /> This is neither Gummo nor any of the above films. There is no art to discover, and nothing to stay with, except whether you should change your "ever-walking movie" or not (which quite a few older couples made a random orgy during the scene and if it sounds appetizing), it doesn't not if you are not one of the few who can't find the idea that your parents are having sex, and some of the local middle-aged couples who will turn to revenge). <br /> <br /> This movie was offensive to me. Not a buggy nudity, not a buzzing soundtrack, not shocked scenes associated with weapons. I was offended by someone spending money to do it, if there are writers and filmmakers in search of funding. I was offended that someone out of town could have seen the dogs' days and come out thinking about whether it was the best we could find in Montreal. Most of all, I was offended that the people involved in the festival worshiped everyone believing that the Emperor had a great and mesmerizing new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as a lady of fat who made striptease. <br /> <br />
