I stayed one night and got very strange at 2.00 so I went through channels channellessly and H.B.O. where this "classic" played. Initially, I was lucky to be caught in the beginning, but my happiness dazzled the film for about two minutes. The whole film focused on an uninteresting man who had fear of women, four beautiful but empty spiritual women who worked as messengers in their uncle's canteen, and his enormously fat and very unhappy cousin who also works in the canteen. In this film, there are some strange twists that make it somewhat interesting, but certainly not worth it. Basically, if you don't have anything to do at night or just can't sleep, the drug works much better. However, boys have a lot of skin so it can be good to watch without sound, but even it can get annoying
