This is a candidate for my lifetime, the most disappointing film experience. Cool title, great director (I saw it before) and Mr Uma Thurman. How can I go wrong? Well, this is a question that pushed hours in my temples after I looked at this turkey. </p> at all costs. Its critical lambing was well deserved. Here is one of those rare films that does not contain any quality of redemption. Out of scratch ****.
