What can you say about this disaster? I watched it because it led the cable. I'm sorry for the waste of my time, but at least I didn't waste any money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the most exciting! Please, you have to be very generous not to get angry with the CHEAP Halloween costume. Well, there are also terrific exhibitions, f / x and dialogs. The confrontation with the creature is incredible, you don't get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst thing you can get directly into video videos. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies "for Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. The only "positive" thing about this trash is sexy women.
