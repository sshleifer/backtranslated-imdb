LOL! Not a bad way to get started. I thought it was original, but then I discovered that it was the KING KONG's 1976 remake clone. I've never seen KING KONG until 15 years. I saw this movie when I was 9. The funky disco music of the movie stays in your head! Not to mention the movie's thematic song by the jetans. This is the worst creature effect I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains the sacred Grail of B-films. Memorable quotes: "Take the sedatives and go to bed." "Put Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti power." I remember watching MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira watching this movie. There is one scene where it was like KING KONG in the opposite direction! In KING KONG, she grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this movie she climbs under the building and grabs the girl (who fell)! This year, another KONG clone was MIGHTY BEIJING MAN (1977), which came from Hong Kong. There are lots of travel matte scenes and motorized body parts. This movie leaves you laughing. It's like I said, just another KONG clone. Evaluated for PG violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
