A foywonder review of this cheap CTV hits the nail on the head. Make sure you read it. If you do not, the group will direct the scientists to the deep forest of the Pacific Northwest to cluster the broom tomb. The big leg family does not take it kindly and continues to withdraw the team one by one, mostly off. Big Foot has an explicit ape-like face, but it's less rare than Harry and Harry Harry. Most movies have a generic wooden character who pretends to be scientists who comforte in the woods and away. This is a budget movie with very little, at least on the screen. We can look at the sexiest women in the shower when one of his male companions watches, but nothing comes out of it.
