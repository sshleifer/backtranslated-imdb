I'm 17 years old and I still like most of Scooby Doo's movies and old episodes. I love movies of the 1990s, and recently we were treated with one of the best directs of this decade's DVD Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo and Goblin, which I didn't expect as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get Clue! I looked at some episodes, waiting for something very good, but what I saw was not at all impressive. First I hated animation. It was flat, drained and very Saturday-morning-standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even in some of the exhibitions I really hate, there was a little better animation. Worse still, Shaggy and Scooby seemed aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne because they added a lot of old episodes when Scooby Doo was a good one. I also hated changes in characters because it seemed that instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing a superhero, something they would never have been in the movies or Scooby-Doo where are you? to show. The subject's voice was not very good either, I don't even remember it, and the jokes were sheep and the poor. While I testify that there is a very talented voice if they have better material, and that he would not have been told that it was the same original voice as humanly possible, what they did, I could add. In conclusion, I thought it was terrible and I don't try to paralyze it, that's what I personally know. 1/10 Bethany Cox
