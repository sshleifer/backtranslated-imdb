This shame! There I was, with a beer and a comfortable popcorn bag, a comfortable hand on the chair, hoping for another entertaining Muppet night. What did I get? Disappointed! How do Muppets get up from the Christmas song? Humor was terrible, the songs were worse than the state and the west (and it says something) and the plot was both confused and poor as darkness. I think the main problem was that they caught too much Treasure Island. A short story, like a Christmas song, is perfect because you can knit it around with Muppet's high ties .... here's a lot of fun. Where will Muppets go? How about Muppets Wzzi Oz?
