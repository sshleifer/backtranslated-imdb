The first half was OK, but the last half was really disappointed. It's funny that the manufacturers even admitted that they had no end to the idea, and it really showed. What really sad is that I have to write ten lines of minimum comments to post. I really didn't want to add spoilers to qualify my comments because the show isn't worth it. When Battlestar galatica first came out, I was really happy about the prospects for better re-evaluations, it didn't happen when the first season's boundary was in porn space. Finally, they cleaned up a little and they actually had a fairly fair drama, so I started watching again. But to end the series, when the war is a cyclone god, it was the same between Belarus and six.
