** May include spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A typical topless heroine rescues another beautiful child and his father (an eccentric professor whose helmet of a back-up helmet is on one shot and completely broken). , Moomin, and Nasty Nazis - What else? - Build the fourth Reich. Misty's costume, as well as some other wimmen costumes, gets quieter when the film rolls. The last part of the film is dedicated to long-term lesbian activity; this footage becomes truly boring, a real fast that speaks more about the critters behind the camera than the curved creatures in front of it. MISTY gets its nominal plot first and fast and then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft heart. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a setback for films made in the 1960s, such as Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this miracle work had been rolled back forty years ago, it would have been playing on the 42nd Street for years with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to home video. Grab you, hurry, before it gets out of print.
