this movie starts with the usual funeral ... and it requires this usual funeral, so I lost interest in 5 minutes after viewing and started skipping scenes. it seems to me that who made this film has suffered to such an extent that it would remain a permanent illness that cannot think of anything but death and destruction. Well, I am not one of Southpark's blind children, I want a movie that will get me a very interesting story in 10 minutes, I don't sit and watch 10 minutes, but preparations for the funeral. he enjoyed this "movie".
