Invisible Man is a fantastic 1933 film, a cutting-edge film for the time when objects seemed to rest on a person who was truly invisible. Go ahead, watch the movie, you are shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first real film of special effects. Come 2000, computer-specific special effects seem to be child's games, the target groups are not distinguished by special effects, but they are frustrated if they are not done correctly. Hollow Man's special effects, the update of HG Wells' story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with the film Paul Verhoeven has directed, perhaps remembering Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Cainet, a scientist in the world of biological invisibilisation (yes, I know it is not a word), but of course he fights with the higher entrepreneurs who threaten to take away the funding of the team. So, if the filmmakers who are ready to interrupt their funding are inclined to do it, they make a final sacrifice and become a guinea pig for invasion (yes, I know, I used this word again). The process has terrible consequences, no Caine dies, but becomes a horrible violent creature, namely a dude. Now that she is invisible, Caine hides her sexy neighbor, co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and the man who took her money. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural creature, "That thing that doesn't die." Laughing at all the natural things, Caine sees her death and spits her face, because it takes time that this creature dies, dragging the end of the movie. The film is silly, stupid, and finally ridiculous, sometimes using realism, sometimes not. Hollow Man has the right options, but of course they are not explored. For a more interesting look at the invisible situation, be prepared for a good old-fashioned black-and-white cinema and look at the invisible man of 1933. Kevin Bacon still remains invisible when you come back, probably still at the bottom of the volcano.
