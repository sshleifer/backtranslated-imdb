Not exactly my genre, this is a street fight directly on the DVD that I just got into because a friend put it when we had some beers. I'm relatively open and Eamonn Walker is quite a fan so I sat back to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and bones are a story of Isia Bone, who is an ex-con who gets into the street as a fighter for unclear reasons that will eventually unfold as the movie progresses. Blah blah blah. What is a tedious movie. I understand that such films do not rely heavily on the plot, but do they keep things in such a stupid, predictable and completely stupid way? It may not be important, but it is disturbing for a nice rubber. It is better not to have any plot or clean activity than a narrative spiritual butterfly. Infected with completely unreasonable and unknown sentimental shocks, it is a cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey. Here you should probably mention what is, of course, the film's drawing point: the fight. Even in itself, the fight is quite poor. Bone manages to take out the single strokes of well-established tough street fighters (a big oaf or two is a ridiculous attempt by filmmakers to correct this inconsistency); Fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is stupid. Even this is repetitive and fooled, broken hands, and faced with constant sub-areas that we see again and again. <br /> <br /> Running a mill, a movie by film, that deserves to be directly into DVD mode, making absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen again and again. And not even very well.
