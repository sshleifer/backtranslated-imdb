Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a deadly, lonely old walnut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with a few servants and tells his doctor, "Don't try me with a doctor, doctor! I'm offensive!" He calls his brothers and siblings home and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness due to "brain reduction" (?). <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff ends with death and murderous "toys" (designed by his dead brother) begin killing relatives. A small cannon burns to the real bullet boys, a lifetime knight's grip on an ax and a dancing Sheik, who punches people with a knife. One man strangling, makes some fun faces. Finally, Julissa and her boyfriend, Karloff, are still alive and hiding in a cave where steel gates close the room. He plays repetitive orchestral music (a sort of death break that is used to kill), the brother's spirit begins to speak ("The whole house goes with me!") And the mansion goes up in the flames. <br /> <br /> This pointless confusion is too dark, boring and stupid dialogue never meets the lip.
