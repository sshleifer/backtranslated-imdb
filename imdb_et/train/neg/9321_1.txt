I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see the b-film slip, but ended up with stool for my eyes. The action was similar to looking at the lawn dry. I've seen better action in soft porn ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer goes out is confusing me. How was this movie's fear film? <br /> <br /> ridiculous under the best conditions. There were no fears. It seemed that a high school student got a new camcorder for Christmas. The plot was everywhere it was. If you are bored to look for a bad horror movie to rent, leave this one. There are many better b-movies.
