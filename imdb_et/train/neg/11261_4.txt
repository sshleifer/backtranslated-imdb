First of all, I have to note that you feel completely lost for over half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you don't know why or why. Finally, when you see things, you just realize that this is not just a twisted ladybug that deals with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegal sons ... Characters are pretty poor and actors (especially young people) don't do much to make credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a great actor, regardless of whether the film is pure garbage. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about saying "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that the dutan Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions and has filmed a few scenes that are quite intense ... Well, maybe, be next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
