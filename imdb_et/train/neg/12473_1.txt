This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen, it's all weak and inconsistent. Functioning is absurd, costumes even crummier and the story is non-existent. This poverty line sword and adventure movie was designed to capture some of the advances enjoyed by "Beastmaster" and "Conan", but it does not give us any reason to follow. Lead's character is dull and dull, he can't even fight the sword and sword from the 16th century. All sequences of action are such, slow and unreal, not to mention the castle and the terribly dated music as they ride the horse. Don't even worry about this devil.
