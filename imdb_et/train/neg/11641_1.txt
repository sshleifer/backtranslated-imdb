Although I am generally a good filmmaker, I am not limited to the films that flee from these limits, and I mostly enjoy and admire films that successfully violate the rules. And it is true that the director Pasolini violates the established cinema rules. However, my opinion is that it does not break them successfully or at the actual point. filmed and his films seem to be a less artistic choice than an amateur market. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-participants, and although many directors have done so with significant results, Pasolini's instructions tend to remain inactive. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often contains images designed to shock, insult or otherwise interfere with the audience. Such elements can often be used with amazing effects, but in Pasolini, such elements seem rarely to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who like, even admire Pasolini's movies. However, I have never met any of them and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that have caused me such a pleasure or admiration. When I judge her only for her work, I think she was essentially an amateur director who "did not break the rules" because of the lack of choice and skill - and who was originally praised by her "intelligence of existence", thereby affirming bad habits as a filmmaker . I find that his work is tedious, unimpressive and pretentious. And this also applies to DECAMERON. Unfortunately, this applies to almost every Pasolini movie that has failed me.
