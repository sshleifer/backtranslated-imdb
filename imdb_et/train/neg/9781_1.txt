I don't think I'm too far away, saying it's probably the worst film I've ever seen. I've worked on my favorite warfare list: "Longest Day", "Hell and Back", "Kwai River Bridge" (all black and white), all with good plots, rich characters, and great action. I have seen better dialogue and acting in a high school written by students. However, the plot is not a bad premise - it is simply poorly implemented. It's like a traffic accident, but I didn't see it off! The film does not need big money or big sets, ie "Twelve angry men" and "lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is no excuse. What did they mean?
