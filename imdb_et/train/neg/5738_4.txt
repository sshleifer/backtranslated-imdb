"Darkness" was somewhat entertaining, but it seemed that he lacked a plot that lacked one more than the other films accused of this damage; i.e. "bad taste". It really started from good when a man ran something. In the first few minutes, it was very horrible, but after a while the film just got to entertain gore, which at some point was hard to come by due to poor lighting and the quality of terrible recording. It was hard to believe the movie because the behavior of minors, which most of the time seemed like to some friends, was talking to the camcorder, changing the way they went. That, because of the lack of any plot, saw it as a movie without any script and without it. As mentioned earlier, gore was the only drawing point in the film that much of the time was hard to do.
