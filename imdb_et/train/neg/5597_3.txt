I say at least the movie is worth it, but it's bad. Most of the action is not good (I think only Sky showed promises) and you feel uncomfortable. All scenes that should be meaningful are really low, as if Ng comes out to his parents. There are many bright details, such as a tattoo on the shoulders of the sky, magnets in the fridge of the girls, and the terrible interior design of the gods ... and the music ... and the clothes .. and everything. Real life has never been such a movie. The boy says at one point: "I'm gay, not horny." And don't know. Even the comment is terrible, I turned it off after Ng talks about how he played with the lesbian.
