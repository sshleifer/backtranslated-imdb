Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to his uncle (Richard Tucker) to New York to experience his life before he shocks $ 25 million. His uncle has been paid to him by three women, Jacquit (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard), to ensure that he does not break the gold miners. One such lady, Cleo (Geneva Mitchell), is turning to the scene of condemnation of women. We're watching the story because the girls are being offered more money to show that the role of the sender they have agreed to live for three months is that Bill is in New York when Bill meets Cleo and another woman. Finally, love for Bill and the other is ............. <br /> <br /> In this movie, picture quality and sound quality are poor. The story is mixed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not that good. She is pleasant enough, but she really lives when playing a drum or thrombon. There is a very irritating character who plays the cab driver (Roscoe Karns) and the movie is just boring.
