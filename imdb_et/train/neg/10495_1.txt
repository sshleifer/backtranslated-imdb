I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have to go even 5 meters from the croc. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes, people eating and skit the president all make the movie one of the worst all the time. <br /> <br /> This is really a bad movie that you have to stay away from. All "jokes" are such minors that you laugh because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you don't know if the script is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Croc Hunter didn't ask him to see him on the crocodile after that.
