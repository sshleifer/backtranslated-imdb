First of all, let me say that I have to think a lot about commenting on this movie. The best overview of such a cinema can only be silence. The film is aimed at housewives and grandmothers. This film tries to look at "real" and the characters should be "real people". Italy could never guess that characters could be "real": they are just "low profile" stereotypes. It gives a very false vision of what life in Italy is. The plot is weak (plot? What's the plot?) And humor doesn't laugh at someone older than 12 years.
