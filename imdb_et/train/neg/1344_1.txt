Any movie with a title so ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically pay attention to any bad movie lover, but the plot is much different from what can be expected after watching a DVD cover. Bagman is not a good movie at all. It belongs to a movie category that appears to be (and probably is) filmed on a home video camera. Action is terrible. I haven't been working on such wood since Troll 2. I haven't heard and seen this kind of wood. The characters are moral and completely forgotten. The end (which I do not break) can be very expected after the first scene is viewed. Due to the unmanaged nature of the film, nothing terrible about the value of the industry is really scary (terrible attempts at a realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended only for bad movie enthusiasts.
