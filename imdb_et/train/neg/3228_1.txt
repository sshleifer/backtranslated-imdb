I've seen other guinea pig films, such as a mermaid well, and he never dies, and although they're quite sick, they have a bit of a sense of humor (though dark). But the devil's experiment is nothing more than filming a bunch of points that give young girls a lot of methods of torture and violence, and there is no plot or redeemable value. This is by no means intimidating, except maybe the way of thinking, but it is definitely nasty and I would not call it entertainment. Now, I'm not a good taste of the movie paragon and I like my trash and slip, but it was too much for me. I'm all about worrying, I'm actually looking for things that are upset if possible, but that was a bit much. A young woman is beaten, beaten, put on constant noise through the headphones until she drooles, and then in a sheet of raw meat and guts and hangs in the hammock in the woods. If you think this sounds good, go to it, but it certainly made me look more at Guinea pig stuff. 1 out of ten, absolutely nausea.
