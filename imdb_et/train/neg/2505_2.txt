I have seen enough of Richard in interviews and performances, and in enough poor Leon, who is the musical bio-image of their 50s in the 60s to find out that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as correct as David Ruffin in temptation, but he is unable to fully capture the character of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> Actress Miguel Núñez, who played the little Richard "Why do fools fall in love?" was a much more suitable choice when a powerful but feminine man was pulled out. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, the film is also. And that's what happened here. LH's fear of homosexuality and voyeurism has gone through or gone completely. What the "Temptations" did so well for the group's rise, warts and everything, this film remained a wide-ranging sign. <br /> <br /> What happens to director Robert Townsend, who started so well with "Hollywood Blending"? He's a talented, funny guy, but hasn't done anything first.
