Blonde and Blonder were uncomfortable. Basically, it was a dumb form of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny and they used too much background noise and music. It starts enormously boring, and TOTALLY inane. It doesn't pick up everywhere soon, and I was feeling more frustrated because it nonsense out. Perhaps, the only thing that saved me from this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes. Rich characters a little bit.If this movie doesn't laugh at me it missed my attention. I wouldn't say to completely avoid this movie, but you can spend thousands of better movies on your time and money than Blonde and Blonder.
