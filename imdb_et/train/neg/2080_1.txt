It's easy to see how it got below the average scenario at the Regency Films (and later Fox) early sales-pitch meetings: cross the superhero genre with comedy "Fatal Attraction" ... voil√†! I do not know how talented director Ivan Reitman was involved on earth, unless the reward was simply tempting. Unofficial employee at N.Y.C. meets the girl on the subway and asks her; despite being confusing and uncomfortable, he finally gets to bed - he only later explains that he is a big Apple superhero, G-Girl. This distaff Superman, who has the authority given by his fallen meteorite, is not a heroine of fantasy, but ... the scriptwriter Don Payne has understood him as a needy, overwhelming, imprisoning mother (he telegraphs us miles away, though Uma Thurman is still laughing) laugh role). It is such a worthless film that cannot be blamed. Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson, who speaks to Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by sour digging on the gays (it is for us that these two friends are strictly male men). After G-Girl's fright, who wanted to get her credentials, Wilson was told she was just scorned as a normal woman ... and wasn't that better? Thurman's early performances in films such as "Henry & June" and "Jennifer 8" presented an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic bone; his films with Quentin Tarantino helped reveal his burning hardness and intensity, but it came at a price (the actor has apparently lost his graceful touch). The picture is extremely well produced and shot with special effects with high vision, but nobody bothering to find humor in this scenario. It is tiring, loose, ugly and badly cast. Burned, frozen, Wilson can't tell any of his associates that he's been acquainted with G-Girl because he made him swear that he's rather the chain of his rectum. I don't know if the writer Payne thought it was fun ... or if someone was involved? * from ****
