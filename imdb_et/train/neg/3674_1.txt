Note: I publish an important part of the plot, but if you have a DVD cover or any promotional material, you already know it. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be written by an 11-year-old who is not very brilliant and probably very tired. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the UN and the NSA seem to be in the show in Hungary. Forget about the fact that when these masters intelligence services go for someone whose mere touch kills you in about a minute, they do not wear protective equipment (not even gloves). These are confusions in the context of this film. In the scientific world of this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity laterally. <br /> <br /> The fact is that people in this movie do not behave (with some exceptions) in the way people behave. Almost every time a character reacts, it is inappropriate. The love story (of course this is one) makes the soap opera script into Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.
