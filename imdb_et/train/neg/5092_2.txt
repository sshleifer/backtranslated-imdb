Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw a jury in Gagarin's life. He was sincere, modest and kind, he was satisfied and seemed an educated and intellectual person. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like the affected gestures and the mimic mannequin. They made a comic! The real Gagarin was someone else! Don't believe this movie! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after films like "Fire" and "Apollo 13" and "Cherets and Korolev: Myths", "Rockets and People" and Facts. "I had a shocking tiring scenario, bad action and production and "Space Race" a lot of inaccuracies. The film is a tedious development of Russian historical facts. Many interesting facts about space projects were not shown. Some facts and details were perverse. For example, in 1945 Korolev was not already imprisoned (released in 1944) and in 1940 he was not in the Kolyma Prison's gold mine, but in a special prison office. Korolev was a designer of a prison design office and was not buried by prisoners of prisoners. However, in the film, Korolev worked as a grave-digger after 1940 (because there are uniform shoulder straps in prison). there is no deep knowledge of this part of history and they cannot make interesting movies.
