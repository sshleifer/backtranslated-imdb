My girlfriend and I was wondering how bad this film was. In 15 minutes, we would have called it closing, unless we were too curious to see if the film could be redeemed. I do not understand this film's praise. Writing was absolutely terrible and some of the worst shows I have seen for a very long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that made me particularly worried about this movie was that people often spoke to each other there was an unnatural break between the lines. By understanding the pause, I understand discomfort (like happiness). It wasn't such a break - it was just bad leadership. This movie can actually be a lot better with subtitles, and maybe it's the best external market for the film because then there is not so much innocent dialogue and bad showing. <br /> <br /> In general, I like such small exotic movies (real blonde, walking and talking, cute and amazing), but it failed on so many levels that I consider it to be one of the worst films I've been in the last few years.
