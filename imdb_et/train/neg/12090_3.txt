Although I see the potentially redeeming qualities of this movie by intrigue, I certainly thought that the painfully long nature of the scene structure was too much for most viewers. The enormous holes in the scenario, as never explained before, "your dad died today" made the mother's comment even more difficult to understand these stars. <br /> <br /> It won the first prize in Cannes in 2001, which is shocking. Perhaps France was hungry for French this year and was desperate for something sadistic like this movie. I realized long scenes as a device that keeps the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but if it didn't match the main actor, it went too far for me and kept me close to the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is only meant for a movie's noir fan and who is waiting to see the movie after the end of the movie. I loved movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream", which were much more annoying, but at least gave the viewer editing and stretching. To look at this teacher slowly and painfully after a silent scene, it became so superfluous that I found this annoying - and I really wanted to like that movie every step of the way.
