I really didn't expect much of this movie because there are people in the Parkersburg WV where I live there. This city is boring and so this movie. There was some good in the movie, but I was confused by all the embarrassing landmarks they showed. This movie may be good if it had real action, but there was nothing there. If you are not from Parkersburg and are interested in what you see every day, stay away from this movie. The dialogue will make you fall asleep, the actors have suffered tears, and Steven Soderberg should lose that reliable picture after that. Its predictable film won't surprise you. What you see is what you get and this is a 73-minute excursion to Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
