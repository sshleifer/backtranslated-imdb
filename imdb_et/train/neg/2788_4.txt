Much has been written about the purple rainy, visible "quin-essential" music film, but I'm here to say that the film doesn't deserve this great praise. <br /> <br /> One thing, the Prince is a great musician and music is one of the areas where Purple Rain shines. Even the score is mesmerizing, and if it only captures a concert movie, it would be a great experience, unfortunately it is not, and the film has problems in this form. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a terrible act / writing, the prince's character "Kid" should be like a mysterious few words speaker, unfortunately it just comes as bright and incense. A lonely loner should at least have some talkative moments, but Prince's character rarely has some dialogue words in the movie and it is hard to believe that she would get the girl in this way. Everything just seems to be a bit down here, which is disgraceful because you can say that it is a character that is terribly contradictory and lives in a very difficult life, but we can never enter it. > The surprising aspect of this movie is just how much it takes at the concert. The life of Prince and Morris in this exhibition seem to be the kind of business that I think it makes sense from a business point of view, but it is tiring that we have a 2-hour movie where the seemingly half of it takes place on stage, especially when the character is retrospectively. This is not a very good movie.
