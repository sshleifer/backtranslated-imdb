The Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is puzzled when the defendant in the courtroom whispers "Thank you" to LL Cool Jile (as Rafe Deed) when he leaves the witness. The sequences of opening this movie will give you an explanation. You see Dylan McDermotti (like Frances "Laz" Lazerov), a detective partner of Mr Cool Ji, who MUST NOT murder Damien Dante Wayans (like Isaiah Charles). Police in the city of "Edison" are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and grab their holes. Regardless of whether he makes an impression on his girlfriend (called "Pussy") or wins Pulitzer, city corruption does not sit with noble Mr. Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, reaching both unexpected levels and life-threatening levels of danger. Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the movie over water, but hardly. LL Cool J wins the "star star movie star" for Timberlake (aka "rapper actor"). Mr. McDermott has fun with his role. The Gravitas lending procedure is supported by participants from Morgan Freeman (like Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means attack and tactical of the first response, but it is more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stands for Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems lost). <br /> <br /> ** ** Edison (9.9.2005) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
