This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic, Romance on the Seas. <br /> <br /> The story is more or less the same, but it is modern. Govinda plays a sharp weakness who is changing her husband while traveling. Although Rani is playing with her husband's college friend who does the same for her. They try to catch each other while the actual husband and wife try to travel to each other in Bombay. Rever plays a regrettable role. <br /> <br /> Lever plays the double role of father and son, both as a lawyer specializing in divorce proceedings. They are against the accusing couple against each other. <br /> <br /> It's a bad attempt to copy the original languages ​​and the songs are pretty terrible. Comedy is slippery and does not make too laugh.
