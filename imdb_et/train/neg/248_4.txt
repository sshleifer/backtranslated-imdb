When will it hurt? I never want to see a second version of a Christmas song. They continue the same story as making a movie, falling on top of each other, trying to make the movie better than the rest, but unfortunately it doesn't do it because it's not a good story. Moral, old-fashioned, conservative happy thinking. As people would learn. Numerous versions of this movie show that we don't.
