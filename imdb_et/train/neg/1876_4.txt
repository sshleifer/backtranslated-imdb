This is a small budget attack on the genre of espionage. To shape your expectations, you should know that: (1) the actor is wildly hard. The stars are very fun, providing their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures and turning off. (2) The script deliberately lacks consistency and credibility. Often, the lines are steep and humorous, because they have no relevance to the elements of the previous plot. (3) Scenes are often framed in unbalanced corners, poking fun genre exaggeration. (4) Pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum offers a sophisticated and classically uneven dialogue in a successful sarcastic way. <br /> <br /> The film has leading intelligence, deliberately starting with B-stolen plot element. 1930s: a secret code whose structure contradicts Carl Sagan's explanation. The film's overwhelming effect is mainly a 90-day comic effect. Fay Grim's son Ned is so early on to leave, so you can't help when you feel sorry for the boy. Parker Posey's beautiful choreographic fall from the bed helps the film to set the humorous tone early. <br /> <br /> The slow pace of the film does not increase the comedy elements or drama elements that appear later. The effect of the film as a drama reduces early comedy. What's more, it is difficult to be overly involved with the characters and their fate when the early parts of the film are so sarcastic. The music score is deliberately difficult, and I found it (and the camera corners off) more irritating than humorous. <br /> <br /> Overall action, incredible and almost incomprehensible plot plot / aversion, and slow pace begins to grind for many viewers. The movie is too long, 158 minutes. <br /> <br /> This means that fans of film sarcasm may want to look again ... using closed captions to best capture the intelligent ridicule of dialogue. The film was too slow for me and sarcasm felt heavier than light. But comedy can also appeal to your taste. The film is a worthwhile view for those who enjoy independent films, director Hal Harley fans or Parker Posey (who is most with cameras).
