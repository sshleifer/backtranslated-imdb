Watch the movie website for more time than you did when writing this movie script. It was no longer able to say it. The original story? Original? They had to find that the script has been omitted from the old testament or that it has a legal setback to this horn tinting. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with Atari 7600 and earwax. Stylish cinematography? Oh, yes, the more funny American video look is classic. I'm sure they had little money for this title, so of course, sf isn't really that good or a little bad now and then, or just fun, but it's a story that makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories are rolled into one and all of these invisible unseen and already made.
