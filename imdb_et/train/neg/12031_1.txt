First, it is not a comedy film; if you do not really force yourself, you hardly laugh. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. Operation is not bad, but not special. The Lucky Luke comic has two families (one big nose and one big ear) fighting each other in a small town ... you're laughing much more than reading this movie instead of wasting your time. Religions and dogmas are not the best source of comedy making and this film no longer affirms this rule. A similar comedy is "Home Teachers"; it had some good moments. My last comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this inexorable and boring film.
