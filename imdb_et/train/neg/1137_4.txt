I tried to go through this movie twice, for the first time, and it was like pulling the teeth and the second time despite the DVD transmission. Problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> When you reach a dramatic courtroom scene that takes most of the movie's second half, it's done, but it's hard. "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) is an interesting conversation during the trial. The end is touching when Lincoln walks and they place their Memorial on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a nice story, well-functioning and kind of .... but the first half has no sparks and the first half has no ignition viewer hanging there. I suspect that the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
