I read the book and the book was exciting. <br /> <br /> This film, its direction, the scenario and the actors were completely upset. I suffered from the absence of a scenario that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the actions, simplicity, and courage to illustrate the probability-based story of brevity. <br /> <br /> I see why this movie was not made public in most cities. Never recommend this movie to anyone I know. Just one of the worst adjustments I've seen has become a plot of less heavenly exploration on earth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was indeed the only highlight. But how does it succeed when filmed in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> Potential viewers don't waste time or energy on their flop.
