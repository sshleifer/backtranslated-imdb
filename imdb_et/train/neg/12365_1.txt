I think this garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why do all American animators think children today want good GI JOE versions of good stories? Looney Tunes are some of the most loved characters in history, but they are not designed to create Xtreme. Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be renewed without losing the original charm, but this garbage is just an example of stupid company decisions that only want to create a cheap idiotic example that kids love because hey! ! children love superheroes? the whole show is just a waste of time, where we see new versions of Looney Tunes, but this time it doesn't sound too bad in the form of superhero, but the problem is that this show tries to copy the series like batman animated series or new law, result ??? bad copies of flash (tea runner) or superman (who else bugs bunny) problem is that Looney Tunes wasn't meant to be dramatic, had to be funny !! As I said before this series sucks, and many people wonder why anime is taking over the world? this show is trying to be dramatic and functional, but it is something that some series and anime can do if you want to see a good update of the old show exhibition design, Tiny Toons, an example that can be brought back to life by old characters, but a good story and original roots. too bad that the show is already dead, another company wise decision i guess.
