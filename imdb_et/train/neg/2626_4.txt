I saw this movie a year ago in the group of "Fast-moving Film Festivals" where we decided to rent a number of B movies and vote for the one who chose the worst. it was voted the best because it was the similarity of pieces and fun costumes. Personally, however, I would not recommend any additional substances ... this film will leave your own brand. <br /> <br /> It made me impressed that I actually tried to copy my hands in a few years. <br /> <br /> A good choice for watching bad movies. It's fun and I remember bouncy music ...
