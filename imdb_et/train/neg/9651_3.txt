The film is a complete mess. We have two good actors who have failed and the actress Salman Khan's skimmer to attract a female audience. The story is nonsense. The signs are poorly sketched. Missing story. No need to talk about editing. Ajay Devgan as Rock Starâ€¦ it's a dream itself. The film pulls along the decadence point. The entire career of Arjun, who brings his Manna to London, lets him grab his girlfriend and let him play in Wembley (the dubbing process Vimbley) is absurd. Salman Khan is acting up or counterfeit too painful to look. I remember seeing good movies from Vipul Shah, but that's not one of them. All good leaders seem to fall into the Box Office mania that Mumbai Media Morons have created. It's another movie "Wanted" and an idiot actor, like Salman Khan, who isn't in the good Hindi cinema. He's good for Indian cinema because Titanic was a winter travel business. With a positive note I like the character of Asin, who dances in Bharatnatyam when he turns into a Western-style dance, if the teacher doesn't look.
