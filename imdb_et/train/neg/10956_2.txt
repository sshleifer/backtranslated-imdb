I bought this movie at a discount on the Gamestop that was used in the film chamber and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The movie itself is slowed down and they use the entire movie with ten different monkeys, hardly seeing similar. Not to mention they use a stunt double, which is just a short guy in costume trying to desperately tempt. another small rent in a Warner Bros movie preview and he got money in the studio. Nor does it help him not even being infamous for the terrible work he did, even when he was a well-known poop-chute movie. <br /> <br /> Why has this movie ever been made?
