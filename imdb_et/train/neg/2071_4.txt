I had two reasons to watch this swashbuckler when he broadcasted yesterday on Danish television. First I wanted to see Gina Lollobrig - and here I was not disappointed. He seemed proud. Secondly, when I was reading the film, I had the impression that it was an absurd humor, unlike Philippe de Broca. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this account. I found the jokes predictable (except for some meaningful remarks about the war issue) and the characters in one-dimensional. Scenes were also strangely mechanically and coerced without any drama at all. I looked up to the end, but I missed it very quickly and sat there, waiting for Lollobrigida scenes.
