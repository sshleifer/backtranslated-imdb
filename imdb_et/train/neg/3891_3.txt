I think my favorite part of this movie, which illustrates many pointless, stupid, and unpleasant, comes at the top of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend, the sheriff, have finally melted at the angle of the defrosting device on some stairs of the power plant. Remember that Nelson has been looking for the MM for almost the whole movie and that MM has killed and eaten several people at this point (including his boss) and Nelson is very aware that MM is violently crazy and human So sheriff gun directed MM -i who is and I give this movie and Rick Baker's props, the most disgusting and terrible human form we've ever seen. And he punishes a very important issue for DOCTOR TED NELSON: "What are we doing now?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera cuts DOCTOR TED NELSON and it is clear that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently, Ted was so eager to solve the problem of the molten man, that he never thought of bringing some restrictive devices, lasso or narrow band or net, or some transient darts, or perhaps a Vangelis new era tape to calm the wild beast. <br /> <br /> Both the sheriff panic and shoots, the melting man gets frightening and fun. Perhaps it explains why NASA has switched over to space-shuttle space in the space of less than a month in the last 30 years instead of going back to Moon or Mars, as everyone knows they are all aware of doing. I dunno. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it is such a weak, lazy writing and direction that is subject to every aspect of this movie. It is hard to say how well the actors really are, because the film has a total contempt for its character. <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful queues will also increase the stupidity of the process. An old couple in the world is trying to steal lemons to break only the fountain. This scene is the lowest of the 70s cinema. I can guarantee that you have never looked at a more meaningful and irritating device that sees prominent people throughout your life. And attacking a melting man in a house living in a house where they hold a horse that lies on the walls covers every attempt to process it (BTW, I think the famous film director Jonathon Demme is on the scene to check out a man who first goes to the house and never comes again out). The only thing that keeps the actress literally chewing is that, as I said, their horse is probably peeing on it. And we are forced to look at his hysteria for at least two minutes longer than any of the SANE film directors had to shoot. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should beat the IMM director and photographer. I remember him from the old Columbo episode, where he seemed much better than he was here - no one thinks of a leading person, but is confident and unobtrusive. But no one in real life can be as unpleasant as his director looks at him here. <br /> <br /> All others, except old couples, get a little better (and stick, I know they are laughing, but I'm not laughing!), but not much. <br /> <br /> This is definitely part of the cinema catastrophe category "So bad you can't watch". However, I would look at it again before I look at many other 70's and 80's abortions (remembering "Moonbeast tracking" and "It lives at night") and the MST range is so much fun, so if you have the opportunity , see the MST version.
