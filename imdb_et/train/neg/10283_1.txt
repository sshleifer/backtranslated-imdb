I hate like an "old man" but, frankly, I haven't seen too many movies that I would love after the 1960s ... in general, the movies seem worse and worse (although I enjoyed Scott Baiot's "Bread, my lovely", out except for the "de rigeur" ​​sex scene, which did not add anything to this film, this film makes the mother, the former Las Vegas choir, impossible for her survival, although she is clearly in her 50s (although she pointed out she is 40 I was 57 years old and like all the women I know in my 50's and 40's are more than able to survive (as I have done since graduation from a 13-year-old high school, I got legal emancipation and left my life <br /> <br /> The daughter is not credible in her job ... she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve (a great opportunity) and this ball also falls, but when another female employee enters up on the disc and are ready a, writers shoot him as "opportunistic" when he just did what every career-oriented person would do - by taking advantage of the widespread opportunity created by the lack of independence. his colleague's discipline, a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of respect for her promises (to her boss, in this case). <br /> <br /> Daughter grabging "allows" her to stay with her, temporarily, but then treats her mother (a woman who gave her life and raised her "adulthood") like a pariah. Obviously, such "writers" do not understand that it is NOT "common thing" for parents to act as children, and then treat their children as their children. It's just more of a social "balance" that Hollywood is trying to push down our throat as we, their public, would be stupid to want their creative offerings for entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie with a fool. If the young male restauranteur had been a real and not two-dimensional "television", he would have stayed with his mother, who was not as much older than him and quite attractive. Eventually, however, he falls for his daughter, the low, rather uninteresting girls who have such a youth, but in a normal, blissful way. ("Oportunistic" young woman who didn't work with her was much more physical, attractive.) <br /> <br /> There was no incredible reason why the audience preferred her daughter (who was surprisingly selfish, self-centered b * tch Mom's incredulous disrespect to her mother - a woman who was confident, lovely, humorous and had the pleasure of not even understanding her daughter. which allegedly created a gap between her and her odorless daughter. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how these characters were developed or not, it is a waste of movie and valuable viewing time if you are not CHILDREN. mustard?)
