The documentary revolves around the Holocaust survivor, Eva Mozes Kori, which is part of Mengele's twin rites, consisting mainly of Auschwitz cases and comparing the emotions of survivors of other double-fledged experiments. There were obviously big comments in the film. This is one of the topics nobody dared to say the opposite. <br /> <br /> I, too, a big part of the film, wondered the emotion that the filmmaker probably wanted to focus on. One of Eric Monder's IMDb users' comments (obviously there is nothing critical to say in a public forum) could only be found in the sweetest nectar. "In a number of dramatic sequences, such as the Jewish group arguing with the Jewish center of Kori, even the meaning of the word" forgive "is discussed, but the isolated and overcrowded Kor has its own" But by that time there is an impressive stance that the film had enough of my standing emotional repertoires to I saw clearly again. After "strong will" to Eva Kori, he forgives the "Nazi prisoners" to start firing, which is forgiving, at least Kor. The film is followed by his adherence, his public statement, which gave the Nazis forgiveness and a new territory. For me, it was the meat of the film, surrounded by ineffective fats of his "act of forgiveness." Of course, this was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> In his mission to test his theory of forgiveness, he is doing his "promised land" to heal the wounds of the past to meet some Arabs to discuss with them the problems they are facing and see if the dialogue does not contribute. bring a better understanding of the situation and a strong confusion with the discussions and discussions with Jews in the US about Nazi forgiveness, including one Jewish center in Chicago. Since then, anyone who is not so tear that he does not see the screen finds that his statements are obviously in conflict. <br /> <br /> First of all, you will immediately notice your body language, protect and do not want to listen to a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. His comments on how he was afraid to rob him show how much time, effort and money the whole thing is wasting. The pretty annoyed Dr. Sami Advan (Professor of Education at the University of Bethlehem) gets it just when he tells Kor to tell him he's sleeping in his apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, a discussion at the Jewish center in Chicago, where he has been forgiven for his grilled meaning, and his right to do so, after those who continue to suffer due to the trauma of their actions. <br /> <br /> I cut again. At the end of the movie I hoped I didn't decide to watch the movie. The film was badly made, leaving Auschwitz deeper than the purely trivial, just enough to ensure that the Holocaust was refreshed in the minds of the viewers and tears. It showed that the documentary, Kor, was unable to participate in a fair debate. His ability to discuss was confined to giving (at best) his attitude to complete unwillingness to listen or to participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, are all so slow that they can't distinguish between peace-making and forgiving? Quoting another IMDb user: "I don't see her forgiveness weak - on the contrary, she just wanted to release her soul from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over so she let her go." This would be the perfect concept of making a non-proprietary concept of PEACE. <br /> <br /> I think there is no room in the world of propaganda, blind faith, and political correctness to question those who have "gone through more than one can understand". <br /> <br /> PS Glossary should definitely go to the list of books that everyone will continue to buy.
