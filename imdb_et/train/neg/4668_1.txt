A potential film extravaganza in the 19th century failed. The big name actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others were not the reason for the film's failure. But the film didn't end, wanted an apology for the plot line and fell into pieces with that consistency. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, whom love combines and destroys beauty (or its absence) and resentment, is the mother's early death and missing father side. The father played by Finney is a disturbed man who tortures his daughter both in life and in death. He believes that the good appearance of his daughter destroys his fortune when they marry their social status. The participants tried to save the story in vain from what was left. The Washington Square is a black hole of destruction and destruction that wastes a great deal of effort on the people. I'm going to give 0 instead of this movie, instead of acting on the actors. Save yourself, stay in Washington Square.
