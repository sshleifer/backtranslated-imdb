I wouldn't say it's a * bad * movie. Unfortunately, I get the feeling that the more you know about the fence, the worse it just comes from the fact that it becomes completely unrealistic. I've been a 14-year-old fence and this movie is very bad about it. Mr Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have a certain fence background), but most other participants - especially students - seem to have disappeared.
