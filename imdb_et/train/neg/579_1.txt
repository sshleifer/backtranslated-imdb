Listening to the director's comments confirmed what I suspected while watching the movie: it is the filmmaker who wants to play the film. The plot is something that cheated on teenagers when they pass through when they pass "I could write a book / scenario / award-winning sitcom". There is an interesting idea that is buried (probably because it is a sequel to another movie), but it is completely buried under a signed, poorly executed and ridiculously unthinking script. <br /> <br /> These lines are terrible and the performances are tempting, though again I have blamed the director. It seems that he has not consulted the participants at all what is needed, rather wrote the script, guided the camera to them and said they would manage it. Who knows, little instruction, would have been able to release the actors better (to say what you like about the musicians in the movies, Jon Bon Jovi was in a great row on his boat and more than an acceptable leading man). <br /> <br There is no cast chemistry in its current form. A nice way to use classic sex and vampireism in parallel is over if a blood transfusion is given to him to infect Bon Jov's character with a vampire blood from his hard-accompanying hunter. He should have bitten him. Remember that they should have been interested in the rest of the movie. The only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leaders is the random admission of the leaders themselves. He had originally planned to use this silent sequence to apologize for the pointless plot expositions - so I think the finished product could have been worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, when movies go, it's poorly drawn, silly and forgotten. Even if the trashy movies go, it is not sexy enough or entertaining enough. It could have been a fun and bloody little romp, but the director has left more comedy for all the wrong reasons.
