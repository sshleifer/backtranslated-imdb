How did it become blocking? Dear God, I don't know where to start, why this movie is too much to suck. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the operation of some characters. The film was too bright, they should have done something with lighting, eg. darkening the environment. The creation of some dead characters made this film a horror hit in the 1970s. It's 2006! People are not afraid of other people who are carrying a hard way. Most horror scenes we take from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. The whole rip! That's why I don't watch Tagalog movies. The only reason why so many people are "shouting" when watching this movie is due to compliance. How many times do we have to copy scenes from the Ring and improvise so that instead of leaving the TV, it is now in the window of the neighbor? Regardless of how you put it, ITS STILL A RIP OFF.
