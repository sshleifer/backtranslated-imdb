this movie offers. the best is when an uncomfortable teenage neighbor tries to get away from the babysitter and in the background it seems she is never near her bike when she tries to fall off. <br /> <br /> But this movie does not end when less than 5 minutes later it gives something but only a hand that extends through the garden and into the cooler that pulls the beer out. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical grilling bars, a number of land lines that go somewhere, and a former seafarer actor with bluetooth mobile phones all give it a perfect Saturday night home.
