Class is a comedy series that depicts a group of 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the exhibition. That's why it makes me sad that the class is not funny, though it has obvious potential. It's not enough, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to the slow pace and the absence of really fun strokes. Some participants also have difficulty scheduling. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters written for the inventor are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they seem a bit too square for the show. On the other hand, the most interesting characters are the main character Ethan and the usable pair-Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> What disturbs me is that the only Latino character, Aaron, is to accept his accent (even if it is not revered but still).
