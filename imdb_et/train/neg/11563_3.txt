This frenzy of Italian film begins with a very soft porn movie and becomes a mystery with some up to many open ends to be good, and it's pretty boring, making this movie very invisible to my taste. The only thing really worth seeing is that many movies are common. The story is a boy who, at the beginning of the film, attracts girls to break his castle, where he continues to take them to his cave, and apparently kill them. They show nudity, but they never show murders at this point in the movie. Then the guy finds a party with a nice red head and goes out with him and marries. He has the red heads you see, because his beloved ex-wife Evelyn was also one, she also died in situations that should not be in the audience business. After many spoken scenes, murders that are related to snakes, foxes, and the like. It is easy enough to understand who is responsible for the murders and what is the motive if you have a meaningless ending where everything is not so nice. This movie just didn't work for me, left me with many questions, and the last third of the movie didn't have the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evely's death would have helped the film as if there was some end to Evelyn's tomb. This title is not entirely misleading because he continued to grave, not under his own power. Gore is usually very light, because there is a scene with too much blood in the foxes and the scene. I just thought this film was dull.
