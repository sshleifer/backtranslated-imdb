Palestinian "cause" propaganda film. If you waited for an unbiased documentary about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you must look elsewhere. If you are anti-Semitic (or only anionist --- something wrong in advocating the destruction of the country?) Or critically to support the Palestinian goals (eg massacre, Israeli destruction), the documentary is for you. We should make a college evening on campus campuses in the UK and the US. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged by the number of lies in this video. I just hope that those who do not really know the situation are not spoiled by this anti-Semitic slag.
