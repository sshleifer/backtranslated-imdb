This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify meaningless ideas, constrained by statements such as "we all create our reality". <br /> <br /> Sorry, people, reality is what's true for all of us, not just tough <br /> <br /> The idea that "everything is possible" does not keep water from exploring: if something is possible, then the opposite things are possible and therefore nothing is possible. This leads to a postmodern mess that is nothing but an attempt to bring down the established truth that all ideas that are well founded and foolish are equal. <br /> <br /> quote a science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well: "Reality is what, if you don't believe in it, it won't disappear."
