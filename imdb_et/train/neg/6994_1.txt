When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was so wrong. This movie was just like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many other movies. But the difference with this and other movies is that the story is very weekly. It's a bad actor and boring music. The photo is OK, but the rest is a complete mess. Don't look at this "horror movie", go and see Ring 2 or another movie that has a lot more story. I hope they will stop making horror films with a virus and virus and put people in zombies. We've seen that enough. The only good thing about the film is when they stand on the roof and the famous, infected celebrities come.
