Director Sidney J. Furie has created a postmodern absurd masterpiece at Hollow Point that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask what will happen to tired traditional traditional paradigms in "plot" and "characterization" when you remove the "motivation" and "cause" crutches. <br /> <br /> The result makes me say that my opinion about him could not be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this film makes sense, law enforcement officials are sure and unlikely, and organized criminals are crazy.
