Larry Buchanan. Yeah, the same man who made the "Eye of Attack" and two (count 'em: TWO) conspiracy about Marilyn Monroe. He's guilty here. <br /> <br /> Add Oliver Stone's e-I-grown-out-out conservatory folders here. ie, "Beyond the Doors"), which is an effective definition of historical inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you know about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar. Y'see, the three great names of the 60s rocks were killed by the government because they were subversives or against the exclusion, justice, and American paths. along. <br /> <br /> Anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who look like their real life colors (that is, if you completely close your eyes, turn your back and walk around five miles) show that instead of these deaths, A good old USA put them out! Yeah, that's the truth! <br /> <br /> Man, I can't believe I watched this movie. Stealing the credibility of str striking point is ridiculous; show that TV commercials look like a big drama and when you look honestly at the end, you deserve the end of "twisting". You really, really; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But as the man said, "Rock and Role are dead - alive rock and roll." <br /> <br /> Not that flick. <br /> <br /> No "Down on Us". And this is the movie viewer who describes the movie.
