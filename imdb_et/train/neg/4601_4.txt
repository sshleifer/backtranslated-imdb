I don't know anything about a previous work of a writer or director, so I wouldn't have brought any prejudice to the film. Based on a brief description of the Guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But the improbability was put on unreliability. The move of each plot seemed an excuse to pull more bloodshed, terrible makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The result was professional and Kari Wuhrer seems to be a decent actress, but the rest was more than disappointing. It was a positive rejection. <br /> <br /> I do not go through the nuances of narrative, but I give an example of what I think is superfluous words. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls his former victim (Wendt) out of the frozen body's freezer. McKenna killed Wend, beating her neck. Now he feels he has to destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendy's death. (What are the police officers, measure your bite radius?) McKenna gets rid of the Wendt's head and neck freezer, which is taken in, takes the ax and starts cutting the head of Wendt. Create. Create. Create. The ax moves around Wendt's neck. The air is full of frozen meat flying clothes, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (She brushes it when she's done.) McKenna then takes the frozen head to the small fire she has built. He sits over his head, squats next to it, takes some photos of a woman he just killed, and shows them to Wendt. "Do you remember him? We could have really done it if it wasn't for you," he says. "Duke, you always liked the campfire, isn't it?" he asks. Then he put his head on fire. We can only burn it from burning, but we hear that the flame is bright. <br /> <br /> I don't want this garbage to be censored. I only mean who enjoys this stuff. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue with the rest of the movie. Well, I mention one example of "improbability" because I brought the idea up. McKenna is kidnapped and locked in the dark bare. He knows he's going to die halfway the next day. (He has literally called for it.) What would you do in this Poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does about what might be the last night of his life. She finds she has to throw away a calendar with a pin-up girl and masturbates (successfully). Give this person a medal of freedom! <br /> <br /> Monster, who looks like Pizza Hut, is thrown into some unnecessary setbacks. The camera is often hand held and weird. The dialogue has such features as: "Life is a piece of ***. Or else it is the best of the possible worlds. It depends on you." A wide-angle lens is used to make ordinary faces a curling mask. The house blows at the end of an explosive fireball, when the hero McKenna walks in front of us. <br /> <br /> Some heroes he has. First, he kills a man for $ 13,000, pushing him several times with his head, then with potted plants before the refrigerator is finally tilted to the body. (It does not bother him, but it is not enough to keep him from paying.) Then I hope I have another, he kills Wendt, pulling out a part of his neck. Then he accidentally kills his first victim's wife and accuses him, although almost any moral calculation had nothing to do with it. Next, he burns alive the headache (Baldwin). Then, when he has taken off two smaller weights, he deliberately blows them up, although one of them is not completely insecure. And we should take root for McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not cartoons like those in Dirty Harry's movies - bang bang and you're dead. They are slow and painful. The first - murder for $ 13,000 - is tough enough to resemble in real life. It is not really easy to kill another person, as Hitchcock had shown on Torn Curtain. But this scene does not allow any importance. <br /> <br /> Some people may enjoy it, especially those that are young enough to think that pain and death are things that only happen in movies. Here are some beautiful things on the screen.
