This is the most common traditional ghost story, which even the use of Irish locations did not revive. How Big the M.R. James would never have offered this story, so does James really have a story called "Thin Ghost"? - he wouldn't have wanted to publish it. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles will appear in limp endpieces as old friends, the producers of this movie. His presence and one funny film industry would have earned this Oscar nomination with his decoration. This is even more evidence of the need for Academy awards to never have been a guarantee of merit.
