... ever. It's north. I'm not kidding. The theater should have had a warning. "Cancel all the hopes you enter here" would have been appropriate. Its weakening stupidity does not even amuse. This film is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The story was stolen for a 10-minute Bugs Bunny comic and it pulled out like Mr. Fantastic 90 for exceptionally painful minutes. <br /> <br /> Remember when Wayans was funny. I think the pressure on the production of Hollywood production has been blamed for a steadily accelerating cock. I'm sad and offended that they think we're stupid enough to enjoy a 90-minute board joke with a thin line based on a caricature. <br /> <br /> I didn't like almost anything about this movie. I'm not breaking anything, but the child is actually a dwarf with a Marlon Wayans face that is badly dwarfed over the body. What I liked DID was the end. Not the movie's resolution, but the actual end where we all rose and went out. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie one star, but it deserves a lot less. I don't think it's worth the stars in the six minutes they wrote about writing the script. It deserves Razzia and I pray to God for it. <br /> <br /> When people start learning; if you stop seeing this idiot, they will stop it. Seppuku is a sensible alternative to this film. Avoid it at all costs. You have been warned.
