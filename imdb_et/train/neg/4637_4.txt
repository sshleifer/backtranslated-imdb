The Bangville police have allegedly celebrated the debut of Keystone Kopsi, a studio-based artist. In this, however, they are not dressed in strange costume costumes and do not drive fast with the advanced car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who asked her father for a calf. Later he sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. One answer and chase are on. Next, Mabel slides his door as someone has come in. It turns out that his mother, who jumps to the conclusion, robbers are there! So Mabel blocks his door with furniture, mother and father are trying to fight their way! It was probably the most fun part of the short with the police car explosions. It was a short 7 minutes that went so fast that it was before it started. The only real trait that has evolved is Mabel, who expresses the charm with his face and big eyes, and looks so optimistic here, except of course when he's scared. It's easy to understand why it became an asterisk. Mostly because I suggested it at least once and why I give it.
