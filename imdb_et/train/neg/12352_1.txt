<br /> <br /> How this movie became a 6-star medium is beyond me. The script is so banal and frankly offensive to whom this life is based. Cinematography comes directly from the advertising world and gifted Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not show any surprise by taking part in this film when he looks at his list. All in all, the "high definition" style is a movie that even Don Simpson is ashamed of.
