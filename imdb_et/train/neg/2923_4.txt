The plot was quite interesting, against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. I also liked to see Budapest because the movie was filmed there. Unfortunately, there were zero chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The scenes of love were forced and mechanical. Jordan's Kirckland was really rigid, almost icy. Rob Stewart was quite charming and a boy, so he looked like his older sister, not his girlfriend. Finally, when we finally realized who was actually after them, it was rather weak and had no sense. I think I would have enjoyed this film much better if the relationship between the two participants was a bit more reliable.
