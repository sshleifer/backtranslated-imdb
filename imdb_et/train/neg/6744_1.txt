As you all know, JIGSAW did not reach Blackbuster because he was a member of Full Moon staff at Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells to all video chains. He recently released BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He was convinced that the Blackbuster buyer would not take JIGSAW and double BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop and BLEED looks like a hit. The main problem is that BLEED is one of the worst movies, and as we all know, JIGSAW is gold. I invite you all to go to the BLEED website and vote for a movie that has broken JIGSAW and all your talents. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW page and give it a big voice (if you haven't already). We need to get JIGSAW to at least 8 or 8.5 and BLEED to about 2 (this puts the Internet on the top 100 movie listings). Also try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone is doing well, - Matt
