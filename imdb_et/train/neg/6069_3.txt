It won't stop me from surprising how you can take a great actor and put it in these films. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he couldn't save that movie. In fact, his character is much the same as he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can't keep it if the actors make the same scene over more than one movie. I believe it will get old and here it is. <br /> <br /> There's nothing surprising about this movie, but then the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player and his mind shows his character. De Niro plays an obsession fan, but his role in this film is less than fun. <br /> <br /> But since De Niro is in this movie, it will be a fan if you're a fan (no pun) who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Nirot at his best, check out "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land" or even go back and see "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". Don't waste your time with this drivel. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 3/10
