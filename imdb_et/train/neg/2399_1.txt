What is this?! Is it a comedy, a horror movie or just something? This is by far the worst film I've ever seen. Especially at the scene of a novel, when it gets a werewolf, it must be the worst scene ever made. This movie is not funny, it's not scary or fun at all. Please do yourself (and me, I don't think anyone should endure this movie) and DO NOT watch this movie! If you can, throw it away and cut it.
