Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, I thought it would be useless. That's it, without fun. This film is really pointless, it is not about any plot or character development or any stories. The main problem with this movie is killing and gore. Basically, each kill looks exactly the same. ZOmbies hanging over someone. Yes, it's okay, but you also need some original killings. I mean, it got very flat, every killing seemed exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love gore and the gore of this movie didn't do anything to me. It was just boring. There is no story, just the same flat scene with another and another person. I also wanted to like this movie. I love movies ... like Redneck Zombies. But I couldn't adopt myself. This film has good points, but none of them are on film. I understand that many "zombies" contributed to the flood and there were like over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool, how they got so many people and helped the world. In general, it's a terrible movie.
