This movie is exactly what you get when you really stretch your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed a driving test and then selected them in the Grand Prix (not I can add, the US Grand Prix because everyone can pull out ) due to bad tires and you can just win), this is how far this movie falls. Now don't take it wrong, I love B-movies, about half of my collection is made of B-movies, but I don't think the alphabet has enough letters to describe how bad this film is. > <br /> The first story (for B-film) is not so bad that it has the potential to make a B-film brand, did not talk about Friday's 13 potential, but potential. But what really makes this movie work is not in one second, if I don't believe anything, it's like watching QVC, except QVC presenters tend to get tougher. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would like to say that I've seen worse movies, but I can't.
