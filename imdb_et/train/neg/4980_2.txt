I just read the protective view of this movie because it was a low budget, now with my stuff. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters were reasonably well animated but implemented in the worst possible way. Fighting scenes were not even fighting it was just one shot actor then one blow monster with great interaction at all. When the monster was communicating, it seemed that it was made by a paint shop pro. I think you should use models and dolls if you have a low budget. They may not be so fancy, but at least they communicate, see Peter Jackson's early films. <br /> <br /> With a working Beowulf, he made a descent, but the rest did not try and forget where they were. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to me confused. One minute they would talk as if they were today's settings, where the next one will be the speech of the drama club Shakespeare. I am not saying that it should be "you" and "that it must be", but you need to find a unified balance so that these lines can be heard from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed this part in the near future when Beowulf quoted an old testament that would have been found if he hadn't spent the rest of the movies on gods and portents. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is very polished but in turn turn.
