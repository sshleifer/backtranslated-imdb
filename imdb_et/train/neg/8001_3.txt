MONSTER - He was great; I loved the special effects that created this monster that looked like a "black lagoon creature". The scenes of the beast that travels the land and occupies people varied from good jaws. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENT: A large part of the story goes in the quarantine area as doctors (under government orders) have a SARS-like disease out there. In short, we get a familiar government story. You know, I'm waiting for this liberal paranoid way of thinking, where Hollywood movies always paint our government corrupt, but it seems that the Koreans are copying the format and it's very annoying. Here it takes the excitement and tension of this "monster". It just drags the movie down. In the film, the main family must look far away, while their family's young girl, expected to be dead, pulled the creature out. <br /> <br /> MORAL: A typical "not polluting water" message because it can happen - a terrible mutated monster. Earlier, it was a 1950 nuclear bomb message when radiation was caused by giant ants, spiders, fish, or anything in these sci-fi films. Now her "environmental issues" are focused. <br /> <br /> HUMOR It was mostly stupid. I usually laugh with a slapstick, but it wasn't funny. I don't know if the Korean sense of humor is that it is pathetic, or if the film deliberately tried to be ultra-corny by taking old "Godzilla" films. We hope this is the last one. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - The video was good. It was a sharp-looking picture and the sound was much in the rear speaker crowd decent. I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. It could have been a mistake because the sound of Korean guttural voices was annoying for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> OVERVIEW - It was a promise, but it turned out to be a huge backlog and even boring in many places that are unforgivable for today's monster movie. Two hours was too long for this story. How this movie pulled the crowd in Korea, which I don't know. They must not have many movies to enjoy and support.
