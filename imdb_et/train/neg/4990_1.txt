I can enjoy the innocent joy of vigilante flick, but it's just bad. And not as bad as you might see from MST3K. It's just bad bad as you can't find anything to enjoy about it, no matter how hard you try. I am really sorry to waste 2 hours of precious life on this mess. You can say this by observing that nobody asked you to act and everyone in that knew that this movie was just burying your career. Apparently, the "Walking Tall" has earned enough income for someone to decide that they can make their investments. If it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad that it's worse than my memory.
