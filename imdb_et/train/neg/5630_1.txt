The only reason I looked at the end of the movie was "hope" to see something interesting. The movie is really bad and the girl's performance is really bad, to be honest, I'm not a filmmaker or an expert, but you just have to realize that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> The first thing I thought was as soon as he started talking was: "He communicates with Willem Dafoe and he accepted to help him with the scenario and appear in his movie because he's great director. " .. surprise, surprise, the next day after I watched the movie I found on the internet, Giada Colagrande is her wife. Awful story and terrible performance.
