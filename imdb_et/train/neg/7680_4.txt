In my opinion, snow white is a bad film from an artistic point of view. The plot is quite predictable, the characters are stereotypes, editing is too exaggerated. Anyway, the film does not seem to have much artistic ambition. Instead, I think it's a straightforward commercial thing. In fact, it seems that the goal of a Swiss character from the French part (actor is the band leader with whom he is in the film - the band SENS UNIK) is for a larger audience. A straight German-Swiss film would not have been sold in French - and vice versa. What really was on my nerves was the product placement of the film. Something scenes are remembered from advertising clips! I also think that the "young people who take drugs without other goals in their lives" is a reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be developed more carefully. I hope Samir has enough money for the snow to make his next film show his true artistic skills.
