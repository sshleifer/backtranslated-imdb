Well. it was no surprise. Many people will tell you that it is expensive. but they all speak "shiztz" about this movie very slowly. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who does not feel the pain he calls "my son," some gory scenes, but I found them weak. You can also skip the movie for 40 minutes and get an eyeball scene that was surprisingly impressive and ill. it has some really stupid scenes. and they will duplicate the hits and hit the foolish counterfeiting that makes me laugh! I don't recommend it. check out gore hounds. <br /> <br /> Check if you want a similar 20 to 10 minute scene that is still not so amazing and has a random scene trying to rape your mother ... yes it's weird.
