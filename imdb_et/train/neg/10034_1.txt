If there is one movie that is the worst of this year, this is TASHAN The first promo signaled that the movie is a boring Dhoom 2-style movie, and I only knew that it would be a bad movie whatever it could be. or maybe we see a promo of cheese. But this film gave me a shock, it was even worse than Dhoom 2 and what I expected The first Saif introduction that is boring Then Saif-Kareena meets, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor Oh God, what does she do in such a strange film? What is this role? What does it do? His first scene is fine, but then his act repeats and he crosses. Then came Akshay, who gave some nice scenes, but then the movie became more boring and with all the outdated things Childhood romance, childish Overdose of scenes of Rajnikant-style scenes and all the boring scenes The end is another joke. Vijay Krishna Acharya would have received more movies if this film had worked, it is a yashraji strategy, just money, nothing else. crap filmmakers Music (Vishal Shekhar) is common <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar comes to the film with fresh air, he actually offers some interesting moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad. amazingly and even more
