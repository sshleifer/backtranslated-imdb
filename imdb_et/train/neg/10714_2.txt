For the two most funny comedians, this movie was terrible. Fast forwarding and never better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought she would be so great in comedy. The previews were so big, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that it would suck the chick to slip. What's with it. The film was very slow and boring. I don't recommend it to anyone now. I'd like it back for that money! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thank you, but not thanks. Who makes such a fool so people would think you are pregnant. I thought it was so funny, I had my kids and I helped other children. It could have been more of a reality.
