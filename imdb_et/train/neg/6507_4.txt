You know it's going to be a cheesy movie, if: <br /> <br /> 1. It was 50's. It's black and white. 3. He doesn't have name links! 4. Screaming form a lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> You must not overdo it - this movie perfectly captured all four of the above elements to make it a true movie. Okay - shhhhh but I'm discussing special effects here - or their absence - <br /> <br /> Were you underwater scene? It seems that it was badly filmed through the aquarium - note that the wind has shone in the wind. <br /> <br /> And Reusable Stock Footage (Exterior Frames, Bridge Scenes - Large Magnifications) This KRAF-Tiness - not from "PLAN 9" - I've seen such a creative stock footage use. <br /> <br /> And hey, where there were no special effects - no worries - screaming Yeah, this movie also used this old hacker. <br /> <br /> Grab the popcorn - put your brain to stunning (many fermented drinks at CLOSING helps), sit back, and wonder: why the hell did they put on the movie again? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
