I don't know where to start; actors, special effects and writing are all as bad as you can imagine. I can't believe that the production specialists reached the point where they said, "Our work is done, the time to release it". I'm just glad that the first two series didn't do it beyond the UK. I would just recommend watching this movie so you can understand how much most movies have done. <br /> <br /> I don't know how another IMDb user can be scary when "scary" dinosaurs are flying around corridors with rubber hands.
