I rented this movie about 3 years ago and it has still been an eye-catching film ever made. I don't think I ever stopped it. It's worse than a high school student. I remember they did something back in 1970, and in the setback, there was a man with a polo shirt, an oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like the Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have said they were in the 70s. He might also have been a cell phone, I can't remember, it was just terrible. I returned it to a video store and asked them why they even wear a movie and can I get my life an hour ago. To date, this worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen pretty bad.
