VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> The driver (Murray Brown) is a lured isolated country house with two beautiful young woman (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and their free spiritual sexual lifestyle, but her hosts turn out to be vampires, tired of lust for human blood ... <br /> <br /> Taking the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by Maverick director Jean Rollin in France , confirmed by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, Jose Ramon Larraz's bold shock pushed the VAMPYRES concept of Adult Horror much further when British censors were ready on the farm in 1974 and his film was cut almost three minutes after his original British release. It's not hard to see why! Using as much nudity, sex and bloodshed as a pretext for his Gothic theme, when the film's short driving time allows, Larraz (who wrote under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as a mere medical background for life, death and impulses - sexual and otherwise - that confirm the human situation. <br /> <br /> A Look at Painting in a Picturesque Country House in the Autumn of 1973, Harry Waxman's haunting cinematography reveals a gloomy atmosphere in which it seems that the destroyed rural area - gloomy and beautiful - seems to be a threat (Larraz pulled at the beginning of the same year with a similar trick of SYMPTOMID, a low-key thriller that crashed into the ultimate rage of violence). However, despite their claims, VAMPYRES Spreadsheets and unprocessed raw values ​​are shared by the audience from the start, and when two female main characters are both charismatic and attractive, the male leader (Brown, his prime minister) during the filming) is disgracefully unsuccessful in the role that should have gone to some a beautiful twentieth plaque. For fans of cultural films, which are fun entertainment for everyone else, VAMPYRES has acquired a taste. At the end of the movie, look at the silent superstar of Bessie Love in the short cubes.
