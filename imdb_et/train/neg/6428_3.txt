This changes the third movie I have seen by Errol Morris and I don't like my style any more. It looks like he finds very interesting and versatile characters, great personalities for creating a documentary, and then editing a language-in-cheek to have fun with everything they have. It's never their direct caricature, and Morris seems to have the most time to say, "But no, no, these people are really exciting!", But there are always fine, small, angular and non-so subtle editing techniques that show that Morris they seem to discourage them from behind. <br /> <br /> This movie follows four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic segregation ... a man studying African hairless moles to find that they are amazingly ant-like, lion tamer, a man who keeps the garden full of animal shaped bush and robot designer. The overall theme of the film seems to be reversing the question of the qualities of animals, people and life? So the fast, cheap and uncontrollable title doesn't really look like a movie ... right? Except of course, Morris seems to be a bit disturbed by the passions of these people (he may call them "obsessed") by making synthetic shapes for life. I do not share that fear and honestly do not understand some of the links made in Morris. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize his subtlety. Without voice training and leaving the words completely to the interviewees, this is not as if Morris had ever irritated the spectators' collective head. Instead, it often mixes circus and antenna material together when they are taken out of the circus and ants context, showing a sort of collective absurdity that all these people are talking about. I don't find them absurd, I think they are all very clean and interesting. <br /> <br /> If, of course, he did not want to make such collisions, it means he is just a quiet converter instead of a craftsman. Given that none of the films I've seen so far have impressed me, I don't care what he's trying to do. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
