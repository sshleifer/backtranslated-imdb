I'll give it four or more of the ten stars or points or markers that are useful. <br /> <br /> There were two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved pleasantly. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual stereotyping, burning speed that foolishly pushed the stupid sound, and the "soundtrack" are generous. Anyway, two really funny scenes were attended by Amy P.-s. He's just naturally fun. He's a mix of the monkey they're doing with SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just came out for money, because when you do it for Sarah Palin's parodies, I think we can say yes it was worth having a black man back to the role of a maid who is really there to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 outta 10 as I said, is generous. <br /> <br /> But more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. Mother "Two and a half men" is in this movie and has some kind of plastic surgery, so her mouth looks like a 30-year-old mouth, so every scene she's on is like trying to redesign my face or put it on my think of it or just answer the question "No. Wait. Wait. Does he have plastic surgery?" Because as a viewer, he doesn't want to have plastic surgery.
