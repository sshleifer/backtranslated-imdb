It was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actor. So the wood it does on a rocking horse looks like a better job. But remember, turn to four weddings, equally awful. Another film that depicts England's full of Chocolate Box cottages and village green. I mean this school, how many schools can Hogwarts look like? The Twee Police Station looked like a set of Heartbeat (a 60-year-old British series). This film was unable to reveal what it wanted to be - a serious study of comedy or female friendship. If it were stuck in the past, the sex situations of the tombs and the very foolish rebellions of the weddings would have worked (I just say). But these scenes didn't work with the tragedy on the other side. I also find it incredible that Kate once spoke to Molly after her terrible behavior. The final remark - what is a decent actor like Staunton in this poo? Not to mention the Chancellor of Anna. Macdowell should stay in the ad pressure chart.
