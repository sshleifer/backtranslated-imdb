This film was supposed to represent a "daammehe" bachelor who was ready and ready to live once and for all. But I don't care about his mission to settle down because I didn't care about his character. I don't understand what all these beautiful women saw her. He had no class or charisma. He would have had to go at least to himself, which made women weak in his knees as his saxophone played but without results. Just because he's a musician, he doesn't make him sexy. Not to mention what he did to get married to a woman he loved for five minutes knowing him was completely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this person have a shame, what-ever-ever? If he had arranged and finished making and stupid things, he would have been more attractive in character, but unfortunately his character was a dream and boring. He could have been as quick as the poor British accent, which sometimes disappeared through the film, with the same ordinary voice. were fish and frog. Now these two were chemistry! Academy candidates for both? STAT! Draw holes, lack of character development, terrible acting, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a movie mess.
