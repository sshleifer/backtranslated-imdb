It was hard to get this movie and when I finally saw it was disappointing. This means it is one of the twenty-century great stories: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting aviation industry and MUST deliver millions of ransom without suffering or interrupting an experiment. If all of this built-in interest came in, how could this real life event make such a weakness, a speech-laden flick. Although Williams is always interesting, the scriptwriters assumed that D.B. Cooper persona was a stereotypically heroic as a movie star we get is a type without any interesting details or insights that a person is bold enough and smart enough to pull out. Harrold steals the film with virtually its pure and beautiful beauty, but the real decline took place in the handling of the plot and in a flat direction. Shame this movie even on the existing ones.
