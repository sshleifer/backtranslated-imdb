I just couldn't laugh! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But don't forget that this is a lot of fun! You don't have to pay attention to this movie! Operation is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I saw a T-Rex head in for a moment.) The predators are the same as Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is the same, but ... some of the scenes he looks are stuffed and it looks that kindergarten has some kind of project failure. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, I'm actually talking about fast editing, they changed it so fast that we don't see rubber dinosaurs, just OOPPS! late, they are rubber! Well, only interesting things here are Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... don't rent it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more fun!
