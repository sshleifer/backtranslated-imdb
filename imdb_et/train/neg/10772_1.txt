The worst part is that they are 87 minutes, which I never get back. I knew it was frightening because the man dressed up as a crazy Indian chief on the roof. (See if they can get it out in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is currently in baseball, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Even if he seemed to be part of it, I had to shame when I heard all the spoken language. Bad, bad movie. It was a terrible bear of bad news. Absolutely shameless and completely predictable. I don't mind a predictable movie if it's well done, but it wasn't absolutely.
