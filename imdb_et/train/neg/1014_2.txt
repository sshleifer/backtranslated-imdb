Timberlake's staging reached almost the screen attack. It wasn't all bad, I think the role of the reporters was wrong. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played a typical rapper role, the toughest and worst man. I don't think the whole smile in the film would even be offered to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman wore a lot of the movie. He had some funny scenes, the highest point of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad, he was just "there." <br /> <br /> It's generally boring film. bad plot. there are many bad behaviors or wrong roles for the participants.
