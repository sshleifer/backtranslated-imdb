Regardless of what many other people thought about the first movie, it really did. This one, however. How to put together one word: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> Let's look at this in part: Here's the plot: finally the old queen's castle has been removed, but her successor: Snow White has another kind of problem: Court-Jester, her son's father, is wrong because super, Spliss , going to the extreme to fight her gray hair and sell the royal offspring for some blondes and hairs. In his desperation, Snow White (Otto Walkees) is looking for help who must first find his other six dwarfs and then try to find a royal offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written over the weekend, where writers were very drunk, but were only writing for the studio. Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part or fans of other players, the DVD is not really worth it. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least keeps the movie completely forgotten is the performances of some of the actors. That's why I gave the move 3/10. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that no participant or any of them can make up for this bad story. .. they're not joking when they're here. Still, there are many great actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as Mirrors, Helge Schneider and many more, but unfortunately, all these comedians can't really do it bad implement the script. <br /> <br /> It may be for some hardcore fans, but it's not worth the money for ordinary filmmakers or now DVD renters or buyers. <br /> <br /> I even regret renting a movie.
