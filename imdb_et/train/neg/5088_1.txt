This guy doesn't know the cinema. Okay, he seems to have made some interesting theater exhibitions in his youth and about two acceptable films that were more successful for political reasons, because they tried communist censorship. It's all very good, but look carefully: he doesn't know what his job is! Scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and unorganized content and emptiness. He has nothing to say on this subject, so he licenses violence, nudity, and rain. How can a dead body that never knew anything about cinematography and art ever be kept alive? Why don't they let him break?
