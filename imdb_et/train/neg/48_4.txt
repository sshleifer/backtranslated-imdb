There are some nice shots in this movie, it catches some landscapes in such a beautiful light, in fact, cinema is probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> But it is basically more for a television element, and although it has a lot of turns on the plot that keeps this pretty interesting view, the subtitles and key project developments are not published in Spanish, so that non-Spanish speakers stay a little disappear. <br /> <br /> I had this as an Xmas gift because it is the family's hallmark to work through the reporter's films, and Matthew Mconaughey was just "awesome to kill" and "Newton's guys" so fantastic. I said I wanted to see my work more. <br /> <br /> Although it says in the DVD box, this is Matthew Mconaughey's film and uses it as a marketer, he has a couple of lines and is not on the screen at the end of the movie for a very long time and he doesn't pick the screen when he is turned on, so dying hard fans, re-ally is not worth it from this point of view. <br /> <br /> Movies watching though, Patrick McGaw is very good and very easy to watch and his character is just as nice and kind and caring, a real saint man, he would be well written on ROM com. <br /> <br /> So true Mcconaughey acts as a shine for what I have seen, I would recommend, "Time to kill", "Newton's guys" "Frailty", "How to lose a boy in 10 days", "Edtv" and " Amistad "and avoiding too much life and angels when you are out, if you don't know the child's movie or the kids are around because neither of them shows his talent, but has a fairly amusing movie for kids, again, MM is really something other than a supportive artist who only has some lines. <br /> <br /> Like Scorpion Springit's, there's no bad movie, but it's not a stealing screen either.
