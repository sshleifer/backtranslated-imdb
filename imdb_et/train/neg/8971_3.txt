After the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003) and the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty to bring us to the third trilogy, prequel Cube Zero. > <br /> There are two low operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband), in the symptoms of deep and false institutions, time, and place, watching and observing the behavior of people who have been placed in gigantic cubic networks, some of which are equipped with death traps . He said the people they were watching were convicted, who chose this dreadful and deadly attempt at the deadly injection, but they had no problem with their work until Wynn, a mathematical genius, discovers that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra (Stephanie Moore ) never agreed to the inside of a cube. Suddenly they have realized that their "jobs" are not what they look like and that they can be part of a deeply ill and twisted ... <br /> <br /> People who have seen and enjoyed the original cube is this prequel may not like you. It is not that the story is not potential; It's just that the first cube of the film was never needed to be expanded. This pure little psychological thriller alone has a very interesting concept and confidence in its message. It was also very independent. The problem with the Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the original mystics, trying to answer more questions, but only really results in confusion about what is never needed. <br /> <br /> What this new film has to offer, which is the question of the psychological nature of authoritarianism and evil banality, is definitely good questions that need to be raised, but probably it should have been done on its own initiative, not as a continuation of the film that does not. had such aspirations. <br /> <br /> In saying this, other features of the movie, such as acting and direction, and writing, are not terrible. A movie like "Matrix" and "Dark City" similar to this film is a dark, dark look at the film, and they have certainly managed to recreate the claustrophobic feeling of the first cube. Unfortunately, Barbarash does not have enough positive features to preserve them.
