How this film was said to have a $ 70 million budget, and without being completely disproved, is next to me. The story and dialogue are beyond the amateur. The characters say things that no real person would ever say and almost never react to what was said earlier. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. Leadership is good because writing is such that ... but a number of supportive role players actually drag production down. The hero's hair would have had to get his credit, it was so strange ... not to mention that it gave a better performance in the picture. Finally, about the film about L.A, which is bounded by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! When you see it, your mind starts to compete constantly, wondering how you could have taken the SFX scenes and build a much better movie around you. Unfortunately, it wouldn't have done much.
