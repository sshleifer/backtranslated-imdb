There are a number of problems with this film, but the bottom line is that he tried too little to do too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money was just not to make the story fair. The missing budget killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) has written a credit for "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", which was a ticket art. But this film had some serious financial support from Disney. Frankly, this is a good example of when not to film. If he had waited a few more years, the technology would be depressed by many effects. (not to mention that he could have found money with money.)
