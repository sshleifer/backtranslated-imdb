Are you kidding what was FULL !!! But nevertheless, I got this movie and 3 more people and they were all on DVD. The movie starts pretty much OK from the movie, but goes down the middle. <br /> <br /> And well, it ends up being one of the most climaxic end of the latest film history. There are a lot of gore in the end order and if you like the dose of schlock-horror, it's your movieâ€¦ <br /> <br /> 3/10
