This is one of those movies that has a fantastic video box, but has a wireless Camra job and unknown actors who talk about a bad dialogue. It's as dark as killings happen, hardly you can see this plus it's hard to understand the movie. this is WCW Vanessa Sanchez (Tygres WCW before folding) and she is a good actor. I like the low budget movie especialy ones that have bugs because they are fun to watch but Severed unfairly is not one of them. This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and broken heads but it is not blocking but if you have something new to look at, then rent Severed.
