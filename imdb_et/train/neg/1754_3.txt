Why was Mary's and Roda's history so dull? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why are very few references to the original exhibition and characters? Girls' characters were stupid and uninteresting. Why can't there ever be daughters who love their mother on TV? Does it make sense for Mary to leave Minneapolis and Rhoda to return to NYC, but why didn't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be a guest star? It just seems like a pleasant way to remember such wonderful characters. Of course it was good to see Mary and Rhodes together, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there has been Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, Dick Van Dyke Show RÃ©union, hopefully Mary will do better the next time she looks again at her old Mary Richards stitching areas.
