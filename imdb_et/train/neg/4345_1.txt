Patav advertising ... I saw a commercial on Carlitos's road: Rise to Power, which says, "From Scarface's producer and Carlito's road" LETS GET IT STRAIGHT ... Michael Bergman didn't bring Scarface, in fact he was "editing a room assistant" 'For Scarface. Take away Bergman's talents ... but I think he should have a little more class. I think I can talk to the masses when I say ... We hate being apparently lying. As for the film, at best it was bad. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzman should be ashamed of this movie. In general, this film did not create good jobs for Carlito's Way. It's obvious that this project was an attempt to make a quick doll rather a good movie.
