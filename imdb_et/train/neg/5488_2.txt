Why on earth is Colin Firth in this nonsense movie? Is he really cashed for cash? <br /> <br /> The film is not clear about what it wants to be, grief, exotic places ?, ghosts? It's a messy, muddy mess. <br /> <br /> It seems that some idea is that Italy must be good in itself and that Italian is something to offer, but in the end girls want to go back to Yankland. /> <br /> There was a yank woman in the movie. It was not clear what the job was, but it seemed only to make the girl coats, unsuitable and maudlin comments. Was it supposed to be paedophilia? <br /> <br /> Really terrible mess. I gave it 1 instead of 2 because it doesn't have the strange film charm.
