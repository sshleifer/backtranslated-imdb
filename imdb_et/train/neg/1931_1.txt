I was going to look at it with great expectation. Unfortunately, the dialogue is totally silly and, in general, the film is far from inspiring honor or interest. Even the child sees the logic of the character's lack of logic. Today's children need creative stories that would inspire them to make them dream of events. That's what happened to movies like E.T. and Star Wars ten years ago. (How many children were the Jedi Knights and the lighting of their lights?) Don't waste your time and money on it.
