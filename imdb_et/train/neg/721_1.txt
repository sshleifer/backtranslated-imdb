This film has received a number of significant errors. The first and most important is the lack of a clear plot of land! This, unfortunately, makes the film not only difficult to track, but also sends the observer some feelings of hopelessness as if it were a waste of valuable time in his short life. This means that the film cannot fascinate the audience, but instead encourages the public to despise the film and everything related to it. In short, it is very very very very very very very! Benefit yourself and chew a big rubber shoe, you'll find it much more interesting and enjoyable than looking at the Terminator's wife.
