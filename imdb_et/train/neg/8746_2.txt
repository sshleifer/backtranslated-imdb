An obvious attack on Microsoft, which people who do not seem to have intellectual property or market economy in general understand. <br /> <br /> Loony's liberal tim robbins plays a painfully understandable bill-gate cartoon and is a cartoonist who orders murders on the right and left. <br /> <br /> Although Microsoft may sometimes engage in anti-competitive practices, it is unlikely that they will actually kill people. That's why the film is up and ridiculous from the start. The "deeper" point is probably that the major technological innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most of the major innovations would never have been developed, rather than the market benefits (and benefits) provided by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> One thing is anti-competitive behavior. - That's common sense. It is quite another that, contrary to market competition, what is represented by the film mantra ("knowledge belongs to mankind"). <br /> <br /> Another example of how Hollywood is completely untouched by reality.
