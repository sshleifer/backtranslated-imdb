It's a film about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a one-time sexual encounter and declares it to be a love story. <br /> <br /> Ten of the monologues felt that only three of them had the truth through them. I was waiting for the film to improve, and it did a little, but never better. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept and I wanted it to be good, but it never succeeded. Maybe if they really love the stories he'd been working on.
