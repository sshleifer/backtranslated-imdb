After you have read all the rave comments on this movie and some that give it so to speak. Finally, I decided to throw my penny worth. Most of all, I would agree that if it had not been Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch, where all the true talents fled south to I-77 years ago, at least as much as possible with the gas tank. I got hit by reviewers who violently claim they are little better than most, claiming they followed the plot without confusing. This story, made by Crook, is like an old record that skips it. As an American, I understand the difficulties that Ind movie artists have to face. A trip to Romania would certainly have lost the budget. Honestly, this whole movie was Claire's loop at the gas station, Claire Road, under Claire's whiteners, Claire's house, Claire's cornfield, Claire school. Claire here and Claire there. It became almost monotonous and it would have been if he were not the majority actor's best actor. Josh and Jeff have to live, but don't write a two-page script and make it an hour, twenty pictures. Before writing the second scenario of dreams, spirits look at the episode of a spiritual whisperer or two and get a little background. All cast, except the above, and a few of you made your first and last movie. Co-Professor Jeff has appeared as he is in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, right? One thing the film had was that the operator seemed to be fixed to Lauren Lewis' derri√®re. Well, now that all the Sarasms are happy, I still recommend the fear buff movie to see this young actress during my career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has seen herself as an enemy worth looking at.
