I'm absolutely terrible to see that the average rating of this movie is 5.2 / 10. What affects me is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I still wonder why I looked at it until the end. First, the plot is completely hopeless and the actor is truly terrible. I think any completely unknown actor would be better for the role than Susan Lucci; In my opinion, Mr Kamar Deli Reyes, it would have been a better choice to stay in your "Doll Valley". All in all, it is a waste of time (and I'm trying to be polite ...) to avoid any price. My rating is 1 and I think it's well paid, but because we can't give O.
