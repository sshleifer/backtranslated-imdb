It wasn't funny in 1972. It's not funny right now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I'm not the basis of the film because it's incredibly sexist - I quoted it a bit or rather I enjoyed the reaction that it creates to annoying PCs - I'm against it because it's badly written and acted. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable character is Blakey, a British 25-year-old who knows immediately when he was a favorite of impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
