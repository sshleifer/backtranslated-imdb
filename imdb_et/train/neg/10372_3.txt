I enjoyed the first reviewer's comment much more than the movie when I saw it in the second theater in the early 1980s. Then I was impressed that the care to create costumes that were so tightly shaped after the millennium drawings. But I have been thrown into widespread destruction, their personalities dampened their masks, while the direction I think is unusually static and dark in photography. The estimate, which was left behind for a while, was negligible, which means "not worth sitting even once". <br /> <br /> However, I would also jump to get another picture.
