I am a very big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is terrible. At that time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and was the director of the film and Jenna was the hottest porn star. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could by doing this big budget movie. Now I know why they are no longer making big budget porn movies. In the world of fantasy, porn stars can work, but it is a real world and they can't act. That's why porn stars, if women were as beautiful as Jenna, would have tried to go to pornography instead of pornography. Just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teenager in her 20s, she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth. He changed his low budget to mainstream movies and couldn't operate. Where is he now? I gave it a rating of 1 instead of 2 just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has done in "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, we don't want to talk to you if we want to have sex with you. Also, if you were an anal in the movie, you would have a lot more fans and more money in Jennal.
