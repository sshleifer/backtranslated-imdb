True, there are many movies much worse than this movie. This movie was not in Manos: hands of fate or troll 2 (yes, I've seen them both ... twice), but at the same time this movie is not Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even this movie surpassed it). Such films make the battlefield Earth look like Star Wars, which is so bad. Razzie Awards, your biggest competition has just arrived at the theater. The film I am talking about is, of course, alone in the dark. I'm trying to take you step by step, why this movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting - I'll start with what was probably the best component of this movie (next to the credit that came out of the "wish I had an angel", actor Christian Slater must be proud, he successfully proved that it is possible to act properly in the film, which is worse than drinking antifreeze. talk, it made me wonder why he just didn't go halfway, maybe it was because Stephen Dorff was also in the film (someone he wants he could, but he can't, do it.) actress, but good looking and that's all that really matters in such movies, that doesn't mean the actor was perfect, though it was average, not good and maybe the only thing soundtrack was not good. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - except 'I wish I had an angel' is a meaningless and bad soundtrack that is pumped into the audience's ears, perhaps to hide the terrible story I will soon go.) Long and very expensive 2 The CD audio track is now sold for music problems. <br /> <br /> Director, directed by Hollywood's favorite director Uwe Ball, who brought us a classical cemetery. Speaking to us, "Yes, the movies get that bad and this is just the beginning of my deadly movies." At least it is said to be led by Uwe Ball. Without saying, I would have thought that a monkey was kidnapped from Congo, who brought him here and forced him to express his opinion on how to punish the film for shock. The photographer's director was apparently rolled up and postponed until it hit the wall. On scenes where the camera should still remain, it keeps moving, leaving us with the ability to stop anywhere and when it should move, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> Production - Who's on the earth stupid enough to put money on the bomb? I'm sorry to stupid ... sometimes. Sometimes I am glad that he was taught a lesson that never puts money in the trash, then the manure of the dog is tied to the bag. <br /> <br /> Writing / Storyboard - Trying a story is more painful to confuse the ice cap under the big toe and hit the football ball as hard as I can, but I'll still try it. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby is escaping from the orphanage as a child, where 20 children go to science trials. She escapes and hides the electricity network where she is under an electric shock (this is where it's so bad that I started laughing loudly). Then it will move many years later if it is a paranoia detective. He has attacked a zombie that cannot be dead, kills and resides. Later he is attacked by a crazy monster, and he discovers the secrets no one else knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really bad. The creatures of the film are expecting us to read about 10 minutes, which seemed like 100, with a random text concerning an erroneous civilization called Abskan. The film does not twist one after another, more than the audience can handle, more than the audience wants to cope, more than the audience's interest. This story is bad that even Double Dragon is doing better. <br /> <br /> Generally leave this movie out. I gave it to 1 out of 10, but it's 0.
