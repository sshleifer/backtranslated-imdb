We all know what a bad day is in the office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it is if you have the worst day when you are just trying to get to the office. Sometimes it's just not worth going, I know what I mean? And sometimes it's worth nothing to do if it was already done in 1970 with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better. <br /> <br /> It's not that Steve Martin is a sad comedian or a lie in the role of educated and acclaimed advertising; on the contrary, in both cases. And it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally wrong. his work has been consistently good, if not great, since I first saw him on the 1960s TV Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it is not an unhappy couple at all: it is in New York and why should everyone in New York live and love their life in married bliss? in some sense ?? the largest city in the world. This is when you are a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970 movie is still a great comedy that realistically looked at all the things that might go wrong while you were traveling, and contained most situations and visual disturbances that you can imagine about what may happen to you in a strange environment. This version of 1999 unfortunately unveils today's free tactics for the public, waiting or wanting to see too much. For example, it is unhappy with the main players' star watch, as we all know, the mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani (relatively long). What ?? Giuliani bucking for the president even then? Worse ?? A speaker is walking to a particular face in New York. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Clees, who repeats his role in Basil Fawlty? but this time, as well as the training legacy, too? Again, dragging the hotel staff who sycophantically sucking up the wealthy customers and generally makes themselves look like an idiot he is in this role. And in this process, the memory of Fawlty Towers, which is by far the best British comedy series, is barred ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 film made? In the 1970s, New York was dying in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, when it was done in 1970, it was the city you saw: a dark, dark, desperate, unpleasant, and not the place where the harassing couple finally chose their new life with the Great Smoke (as it was, contaminated and all). By 1999 things were better: the glitz was back, New York was successful, it was a big apple, ready to bite you if you had a moxie ... <br /> <br /> inside and finally join a fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life, freedom and happiness. So this movie is really comical, but not for the reasons that manufacturers probably foresaw. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the comedy, this movie has been much better with Jack Lemmon. If you have seen the last one, be sure not to worry about it.
