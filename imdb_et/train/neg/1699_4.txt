I'm a fan of Lynche's work, so I was excited to find this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very let down. It is a series of short cartoons that try to show disgusting and disgusting humor. The animation is very crude, no doubt Macromedia. Every comic has a big fat guy who beats his family and acts like everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> People who do not know this animation are likely to be somewhat impressed. However, if you have spent a lot of time at Newgrounds.com, like me, these cartoons are no different from what you have seen before. Many of Newground's popular amateur artists do much better than the ones shown on this DVD. When Lynch presented this work on a website, she would be perfect for Newgrounds' best artists. But since I saw it on DVD instead of Newgrounds, I'll give it 4/10 instead of 7/10 as I would otherwise. These cartoons fit the internet, but like David Lynch, I waited for better quality in both story and animation.
