I don't take too much time here, but I wanted to say Darkman 3 is awesome. I have all three DVDs, I added them to my collection of DVD movie collections. Darkman rises best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die Hard, you get the point. There are not too many horrors, thrillers. Many thanks to the whole team and assigned us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you don't know how I came from this DVD. I bought it over the internet, but it's area 4, as you know, most of the US DVD players are regions 1. If you have a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player because it's all regional player. Just go to setup and select the desired witch area setting (1-9).
