STUDIO 666 (aka THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another subset with a direct DVD movie. <br /> <br /> While many direct DVD movies are fast, STUDIO 666 is bad or bad, so bad, in good terms, STUDIO 666 is an unfortunate failure. <br /> <br /> While writing, each first page comment contains a negative rating and a negative rating. Each of these people has hit the nail in his head. <br /> <br /> Two people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments from 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously, they have seen a few movies and have a more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive point I can make about this movie is that it's better than CHOKE and one of them, two extremely mediocre movies I wouldn't want at my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot has to be made hundreds, if not thousands of times. The film has only a slight twist (and that is badly dealt with) with ordinary expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Shortly thereafter, his spirit will return to one of his surviving friends. A friend in this possession goes to a deadly laugh. The rest of the plot is really too bizarre. You must see it yourself if your interests have not yet come to extinction. <br /> <br /> Movie action is usually very poor. The actor who played Dora was an exception. His character was always interesting and seductive when he was on the screen. He helps to raise the film to similar modern efforts. Unfortunately, some lines he had said were written lightly to prevent him from recording the movie. <br /> <br /> The direction was equally poor. Roisto didn't seem to be the least dangerous, every killing wasn't tense or tense, the atmosphere was non-existent, and the camera's work was incredibly basic. Some special effects (if you can name them) reminded me of the GHOST STORIES TV series. Unfortunately, filmmakers at GHOST STORIES have smart scripts, credible performances and superb camera angles. Perhaps, if the producers had been watching this TV series closely, they would have found some more techniques that could have saved this apology for the movie. <br /> <br /> Music is totally inappropriate for the film's tone. It's just rock music and not the best examples of this type. Don't start me at the beginning of this terrible song that was played at first! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, especially dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they aren't funny enough to move the movie up (or it should be) to such a bad-good level. <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 has very few noticeable aspects of everyday midday. I recommend it only to those who are fans of straightforward DVDs and want to see every player ever made.
