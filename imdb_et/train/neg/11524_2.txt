A pretty incoherent film of a man in the 1960s who was super-hippie in the religious cult, fighting with them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one other cultist who is hidden during the police attack and another man named Hawk, who lives in a small cabin by the river. Gold kills some of his followers or some of the city's inhabitants. It is difficult to see who the characters are, or in what time frame the scenes should take place. The leader comes sixteen years later (I got this box - I was stuck in the movie time). Nobody sees a parent, not a noticeable view. <br /> <br /> One murder is made by seeing a large round cut, others are made with a knife or cross section. I have never heard the name of the title tag mentioned in the movie, but he is the one who fights most, hooting and hollering. <br /> <br /> The movie is placed quite badly with the help of a voice (not much) to explain what is happening. Some sound effects were pretty bad. The man starts to hit and we hear the whipping sound. The woman burns a gun and we don't hear that fire, but we hear ricochet instead! It doesn't seem to have been done for a comic effect.
