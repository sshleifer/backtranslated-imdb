I felt like I was watching this movie a thousand times before. It was completely predictable. Every time I tried to twist the story, I saw something waiting for something interesting, but I didn't see anything I was expecting. Like "The bread factory opened another facility because the bread was not enough". Two words: A flat story that has become a clich√©, a bad example, bad special effects ... Only a stupid Russian policeman, Vlad, was a little funny, punishing bad guys. The bunch of muscles was so incredibly STUPID that it made me laugh for a moment. I don't know why I waste my time because of the stigma of this movie ... It doesn't get worse (because it's not possible): D
