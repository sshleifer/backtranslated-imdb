I took this title 15 or 20 times in Blockbuster, looking for something half-decent. All I can say is that they were all decent movies at night, which I decided to rent. <br /> <br /> I give him credit for being better than "Dracula 3000", but actually it's pretty easy to say because it didn't have Caper Van Dienit. The other things that were not, were an interesting story, an interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I think you don't have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The wrong team of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire ... go drawing) flew from a mining colony to a mining colony, trying to destroy all the vampires he found. The team consists of: a skipper, non-well-well-well-master (who dies early), his co-book, but an inexperienced first companion, the aforementioned vampire-vampire man (not a letterhead), a wannabe-cowboy, and indeed a butch Asian commando, " tough guy "woman ... it almost sounds like MTV 'The Real World' cast. After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with the bleeding cell (and if it turns out that the lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy), his first companion will take over ... blah, blah, blah ... all hate him. blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but as I said it was the same story used in about a hundred other genres. <br /> <br /> The effect was cheese and why Michael Ironside was outside of this movie. The vampire vampire men (still not a mistake) were quite hot, but if you expect him to be revealed more than just his cracking, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can't say I had the worst movie I've seen since I actually rented Starship Troopers 2, but wait until it arrives on the Sci-Fi channel.
