Ritchie's first two films were delicate, stylish entertainment. Here he bets the last two classics? "Ordinary suspects" and "fighting club"? and still comes out with an empty hand. <br /> <br /> Despite being considered mysterious (the largest con-suspect of a suspect "twaddle", he was ever pulled to convince you that he was "or whatever it was ...) and trying "Fight-Club" wrestle about what characters are real and what are internal manifestations, fighting the film's interest in its second half. Lastly, you know you're driving a blind alley, and slowly slowly. <br /> <br /> Minuses, chess and game theory are all great issues, but Ritchie casts them too superficially and too repeatedly to use the material a lot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) traceable is Ritchie's brave way with the scene and the Maurice-Jones dynamic camera. When Ritchie has stayed on a more satisfying plot and went back to tighter editing, there is no reason why she couldn't have done some other enjoyable gangster. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of your time. The misunderstanding is not the same. If you want to see a great movie that doesn't create a logical sense, but does its value (and by the way, which includes an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement), check out "lost roads".
