Happy, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - these are all teasers that made me wait for an hour or "discover" the jewel of the movie. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never gets over. Film is a relentless self-conscious. I found that I could not stop belief even for a moment. Naughty, obviously theatrical sets, naughty, obviously theatrical performances, naughty, probably theatrical management - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegors need not be delivered with sledgehammer. And it is hard for Julian Poile to feel anything, because we never know much about her. A ridiculous girlfriend, annoying citizens, an idiotic clergyman, kids - why does anyone, especially anyone with a lifelong ambition to enter the sea (the nature of Slater), decide to stay in this clumsy place?
