I usually like comedy films. I really enjoy them. But I don't really get an "Envy" point. I mean, it's boring content / topic, and it's not really funny. Stiller and Black are not showing all their talent in this movie. <br /> <br /> So if you plan to rent a comedy, I suggest you do it. If you don't want to get bored, and I see I'm not the only one who has that opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for it (see the trivia).
