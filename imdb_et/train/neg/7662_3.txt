It should be my movie. Even if it had been sucked, it would have been my alley; hell, I like "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine" movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for a soft alien / demon / adventure movie. Let's go over why I decided to look at it first. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. I am a great archaeologist and this film includes a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with high quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this film had a potential for at least a video shop's cheese-horror, but the boy sucked ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them entertaining, like me ... I mean, let's be honest, both are melodramatic. But now for some of the many mistakes. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the film as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really terrible. We're not just talking about bad things, I'm talking about naming Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I don't know if he is able to act, but playing a museum curator is just out of his league ... completely. His look at the roll of an educated scientist was not very different from what you look at setting up bad porn. I mean, it's not just bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those who are curious, he doesn't get naked, but only with a bra, a silly, totally useless love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with Reid's performance, perhaps the film might have worked, but the plot is what dominates and the plot seems to be written at the age of 10. I didn't know it was customizing video games before watching a DVD, otherwise I would have evaluated the stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> Nature jumps out of Slater's childhood home, where he gets a setback from something terrible, of course, amnesia. In his adult life, Slater recruited some unit 713, the force of the paranormal army, which apparently cools the evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess you never know if it wasn't one of those passes that I passed through time. The film starts with Slater's hunting, getting its last pieces after some relationship with "Chilean mercenary force specializing in the sale of rare antiques." Maybe you're wrong, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> It is an evil doctor who wants to unleash some hellione on earth (no reason), experiments with kids, super demon / alien human hybrids, "photonic" dots (demons can't stand the sun) and of course Slater and Dorf to try and save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can't even go through the clich√© elements. The script needed poor reprocessing to narrow the focus and provide the depth of SOME. I mean, why is this evil scientist so fucking bad? Oh right, people are doomed and just trying to save a group of people. I think he's infected? How did it happen? Okay, he has one evil demon in the cage that pulls his blood to shoot. How did it happen to hell? Why and where he got supernatants (oh yeah, they're using an old sci-fi stand of alien aliens / demons who "fuse" with their host backbone) Of course, Slater, like Blade, is half-super-slug powered, but his slug "didn't blend fully due to electric shock, "thanks to God. Oh, and people with these "thawed" backbones have no idea they are semi-strangers / demons and act as members of a good community as long as there is a secret signal from which they kill zombies. Yes, we get zombies. <br /> <br /> So much crap that could be fun, but none of it. <br /> <br /> The ending is also completely stupid, because everything turns out to be the big thing to solve first ... at least something that a little dynamite can't do. <br /> <br /> Not the worst thing you see, but a really bad movie.
