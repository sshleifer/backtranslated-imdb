What are people talking about here? I had to see another movie like you. I was so bored that I left the theater. What's in it. I just laughed once and not so hard. Anyone who turns this movie into a green light should be taken out of the street and beaten. I usually find something in my movie that I like, but it's crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" look like a classic. It is in the trash like "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory", one of the worst times. OUT OF ALL EXPENSES! I thought the studio would give money to people when they announced their excuses when they left the theater, but my fear of not happening. Looks like I never see this money for two hours.
