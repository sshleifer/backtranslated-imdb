At first it is interesting. Colin Firth marries a beautiful, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) whom she has known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then it disappears without warning. He is looking for him and after a few dead ends he steals some of his abusive childhood and recent past, which may include crime. And then it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it. The beginning, though not as tense as it sounds, is at least observable. Then it will stop being interesting or even meaningful. And the end is so flat, so boring, and so there is no excitement or intelligence, you think the scriptwriters didn't know what to do with it, and forever tried. What a waste of a good idea!
