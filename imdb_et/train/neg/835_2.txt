Having followed both Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both thoroughly. I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth it. What a disappointment! Disney must hopefully cope with revenue. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they lost the pixel arrangement. <br /> <br /> In principle, they just took some picture material that remained in the editor's floor (or trash) and glued them together to make a quick button. Unlike LK I & II, both were strong. <br /> <br /> This movie has no story at all. Although it is always fun to watch characters and animations, there is not enough material for the movie. Some of the bits would have been good 2-plate fillers for original offers. <br /> <br /> Disney - Shame you on printing this trash to make a quick doll! <br /> <br /> Next time take the time and effort and put on a permanent job.
