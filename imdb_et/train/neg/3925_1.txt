I saw this "hot" movie when it appeared in 1986. It had an X rating for a short scene that involved oral sex, but played in prestigious theaters (this was "art" film). It is said to be the first film that clearly shows the actor in an explicit sex event. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story in high school (Federico Pitzal), who is in love (understandably) with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned earlier, Detmers is a very beautiful and good body, but it also produced very good results. Pitzal was (little by little) pretty bad. No wonder he never made another movie. Despite the notorious sex scene (which is explicit but quite short), it is the slow moving dull story that bored me. The good behavior of Detmer only helped at a certain moment. Mostly, I looked at my watch waiting for it to end. If this was not the case, the film would have been forgotten long ago. Bored and slow. You can skip this.
