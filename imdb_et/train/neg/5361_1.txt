Saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970s and hated, hated, hated it! Just the most booing movie I've seen in my life. Don't know where Leigh got inspired, but it's one of those movies where you want to shake the characters so they can open and communicate. The title says it all, because there are no frugal moments in this movie, but long, long silences with people who can't express what they are (probably) feeling. If you want to see something that drinks you, it's for you. If you have nothing better to do in two hours, then stick a fork on the toaster: the experience is endlessly pleasing than anything you can get from it! Yes, Leigh had a lot of real value in his career, but it misses it.
