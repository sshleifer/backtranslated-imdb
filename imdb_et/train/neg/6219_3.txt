When LASSIE MAGIC was opened in Radio City Music House, I was stupid enough to believe it would be as warm as the first Lassie films. Not. <br /> <br /> The story was debilitating, Sherman's brothers were at a lower level than usual, no characters were used, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had both seen much better days. <br /> <br /> I also liked to see what ALICE FAYE's contribution would have been because he had been in the absence of the screen for so many years and was always in the earlier role of Fox. Alice was also a stupid script and unstable photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing is original here, adults don't like to enjoy anything far - and obviously there's no magic for anyone. You can't miss this one.
