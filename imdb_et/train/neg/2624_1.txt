Saying that this movie smells, it would be offensive to the skunks. As the second comment says, this movie is offensive to everyone in the 7-year-old mental age (this is especially amazing for the offensive). It's terrible - and not "so bad it's funny" sort of so - it's just terrible. No, I have to say this: IT STINKS! (Sorry skunks). <br /> <br /> From opening credits to the end, it's hardly worth more than 10 seconds to open this movie. "The plot" is inconsistent, characterization is non-existent, action is upper-robbery, "look at me I'm funny!" school and so it goes on. Sets are cumbersome (if at all) and are badly killed, it's just terrible on every front - maybe I can't remember music after the music (other than songs). <br /> <br /> In order to be honest with the creators, they put their cards on the table fairly quickly: opening credits include the title "Also Ertha Kitt plays Betty as a meteor" (because since the meteor turns out to never say anything but do random the noise they might have raised from Ms Kitt's contribution to one of her records) and the second line of the film goes like: "... and scientists have discovered new facts around Uranus circles." Uranus - "Your anus" geddit? geddit? Ah? Ah ?? Your anus? Humor is really so cheap. <br /> <br /> He tells strange things about the "comedies" of this period that the hero was perfectly allowed to deliberately shoot people who died on the street but did not say "sh * t" out loud. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty cents (about $ 1.00) for selling this movie. I feel I hanged.
