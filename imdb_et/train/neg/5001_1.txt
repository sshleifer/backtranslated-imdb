I do not know why I comment on this foolish reality that I happened to see some episodes (cable marathon, if they took out 5 episodes sequentially or something, I didn't look at the whole thing.) Only like three episodes when I was nine months pregnant and I started to work every day. Maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, I really do. money and fame seem to have very little dignity. Or he is in a self-centered extremity. It married nitwit Federline (okay, anyone can make a mistake) and before that "celebrated" this terrible exhibition of his everyday life, where he captures the camcorder wherever he feels, regardless of whether it is is someone's face or shower when Federline stands there. She comforts her sex life, leaving something to her imagination, I don't care about my part, but I can't think how she feels about her divorce now. And yes, for her I am embarrassed But I shouldn't be. He seems to be living a rather empty, low life. I don't want to change her, even if I could. If you want, do-kill TV.
