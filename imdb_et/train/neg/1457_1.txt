I watched this movie a couple of times and I can say that it is a small budget garbage and that it has nothing to do with actual history. Actresses' performances are very bad, but this is the result of limited action. Anyone who watched this movie probably thinks Hitler is a crazy crazy guy who runs a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that in these years there are many better films about Hitler and Germany, and that the rise of evil is very low. I can recommend the German Downfall, where you can see the brilliant results of Swiss actress Bruno Ganz in the roll of Adolf Hitler.
