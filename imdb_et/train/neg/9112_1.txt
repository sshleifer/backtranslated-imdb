Basically, the cruel intentions 2 are cruel intentions 1, again badly done. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some lines), but with a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown and certainly less talented. Instead of seducing her and pulling me to see it, I felt dirty because it was like soft core porn. I'm not sure whether to blame the participants or writers for idiotic lines ... and I always feel that bad because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically two hours of my life. It literally amazes you that some movies have been made, and that is no exception. I can't believe they would do the third.
