Listening to the words of the four stars of Jay Leno's re-heard is a unique memorable aspect, which is the whim of an unsuitable police partner in this formula. In COLLISION COURSE, a pelican comedian plays with early Pat Morita to track a stolen prototype turbocharger (I think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot?). These two cases work hard, they really do, but Leno is not an actress and Morita's routine routine is getting old. The film is a bit of a cheesy complaint of the '80s, but its worthy moments are getting smaller as it fills its longer 100-minute working time. The fans of Leno's great comedy talents are feeling behind; everyone else is just bored.
