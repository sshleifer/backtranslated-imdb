The box cover makes this movie really good, don't deceive. In 1984, a splatter university appeared, which was the last good year of horror, but it sucks. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool. does this film have any plots that hell would ever produce film waste? <br /> <br /> Spoilers Back and forth <br /> <br /> The teacher dies in it and it was women, we all know that we must have a female supporter when you break the rules, do it with a good horror, not this waste
