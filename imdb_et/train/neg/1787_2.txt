I liked Batman: Dead End. For Batman, there was a dark-lipped movie noir that was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. It is not like that. <br /> <br /> First, let me start with an actor. It's not really that good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But it doesn't talk much. He is good at first glance, and then you realize that he is what he is, a bodybuilder who is a tolerant actor. But the main problem is that Batman is not in daylight, he looks like a freak running in a Bat suit. Instead of trying to make up for the mistakes of the past, a terrible love man. The daylight also reveals Bartram's irritating dorky fool that does not leave Batman and Dead Endi and is unlikely to be caused by short darkness. Bartram seems to think that contempt and stubborn shaking his head, this is not the opposite. This is called Posing, something that actual actors avoid as a plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never thought about why Collora led the builders. It makes more sense to give a role to an actor who can manage it, not a bodybuilder who can manage it, but HEY HE is as much as COMIC! Of course, they could have done better if Collora's dialouge didn't leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The whole trailer (yes, trailer. Full length movie is not) is focused on Superman then Batman. But everything on the Superman side is bright, appealing and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He is standing around, smiling, says his lines. That's it. Although I am not surprised because he is just a bodybuilder, they hired and could get some exhibitions. I'll tell Collor once more that I acheed ACTORS. Not bodybuilders. The actors are so much more convincing that we forgive them for not seeing exactly like a comic book. <br /> <br /> Costume is what you would expect from Superman. Like the Batman suit. Well, I think it's just good in the dark. I say this because in some shots, the suit looks something that would be bought at a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But that's not good. These pictures are especially amateurs. This and much of the "movie" looks like it's made with a VHS camera in their backyard. <br /> <br /> The best shots are in Superman's fired car. And two faces and Batman's last shot ended. For those who have seen the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now, if only he could hit the whole trailer. <br /> <br /> Finally, I ask. Why should you show your ability as a director to make a short film as a trailer? It doesn't prove anything when it comes to the actual director's handling story. My only advice to Collora is that there is a way to talk and be able to market. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End didn't feel like an amateur. I can't figure out where it went wrong.
