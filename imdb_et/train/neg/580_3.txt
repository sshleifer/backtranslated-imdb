A really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable, and the poor acts as a complement. <br /> <br /> This vampire hunter is the worst thing I have seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) Mexico is looking for some blood mammals! He uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade) and is part of some of Van Helsing's vampire hunters, OK, but he's working alone. He is set to act on behalf of a powerful vampire queen who is looking for some black crucifix to perform a ritual that allows her to be out of the sun (almost another Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and played by James Woods). Derek begins some new friends when looking for a queen: Sancho (Diego Luna, really badly acting) teenager without experience, father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente), Catholic priest Zoey (Natasha Wagner), a specific vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) expert vampire men. So apparently in this adventure he is not alone. <br /> <br /> You can get to know how this film looks at his leading actor (Jon Bon Jovi); there is a big difference in the quality of the actors compared to James Woods and when you watch the movie (I don't recommend this part), you are one of the most simple stories that are quite predictable with terrible shows. really bad special effects and inconsistent events! <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not seeing this movie, rent another movie, watch another channel, go with friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
