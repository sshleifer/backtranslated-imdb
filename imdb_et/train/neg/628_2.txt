This movie was a potential decent horror movie. The main character was well done and I felt sorry for it and had a good back. HOW ALL OTHER SUCKS. Director Emmanuel is quite incompetent in filmmaking. He uses some of the most idiotic frames. <br /> <br /> - A few random images scattered throughout the movie. I don't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic, but he wasn't. It was stupid. The trailer's casual shots, where the protagonist lived, casual buildings, casual panoramic buildings from buildings, a casual cat that walks away. WTF? And the clouds. A lot of dark clouds. <br /> <br /> He really liked this technique to cut the scene into different shots, not just as one continuous picture. EX: Guy is trying to shed light on her weeds and the cameras around her circle. Instead of just one picture, he edits such 10 different pictures so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid. <br /> <br /> Action is terrible, but it makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast because it slips and spins and spins all the time. And some deaths could have been better. You expect the main bully to have long been built on death but speed. Simple corncob in the ear. The interest of love was hot. Charming. That's why this movie gets 2.
