Left behind is an incredible waste of over $ 17 million. Action is weak and endless, the story is even weaker. The audience is asked to believe the features of an incredible and repeatedly ridiculous plot and to give something good for the faith. Not only has the film worked badly and been scripted, it is seriously affecting all the technical areas of the film. Production design does not contribute to the reliability of operations. Impacts are completely uneven and flat. Lighting and general continuity are undeniably terrible; even compared to tenth budget films.

However, it is unfortunate that they are forced to accept grade 3 amateur films.
