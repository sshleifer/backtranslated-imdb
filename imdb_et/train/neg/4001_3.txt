Had heard so many of the Cracker series of the 1990s, if they didn't see them, I was looking forward to it. Certainly, the combination of Jimmie McGover and Robbie Coltrane couldn't go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Polemics, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent setbacks, was overwhelming. Production was trying to be super-modern, but the blinking boxes and even the childish letter irritated. Robbie Coltrane dreamed about two hours of hours, unexplained and unlikely "insights", and the police were depicted as one-dimensional worshiping idiots. As a result, the tension and the last scene (details about the fear of spoilers) had never been so ridiculously bad for a TV drama, as I have seen for a long time. > No, I don't want to see them anymore, but I return to the 1990s DVDs to see if they match their reputation.
