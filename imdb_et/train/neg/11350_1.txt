As long as there is 3D technology (I think in the 1950s), there are animations for it. I remember specifically, Donald Duck's comic with Chip and Dale. I don't remember this name right now, but the plot was that Donald worked in the circus, fed the elephants peanuts, and Chip and Dale stole the peanuts. It was made for viewing in 3D probably in the 1960s. When you happened to watch the Robinsons meeting in theaters in 3d, they showed this movie before the movie and explained the details of its origin. There are probably around 100 cartoons made specifically for watching 3D glasses. This claim was a bad move, because it is not difficult to prove it wrong. Besides, it looks just like a bad movie.
