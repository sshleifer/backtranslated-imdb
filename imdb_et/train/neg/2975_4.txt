I looked at it right after I saw HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so that something improved. Moreover, it prevents me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its rank. Unfortunately, the more I looked the more than I understood how well Danny Boyle's original was and how much this film affected 28 weeks later <br /> <br /> It is not possible to see how many 28 franchises date this type of Italy horror movie. I was absolutely convinced that ZOMBI 3 had to be done at the latest in 1980 or 1981 - in that case I would have called my summary for 28 YEARS (Geddit?) - but it wasn't until I found this page published in 1988. All output values ​​are screaming that it is a small budget splatter from the beginning of this decade. Maybe I enjoyed this movie as a 15-year-old schoolboy in 1982 as my peers, but not now. <br /> <br /> Much of the problem is the lack of internal consistency. For example, some zombies interfere with snails, while others may work very quickly and have a self-consciousness leading to a ridiculous end-stage involving a DJ. Similarly, some kill can be killed if others stay alive even when their head is cut off, wait until you see the freezer scene, you can just laugh. Even the serious characters suffer from this kind of scamed sloppy scripts, where the character suddenly reveals that he is a helicopter pilot, asking me why the army has taken a career to run Jeep, reminding me of the earlier movie THE CRAZIES, which reminded me of 28 more films. A number of terrorists break the scientific base, leading to any disaster, when the army are bad guys trying to kill both infected and survivors, and long before you finish being dead. The problem with this is to remind you instantly how the British franchise did so much better with the bigger budget. Not only that, only 28 franchises are turning to a mindset that can be very interested in the average horror film. ZOMBI 3 does not turn to anyone but tough sprayers
