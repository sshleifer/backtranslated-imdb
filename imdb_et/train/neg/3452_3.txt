I chose the film at the last Dubai film festival because it was selected for the prestigious competition section of the Cannes Film Festival. I was surprised that Cannes could be so far away in quality assessment. <br /> <br /> Film, some reviewers, have noticed that it doesn't have too much fire - but natural violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your son ... or forcing someone to eat porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some tips from the controversial Corleone sons, Copolla's "godfather", which seems to re-face here in China / Hong Kong, but the quality of the two is as clear as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> The movie is only recommended for violence in junkies. There's no big cinema here. At best, it can be considered better than normal Run Run Shaw production for output values.
