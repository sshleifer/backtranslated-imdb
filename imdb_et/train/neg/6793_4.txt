Gritty, a dusty western director, Richard Brooks, who seems to have penetrated the genre, keeping all the usual clich√©s intact. In the early 1900s, horse racing is attracted by the low-rise cowboy (Gene Hackman), the booming player (James Coburn), the devil boy (Jan Michael Vincent) and even FEMALE (surprisingly Candice Bergen). When predecessors are away (predictable arguments about whether a woman should be involved), it becomes a rather appealing entry, even though it is not a new base (it rather resembles Gary Cooper's timing). On good-looking pieces, the macho verve and fine-grained pieces, but the mechanisms of the plot become quite tiring quickly. ** from ****
