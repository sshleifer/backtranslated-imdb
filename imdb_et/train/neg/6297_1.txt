I'm a big fan of Martin Amis whose book is based on this movie. Unfortunately, the director has not been able to translate the book into the screen. The novel has thoroughly posted its modern and highly artificial character and the breakdown of the development of traditional plots and character. It's a fun exploration of the greed, passion, and void of man by the most moral of today's British writers. The film director has completely lost the novel. In his hand, the film screams at the speed of shock, allowing every known trick and "strange" camera corner. It is like Ken Russel's acid and suffers from that senior director's feeling that is up to one hundred. Not even a (brief) glimpse into the penis of great actor Christian Solimeno, this wretched film was enough for me. Abysmal!
