The Zombie Rebellion is BAD. There is not much entertainment about the film. It is boring, inanimate, malfunctioning and poorly written. I've often complained that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my taste, well this film makes Dracula look like mountain biking. 65 minutes of driving time was 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> Story: An expedition will be sent to Cambodia to find the mysteries of mind control through "zombification". A man finds a secret and uses it to marry the woman he loves. When this happens, it will release the zombies under its control into terrible consequences. That's it. It's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most movies, I tried to find out where the man was. He seemed so familiar. I had enough time to think about it. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the "zombies rebellion" it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had seen her recently as a white Christmas general. This is the way I myself organized the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I didn't buy a DVD for this movie. The King of Zombies is on the other side and this is the masterpiece of making a movie. What's worth, I'll give it 2/10. (I'm not going to 1/10 because you believe it or not, I've seen it worse.)
