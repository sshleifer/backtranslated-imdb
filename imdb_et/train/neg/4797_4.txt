After mob boss Vic Moretti (late big Anthony Franciosa) kills his wife, with whom he was cheated by Derek, with his new drivers and vets in Vietnam and accused of being a poor boy, Derek finds himself in jail where he has to fight a corrupt prison, Vic prisoner who leads prisoner , and oh yes, illegal attempts by a hidden CIA agent (big genre-chief and first-time director John Saxon) to make the various prisoners super-human unbeaten zombies. Of course, the thing goes out and Derek and the rest of the unchanging prisoners have to save the day after the imprisonment of the infected prisoners. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor and when director Saxon is ... a great talented actor. To say that this film (John's only director for a trip) does not have a certain visual beauty, would be a little inaccurate. But the film is not entirely unjustified. Dialogue, being idiotic, is just bad enough to sometimes be humorous. Unfortunately, this is not enough to keep the film alone, and it will take forever that the film will even come to its own (which is quite late in the film). As such, it is most advisable to tell this movie that if you are a Saxon fan (what I really am), it is worth looking at, just go with low expectations and you should be good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure Get Topless <br /> <br /> My Class: D +
