I wanted to see the movie because of the article in the movie magazine. It was not highly recommended by the critic. The story is different and I am sure it could have been a good movie if it were in the right hands. Targeting and acting was terrible! I had the feeling of watching a movie made with a lot of amateurs. Although the film started promisingly, it worsened and worsened. I think it's an uncomfortable movie with uncomfortable characters. I still think it's worth a look because I haven't seen movies with gay porn. Don't hold your expectations high, you are very disappointed. * out of stock *****
