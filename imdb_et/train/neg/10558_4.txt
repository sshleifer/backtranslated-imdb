I don't know why it has fans, and I don't know why I've even given that score. It's unpleasant. There are many gialloids where you have to stop disbelief, roll the picture and catch up with it before it becomes disgraceful and some poor police officers finally have to explain what we've seen. But it has very little cost and has long sequences where nothing happens and is of no importance, while we have to listen to the most repetitive soundtrack, even according to Italian standards. It's not a giallo, it's a complete fear idea that includes Klaus Kinsky in one of his boldest calls. I think he turned up, worked one day and cleaned D'Amato when he left, so that others could complete them. Of course, Ewa is beautiful, but not enough, and finally we've seen too much of her popping over the place, long since we've completely lost her mindset and pretentious twaddle. Maybe I was just not in the right mood!
