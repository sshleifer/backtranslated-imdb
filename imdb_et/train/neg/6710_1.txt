I've seen more than 1,000 movies and it stands out as one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is a shame that they had to tie this garbage to The Angels in 1963 with the song "My Boyfriend's Back". If you need to choose between watching a movie and painful dental work, I would recommend dental work.
