I'm not sure it was a language or a poor actor, but everything about this movie looks and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After you've seen Der Untergang, it's a big disappointment. There is no connection between the different scenes, and the actor is so incredibly poor that I couldn't even believe people could do something that was very potential. <br /> <br /> And most of all, English is spoken in Germany. Big mistake. German has a certain sound on it, and especially Hitler himself sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is spoken made me believe it was an improvised spot, the characters were empty, and the film seems to be a set of random events that could have happened. <br /> <br /> Whether it is English or the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, all this movie was fake and ridiculous.
