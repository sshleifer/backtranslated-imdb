I watched this movie last night, but it wasn't really impressive. <br /> <br /> Except for Combo, I thought it was poor and the narrative was limited. It was like "made for television". <br /> <br /> I felt the film was very natural. A whole set of hammers (yes, we get that it is Britain - you can finish it) was tiring and gave a very one-sided insight into what life was in the 80s in Britain - poverty, side by side, Margaret Thatcher, something else? There were actually middle classes who were there at the time - just ordinary people working with a decent salary and a mortgage. The Falkland clips also seemed to be at the end, for a "dramatic effect", I assume. We see how their way of thinking has changed so quickly. I couldn't even look at mocking. I find it very hard to believe that he would have attracted a boy who was not only younger but also younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing when you reach your twenties, but that is a big difference between your teenagers! My experience shows that this difference in teenage age only occurs when the girl is younger because the girls ripen so much faster and are at the wavelength of boys aged a couple of years. I'm sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock. <br /> <br /> The end was somewhat steep and again busy. If the flagging incident had to be an icon, it fell somewhat short in my eyes. Don't do me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and the four weddings have their own charms, but can't we do anything for the Brits? Why are our films always so hung up in the classroom? I was born in 1973, so it wasn't much different from Shaun's age in 1983. I grew up in single-parent families in rather subdued councils in England. But my childhood experiences were very different from those in the film - I don't even remember that racism is a problem (although I don't say it doesn't exist). "Is this England"? Not in my experience.
