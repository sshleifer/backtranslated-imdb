This 2003 TV film was, of course, shown on the women's channel. Man, why am I even trying to look at it? I don't know, but I should have looked into my head. And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed to give people injustice as he does. He takes away all the power and conviction a person can have when he has made several boring women. The number one bears the wife of Joyce Hyser. I couldn't wait for her. His vengeance was stupid and stupid and was very confusing with most of the film. Another femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you would ever like to meet. His appearance did not guarantee our leading person to go over the monkey and his actor was so obvious, but the fool could pass. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slowly, when he slipped his wife in slit, he played David DeLuise again as a loser. The rounding of the runners is Anthony Denison as a boss with little work but a hero in our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero or should I say the victim was not so good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He never got part of the ground and was repetitive. Though as a man, I got angry when two women went with it. Men, be wary of this channel that puts men down and women even disappear by murder. LMN is a channel. Beware. Note: After being mistaken for the second time, I am convinced of my original thoughts. Especially writer / director, Simon Gornick. I believe he has shamed the male species and should be whipped by the horse. Only the rescue arm in this film is Tembi Locke, who has no chance of showing his talents in awe of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLue. Plus a stupid plot that only makes it worse. Alla Gornicki movie and her free letters. Please LMN will not show this trick again.
