I rented it on a DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious of seeing Michael Madsen, who appeared in a movie I've never heard of, but it was a hands-free, so why not check it out. <br /> <br /> Well, I think Mr. Blonde would very much forget that he has ever participated in such a movie shame. <br /> <br /> Obviously, even if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors can't save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this movie. Too many native speakers who are native English speak partly native speakers by reading the rows of the script that should have been thrown away and not made for film. It is incredible how incredible all the lines of the movie are. Music is terrible and totally inappropriate and the whole thing looks and sounds like a bad school game. <br /> <br /> I suggest that you look at it so you appreciate other, better movies. That's why I gave what he deserves instead of 3.
