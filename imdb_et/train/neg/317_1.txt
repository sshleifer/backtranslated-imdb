It must be the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there was no interest in this film. I was on holiday at that time and I had plenty of time to dedicate just-for-the-fun to the movie. The apartment we stayed in was in the stock of the movie - they have to be in the $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing else he has done. It started with a bad assumption and then just worsened. There's nothing funny about that. <br /> <br /> I've been watching a lot of movies, including some that I don't care about. But if you decide to waste your movie time, don't tell me I didn't warn you.
