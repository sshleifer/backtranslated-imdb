The first (and only) time I saw in "Shades" was during Sneakpreview. It wasn't even in the premiere. I remember there was someone from the directors' staff, not even remembering who. It was a Belgian film, we have never heard of it, so we were quite neutral without knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he is ahead of the rest of the miles. He plays an actor whose star has long been eliminated. He helps to realize the Shades movie in Belgium. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, we noticed how much swearing it was. Nothing is against a random swear word. But it was too disturbing. When Rourke uses F *** to express something, it comes naturally. But if someone uses a word F **** or S *** when cast, non-English speaker, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost how many times they used F and S words. Everyone was just out of the theater. And we had to give a voice, but it was hard for us because it was only 0 to 10 and we were looking for -10.
