OK, don't let me fool you at the conclusion. This movie SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible that people shouldn't have described their brains. But it is in no way worse than Manos: fate, hobgobblins, spider horror or a small handful of movies. As a review, the film sucks, it's terrible. Don't see it with MST or you may have health problems. But there are worse movies.
