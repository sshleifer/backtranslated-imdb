I can only believe that Garson Kanin must be two people. Who wrote the glorious "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and wrote with his wife Ruth Gordon "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" both great scenarios and who wrote and / or wrote the lead tireless, sad generation like "Bachelor Mother", "Some Of A Nut" And That. The cast is trying, but the script is so tired and clich√© that even the effort of Brenda Vaccaro is always struck. The sinking of the script is the lowest in the truly offensive order where the character of Janssen has the character of Driva to make sure he is not gay. An ugly order, but unfortunately what you can easily play in the movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now completely verbotenid, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
