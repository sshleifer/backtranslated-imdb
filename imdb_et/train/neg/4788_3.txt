In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie Tall will continue to run, assisted by a happy 9-year-old, black G.I. Jane and Mike's dead brother's spirit (he died in the original Phantom). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel because gore and black comedy are much less inspired and exciting than it was in Phantasm II. I had the feeling that the stress was only on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a comedian. The humor of the previous film was much drier and more oppressive, which is more suitable for such a creation. Here too, the settings are not so sharp, plus the constant presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious? There are still many gore, but not half, at this time. By the way, be careful of the severely cut version because it shows the most amazing killings on the screen. The entire Phantasm series is Don Coscarell's lifetime achievement, who wrote and staged 4 production. The first one is a semi-cultural class, the other is the horror of horror and violence, and the rest can be easily missed. A. Michael Baldwin returns to Mike, although James LeGros represented his character in Phantasm II much better.
