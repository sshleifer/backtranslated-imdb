It's incredible! .. is, someone before me wrote that it was time to waste sit and watch this movie .. that's it! Don't do it! I'm completely here! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I found it funny that she played the meaning of her name in the movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (home only), but now (right after) I'm completely disappointed! It was his worst film ever. Traceable !! Bad actress-game! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario! ..Every one good idea: this wonderful girl! Be sure to have a mannequin! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 rows minimum?! I don't want to waste time reading my opinion! I hope that I was clear and full, because English is not my mother tongue. So have a grate time and watch good movies as i try too .. Peace!
