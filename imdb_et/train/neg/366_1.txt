Bad actors, bad filming, dirty dialogue, low characters, but then it was a bad assumption again. Basically, an 11-year-old is being tempted because he has very little money, a blank check by a moral criminal. Of course, there is enough technology and intelligence in an 11-year-old to buy a house, watch cash for $ 1,000,000, and even foil three worshiping idiots that resemble three stories. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is a tedious, unpleasant, boy who decides that if a stranger is a blank check he will use this situation as well as possible. In other words, he travels to the bank, <br /> <br /> tells the teller what he does in his printer, and miraculously walks one million dollars. Preston is also likely to be able to achieve incredible speeds on his bike, because a man who drives Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed was unable to catch him, even if Preston jumped on a line of cars. <br /> <br Of course, every hokey adventure movie must have a hot heroine. In this case, our hot heroine child who is bothering an FBI agent who is an eleven-year-old Preston and promises on the second day she gets 17. <br /> <br /> But the absolute worst aspect of this movie was not her casting or sloppy a dialogue like "The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick the hose on its butt and then on the fur". It was rather the whole fact that no one in the film seemed to realize that the FBI wasn't fucking fucking random. What I have not been able to explain is that Preston uses the "Macintosh" screen to disguise it as an entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI finds it intriguing and sends it to our young hero, Preston, who uses his 11-year-old spirit to yell when lobsters fall on his face, then treat him with hamburgers, ending with a ridiculous romp cemented area where water jettison from the ground. Our heroine is not able to understand during this whole adventure that the FBI is slipping and sliding right behind the two because they are doing the Preston limousine, with a 1-dimensional driver who will never be able to offer cheap, the third price laughs the whole family can suffocate. <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 is very grateful for this movie. I don't see how it only has 4.4 / 10.
