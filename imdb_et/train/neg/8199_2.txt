I'm oh soooo glad I'm not spending money on going to the cinema :-). This is nothing more than the preparation of some other classic titles, such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, Abyss, etc., according to a rather boring and pointless scenario. I really can't understand what the purpose of creating this movie was - he has nothing new to offer in his print, which is also pointless. Besides, there is nothing to watch - the FXs look like they were used in another shop, you saw them all in other movies. But it is definitely a good lullaby.
