The irritating mouse and lullaby really got to me and there was really no story ... This is something I would have done in my first year at a film school. Very sad. In addition, the story seemed to be obviously dragging without a reason ... there were too many things that just dropped there, with no story that makes me feel that the creative team didn't know what they really should have been shorter ... what it would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have been watching this episode last week ... I have to say that it was by far the worst, and I wanted to warn others not to start it.
