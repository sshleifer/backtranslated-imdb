I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's really funny at a very sharp value. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean she just can't act. He should now give up, because acting is not clearly his thing. His co-stars are about the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than everyone! The director should be ashamed to put his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I don't think the Oscar is on the cards of this bag. <br /> <br /> I've never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do it. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, don't be 0/10 when it was 0
