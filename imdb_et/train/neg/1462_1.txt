It may be the worst film I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshel claims, this film is not historically accurate. It starts badly and then all down there. We have Hitler's father who writes his "bad luck" on the fact that he married his brother! They were really second relatives. Hitler's mother, Klara, called her father, Alois, "uncle", because Klara's grandfather received and raised Alois as he grew up as his son when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and so he was used to calling Alois as a child. <br /> <br /> The scene in the trenches, where Hitler's colleagues mocked, decides to take it to his dog just as a shame and insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see that Hitler kidnaps the dog through the trench when he reaches the poor thing he continues to obey him. Far from seeing and hearing the soldiers of our colleagues, they continue to cowardly and cows, but then land directly on their persecutors and every one we are told is killed directly. How then, when Hitler was the only person to survive in the life of the scene, was this narrative said brutality and cowardice? Did Hitler himself go around it? - I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Next, Hitler is tempting and intimidating the poor, stressing and warring a Jewish officer giving him a rumble! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a pawnshop before fighting his fatherland and had brought some medals pledged in his shop because I was sure that iron letters were not shared, as shown in this comic. <br /> <br /> All grotesque clich√©s are here, especially the soothing and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on a small man. If only the manufacturers had kept Ian Kershawit on the side. Then they could discover that Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" was more likely to include Fuhrer's boat than Richard Wagner's "Flying Dutchman" cannon! <br /> <br /> Hitler may have been responsible for 60 million deaths, but how can he ever forgive his dreadful music for taste? <br /> <br /> I could go, but I'd have a lesson with it. <br /> <br /> Let her miss her.
