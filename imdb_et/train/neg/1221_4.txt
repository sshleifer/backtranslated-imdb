I remember the days when Kim Basinger was more than a pretty face, decorating the movies with typical funny Blondie, romantic interests, or at risk. But it all changed when she won an excellent film LA Confidential for her role as the best supporting actor in the Academy Award, and I think I was not the only one who surprised her for a definite result. But after that moment his career did not follow the ideal path. to participate in moderately prestigious films (like the people I know or the door on the floor), but we have never seen him again in an essential character. and it is not only that its character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really funny. The scenario of this film may not be more hollow and more fundamental. The film is full of clich√©s and general crooks. Manager Susan Montford's work is truly catastrophic for many reasons, but mainly because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. ridiculous.I do not recommend although he was at all.This film puts the capital of sin is boring.
