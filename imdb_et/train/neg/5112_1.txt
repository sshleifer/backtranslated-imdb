Yes, it is warm-hearted and all that some unhappy families are receiving by ABC / Sears and is "renovated" their home. There comes a humanistic complaint. I liked it early, but now this exhibition has become reluctantly overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Ten poor families could be given relatively luxurious homes with many good benefits for every family member. . People at Habitat For Humanity must shake their heads soon. For example, does a sixteen-year-old boy in his bedroom have a whirlpool bath or a low rider bed in bed? Does the mother really need her own broken, non-working and rusting old truck that some of the best adapters have restored in California and "pimped"? The new job would have done pretty well and probably a third of the price. Do people need sixty-five inch plasma screens in every six spaces? And then there is the question of who pays real estate taxes and utility bills. Even after a zaniake "Makeover" vacation, someone has yet to earn a living. I doubt that friendly people in social services will see humor in this size. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is nothing more than a rating editor for ABC and quiet commercial for its sponsors.
