At first glance, I thought it might have been a decent film. Am I ever wrong? The beginning of the film looks like the bunch talks and decided to make a small budget movie. The first 10 minutes do not notice the cheese's terrible sound and pious special effects, but then it gets worse. After about 20 minutes I asked myself, "What was the plot again?" I could only ask this question if I didn't laugh at the flatness of this movie. The main actor is one feeling of emotion and he sticks to it throughout the film, although he had to go through love and hatred and everything in between. The regenerating scene made me almost vomit because it made me live again for one minute of the footage. Now we hit the movie in the middle, where they're probably trying to pull Morpheus out of "The Matrix", though he's just doing a terrible job. The actor speaks of "Star Wars" and the fortunes of cookie expressions are almost intolerable. Now, at the end of the movie, you do not realize that this is the end of the film, because you really think the plot is finally developing. The "Morpheus" sign dies, ONLY a good movie about the movie. He speaks a few words and credits. What is this? There is no plot, bad behavior, cheese everything, it didn't get worse. If you value human dignity, don't look at this movie!
