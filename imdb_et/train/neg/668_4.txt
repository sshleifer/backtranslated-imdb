So Prom Night had to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big joke and I was afraid to see it at the beginning of the movie, but it's not a horror or a thriller to see it. <br /> <br /> I was basically fun with my place movie because it was so predictable. You could predict what will happen next. The young actors were correct in playing their character, but I have to say that the killer was definitely at the beginning of the game - wisely. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give the plot props because it was good, but it is not exciting or scary. There were almost zero "jump in place" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars watching it in theaters, wait for the DVD.
