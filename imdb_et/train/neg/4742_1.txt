Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, a popular girl who is a hot jock boy, and made friends who have decided to be a Homecoming Queen. He should save the world as a war and Shin comes with the help to help him with his martial arts. Shin teaches him the skills of a snake, a tiger, and he has to learn certain methods to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture but Brenda Song is a comedian actor and I don't see her playing a serious role. Laughing funny, watching her crying over Shin. Shin was unable to act at all and everything was incredible. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar and the thing I came up with was Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the stunts were so powerful Ranger-esquire that it was just messy and stupid. The characters were not pleasant and I just couldn't look at it. Disney really needs time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, along with other movies like Jumping Ship, Friends of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, & Stuck in the Suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action-adventure and funny jokes, you'll love this movie.
