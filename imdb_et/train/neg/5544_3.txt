Although this movie definitely has a bad movie smell, it is surprisingly observable on many levels. First of all, it is interesting for old film fans to see Dean Jagger's leading role (no connection with Mick). Although Jagger later became a very respectable role as a supportive actor (even 12 O'CLOCK HIGH in raising this category of Oscar), his performance is unique because he actually has a full hairhead. this way) and because he was the worst actor in the movie. This film only shows that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films, it does not mean that he cannot finally be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. all. Writing is bad, acting is bad and special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian spend, it is obvious that they just go in place and the background is badly predicted behind them. In addition, when they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry! The whole film has a lot of consistency and meaninglessly bad dialogue - so much so it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugos or George Zucco to film - because both had played in many class-z horror movies. In many ways, this would be a great example of a film class, how not to film. <br /> <br /> So while you give it to 3, it's probably a bit too generous to have fun laughing and short, so it's a good idea to look for a bad film fan.
