There are some good things in the movie. Music and cinema are great. Alex Wilson is hot and provides excellent performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. Production was very happy that they were cast because they really produce value for the film. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many movies that are not talking are also cute. Why isn't an actor playing Amy on credit? Brandon Alexander gives an excellent comic performance like Clitar in Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is probably the star, James Townsend. He can't act. He's also very tough, not nice at all. His hands are like spaghetti. This is horrible. They have no muscle tone at all. No wonder she has to make her own movie and make her self. No one else would deny him anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend, because he is so gay. They should have led someone else if they wanted what was best for the film. Maybe he just wants to use this movie as a tool to launch a career in soft core porn, certainly not real action, because he would have taken some exhibitions. In addition, anyone doing porn is on the blacklist in Hollywood. Sonja Fisher doesn't seem like an actor at all. All in all, this movie is a porn type, and it's no better than what you see in Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassing and doesn't want to associate it. There is no photo or anything else on the IMDb page, so Alex Wilson is probably a one-time use. Plus, I found her once in West Hollywood once and when I mentioned this movie she just turned around and walked away. I understand. If I had worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and wouldn't want to associate it.
