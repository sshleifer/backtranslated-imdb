First of all; it is very dilettant to try to describe history only in weapons, microbes and steel. The same tried to make Marxist's economic positions. <br /> <br /> Western success cannot be just a fool of happiness, the benefits of domesticated plants and animals. We see that all the benefits and bonuses all over the world are useless if they are not reasonably managed. There are no enormous natural resources in Japan, but Japan is one of the largest economies in the world, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, where there is rich oil reserves, only the average is successful. Both countries had and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why is this gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Daimond said it was very important to understand the factors of weapons, microbes and steel on UNDERSTAND. Maybe geography is not the main factor in the world difference, but the ability of people to understand and use things? Spiritual ability to understand. And then geography is subordinate.
