Ahh this movie had so much potential! Good quality B-actors, Jessica Simpson raids and ... that's it! <br /> <br /> I believe some of the unnamed marketing departments had an idea. Basically lets do some kind of Legally Blond movie, but do it in New York. This great bright city, power and money and where everyone is heartless, power / money hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, the small town of bimbo, the Owen Wilson brother, and some obvious reason that Andy Dick (you should only ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> Key Feature: <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the girl for NY, the girl follows, the boy cheats, the girl stays at NY, the job is under the wrong pretext, muck up, the other boy encourages ( brother Wilson) and saves with the day and the kiss. <br /> <br /> Some words will remind you to think about this movie, ie terrible, terrible, unbearable, intolerant and xenophobic. Just don't look at this movie, be happier. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and I certainly agree with him. This film creates shock. And I know what you mean ... at least at some point I can see Simpson naked or close. It doesn't happen, save time and YouTube. You have a better sexual time! <br /> <br /> Editing films is weak, functioning is unbearable and why are they using blue screens? <br /> <br /> In summary; this is the kinematic treason that should be punished to the maximum. <br /> <br /> The second question is why Willie Nelson always plays father's characteristics on Jessica Simpson's flick and why are not black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie?
