Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit his hypocritical biblical quotation father (William Finley) and draws attention to the bodybuilder group headed by the successor of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays in de Sade's setbacks, hugging his cell. Genie has been mistaken for Mohammed (Juliano Merr) who rides naked on horse and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces him to smoking opium leading to wild hallucination with topless harem dancers, a woman who simulates oral sex snake, orgy and her Dad preach in the background! In the meantime, the black hooded members will disappear, pull out their eyes and cut their throat. When Genie slipped into his tea, he predicts that Sade hangs from a cross, a gold-colored woman in a leafy vegetable, and a bloody lined bed. It is all because he is the reincarnation of de Sade's lost love. <br /> <br /> This typical buggy production by Harry Alan Towers is superfluous, perky, and pretty pointless, but kits, costumes, cinematography, and location work are all great at least there is always something. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
