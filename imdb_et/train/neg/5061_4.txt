Anurag Basu, who directed the flop KUCCH TO HAI, made his debut in the film <br /> <br /> The movie was ahead of time, though it has a story that is not different and it was closest to HAWAS, released 1 week before and fortunately it was better and did a better business. <br /> <br /> The film starts well, Malika's guilt is well shown at first, although the scene with Emran-Malika is too coarse / vulgar <br /> <br /> Emran and The scenes between Malika are well handled and the story of Ashmith's contact with Emran is brilliant <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is moving fast and the viewer is holding the edge, but the other Emhan girlfriend track is not completely convincing <br /> <br /> Also, the double track seems half-baked <br /> <br /> The league's too expensive <br /> <br /> Anurag Basu's direction is good Music is the winner, all songs were fab Camera-work was stunning <br /> > Emran played his naughty streak very well, it was a role that gave him a stardom and even though he played it ed roles and annoying assaults in this movie. Ashmith was once good at performing his duties, he did a good job and was one of his only good results and he also seemed good. his service was sometimes up to the mark. Unfortunately, he seldom showed such potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is okay
