Comparing this dirty old, low-budget porn flick would be offensive to an old, low-budget porn flick. The scenes of the animal have no meaning, nor does this man or his crimes, even in the broadest abstract sense. The summary on the back of the DVD case says in part: "Repeating BTK Killer Terrorist Governance". This is not a retraction. Restarting indicates that you are told the truth about what happened or how or why. None of these things is true. I'm an enthusiastic serum killer and I've seen these pretty filthy movies, and frankly, it's NOT one of them. It's not even a BTK killer. Save yourself time and a few bucks and rent a Dahmer. This serum killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you just see this movie yourself, check it out for free in your local library and even then you will still feel cheated.
