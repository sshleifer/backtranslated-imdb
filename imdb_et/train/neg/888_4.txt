It was a movie I couldn't wait for! So finally I got it and I was quite disappointed. For starters, the film is so little said in New York, just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It really doesn't stay focused on New York's magic.Another thing that changed my mind was the French movie inside the movie. is a remake, but it's not a French-style remake! Anyway, here you will notice the elements that remind you of French films, such as long and dirty scenes, incomplete or small stories, and of course all French-style smoking! The story follows many lives (too much to my taste) and they seem to be somehow bound in some way. I feel that characters are not dedicated as much as stories. The film was too short to cover every lucky end of every fate. So we see about 30 people in about 5 minutes. And there are your 120 minutes! If you like active scene dialogues and things, it's not a movie for you! I'll give him 4 just because I love New York and I loved it!
