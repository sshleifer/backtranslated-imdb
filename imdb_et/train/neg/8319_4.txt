Quite unimpressive. "Twists" are all quite predictable if you've seen some movies and a few interesting parts (where someone uses context tips to make a decision) over the last ten years and they don't have much punch because "secret" is already shown before these hints are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> Operation is good, the story is just not very interesting. Astral projection material (not funny) becomes a prerequisite for all "still awake" <br /> <br /> The surgical scene is initially tense, somewhat uncomfortable, but then it becomes completely banal. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Generally boring.
