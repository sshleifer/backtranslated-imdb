I also saw this film screening at the New York High Falls film festival and I have to say that I found this complete and dreadful hole. Although it was funny in some places, the only real laughter was that it seemed to be the real plot to talk about, and in some places the action was terrible and wood, especially the "lovely lady" and the narrator's voice (which I have never heard) was much desired. I felt that J.C.Mac was the redemption feature of this film, the real action and the grit and (selected) the only real actor. I am sure that with the management of the second pain and the stricter governance it could have been half a decent film. We just hope it is not sent out to the public, or if you really want a copy, check out Lidl's favorable binary.
