In the Fiji Islands, the greedy and careless owners of Valalola Resort Primal Park are invited to open investors and guests to their community, which consists of a hotel and zoo to find partners for their discoveries. If the college's small thieves are taking part in a hunt in the virus security system, are the biggest attractions in the zoo? sabretoothid from the prehistoric age of DNA found in fossils? escape, killing hosts and guards for joy. <br /> <br /> The incredibly flat and cheap "Sabretooth attack" is one of the worst films I've seen recently. The characters are terrible and not funny, and the story is terrible blasting of Jurassik Park with bad clich√©s. Basically, all the lines and situations are bad and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that sabretooth is bulimic and want to kill for joy. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("Sabretooth Attack")
