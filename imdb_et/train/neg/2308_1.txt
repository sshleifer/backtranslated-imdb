OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg stands beside Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife. Then pop this child into a DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. It should be comedy. And I have to admit that I laughed about ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: a ridiculous and abusive neighbor, a boring legal trial, racism, talk of grief and death, and arson. Fun, huh? No, please, if you don't listen to anyone's comments, please do it here. You can't even look at it yourself. CRAP! I said that, CRAP! Anyone who named it should really complain.
