This movie is terrible. I was really looking forward to it because I thought "Lantana" was great. <br /> <br /> The following review may include a * spoiler * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> First of all, good things: it looks good, some shows are OK. Bad things are all else. The story, as you probably know, is about some of the clusters who fish and discover the body, noting that they find it on Friday, but continue fishing and finally report on Sunday when they return to the mobile (mobile) range. But the film takes time (the boy takes time) to reach its central event. <br /> <br /> No one else in the character ensemble (about a dozen) seems like it is, I think it is consistent because everything is unlikely. I was extremely disappointed that it was not enough to explain how the characters were involved, and only at the end of the film I couldn't build a genealogy. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think about the film we're relentlessly gloomy, which is a story in the structure, because the character's life looks just as good as it is after the fishing trip. If you have set the bar so high, it is difficult for anyone to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Logically, it's a stupid time. The killer throws the body off the lake and then tears it somewhat into the mountains. Fishermen leave Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne is home late at night when his wife is asleep. Then the first morning, the police attacked the door to get to the station. Have they not heard of the phone? At the station, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after they report on the body? <br /> <br /> A completely missing story is a discussion that wasn't necessarily after the body was found. It's a mystery - everyone asks them "how do you do that?" and the audience asks the same question. (The discussion about what to do with the body is the main scene of "Deliverance"). I know exactly what I would do in my situation. Someone has to go to the car, move to the mobile range, call the police, wait, and they will return them. When others wait for the camp and the fish who cares? <br /> <br /> Many of them just seem wrong. The only thing true was that when the girl was black, the local Aborigines seized fishermen's activities as racist - "it wouldn't have been if it was a white girl." <br /> <br /> All over there is curious indifference about who could have killed the girl (I think the subject is mentioned once) and no secret, because the audience sees the killer in the opening picture. /> <br /> So I'm sitting there bored and confused while there's a twist - not a plot, but a subject. Suddenly, it comes from the quiet dignity of the aborigines who are killed, leading to a ridiculous end to some inconsistent things about reconciling black and white. <br /> <br /> This is an Australian movie "From Your Best" according to age.
