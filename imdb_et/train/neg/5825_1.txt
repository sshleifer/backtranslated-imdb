It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen! People left the theater, others were asleep (ok, that was a late night show) ... This is a movie that doesn't make sense, one of those who can ever see you out of the image. I would like to look at the look of this film because I am deeply interested in what is happening in the minds of the authors of such garbage. Do they laugh when they create these ridiculous things or think they are doing something interesting? I don't know ... The soundtrack is terrible, except for some instrumental things that remind you of the previous Bjork album. Even if you are a fan of Bjork music, leave home. This is the best thing to do. Small, small, nice pieces of music are not the cause of your torture. God! ...
