Tara Reid as Intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a Doll Store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well it's STEPHEN DORFF for Christ SAKE !!!!

Here is the idea, just my modest opinion as the film's public, but it follows directly from your past choices, the most genius of the film's history, inventing a pill to cure all the illnesses known to people and get it, they have to play Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you loved it. Seriously, though you owe me $ 7.50.
