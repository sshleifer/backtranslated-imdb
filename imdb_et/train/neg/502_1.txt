This film is not only a very bad film, with terrible actors - or with expected actors -, a boring direction and a story that is not attractive, it copies exactly the excellent "giallio" "Torso" scene from 1973, staged by Sergio Martino, two years earlier, one of the most famous psycho-thrillers and cult films in the world of cinema in Italy. "La Sanguinusa conduce la danzas" plays the director's bed between the black girl and the white girl, looking at the bedroom window. Of course, the Rizzo movie scene is ridiculous and worse than in Martin's movie. Repeating the play of another black girl, another white girl and another scene is just the most suitable way to prove that Rizzo's film has no ideas, originality, taste or anything at all. I think such things are offensive to the spectators.
