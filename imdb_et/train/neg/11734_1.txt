Tasty. I can't even write intelligently about a movie. I laughed at the whole movie. It didn't have to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he's doing. His story seems to have been written without knowing Iowa's culture and met-problem. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes her film even more reasonable for me. Why are the two main realities accent? That doesn't make sense. Action was best and sometimes difficult to see. The movie was filled with gratulous violence and sex. I think violence and sex had to make a movie, but it happened to be incredible and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliantly bad that everything I could do was laugh and effortlessly run pictures. When I left the theater, all the others who left with me laughed. The ending of the movie was meant to awaken tears, but it did exactly the opposite. Don't waste your time with this terrible movie if you don't want to see an unknown, delicate, overweight, clich√©.
