Anyone who has learned some kind of physics or cognitive science will be frightened after 40 minutes, like my husband and myself. Unknown masses can be entertaining hand-giving arguments and absurd "conclusions" drawn (without logical reason) from real science. I am offended by the nonsense that is presented in the shadow of "science". I can only conclude that the writers accelerated from the book of quantum physics, did not think about the word, looked at the matrix about a thousand times and began to write this film. For example, a Washington DC crime test was conducted through the Transcendental Meditation Program. A short search shows the science of these methods.
