well its official. They've just killed American Pie. The first 3 were completely hysterical, but this and others have been terrible. I mean, the story is about two college brothers who fight for each other for their houses. I mean talking about a weak plot, the first three dealing with growth, change, and marriage, which are all points of value for human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know he's trying to compare himself to Steven Stifler, but he's not a cigar. I'll give this movie 3 because there are 2-3 funny bits in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character of this movie is, of course, Jim's father whom I don't know why he continues to work on their badly-made films.
