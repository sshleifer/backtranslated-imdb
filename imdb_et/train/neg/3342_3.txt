I didn't expect a lot of film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren, but I was definitely expecting more than I got. One line user comment - Grade 2 Action Film - didn't seem to me to be too cheap for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not have bothered to watch this movie if it was under 5.0 but hey, out of 10 out of 10 out of 5,9, which seemed quite acceptable to me for such production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of people who rated this movie 10 (excellent) were clearly an ad game because DETENTION is the usual Nu Image garbage you've seen before and again. <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince the former army to change the history teacher assigned to the untreated school. His actions are simply terrible, emotional and lively. Lundgren's inability to become more visible to young offenders. Whether they are great actors or they look great with Lundgren - just because they look natural and believable. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has some elements that might have been of interest to this low budget movie - closed - high-security high school weekend, four teenage prisoners with a war veteran teacher, and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get there - but The story (something like BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD or is it PANIC ROOM?) is full of incredible situations, lots of clichés and stereotypical signs. Let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó are in love with the Bonnie and Clyde pairs and give the film the most accepted performances, even if he seems to be a small Sam Rockwell and his, Milla Jovovich, the budget line he wants to be. In a movie where everything goes wrong, they offered enough fresh air to keep the madness and style down to zero.
