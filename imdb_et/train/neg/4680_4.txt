When asked how I would define the word "Low", I'd answer "Look at Jerry Bruckheimer's production." When asked how I would define the phrase "wasted potential", I would answer "See Jerry Bruckheimer's Production". Bruckheimer's productions are almost always confident that the fire will hit the box, but critics will almost always get critical pans. On my head, I can only think of an official and GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN to get a lot of critical acclaim. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE was also praised by critics, which is certainly one of Bruckheimer's better films, which unfortunately does not speak. My problem is a scenario that creates a story: the Russians are fighting against the Chechens and the conflict is spreading across Russia, leading the ultra nationalist Russian language to the base of nuclear missiles and threatening the West when they intervene. Perhaps everything was related to the end of the Cold War, but I found it very unconvincing. Some flaws in geography, such as the French carrier Foch, who is in Medis (wouldn't Foch be on the black sea?) Or that exhibiting famous films from the Balkan conflicts, the first Gulf War and even Vietnam. Again, in my mind, the adjective "Very convincing" seized. The story improves somewhat when the story is underway - a battle between orders from the submarine submarine commander and his second number. Director Tony Scott does his best when it is done, but the problem is still convincing in the scenario. The worst thing is that if it was done in the mid-1980s, when WW3 was a real opportunity - Nay's probability - this movie would have scared me, but after the end of the Cold War there was a risk of a nuclear war, which means that CRIMSON TIDE has little impact.
