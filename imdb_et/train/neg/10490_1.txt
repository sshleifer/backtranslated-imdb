I note that the previous reviewer (who still seems to be in school) gave a very good overview of this film and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer has not seen this classic novel much higher than the 1989 BBC adaptation. The main problem I had with this (1999) version was casting Anthony Way into Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy triad who shot at fame after appearing in the TV mini series "The Choir". I can only assume that he was cast for Tom Long's role by his excellent actor "Cream". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choris" had grown up for a high and ganglical young time when "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed and as such Anthony does not convince school student Tom. It's too far from imagination to believe that Tom (like Anthony plays) as a friend with a much younger Hatty. In the BBC version of 1989, Tom and Hatty are much closer to their age and the development of their friendship is so much more plausible. Even for the 1999 film, even special effects cannot convince and there is no noticeable improvement in the 1989 TV effects. Casting and running this version is worse than the previous customization and the whole movie was not a shiny version of the real classic. Finally, I would like to point out that the BBC version of VHS 1989 picks up more than 20.00 pounds in second place, while the new DVD of this DVD can be bought for less than Â£ 5.00, do I have to say more?
