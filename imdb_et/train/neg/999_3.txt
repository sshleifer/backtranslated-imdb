I saw last night at the "Descent" film festival in Stockholm, and it was a big disappointment. Disappointing because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson's smaller intimate film was exciting and, being a fan of "rape / revenge" (sounds pervy, I am not!), I was unnecessary to say very curious to watch this movie . My conclusion: we stick with the classics! Yes, talk has potential, but dialogues are flat, actors are not convincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that this is the true image of the college in the United States, that the emptiness of the characters serves the purpose and all that jazz, but it makes the whole movie irrelevant. Just like the scene where Dawson is raped, it's not strong! I did not expect anything "irreversible" style, but do we not think we know him for compassion? I didn't. Not one minute, he was so flat all the way ;-) And I read that photography was impressive. Well, it is really good, but not a breakthrough. I have to admit that the screening of the festival was not so good that maybe I stayed here, but at the end of the movie I couldn't think, "I feel like watching Argento 'Inferno again. lol. Seriously, the club's first scene is beautiful and all but I had a bitter feeling watching a longer and more boring version of the scene from a dirty bar at the American-Canadian border on Lynch's Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me ... ... raw red and blue lighting, heavy bass music , general cool / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just couldn't get into this movie. Damage.
