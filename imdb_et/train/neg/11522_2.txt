First, the character of the title is not even the main character of the film. He's a cult leader sidekick. An actor depicting Igor believed that shouting out loud, hysterical laughing, and a smile on the curve, if getting into the eye would be a great way to scare people. Igor also had an irritating habit of yelling (because he never actually spoke) with a high voice. He would also say idiotic monolayers. For example, if a cult member murders one of his followers with the buzz, Igor sees it as "Paul! No Paul! Why did you do that? I could have cut it! now was his time to act. ‚ÄùIn addition to bad action, the end was not over, because when the story collects the little steam that is at the peak that Igor has with a crosshair and the rest of his girlfriends are killed, he appears twice more to kill the rest "Good guys." The film does not give it any explanation, but tells the viewer that Igor was escaping from the mental hospital.What does the bottom line do not waste its time watching this film. I wish I could get back the moments I lost.
