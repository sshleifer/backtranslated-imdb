The old man (Stephen Collins) gets pregnant by a single woman, Stella (Bette Midler). She gives her a commitment to marry, but she turns her down and decides to raise the child independently. Things go well until a child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) get worse. <br /> <br /> I've seen both the "Stella Dallas" quiet version and the sound version. Neither of them affected me much (and I cried easily), but they were well prepared when they were dated. Trying to do it in 1990, it was just a stupid idea. I think Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "beaches" to do that. It was (predictably) bombarded. The story is ridiculous and according to today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado are good results, this movie really strikes and I was finally bored. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in roles. Tough and dull. Really - who thought it would work? Instead, look at the 1937 Stanwycki version. I'll give it 1.
