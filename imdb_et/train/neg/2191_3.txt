The doctor who tries to complete the medical dream of transplantation secretly tests the body with different success from the hospital. His last best chance comes when he loves his girlfriend's head in his jacket when he rescues it from a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and with that assumption I found it. It has everything that bad filmmakers are looking for - chest and brain surgery with surgeons who leave pristine white crusts, unique camera angles (I always love the rear wheels of cars), cheesy clarinet stripper music, and one of the longer death scenes in film history. But, unfortunately, these so bad-on-good moments cannot overcome the extent of bad smells. <br /> <br /> Jan pounded me, his droning monologues jumping whispering, somewhat less than the evil laughter, and the fact that he was kept alive with some Columbia household appliances and 2 DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I was unable to attract myself even to Dr. Bill's terrible overpowering and moral self-awareness. Usually this kind of gift makes it necessary for me to see these films, in which case I was bored with it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best part of the movie was the 1960s 'body purchases' and I even found myself behind it. <br /> <br /> Don't spend that money - there are better bad movies to entertain your sick sense of humor.
