I watched this movie. The original Phantasm had such a wonderful atmosphere and mystery. Like many of the 70's horrors, it seemed to be a creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80s onwards, pumped the action, but retained this pleasant attention to the mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is just terrible. This explains all the strange events of the previous films, which rather reduces or expands their power. It shamelessly destroys the shapes of the first Phantasm, such as the cheap reenactment of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this film that they seem to be the orbit of household pests rather than threatening death. Hundreds hanging from the ceiling like Christmas balls that deepen the draft. Has anyone - the prop champion, the DP, the editor, the director - noticed or taken care of seeing them so harsh? Worse still, Phantasm III presents one sudden, uncomfortable joke after another. How is the intensity of the first film different? The original Phantasm used humor to relieve his ruthless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to make Reggie horniness countless cheap jokes: several refer to the "flying balls" ha-ha, oh, I get, balls. Maybe the team got out of these jokes, but they're with us.
