Finally, I watched this movie before the woman even wished to review any comments. I was just thinking about curiosity, let me know if there are people who want to watch another movie. I am quite shocked to find such long and positive comments on this website, which leads me to the conclusion that this is a fraud. <br /> <br /> When my opinion goes, I have to ask, "are these filmmakers slowing down or doing they expect the viewers to have slowed down?" The film is so cruel on so many levels and I'm not even talking about story or presentations. <br /> <br /> So, these bunch of boys and one girl (leader actor) make up a music band; I think that the constant presence of guitars should be the ROCK band. Hell, when did the dancers become part of the Rock band? Anyway, let me accept this as a Bollywood-version-of-a-rock band, but amusingly enough for all the points that were actually the two guitarists who made all kinds of "ROCK GESTURES" and I assume they're playing instruments, the guitar sound was completely lost !!! I just don't understand the size of stupidity here ... <br /> <br /> I just stop here because the film's further mistakes are not absolutely worth it. Bollywood leaders no longer ashamed !!!!!!!!
