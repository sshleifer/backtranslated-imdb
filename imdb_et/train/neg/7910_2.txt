I saw most of the "My Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC Film Festival in New York and I had to leave the theater because of the feelings of nausea that deepened in me. I've seen Bollywood movies and I've seen the saddles of Bollywood movies. This movie was unable to decide what it wanted to be, so it was fun for itself. <br /> <br /> It seems to be freely copied from movies like bride and prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and sloppy, lazy work. How can Bollywood ever wean from its determination to stick to over-exploited, well-run scripts? Isn't there anyone who could bring millions of real and exciting stories to the screen, which will surely exist and appear in a billion people? An intelligent automatic driver, a cow on the street, free scenes from foreign locations, meaningless scenes from Mumbai Streets, they're all there. Any possible Indian clich√© is included precisely. So it is woundingly predictable. ugh !!! The performances are weak, except for the talented and beautiful Neha Dubey. One wonder why he would choose such a project.
