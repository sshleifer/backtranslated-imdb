"Show me your boobs!" is not funny and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons when you understand where I come from. I don't want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think about it or hear it. I find it sad that Nick jumped this mess a lot and then we get the fools of little kids acting like stupid adults. I know it's meant to be humorous, but we think we have K and 1st grade sweet innocent girls who can't wait. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters don't look at it. I would like to block Nick, but there is no conscience at this point, but if Nick keeps this mess, I have to do it.
