EXTREMITIES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> Woman Turns Tables to Applicant When Confirming Attack at Her Home and Being Determined if he can kill or report to the police, in which case he can be released again and attacked. <br /> <br /> User fans who can expect another tougher rape fantasy WOMEN DAY (1978) style is almost certainly frustrated by EXTREMITIES. True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two uncomfortably long attacks before he gets to the attacker's upper arm (suitable rhinoceros James Russo), but the scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes until they discovered the dilemma that informs its production from the moral core. Would their final solution stay in court? Maybe ... <br /> <br /> Based on a play that left every actor in the play and bruised after the performance, the film does not attempt to open the narrative and instead relies on a limited set of basic activities. Acing and technical loans are good, although Fawcett's weak power cannot play effectively on viewers who could rely on him to give his outrageous outrage.
