The only thing that prevented the full disaster of this flick was a couple of interesting stylish touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Warning) Death comic is a little derivative of the Twilight Zone scene: a movie that gives death to the comic. Nonetheless, it was well addressed, especially looking at the ink being bleeding and the color slipping. <br /> <br /> There is also another good scene with a demon engine. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I was delighted that I was getting cheaper out of the DVD when I was out of the store because it was quite terrible. At the same time, I bought "Soul Survivors" and both films were the same excitement that you have always dreamed. However, when "soul workers" have nothing to redeem, or if it makes sense in some way, it had at least a few stylish notes referred to above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD lets you go to the 8 "nightmare" where something actually happens, the only way to watch it. Scripting between creative gore moments is quite intolerable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
