What the viewers mostly remember is the bad headache caused to them by the film due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera work and rapid confusion. I am not opposed to such stylistic devices as they have done correctly like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh with most of their films, but in that case WAY was too much. It seems the jumps and the light are blinking between every city in Mexico and every important scene to distract you from the fact that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily understand how the whole thing ends. In the case of a film that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is unforgivable that this story has been said so many times and more deeply and characteristically. This is the second disappointment of the movie. If I want to look over, I do not need any justification, but this film tried to justify the killing of Denzel Washington's character and badly failed incredible performances. The first half hour or something else will not happen, except that foolish archetypes and clich√©s are depicted, and if the machine starts rolling, it will be cut so quickly that you don't know what is really happening. So the film doesn't work on an incredible drama / thriller level or a pure action film. Of course, the movie is not as bad as some of the most frustrating blockers of recent years, but I don't understand why so many people say this movie is something fresh and so cool. It is too long for the video clip and the movie has too little content.
