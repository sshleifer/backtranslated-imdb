This is undoubtedly the worst film of Rajnikanth. The first part is with Goundama's firm comedy, but it is getting worse and worse and totally illogical. Our hero digs a similar name (Baba) in the saints through the horn and a completely flat one-liner. In the first half, Rajni has proclaimed his usual roller-riders and style, and in the second half he is almost holy after the beggar takes him through a multi-dimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (not the famous saints he previously heard). special powers without visible reason (except karma). It really has started to interest, isn't it? <br /> <br /> In the rest of the movie, he is wasting his magic and power and fighting politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable hilarious fun implementation. Oh and black magic never worked in the hero because he just happened to have him with Param Vir ... er .... Shakti Chakra. Bad guys and ordinary politicians are clich√©s, overworked and ultimately totally irrelevant because they're not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the shortcomings, it was fun to kill time with public-related Baba-bound liners and sweetheart. Its fun to watch others who are over the film are also bright. AR Rehman has said he has made his own movie stories through a mobile phone. The importance it has placed on it is very popular with Rhine in Japan and has included two characters of Japanese origin in this film (one of them called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) In its interest. But how they are portrayed, dressed and treated is completely pathetic. Japan can then see the Rhine movies. This film was probably the Rhine advertising material that entered politics, but the results of the film itself would have killed some of its political dreams. <br /> </p>
