I'm not rating this movie, it's not worth it. I just looked at it because I'm a fan of Pfieffer. I love her and look at something she did. Even this scam is not disappointed. In every scene he was in, he looked at the viewer ... waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing was ever done. It had some good stories, but they ended sharply as it started. Some of the other characters were potential, but it didn't get anything. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when he made this film and his most beautiful. The wardrobe and the set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can mostly watch and rarely see a movie that I can't find, but it was bad. I do not understand. The worst thing was, at the end, he had a big rock strap. It was the end scene that woke you up and said that the movie was finally in some place, then in the credit roll. Good mourning. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and looked at how my cat would have been more exciting to eat. Well said. In fact, this comment was more entertaining than the movie, because it summarizes it so well. I lost it dud.dud.dud.99 cents.
