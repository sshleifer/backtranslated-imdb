... and Ethel Merman also loves his loud, bossy vocal, like the evil witch Mombi, but this cartoon sequel "The Wizard Of Oz" is a real imagination, replacing fantasy and excitement with noisy action like a bad music video). Little Dorothy is thrown back to Oz, which has destroyed and meets old and new friends. Intense animation is stuck between the less-inspired exhibitions of the weakest Walt Disney and Hanna-Barbera, although many songs are good, especially Dorothy's sweet "This is far from the land", which Liza Minnelli performs perfectly. You can count on Minnell for energy, so the movie always happens when Dorothy is around. Much of this is unmemorable, and I'm not even sure that baby boomers will be rewarded for this because it has been in circulation for so long. Like curiosity, just fair. ** from ****
