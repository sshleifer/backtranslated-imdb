This is probably the worst Christmas movie. The plot is practically non-existent, the acting (especially Affleck) is at best bad. Ben Affleck's fans will probably protect this movie, but they have to agree deeply. As far as I could collect, a plot of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, said to go to a place that reminds him of childhood and burns a list of things he wanted to forget about his childhood. In doing so, he will pay the family who is currently living for his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film goes on and finally he gets with his family's daughter .... blah blah blah.
