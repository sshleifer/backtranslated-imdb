This "film" has no reason to waste time. The original said it all and still keeps up. Read a book or create a research, and you realize that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! Having been in Holcomb & Edgerton, KS, where the story goes, the kits and places were NOT like Kansas. The original is riveting, from filming to the actual use of the actors, weapons and victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Quincy Jones Soundtrack and Conrad Hall Cinema ... The original is now available on a widescreen DVD. Let this turkey die quickly.
