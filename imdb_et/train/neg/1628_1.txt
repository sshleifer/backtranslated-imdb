Without questioning, one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s seems to be GAOTS really, I really want to be something important. The tragic truth is that at every level it is so worthless that it can't help but laugh. In despair of the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, it reaches the city for a couple of days in the wilderness ... they walk through a shady road, everywhere as torture as the US. Berkeley coffee clock. Almost every row of tarradiddle dialogue offered here is extremely bad ("I feel that life itself is made up of so many little pomegranates ... but it's so beautiful?") After what seems to be absolutely something eternal happens (well ... OK ... we are being treated with a naked and gentle soft sex scene), there is finally a very controversial confrontation that involves a couple of Nam-Vets, who make a scene of nature and play a pretty tough folk. with acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> EVERYTHING FILM doesn't happen to be eventful or interesting. I thought Larry Buchanan's picture "Strawberry Needs Rain" was a weak example of Bergman's respect. "Golden Apples" are all just as bad, but what it offers makes it memorable. 1/10
