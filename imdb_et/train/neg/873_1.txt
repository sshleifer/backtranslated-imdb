The executive, who is very successful in his working life, but who is unable to come into contact with his familiar life, is the birth of a son who escaped from his place of residence. Both characters feel very alone and probably less intelligent shows the executive beauty of small things in life ... With that argument, somehow with an Amelie-like atmosphere and sentimental music, I didn't expect, but a moral nasty film. Anyway, because there were interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes a rather violent man) and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne was very good, I decided to watch the movie. In general, the French cinema is able to show something that seems quite alive to life, not against a stereotyped American cinema. But it is a disappointment to see after the absurd end, the boy's impossible death, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive family, the cheap morality, the intolerable laughter of the daughters, the man in the sky like Michael Landon ... Really disgusting in my humble opinion.
