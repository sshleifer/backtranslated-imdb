This is by far one of the most boring and terrible examples of Adolf Hitler's first days I've ever watched. Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but when he casts Hitler, it's just wrong. To cast Liev Schrieber, like Hitler's long-standing friend and help, Haefengstal must give desperation and anguish to Simon Wiesenthal's center. J-W plays a Nazi supporter, a bad bad casting. It was not a pleasant family film with a good historical background. It was Hollywood garbage in its best cases, with the support of strong (but seriously unconscious) support, which showed that they had all been lost from the radar over the last 5 years, but disappeared. <br /> <br /> Counterfeit German accents (water wax vin zis var) offend German residents everywhere. My mother is German and she was sitting in the smoke with a voice that stood from the same sentence from American / English / German. A strong mold makes the right cardboard cut out at the local video store than on the screen. Jenna Malone, like the fatal Geli Raubal, was great, she found the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who finally ended her life in order to escape her future in the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you want a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate overview of the early years of Hitler's war / holocaust, rent "Inside the Third Reich" in 1983 as starring Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and more meaningful than it was balanced. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you that it has come to my books to confirm my many inaccuracies.
