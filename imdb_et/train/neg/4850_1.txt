Some unrealistic movie boilers are included. <br /> <br /> Based on real life experiences, this film continued to frustrate from the start. I am currently using my second tour of Iraq as an infantry man. This movie has nothing to happen in real events. Naming a name from the beginning: a bomb trolley, EOD elements that carry solo without escorts, EOD staff slipping from VBC, having sleeves rolled all the time in ACUs, where I had to call it a 2 dollar haircut, a sniper scene. The list would continue, but there is no need to list the things that happen wrong with a two-minute period before more things were wrong; this movie is made. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people and critics who cannot be understood or experienced with deployment or military. <br /> <br /> People with military background or knowledge are disappointed by the army's inaccuracy.
