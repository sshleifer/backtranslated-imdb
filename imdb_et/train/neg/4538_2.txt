I went to see it in the movie theater, but what is the waste of time and money! Bad action, I'm sorry it didn't help to enjoy this rather sticky scenario. very strongly in the scenario. They had really enjoyed the book, so the film had to be perfect. Maybe I had my hopes a little too high, but I hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet to the point that I actually left that I had to vomit and the worst was the sequel! Make the world a favor and stop this terrible crusade.
