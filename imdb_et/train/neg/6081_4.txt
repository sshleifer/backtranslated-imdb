Typical 70s Italian movie, original and good music came, but with some fraud, interesting but not fantastic photography, poor and sometimes confusing story (eg the role of a wolf dog and where the boy comes from?) A bad dialogue, a nice atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The reason why it is still (relatively) well known and desirable is apparently naked scenes (including typical 70s pseudo-sex) with 11 and 13-year-old girls with an older teenage (Eva Ionesco) and Laura Wendel) - From a socio-political point of view, it is interesting to see how these very young representations of young people were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the US) 30 years ago, now that it is more than taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the bullying of one of the girls (Laura) by the other two characters and the discovery of her sex, with a pretty accurate teenage image. The nature of Eva (Silvia) does not change to the end of the film and it seems to be very familiar with the erotic art - she has no "aging": she is a very useless young girl who is already aware of her sexual charms, but ultimately it is used and the movie that cries like a little girl she really is. The boy is a completely despicable bully, while Laura is a very naive and weak victim.
