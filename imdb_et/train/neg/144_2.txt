It is not possible to describe how really, really bad this film is. It's a shame that I actually sat on this movie, its a very tiring and predictable movie. What's wrong? Action: There is no performance that is even close to even the minimum parameter (atleast all of them are very beautiful). Soundtrack (songs): "When we get on Orgy's soundtrack, everyone knows they're watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack: Okay, but someone with a keyboard can make a sound these days. Don't even start with "What the hell?" moments, here are some: Killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens the actor's turns, no one is there, turns back, there's something sitting in front of him. Now that the killer looks like a high power drill, it's really great! The filmmakers will score points at least to connect it, but can I really believe the killer took the time to find the socket to turn it on. Where did you get the cages? "I could go on and how bad this movie is, but I only have 1000 words. I give it from 2 out of ten stars. One letter that made me laugh and split the whole star. Seriously, don't waste your time with it.
