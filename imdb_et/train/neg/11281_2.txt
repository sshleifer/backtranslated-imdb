I've given this star a high rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in the movie in 42 and 43 minutes. In this scene, the film director offered me an immortal line - "$ 50..to drink and talk", but I felt that my Polish side could speak more convincingly on the Russian accent than I could, so I refused to talk about it. I was a little starstruck because it was my first film experience .... and who knows that these lines would have come in, like "I'll be back" and "quite honestly my dear, I won't give the fuck." to one line, my name would appear as Rancid Aluminum credits as "Heavy 1" instead of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> As time goes by, I find myself happy that my name is in no way related to this film. <br /> <br /> Though I spent the whole day in a pack, Barry Island in South Wales, no one could tell me what the real story was. All the catering companies and the wardrobe agreed that there seemed to be a lot of passion and nudity ... ... things would have been worse than I was naked in this most horrifying movie .... <br /> <br /> Still .. ... On the positive side ... I could talk to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, because "Notting Hill" was still free, and not rushing to be a Welsh. Various inappropriate comments were made about what the terrible pit Barry Island had received since my childhood visits in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed that I realized I had quality production ........
