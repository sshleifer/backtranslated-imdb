This exhibition proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of valuable DVR hard disk space. I didn't expect much and I actually got less. I don't expect the second episode to cancel this show, I can't believe Geico will ever try to use the Cavemen advertising campaign EVER again. I would have preferred to spend the evening checking the head of my daughter's head when looking at this garbage. I don't know what ABC passed on to fit the '07 autumn timing, perhaps a hospital / crime / documentary reality show that includes an AFLAC party? If I did not express my opinion on this exhibition, let me be clear and say it is not too good.
