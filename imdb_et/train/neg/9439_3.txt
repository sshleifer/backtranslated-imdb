Twist endings can be really cool in the movie. It is especially interesting when the twist is in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention. These types of twists are the ones that make people think. Then we have such films as this movie. Turns it out if you don't pay attention to whether you have a clue what will happen. If they reveal such a random twist, then instead of shock it is a somewhat silly reaction. This movie begins as it is an interesting frightening, but after about 20 minutes it is nothing but a boring dialogue and a stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Three young women attend a concert, so they get lost in the woods and hit the wood chamber. They arrive at an old horrible house that hates men and is welcomed by his home-grown daughter, Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange events happen because these girls stay in this house for several days, instead of trying to leave or get home, and the mid-term review progresses foolishly. <br /> <br /> This movie is in too much dialogue, and it's always just a few characters. We have the main three girls, the horrible spinster and the old lady, and any conversation of any importance goes no further than these five. Even worse, they never have anything to say. It's actually quite crazy about these conversations. We want to know what's going on, and they just talk and talk and talk (nothing). The house where these girls stay when they get into their car accident is probably three miles everywhere ... wow, three miles! Two hours or less to walk them kills. Why didn't they get to the household that drove into the city? Was he single? How do these girls ever question their departure and just want to stay, rarely even on each other? Why did it have to so much fool? Maybe the answers are boring script. <br /> <br /> A five-character movie is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary and the end is definitely there, but no doubt stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out ****. 79 minutes. R nudity and violence.
