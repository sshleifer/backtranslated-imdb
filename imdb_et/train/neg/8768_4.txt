Now please do not call me "unpatriotic", "weirdo" and more. <br /> <br /> The length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake. No editing at all seems like it seems like J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much. Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was fun and gave a message. <br /> <br /> It is based on real incidents and real people. Kudos to this, but were recurring war scenes really necessary? In addition, the focus continually shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to follow them all. There were shy conversations. In the beginning, it gave some relief to violence, but later it became so monotonous that it could even correctly predict the nature of the impending talk. do not know that the enemy was somewhere near? And when they were shot, he caused compassion, but it seemed to them not so safe that it would be so harsh first. </p>. It is better to listen to them rather than the movie. <br /> <br /> Action was a rescue arm: from experienced veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to relative beginners like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone acted like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve special attention when it comes to lightening the mood. <br /> <br /> Dialogues ranged from brilliant ("Madhurist .. with Love!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). And an exploding viper of all MCs, BC, Cs and F was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil is trying to offer a respectable respect to the brave Indian soldiers, but is trying too hard and ultimately fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve better respect.
