Ah, Lucio Fulci, peace. This infamous Italian is the most well-known "Zombie" and absolutely invisible "The <br /> <br /> Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby". Well, add it without a list <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it was, touches a woman wearing gold <br /> <br /> mask and G-string. He wants a young dubbed power with a number of magical arrows and bow. They are magical because they glow. Daddy with the crew with a bad wig, <br /> <br /> and spend most of the movie saving the flat <br /> <br /> action sequences. In the end, they are killed by the chick, but not before taking the mask and reminding me why I broke my high school girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Fulci baths every orange glow and fills the screen with smoke. Nothing is a smoky orange action to crave Sunny Delight and a cigarette. Special effects are ridiculous. In one order, our ambiguous gay duo attacks dozens of arrows that are obviously scratching on the film <br /> <br />. Most of the budget impact has to be spent on Fulci-licious gore, which consists entirely of spurt. <br /> <br /> Wounds. Hey, we can all use a good spinning ring, but while getting into the wounds, it's boring. <br /> <br /> I had to play setting my TV's brightness anyway <br /> <br /> just to see what the hell happened. <br /> <br /> There are many talks about filling dots and prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> look at the future ... if you find and watch this movie, <br /> <br /> you regret it. The scene in the Video box does not show any context in the movie. "Conquest" is a job offer <br /> <br />. What MST3K could have done! <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong women, women <br /> <br /> nudity, short men's nudity, and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
