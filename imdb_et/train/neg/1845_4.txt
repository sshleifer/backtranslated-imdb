Losing Control is another offering of the erotic thriller genre that could be considered a film world cellulose fiction. They usually include a ring road with a lawn intention that is confusing with many frustrations. This is not a complaint, especially if it is done by stunningly beautiful women who always live in this incredible world. Just by chance (or?) He meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who deals with him with ever more risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim firmly refuses to end the matter. His representative Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks she is doing a miracle about selling her books. Like most movies of this type, the rash is coming to an end, but some things don't add up. I've seen enough of that kind of movie to think about, there's no change - but I like them. They are so weak. <br /> <br /> Cast castings are different. Doug Jeffery wears a movie as a psycho / sociopath you don't want to overcome. Kira Reed looks good but can't convince a woman to be in danger. Clay Greenbush as PI did not convince either. <br /> <br /> Finally, carefully note the DVD you are watching. Both the cover and the disc indicate the R-value and the driving time is 93 minutes, but the operating time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why sexual scenes have been truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is short as it begins. 4 stars.
