This movie includes two of my favorite shows in Kilmer and Downey. In addition, it is always a pleasant part of Larry Miller. Nevertheless, I found it almost unobtrusive. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty nice, but she is almost free of charisma and Downey's character obsession with her character is not at all understandable what the film presents or how it is portrayed. The end seems cautious and although it seems that the audience should join the film with an arrow and eye, it has not brought us to our main characters, leaving us unwanted or impossible to do so. The movie fans say that those who simply disagree "don't get it". I don't think this is the case. The plot was neither complicated nor understandable. It was just gripping and cumbersome and probably made. I got it. I just didn't like it. Paddy Breathnachi "I Went Down" and Guy Ritchie "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" are much more realistic examples of what filmmaker Shane Black is not able to achieve. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but a look at her credits (mostly as a scriptwriter) makes me want to separate from the rest of the community.
