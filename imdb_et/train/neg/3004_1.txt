What a terrible movie. Action was bad, the pace was bad, cinematography was bad, management was bad, "special" effects were bad. You look a little bad, but even the killings were bad. <br /> <br /> First, a past event that created a killing motive lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of it and explained what happened well. <br /> <br /> The victims were then called "reunited" in an abandoned school where all utilities were turned on. One of the victims thought it was a bit strange, but they left it back and decided to break anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the killings were so fake that they were virtually unnoticeable. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie if you don't want to see some breasts and not very good breasts. This film makes Showgirl virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
