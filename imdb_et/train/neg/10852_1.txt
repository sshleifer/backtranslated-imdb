This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, the actor is ... Well Dani, stay singing or shouting or whatever hell it is. Random chicks, who hardly carry anything, are just catching sexually deceived Gothic boys. Personally, I think this movie sucks. The story and the characters could be very good, say, leadership, actors and other small nibby things were better. But the film is just a bad one, the only reason why people make such a piece of nonsense because it's Danni. This movie is probably the worst B-speed movie. Believe me, which is hard to achieve, especially if you compete for Def's Temptation and over the "serious" horror movies of nervous excuses. I'm not a CoF fan, and I just see it in another rubbish ... Really bad. When Dani did it for comedy, he would do well. Very well done. Nonetheless, I find it low because it is crazy. See if you are happy, happy, happy, in joyful mode so you can laugh at everything or if you are high on many different medicines.
