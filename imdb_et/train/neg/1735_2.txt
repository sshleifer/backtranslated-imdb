I have the feeling that the producers of this mess made the most painful, ridiculous West. "PAINFUL" is the best word I mean to describe it. <br /> <br /> The plus side has nice color photography and a beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played a scratch) who acted in a disruptive role and was so brutally written that no actor could do a good job. Production values ​​were quite good, which only helped to highlight the terrible story and scenario. <br /> <br /> The things I hated: Stewart Granger seemed as little as a western glimpse of his British accent, clean custom clothing, and a stupid, whitish whitish candle that was tied around his neck. It became tiring of how the townspeople and his son continually interrupted and defeated Granger and did not speak or reply. I know we need to stop beliefs and appreciate the West as a symbolic moral play, but it created its incantation with ridiculously unrealistic and predictable scenes. pass that bad boy's flock goes through, and then Granger sits in perfect places so he can shoot the dynamite very far to create rock pieces to bury and punish herds and bad guys, seemingly destroying them all. two main bad guys. The next worst is everything about a plot loaded with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the film seemed plausible: I couldn't believe the whole conflict. The bad guy drove his cattle to the market and wanted the cows to chew on the road; I do not understand why nothing could have been developed. Does this require land ownership? Don't bother to see it.
