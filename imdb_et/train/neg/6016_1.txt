This film, which appeared directly on the video, must contain a warning sign that it is dangerous to human health and may be boring for the viewer. This is another thinly hidden, evangelizing "rapture" religious film in which good guys (believers) suddenly disappear and bad guys (disbelievers) are left behind. This is an interesting concept, especially since we see that this happens to a non-believer who has a sin with a stewardess on board (there is no need to say that the sinner does not disappear!). Fortunately, all the pilots were disloyal, the plane did not fall, or the film would have been in love. Although it might have been interesting without a strong religious attack, a complete film makes one act of the movie, it is terrible and obviously computer-generated simulations are very counterfeit. Plus this is another movie that has been filmed in Canada to be in New York City. Free me ... I read the Bible.
