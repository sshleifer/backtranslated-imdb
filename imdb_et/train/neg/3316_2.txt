It was the first movie by Ewan McGregor I ever saw outside of Star Wars. Since then I have become a great fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can't forgive this movie. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen and that's why I have Emma been one of those classics. I've always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. But after this terrible transfer I was forced to admit that the original Emma was pleasant and charming. Ewan McGregor does not offer almost any purpose in this film after they have taken part in Frank Churchill's cages and violated. Gweneth Paltrow is already ridiculous, and the rest of the film is unnoticeable and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation for anyone interested in English is going to go to the originals. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor ... then believe me, skipping this movie, you haven't taken anything off, just five minutes from the group with a silly hat and bad hair.
