It's 1978, and yes, there are probably too many black players in teams! Fans are disturbed and 75,000 seats are full, but less fortunate to have so many black players in the field! It's made for the TV Super Bowl movie to be watched. This is not much more, but it is really surprising for the talented actors who make the appearance (by the time), probably the most Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, the screen says all the goodness of Selleck, such as "Dick Butkus", "fast". <br /> <br /> This is a silly story about super bowl betting. "New York" (read the mafia) accuses PJ Jackson of ending the game in their favor, in this case a $ 10,000,000 stake. The PJ is innocent and seems to be loose, buying some people here and there. But things look different from him. Another person, no doubt Lainie, takes responsibility. After a while, the mystery of the murders is not certain, but it is more apparent in the final murder that Lainie is a new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it's traceable. Operation is fine and filming is OK. At least there were no stupid typical 70s car rides (they are not just here). Just remember the past stereotypes and the cocaine era, and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
