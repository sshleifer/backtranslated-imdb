Theatrical publications of the 1970s show that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become the key to legendary proportions of cinematic lows. Finally, in an unexpectedly beautiful package on a DVD, it is unlikely today to win a wide audience, as it was when it was first released. <br /> <br /> Gore Vidal's bestseller of 1968 was a dark satirical statement. Most filmmakers found that the novel's story, structure, and overall tone did not turn into film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th-century Fox acquired not only rights but also hired Vidal to adapt their novel to the screen. But the studio's leaders were soon cold: Vidal's adjustments were repeatedly rejected and the novice writer-director Michael Sarne was brought to the screen. <br /> <br /> Studio executives hoped that Sarne would enter the youth market as they saw the film as a target, but Sarne proved to be even more than sync as the leaders themselves. After rewriting, it was rewritten. The cast, sensitive disaster became more and more fighting. In his DVD commentary, Raquel Welch says he rarely has any idea of ​​what Myra's motives were from the scene to the scene or even any particular scene, and that each person concerned seemed to be a completely different film. In the "Back Story" documentary, Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a number of people who hid in their changing rooms, waiting for their lawyers to return their calls. <br /> <br /> The film itself proves these comments. The basics of Vidal's story are there, but not only the story has been reflected in all the wider influences, but it seems to make no sense in itself. Everything runs in many directions, nothing connects and numerous scenes are down, regardless of previous scenes. And while director Sarne repeatedly remarks in his commentary that he wants to make the film a pure farce, the only laughs have been random. <br /> <br /> These accidents are headed by Mae West. It is true that there is an unexpectedly well-preserved appearance in the West and that he has not lost his way with a single liner, but cannot overcome the fact that he is in his seventies and his conviction that he is still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely confusing , saying. But worse, West is beyond his age. His attempts to translate himself into a hip and eventual place will bring about one of the most embarrassing self-infirmities ever seen in the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is largely wasted. Significantly underrated actor Raquel Welch plays the role of Myra as a Barbie doll for steroids; non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in Myron's role, but the whole role is essentially pointless. John Huston and the comedian John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper and Andy Devine alone appear relatively unsuccessful. Yes, indeed, all the participants in the movie feared it would be: fast, if it should be slow, slow, if it should be fast, relentless from start to finish. It is true that the director Sarne has a randomly inspired idea - as she used every movie clip from Shirley's temple to Judy Garland to create a counterpoint to the action, but in general, when Sarne was given the choice to do something she seems to have done wrong. <br /> <br /> How and why it's made clear in Sarne's audio commentary. Sarne didn't like the novel or the subject in general. He didn't want to write a scenario, but he needed money; he didn't want to direct the movie, but he needs money. He makes it very clear that he did not like the author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he definitely says Reed is not a nice person), and he still finds that Vidal and Reed worked to sabotage the film because he refused to play his "homosexual" in the action plan, which seems to be their wish that Sarne filming Vidal's novel rather than her strangely portrayed start. <br /> <br /> Although he spends a lot of commentary time, confirming that the film is widely known by the gay community, Sarne never realizes that the appealing homosexual audience of the film is having a ridiculously inaccurate portrayal of homosexual people. When the film is taken with the film, Sarne appears more than a little homophobic - and frankly, it is one of the worst choices of writers and directors that could have been done for this project. <br /> <br /> In addition, Sarne and Welch's comments and documentary, the DVD edition contain several trailers and two versions of the movie: the "theatrical release" version and the "restored" version. The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the "restored" version is printed in black and white. The changes made before the release of the film were not restored, but the documentary details they had. Both widescreen transmissions are very good and the sound is pretty good. But to finish where I started, this is the film that is most interested in film historians, movie enthusiasts and fans of the film. I'll give her three of the five stars alone, but everyone else should pass it on. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
