This film was disappointing. Waiting for a good movie. I'm the person who starts the movie and doesn't turn it to the end, but I forced myself to not turn off. <br /> <br /> The reason I didn't turn it on was that I was a big fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see him. After watching the movie, I was very speechless. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Thank you to Christian Slater for putting this humor on it. If you weren't in this movie, I would be bored in my mind. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins must act. By the time the movie ended, I didn't even get a plot. I was so confused and annoyed.
