Animal husbandry (1954) was very good about the dangers of totalitarianism. If the good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are unknown or dominate the iron with a fist and an empty head. Unfortunately, this movie is neither of them. What we have shown is a piece of propaganda that has a lot of fingerprints and shows. Animation and direction were good in terms of budget and time, but George Orwell's novel is very short. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how novel or are only interested in customizing this brilliant novel, but with all the tools. I found it somewhat mediocre. But only one man's opinion. <br /> <br /> Transformation is below, but not much.
