I saw it when I first released the movie. The memory of how bad it has been has been with me for almost forty years. I didn't want to trust the feelings of my film when I saw it, so I consulted the review of the film published in the larger capital newspaper the next day, stating that the reviewer wrote that the film was inconsistent, unclear, and endless. Few studies show that the producer was the star of Leslie Caron's wife, so the whip of nepotism refers to this terrible film. The list of many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking - shows, among other things, that he has a promise. But the death of this film is due to his terrible scenario. The "mystery", which is linked, is so hidden and so little visible throughout the film that the viewer is left confused by the scene. The film seems to be between the detective's understanding and the thriller of espionage, but never going to one or the other. The separation is completely inadequate. The main characters live in a dry, emotional type that does not create any empathy. Film art is a pedestrian. The result is that an unhappy viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and finally the movie. I'm a little surprised that this pathetic version of the movie can't be bought. I hope that if TCM finds the printing of this movie and forcibly airs it is safely placed at 4:00 in the slot.
