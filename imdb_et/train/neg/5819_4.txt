This is the story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. Parents are divorced and the mother stays back in the house east. Father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California and moves around Beverly Hills to get his children the best education. <br /> <br /> Things that really joke when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece lives with a group. <br /> <br /> The film discusses the family's various adventures that are complex with the wealthy neighborhood drug scene. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter sounds like a woman who wants Murray to move with her because she wants a companion. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno are coming to an end. They play according to Murray's brother and sister-in-law; they are also Tome's parents. In front of the children, Reiner reminds Murray that he has paid all bills for them. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a sour note, as the embarrassing family moves out of their fiction and takes Beverly Hills to drive their car. I think the film is about promoting independence and good old self-esteem.
