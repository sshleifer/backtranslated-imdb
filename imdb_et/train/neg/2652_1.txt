I can't believe we looked at this complete crap, but we did and I feel obliged to warn others to avoid it at all costs. If one of the main characters reports that he or she is homosexual twice in the first five minutes, do not ignore it as a typical PC-nonsense and draw that it should become better because it is not. If his fagotty boy hanging around him doesn't make you sick, be grateful that this freak wrote and / or led this somewhat restriction to this temptation. I mean, get real. It is one thing that the film would show such screwed times as gay, but quite another, that it would be constantly screened and examined closely and personally if the comments of the liners clearly show that the flip should be about a mother who is looking for some "closure" of her daughter for sudden death. What does one thing do to another can be tempted to ask? Obviously, these two issues are inextricably linked. And if it wasn't bad enough, the ice cream parlor is a bearded lady. I mean seriously, has this poor woman ever heard of electrolysis? Why does he have to go as such? At the very least, the shaving of foolish things is gone, and if you are there, these terrible moles are removed. Would you let the ice cream you just served? I don't think so. It must be a New Jersey affair. <br /> <br /> You think Diane Keaton can save this drek, but think again. Did he really try to place a lipstick? I don't even want to think about it. What if the body had to be his dead daughter. This grotesque apology for the cinema has come out of the word and it's all there. One wants all these characters to just walk in the waves and just go on. None of these fluffy people will have compassion for a moment. Trust me - let this piece hit you. It does not mean death, a mother who inadvertently smothered her daughter, or even other, much more unpleasant questions that she raises, no matter how little you want to hear it. This is a mistaken and talented director of a perverted trash load.
