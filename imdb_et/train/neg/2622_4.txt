102 Dalmatians (2000, dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> It is thought that Cruella de Vil (Close) will be released from prison and try to start life. Things are going well for Cruella, who is busy with homeless dogs on the street. When Big Ben strikes, things get bad. Hypnotic treatment is the opposite, and Cruella is back, and this time she has decided to do the spotty coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close repeats his role in Cruella de Vilina and is again a movie. Every scene that comes with it is a boring sequel, rather than repeating a previous movie rather than a new story. <br /> <br /> He has changed. ? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
