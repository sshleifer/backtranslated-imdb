As others have pointed out, it should have been a great Hammer-style movie, and it seems to me that most of the actors have told me to play it ... but the scenario is so leading, poorly working and full of blunt soliloquies (the poor Timothy Dalton is exhausted most of them) that it is too excessive and in itself important. This is the atypical weakness of Dalton, although he quietly reaches the climate where Dr. Rock finally understands what he has done. The only actor who really pulls out is Patrick Stewart, who is the most welcome vision. Freddie Francis may be a great operator, but he was a terrible director.
