Who, with the right mind, plays the lyrical song while they represent an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper comes into contact with his dressed husband in a dressing room, the lyrical song is similar to the song, so no one can listen or loose any emotional influence that the scene may have. Annabella's scenes, which her father beats with his fist, with a lamp and then with a seat belt, were so cartoon that it would be absurd. This whole movie is a comic, the rampant bias against white is literally amazing. The discussion of black women after the discovery of a fold woman explains that she has been deceived by a white woman - as discussions in the Oxford discussion team are ridiculous. Powerful racism can be tolerated, but mixing the soundtrack and sound during this movie is too much. It was a technically poorly made film. There is no understanding of the basic art of making a film, the soundtrack, editing, and the desperate endeavor that big players are trying to keep this movie. I was really sorry for Anthony Quinn, I wondered why he had played a role in this flick - his appearance is painful. This is the first film I saw about this director and this is my last one.
