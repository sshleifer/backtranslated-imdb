Certainly, Michael Madsen has a strange debut. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic master whose life is shattering around him. Cecil grabs the phonebook, looks at the name of the preacher and invites him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to honor God's word and has Jesus in his heart. This will make everything better. Ahh ... if only everything in life was so easy. The fact that this "film" looks like it was about $ 500 would definitely not help. 1/10
