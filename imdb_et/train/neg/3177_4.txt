I have to admit that over his dead body wasn't really as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I thought I'd go and look at my eyes, but it wasn't really too bad. I was just waiting for this terrible movie, but it seems the writers didn't mean any harm, but Eva Longoria's casting (Parker, sorry) she seems a bit behind the film. I think I can be a little better without him, just he's upset with me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat pleasant. But you have to admit that this film didn't make any sense, it was one of those quick proofs of an actor-type thing. The film could have been funny if someone had really paid attention to it and it would be better to cast it. <br /> <br /> Henry just lost his bride, Kate, who was killed on ice day on her wedding day. But when his sister takes him to the psyche, Ashley, Henry falls to him, but Kate haunts him beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so fast, and he would make sure Ashley can't torture her day and night at night, believe me, Kate's voice, it's scary. <br /> Over his dead body is the right movie, not sure if it's worth the money, but I'd give you the rent if you want to see it or be curious. Eva Longorial is not just enough to work on a movie, not to offend those who love her, she just falls over a small screen over a silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's character, he still does not seem to be too pleasant when he pulls everything out, or his "gay" friend Dan, as if it is not really pleasant. Simply rewriting and paying attention to this film would have been better, but instead we get an average predictable romantic comedy that leaves an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
