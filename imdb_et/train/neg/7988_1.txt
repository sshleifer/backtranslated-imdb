Anita and I seem to be more than an excuse for the author of the novel and scenario, Meera Syal, to encourage her prejudices, complaints and general reluctance against English. The overall general mood of this movie in English in this movie is a mistake. Racist, ugly, eating bad food, and dimly bright - only by turning to Indian culture can a local priest redeem at the end of the movie. In contrast, the Indian family is beautiful, smart, educated, can speak many languages, caring and loving parents and grammar feeds. The film is so insidious that I am surprised that the BBC has financed it at all. If it were the other way around, the Indian family depicted in this way would see an English family, the film would be considered racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments where my brow was still worn on my forehead. I thought it would bring me to my hairline. First, the rumor between women in Dival's solemnity - subtext: English is dirty and buggy - and men - under the text: English women are prostitutes. Secondly, eating Anita, where Neema's family lies about her cutlery - subtitle: English is so stupid, you can do something about it. <br /> <br /> But the underlying contempt is something English - even English weddings are an object of intimidation - it is visible throughout the film. Anita's character was pulled so terribly - almost a fallen woman's rope - that I finished the movie's anger. <br /> <br /> It's not "Beckham-like", where humor focuses on love exaggerating community behavior and practices from this community, and it's a movie about two girls from different backgrounds. Instead, Anita and Me seem to see the cultural form of apartheid as inevitable, because English is the version of an almost untouched box in India, which is also underlined by the thin-film attacks on the "other" community in the English language. <br /> <br /> I felt that Anita and I were hateful, complaint-based. On this basis, the BBC would not have had to finance its production.
