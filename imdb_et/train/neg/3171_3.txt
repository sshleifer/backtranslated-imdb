Was it the biggest movie I've ever seen? Was it the worst? No. <br /> <br /> The mother of four is nice to look at something that was light and fun. It was nice, but it was lovely. level of abuse. Of course, they don't care about Eva Longoria. I think he was better than Saint Martin. I think films are an issue of opinion. Participants play a major role in whether it is a hit or a flop. Maybe there were too many things. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to talk about an average movie, not a dreadful one. It may just be a chick flick. Similar to The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband talks about them. :)
