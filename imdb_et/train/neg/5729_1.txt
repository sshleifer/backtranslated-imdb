It must be a WORST movie ever !!! Acting is sparser from the movie. A lot of blood, but don't know where it comes from, cuz they don't even show cuts. I can't believe I'm wasting my time while watching this movie. We laughed as we looked at comedy and not horror. It's shameful for horror movies !!! For one, if they are in Asia, why is there a white policeman who drives the waste disposal bin? There are so many other languages ​​that you don't even know what's going on in half the time. Editing a movie is a joke, my teenager could do better. And when I went to the cinema and this nasty old man worked on a window that would be the first clue. DO NOT ATTENTION THIS MOVEMENT !!! HOW DO NOT HOW YOU ARE YOU!
