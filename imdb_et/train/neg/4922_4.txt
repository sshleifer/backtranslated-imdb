DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that was constantly shown on Sky Movies in the UK and since it seemed to have been reviewed about three times a week throughout the year, I have no idea how I managed to miss it until it is the first online broadcast television today. In fact, I saw that I wasn't much of a fan of horror, probably because of my theory that it was a disgrace. My theory turned out to be a big part of <br /> <br /> !!!!! MY SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of twilight scripts involved. For example, at the beginning of the film, the bad guys from London go to the American Dracula coffin (in a twin-engine turbo-proportion!) And one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo area where Dracula lives. The fight is interrupted, there is a lot of noise, but the cockpit does not listen until the script requires it. At this peak of the segment, it also appears that Dracula can save you money, but it seems forgotten as the movie progresses. Sloppy scripting and also seems to have a problem with the structure where there are numerous characters in the New Orleans mardi gras where the characters are located in a different location than the police station on the next scene. at mardi gras scene after that means there is no credibility to the plot being enhanced <br /> <br /> There`s something else that yanked my chain - product placement. There are ten scenes in which the logo of a certain recording mark / retail chain is in full view. I dare not disclose a company trademark (except that they also run a train association that is a national joke in the UK), but I had the impression that such advertising was against British broadcasters and I am surprised by the BBC if this is the case <br /> <br /> DRACULA 2000 has some positive ones, such as visuals. It's actually a good-looking movie with a good look and boys were hot vampires, but that's something we should expect from Hollywood in recent years - a very good looking movie that's very stupid
