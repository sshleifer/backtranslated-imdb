I agree with most, if not all, previous comments with Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoich series is an excellent character training combined with great sword fighting and excitement. <br /> <br /> I've seen Zatoichit 1-13,15,16; I believe that 14 is not released in zone 1 (usa). Zatoichi Outlaw was disappointing. The story was complicated and seemed like many of the earlier Zatoich stories. At one point I was wondering if I could see the previous Zatoich movie relocation. <br /> <br /> This movie was a disappointment because it started to depend on effects (head rolling, breaking limbs, blood) and less on the Zatoich character. All of the previous films were successful in story and action, and they won a great following without having to use the effects. <br /> <br /> I hope the rest of Zatoich's movies don't follow the same trend. This is the first film in his studio in Zatoich. I recommend all the previous Zatoich movies - and I recommend them.
