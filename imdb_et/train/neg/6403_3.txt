.... about the level of this comedy. Barely even reached the length of the function, "Can I do it ..." Until "glasses" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize it was supposed to be a punchline (for example: Santa Claus); others are so long that you can't believe it if you realize they need so much time to create this punchline (for example: student awards gag). And almost everything is directed without art. Don't do me wrong: about 1 in every 10 jokes will be funny (iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also a wonderful admiration that proves once again that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (including some comic man's nudity). And I agree with others that deliberately stupid title song is actually pretty fucking memorable! But none of these reasons is enough to give this film anything more than * four.
