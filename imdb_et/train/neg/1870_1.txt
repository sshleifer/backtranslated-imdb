I always loved the bill because of my great script and characters, but lately I feel it has become an emotional soap. When you look at pictures / posters, you will now see two officials hugging / kissing or doing something with friendship, while the bill of the bill would have long had anything to do with crime. This proves that it has changed a lot since it is an absolutely amazing police drama central type of television soap. When I look at it, I feel like I'm looking at the Coronation Street police version or something. I have to say that I am still on the bill because I am interested in the work of the police and such a thing, but I really will continue to do what Bill used earlier. I want to rate it out of ten, because you have to admit that people who have taken over the bill have completely destroyed it. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the characters they both have fallen, most big characters are now gone (although some still think) and I don't say the newer characters are bad or something because they definitely don't No, it's just that they don't have a harsh look, personalities, and script lines that all the old characters were before, because most of the new ones are currently associated with stupid relationships and family problems. <br /> <br /> In general, it is today a television program on television. it is always interesting to watch, but as I say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if it is the right spell) and now it is classified as a terrible, unrealistic television show. <br /> <br /> It is advisable to watch out for the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
