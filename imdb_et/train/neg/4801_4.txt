I wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison sentence, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a completely outrageous 80s-touch, and it is the actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you thought) bad guy, director. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror. But the direction is very woody and there is no horrible / frightening moment. It just goes on and on and then (logically) it has to end. The finer and bolder visuals and its fate as a cult class would be closed.
