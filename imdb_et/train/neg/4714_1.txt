I want to give this GARBAGE piece to zero, unfortunately not, so, I had to give it 1 to warn you how foolishly this terrible comic is! The characters look like the ones the preschoolers were drawing, no, wait, I've seen the pre-school age better! I prefer "Flapjack Misadventures" to this terrible apology comic! I'll say what others have said, two words: RIP OFF !! Remember the Dexter Lab episode when they climbed the carton with this volcano? Yes, Mister Fellows even against this idea and couldn't! They even shattered Shadow Lugia with this one episode that showed Pokemon! (He even put that franchise in!) The fact that one character is cheap from Mandark's Dexter Laboratory! Mister Fellows must be punished for trial for this offense! Everyone has their own opinion, but among you who like the Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test, you just lie. Do yourself a favor, change the channel if it hangs trying to shake the screen!
