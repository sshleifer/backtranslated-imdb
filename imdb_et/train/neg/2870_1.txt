Oh my God! Please, for the love that is sacred, don't look at this movie! It's 82 minutes of my life when I ever return. Of course, I could have stopped half-seeing. But I thought it could get better. It wasn't. Anyone who really enjoyed this movie is one seriously ill and twisted person. No wonder the Australians / New Zealand have a terrible reputation for making films. All this movie is terrible, from action to editing. I don't usually even write comments here, but in this case I make an exception. I just want someone to warn me before I hired this catastrophe
