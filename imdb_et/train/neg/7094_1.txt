This trashy B movie is trying to mask the study of sexual addiction, but it is really a bad excuse for a flick of sexual descent. The story revolves around Sammy Horn (a fine name) played by Michael Des Barres. Sammy is a restaurant owned by a married woman Grace (Rosanna Arquette) and a small child. She has a sexual addiction and every five minutes she must be meaningless to every woman who advises her field of vision (and of course every woman on the planet thinks she is irresistible, even though she looks old enough to collect social security) <br /> < br /> The story focuses on the conversation with his therapist (Nastassja Kinski), where he describes each of his sexual abuses through a setback. This is more than a convenient starting point for a sequential intervention parade that consumes at least 75% of the screen time. <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start criticizing this movie. Production values ​​are uncertain. The film is filmed with a video where somewhere in the TV soap opera (at best) and an amateur porn movie filmed in a garage. The direction of Joseph Brutsman is terrible, bad lighting, uninspired framing, and bad actor direction. The script is coarse and dialogue is meaningless and vulgar. <br /> <br /> In general, women depict nymphomaniacs as a sexual obsession, who only expects an addict, like Sammy, to come and tough when they eat their unsatisfactory appetite with some impersonal copulation. For example, Grace's sister can announce to Samm that she knows she's asleep and that she tells her wife. His response to this is to throw him against the wall and to rape him. For about three seconds he has an epiphany and is immediately replaced by one of his sex disciples who ask him to give him more. As they finish Grace walks and says to him, "Oh, nice to see you, you have to run to get Timmy and your mother is the word from Sammy indiscretions." Loyalty relationships are hermetically closed. There's no spoiler here because it's so typical of the film's character that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it. <br /> <br /> Sex images are all superfluous, mechanical, and so badly simulated that they are more comic than erotic. Most of them are dressed completely with both participants. Operation is sad. Michael Des Barres presents the entire depth of the rain bottle. It looks like he gets into the thrust and fear of sex, but when it comes to acting with Arquette and Kinsk, he is disobedient. Rosanna Arquette is the closest thing to the actor of this film, giving her a tolerable performance and really hurt when she finally finds out that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal. Nastassja Kinski is too compassionate as a therapist, but at least some of them are here. The rest is just a double body of the elevated body, to whom they think of provocative lines, such as "hit me harder, what can you do best?" and "Oh, God Yeah". <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, a dubious distinction, considering thousands of movies. I have given him an extremely rare stigma for this 1/10 rating. Do not see for three hours after a meal.
