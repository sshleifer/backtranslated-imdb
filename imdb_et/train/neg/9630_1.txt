I understand many of Ben Stiller's films or will come out this year, but maybe he should demand quality rather than quantity. <br /> <br /> I was stupid about what filmmakers thought of the comedy "Along Came Polly." Stilleri Reuben is a grab, charming and is one of the worst achievements of the year. Stiller's schtick is tiring. He has undoubtedly a comic talent, but he must either find another schtick or break, find the material that is really funny. Because his films are painfully humorous and maliciously bad. <br /> <br /> There's no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Anistan, which is a shame because she is a good and intelligent actor with a promising career. As long as he makes more movies, such as "The Good Girl" (where he is terrible) and less than "Along Came Polly", he has a career he could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome the slippery material he is working on, but it is a daunting task for any actor. Except for a few moments with Alec Baldwin, like Reuben's boss Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Reuben's best friend Sandy, there's nothing funny about this horrible movie. Other supportive characters, including Debra Messing like Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Asaria's accent is not only stupid, it is terribly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> "Along Came Polly" was certainly a promise. Unfortunately, this writer needed a comedy instead of this comedy.
