There's only one word for this movie. Terrible. The director has a clear talent, but like his character Robert Carmichael, he throws everything away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has the potential, but like Cray, she can't use it. Cray's vision of British youth is getting into crimes and then shrinking. Like the British tabloids, this film represents the aspirations or respect of young people. Cray exclaims, but it doesn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> I was terrible about the violence Cray chose to face the audience. He assumes that the audience does not feel the cruelty of the world. Like an unpleasant graffiti piece on the toilet wall, she shows her male uncertainty with the youngster. <br /> <br /> Some high-quality players have small parts in this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make short performances. Action is otherwise amateur, young men Joe and Ben are shining. Carmichael, played by Daniel Spencer, is horrible. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, an attractive woman of celeb chef Jonathon (Michael Howe). how he was able to subject himself to such an attempt did not believe. The film is never subtle and Monica is treated with the most widespread violence associated with war. The war images are used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves, that acts of violence take place even in "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and it is a symptom of our changed society, where men have less and less important positions, but Cray goes down to the level of barbaric men he wants to reveal through the use of his brutal and violent images. No female characters in the movie. They are either victims or a man washed in Manville. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first film. I listened to what he had to say during the Q and A session in Edinburg and he is not a unintelligent, he just has no experience, and his film is naive. The film will be published later this year, but I hope that the company will bust if the public does not need such confusing material.
