I was delighted to watch this movie, assuming it is a golden classic "Private Lessons" that depicts a dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" is never a title I mention. It's just the usual soft core of the Cinemax flick that doesn't change your life. There is only one hot sex scene on the roof, but that's the case. I looked at it a long time ago, but believe me, it's just an ordinary boring soft core. <br /> <br /> Women are hot but not enough to rent or buy a movie. My suggestion is to view it only when it is via cable.
