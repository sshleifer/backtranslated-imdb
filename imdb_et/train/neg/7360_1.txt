This is one of the worst action films I've ever seen. This is due to a particularly high degree of factual improbability (as an obvious agent who puts a bank loan into an official, at the same time making it clear that he speaks through someone's wire or scene where researchers assume that it is possible to enter a room where the virus has been released, though "it doesn't has not found a viable host ‚Äùdoes not mean it will never find one), cheap kits (the bank looks like it was badly built to resemble a cave) and bad behavior. This is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a deadly virus capsule. But the Prime Minister, who decides to remove it from the bank's deposit book, does so while the bank holds down, the same FBI agents have reported it, and at the same time a terrible earthquake is emerging. Needless to say, the sudden aftermath is dirty in many ways than one. However, the results do not produce an appealing film, but instead of the obviously z-class junk from the beginning of the film. (Perhaps it is because some of the screen images on the packaging create a computer screen rather than the actual screen shot of the actual sequences of the film). What the hell Ron Perlman did, I have no idea. I don't know if he was so embarrassed when I was watching it.
