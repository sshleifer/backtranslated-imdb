"Igor and Lunatics" is a completely uneven and amateur experiment with a mad hippie-killing spree horror movie. Apparently, even twenty years later, Charles Manson still inspired the filmmakers of excessive but incompetent trash. This is a typical Troma production, which means in other words, a useless plot is a much boring and completely irrelevant padding footage. Does the display have a bit of random gore and free nudity? what's not bad? but it's all so pointless and ugly that it's frustrating. "Igor and Lunatics" are so desperate that he even uses a lot of video material twice, such as the ring saw killing. The incoherent plot attempts to talk about the drug addicted hippie cult and Charlie Manson's wannabe Paul story. One of Paul's lower local disciples, Igor, becomes a little too obsessed with the orgy of Bible stories and drugs, and gradually causes the entire cult to fall into a criminal crazy. Just to illustrate with a small example exactly how crazy Igor is: he tears the heart out of a really sexy black black-girl's breast! There's a tedious synthesizer soundtrack and some really embarrassing pseudo-artistic camera girls, such as slow motion shots and mysterious dream sequences. Perhaps there is one sequence that more or less qualifies for garbage fanatics, and that 'is when a poor girl is cut in half with mechanics. For some special reason, the camera keeps bleeding bleed for fifteen seconds.
