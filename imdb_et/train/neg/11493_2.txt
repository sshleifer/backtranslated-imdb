Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series on this planet. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is intolerable and the historical background is mostly pointless. . Instead, it was a big city now, the best days have already passed. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been a city for the pirates of the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the largest city of that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than all: management! How can such dilettants like this type be allowed to control such a movie? Impossible! There weren't any plausible scenes, the fighting was ridiculous and I couldn't laugh at the toughest scenes.
