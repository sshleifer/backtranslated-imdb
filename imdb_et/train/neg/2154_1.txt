Let me admit. I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg saw the jacket panties so sexy. But there was another story inside. In addition to being a parody of the special effects of the "invisible person" genre (very visible strings and other such equipment), the film wasted a chance - in fact, he went along - all non-WASP races and real or imaginary homosexuals. The insult to the individual of each script was either homophobic or racist or both. It starts with your nerves with trembling sound, honest photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat surprising. But by the time you get there, you'll be less involved. Too bad, it would have been a pretty good movie.
