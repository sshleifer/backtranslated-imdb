I tried as hard as I could to sit at this irritating confusion, but I just couldn't do it. Brad Dourif sucks in the lead and all the supporting pains were just a little worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is just ridiculous, from terrible action to ridiculous FX to fool. <br /> <br /> Totally wasting time; do not worry. Root canal treatment would be more enjoyable. Bamboo cuts under the nails would be much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie is just a little worse. Get the idea?
