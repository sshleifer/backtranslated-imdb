I was going to look at this movie with rather low expectations so it would be a nice fluffy piece. Unfortunately, it wasn't even. I could barely sit through the film without having to walk. I went with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and even asked, "How much longer?" After the end of the end, I was just wondering who approves this script. Even trustworthy Fred Willard could not save the tragedy, country jokes and banal plot. I would recommend that the person who wrote and directing this film (I use the term loosely) should take a local community college web-class or class to get a film class. At least there are many books about management, screen writing and making movies that teach them about structure, plot, dialogue and temple.
