Encouraging the positive comments on this movie, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad error. I've seen a 950+ movie and it's really one of the worst - it's terribly almost all: editing, stamp, storyline, "acting", soundtrack (the only song in the movie - lame country tune - not played) less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the final credit for the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving this 1-score is Harvey Keitel - although it is far from his best result, it seems at least a little effort. One of the obsession of Keitel.
