Be warned: neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main role if you think the poster is. Their roles are actually small. <br /> <br /> The film is stumbling badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama. Especially I am unable to gather great sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsession. The plot pulls awfully and I turned it off after about 2/3 - unusual for me because I like to finish what I start. It has 1 to 2 stars in a good and beautiful environment. <br /> <br /> 2/10
