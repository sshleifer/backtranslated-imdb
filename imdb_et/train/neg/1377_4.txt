Most of the screenwriters are strangely skipped by the volleyball genre. Fortunately, the highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has always brought us the second best volleyball movie (which is lower than Out Out and higher than, umm). But don't let that movie cover on you. Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as today's Sherlock Holmes. Using high-tech gadgets that are less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji is able to support FBI agents to track a man who hasn't committed a clear crime. Although there are other players in the movie, including Denise Richards, a gay-negro, and an incredibly ugly and annoying girl, Koji carries this film independently. Every movie fan like Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.
