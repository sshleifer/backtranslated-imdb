The charming boy and his mother move to the center where cities, cats and death follow them. This is a summary. <br /> <br /> I admit that cats are a little puzzled after seeing this movie. But seriously, despite the many things that are wrong with this film, and believe me, there is a lot to go around, it is generally a very enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Characters are more like caricatures here than just the instincts on which you rely. Fear, greed, lust or pride seem to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that this seeming failure, in reality, serves the story. The supernatural assumption and the fact that it is Stephen King's scenario (not because I have something special about Mr King) is supported by pretty nice FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute pearl of this film is undoubtedly the mother of another world of Alice Krige, who plays Mary Brady. <br /> <br /> The King manages to take a simple story of an outsider or people who are somewhat different (ok - in such a case), trying to match and twist it into a surprising surprise horror game that must be with any spooky fan.
