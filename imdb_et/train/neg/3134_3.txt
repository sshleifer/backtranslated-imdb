"Fallen" belongs to the WOL category. I'm sad I'm older than two hours now. My other family members watched this movie and threw the screen down comments and took the mummy. I knew the actors (Wagner). I've read other negative comments and can't add anything to this film except that it can be reduced to 25 minutes so it can take a 30-minute slot on the TV without losing the plot. It reminds me of food that has several good ingredients, but when it is delivered it is not at all fragrant. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot mystery and replaced it with several people who want to denature the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. Colleges heroes discredit and throw their ears there. Later, after all people were turned by the evil people. The heroes saved the day and prove that everything is wrong.
