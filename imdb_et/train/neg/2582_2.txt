We just finished American Pie: Beta House and I have to say it was such a trash. The first three American pies were fun, the last three were a joke and should not be called an American pie. <br /> <br /> As you thought in the title of the movie, the beta house is about a brotherhood, fresh men, girls and their most original part, which falls in love. Of course, the boy who is on the road with the chicks is Stifler, who, together with his associates, is trying to accomplish another seemingly impossible task. It was unreal and super fake. Its just predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the College battle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) In summary: terrible show + boring script + wrong use of American Pie franchise = waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give him two out of ten, although most of it suck was a lot of nudity and beautiful girls like 2 funny scenes :)
