Despite a lot of style, flash and sparks, it doesn't speak French music. The music is repetitive, predictable and annoying. The story is uninteresting, as are many characters. <br /> <br /> People break a song and dance without motivation or reason. Most cast fabrics carry fake views of wigs and chinlines, and the kits are hopelessly waiting for the studio. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so it was negative. to me. Surely it is a shame that such a versatile cast is so weak that the final effort is. <br /> <br /> I'll show you that if you follow the ex-post controls (in this case, the big classic, "Umbrellas") don't often go. No one can be restored but restored.
