I bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore had previously negotiated how many episodes they would like to bring. And a big pussy? What the hell was that, "look at me, I'm a rat!" Double Episode Crap? All this clich√© mafia despises! The extremely big names that were voted on have already received money for their charity and have received customized custom exit. Hmm ... It's not reality, it's staged drama! The second show by Mark Burnett, "Survivor", also brought me questions when Johnny Fairplay stepped out, if he had only a short time before the baby was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
