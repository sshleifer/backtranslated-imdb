I really wanted to do it, but in the end it is a badly made movie with too little smile. <br /> <br /> Policies are on the ground, attacking Republican hell, but that's exactly what he needs to do. That alone gives me a reason to hit. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it has been made in a rush of REAL (like about a week). And it includes a stupid sub-block for a bimbo singer that seems to be completely on the subject. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan is obviously Iraq or Afghanistan, or some other country in the US that is f ** in the 50s. Humor is a bit dark (ampoules dancing with the prosthesis legs made by the Tamerlane company), but it's a sign, especially for companies involved in reconstruction ("democracy lite"!) heavy and labor. I think it is against so many bs propaganda that it has to try to get people over the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer a nudge, eye approach - a little bit. But it's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could look at it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" is more of a sign.
