I grew up watching the inspector gadget. It was and still is one of my favorite movies, if not my absolute favorite. I have learned a lot about geography and history from Spin-off Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to slip the banana from the shell and become the greatest detective ever. <br /> <br /> But the film has destroyed the reputation of excellent comics. , NO OLE is definitely the role of inspector widget. The first thing in the Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so comic. In the film, Gadget mostly solves the mystery itself. In the figure it was almost always a Penny, Brain and a fantastic book (I still want my book!). When the gadget solves the mystery, it was random. The gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but the comic was a stupid thing that came from humor. in the movie. It's not meant to be a comic for just Saturday morning. Gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. The film was a chic convertible. The movie was a sedan police car and it could become a van. It was also barely any gadget and was mostly there to get it right. <br /> <br /> But if anything, one thing that was terrible about the film was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a comic on Saturday morning. The film was too serious, too superfluous, it had too much plot and wasn't even far away. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who haven't seen it: NEVER see it. EVER. Watch the movie, it's a real classic.
