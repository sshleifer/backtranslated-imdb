I saw this movie in New York. Waiting for the bus next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. Rain and didn't want to wait for PORT AUTHORTY. So I went across the street and saw the worst movie of my life. It was so bad that I decided to stay and see the whole movie, I haven't seen anything bad yet. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I just stayed because I couldn't believe it .........
