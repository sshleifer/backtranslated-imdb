There are so many false statements in this so-called documentary film that I have called on television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel may be able to produce a flashy DVD, but he doesn't see it. He claims the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> He relies either on inaccurate, not on a full story, or an old favorite "government is always on us", and people believe what they are talking about and do not check the accuracy or details of their claims. <br /> <br /> What's more, his "exclusive" or "unpublished" footage is freely available on the Internet from different sites. <br /> <br /> Further reading of this filming circumstance shows that he used false information for interviews and has used creative editing of responses to promote his opinions. <br /> <br /> All claims about Mr Sibrel Apollo's "inaccuracies", "errors" or "whistleblowing" have been thorough How did I get this 40-minute back?
