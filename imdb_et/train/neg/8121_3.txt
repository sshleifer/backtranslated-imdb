Time is valuable. This movie is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who talk about small films like Fargo and its total waste of time. What a piece of bear is! <br /> <br /> The hook of this movie is the upward moving black daughter who is looking for and looking for her white trash. That's great. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, kits, editing, sound) is about 2 steps over a 60-minute story. The characters are low and unpleasant. I am offended by the fact that these people were unable to understand what was obvious to the public; The audience mocked the screen of the movie, which characters should say next.
