The 1977 cult film has two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) that appear at the home of wealthy social worker George George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping to help find a place they can't find. But these two have other plans in mind when they find that George's husband is out of town, they take control of the place of residence, linking George, killing the delivery boy, destroying it all in one evening. A captivating and disturbing film, but these two will just get the same weird as the movie ends. Most of them will not like him right away or will stay on this ridiculous movie in about 30 minutes. In both cases, some find it even a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
