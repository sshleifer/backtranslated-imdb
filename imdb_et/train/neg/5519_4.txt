Okay, so the previews of this movie will only tell you that the rebellious young girl lives with her grandmother's summer to straighten. That's not really so! It is about a young rebellious 17-year-old girl who opens the mystery and her mother must believe whether she is telling the truth or not. To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They really had a good plot and a really good thing about the relationship between love and hate between mother and daughter. However, I didn't enjoy showing Lindsay Lohan. In fact, this film would have been great if they had someone else, perhaps a better actor. Rachel's (Lohan) character is a very sexually aggressive person and it reminds us of a real Lindsay, so it takes a lot of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I think if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this movie. The end is pretty big (and sad).
