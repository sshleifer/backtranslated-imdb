Immediately after renting and watching the movie many years ago, we decided to make an absolute zero on the film scale. There was nothing in the film that could have been done worse than it was. Up to now, we still appreciate the very bad movies that are better than the "Lonely Lady" they are. among others, "The Last Summer" and "Mad Housewife Diary", and he found that he had been asked to write a scenario for "Lonely Lady" by Harold Robbins. He said he sent the treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think he understood Hollywood's female scriptwriter difficulties. He then said, "I think they could write to someone." The interview was filmed before the film was released. He died in 1981 and I bet that the first thing he did when he arrived in heaven was personally grateful to God for rescuing him from the result.
