I watched it .... let me reformat ... suffered it because I'm an Eva fan. I don't think it's a flick that he puts his head on the back of the picture. I like gangsta flix, but it wasn't even close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars and the money was probably spent on the catering company. <br /> <br /> The assumption was interesting, but the first victim died before you got the chance to take care I don't want to say who did it and how, because it's not worth the effort. I am just glad that due to the monthly rental plan for my local video store, I didn't really have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Oh! Before I get a flame, I love movies, I thought lotta flix was good that some of you were stuck, so I got stuck for it, tells you everything you need to know.
