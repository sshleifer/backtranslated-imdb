As a player, I can't say I like this movie. The fact is that I hate it right. I tried to look at it as openly as possible, but when it comes down to it, it seems rather offensive to my social group. <br /> <br /> There are several reasons for me. <br /> 1. Characters seem unnatural. I've met many players from all walks of life. I don't know anyone who acts like characters in every movie. It's like film makers have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and brought them all to 5 people. Most players are quite social people, some are quite active. <br /> <br /> 2. Style doesn't work. The Mockumentary style is not compatible with the film object. The actual documentary about the players would actually work better. Although it looks good (I.E. purely assembled), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue seems forced, unnatural. It also seems to have no real world. Players swear, I admit it, but we don't have Tourette syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. Humor is missing. Though self-confident humor is the focal point of my group and of several other groups that I have come across, it is less self-restraint and rather a toilet humor. Likewise, a large portion of gamblers' humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most players would interrupt and blame someone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically: accuracy. I don't mean rules, but dynamics. This movie is constantly being compared to the lower budget, The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which represent players as real people playing the real game. The difference is that the players: the film presents a situation where you want to win players meaninglessly against the players, where you can say: "Huh, I know such a man ... yes, it's definitely like Gary."
