I liked the previous Ittenbach movie I saw, "Burning Moon". But while this film was rather grim and disgusting, "Premutos" seems to laugh mostly. Although his admiration is how Ittenbach did not make his movie for free (and the DVD documentary is worth it), I found myself constantly not moving on to the next gore scene. Of course, there is gore and if that's all you want, go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there is an unreasonable number of manners and tedious stories. Many compare it to Peter Jackson's films, especially "Braindead". But looking at what Jackson was doing with a similar budget in "Bad Taste", it is clear that Ittenbach does not have one thing Jackson's talent has. 3/10 (for the very good and rich gore effects and maximum use of limited resources, but not for what I pay for it)
