All I was thinking of while watching this movie was a B-class slope. Many have talked about the quality of redemption, how this film depicts the realistic depiction of the effects of drugs and the individual and their subsequent spiral as an independent state of unhappy events. Indeed, the methods used (as many have already mentioned) were overwhelmed and therefore convincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it was incomplete, unimaginable, unlikely, and twisted. You can read most of the other reports in this movie and they say pretty much as much as I do. <br /> <br /> Some actresses and actors are attractive, but faced with such boring activities ... wear a movie so far. The action is bad and intermittent: a few strokes thrown here and there, and the end of the final bomb attack. Nothing writes anything at home. <br /> <br /> As others have said, "BAD" movies are great to see just because they are "bad", you prove it. However, this film is insignificant. It's not something. <br /> <br /> In addition, if someone needs an educational movie to scare people into drug use, I would strongly recommend that there are many other movies that deal with these issues much more effectively. There are just a few examples of 'Requiem for Dreams', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Hope in Las Vegas' and 'Candy'. Although we should also look at some sense of light on movies on the same subject as "Go" (general, both serious and funny) and "Halfbaked". <br /> <br /> The final note, which can redeem the line that Vinnie Jones gave, was stolen from Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels. To think that "Loaded" is a bit of a big movie, it's a whistle. <br /> <br /> In general, I suggest you save money and time if you don't see this movie.
