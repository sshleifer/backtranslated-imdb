Even if there are generally trusted names such as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland does not give this film any sense of depth. It barely hurts the surface of the events that happened in the evening of 1981. Kilmer just goes through the movements, as both John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hoping for two other lead positions. like a Holmes wife and a minor girlfriend. The other cast roles have such small roles that it is impossible for them to get any size. The film also features Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and Paris Hilton.
