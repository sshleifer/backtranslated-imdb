I work as a doorman for the Washington Hotel and take my word, Michael J. Fox- # 1's character was far from accurate, we just don't go with our pockets with theater tickets and $ 100 bills! # 2 If I ever let someone use the space for some "afternoon joy", I'd shoot on the spot! The organization I belong to (Les Clefs d'Or) has very strong ethical and behavioral standards that we take seriously. # 3 Similarly, at the end of the movie, the idea was that Doug simply removed his golden key emblem and passed it on to another employee - we serve these keys and this is a token of honor and knowledge that is allowed to be worn by them. There is a whole implementation and control process for joining the organization. <br /> <br /> This movie does nothing to dispel the unfortunate conception of the doorman as a grabber of grubbing money. In short, it is a disgrace to our organization. I welcome all the comments.
