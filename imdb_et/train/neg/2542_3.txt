... not that all Disney movies are garbage. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I first saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" and loved the movie. When I heard it had two sequences, I was ecstatic. I finally found a copy of it and looked at it one night. I don't see how they can make a G-rated sequel to a horror movie. The original is a movie / documentary about the Fauke Monster and can scare anyone. "Back" is for children and should not be viewed by anyone. I don't remember the plot too well because it's been some time since I watched it, and I don't look at it again, but ... It's about their hunters who come to town and they want to kill Bigfoot. Three little kids flies out of the house to stop them. Passes through a large monsoon. Hunters hurt, children save. Then they all hide in a boat that has a big piece in between and try to wait. Then suddenly comes Bigfoot and doing something very sick. I don't want to destroy any end, but it's not scary. Well ....
