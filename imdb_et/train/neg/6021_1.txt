I can't believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this movie. Spectrally bad behavior, extraordinary scripting, and the effects you could make on your middle computer, incredible plot contraction ... a reporter who can become an inexperienced stewardess to work for the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this movie is so surprising that you feel like you have been trying to break your head. All this movie is going to preach to the choir and everyone else laughs at the waste of such ridiculous money. If the makers of this film really wanted people to be Christian and show what it really means to believe, they would have used the money to help people in real poverty. Now, / that / could have some people actually listen to them.
