I can't imagine that someone would want to watch this movie after a year. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it wasn't), but largely because it is about 20 years old and out of mainstream. I tried to find out where I saw the actor before and it jumped. So, yes, the boy ends up playing too little because he doesn't like the kernels, it forces the media to be a lot of attention and a quick solution to the Cold War. End. Fantasy to be sure, but one so confused would make John Lennon a blush. Because terrorism has replaced communism as a -ism that frightens us, this film does not really matter, except as a (inaccurate) look back at those times. Written, display and film ships have not been developed in the same way. The reason I appreciated it as high as I was because I watched this movie about 50 times when I was 5-6 years old and I still have a small place in my heart, but now I realize it's not really cut mustard. So, when the law of big laws is true and someone finally decides to review this movie, understand that time is much better, but also much worse. (I'm currently stopping John Q.)
