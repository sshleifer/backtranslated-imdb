The highlight of this film for me was undoubtedly Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was certainly against the type and showed that he was able to deal with his unconventional (his) role. Hanks is usually a good guy in the movie - you like, admire and root. Sullivan wasn't a good man. It is true that, in the context of this film, he reached such a somewhat sublime - his goal was to release the murders of his wife and youngest son. However, he was a gangster and a murderer before he was killed. So Hanks took on the role I wouldn't have expected, and he pulled it out well. <br /> <br /> Hanks is a good one, although I couldn't call it a pleasant movie. After opening, which I would best describe as mysterious (it wasn't clear to me for a while), it becomes a very amazing film, a complex relationship that Sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mobile and try to raise their two sons and keep them "clean"; isolated. After the older son witnesses the murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, to get the wrong son (and mother) and to leave Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr). It turns into a strange father / son binding film. <br /> <br /> Although it ends up with some promising remarks (at least in the overall context of the story), it is really a very dark whole, this mood is strengthened by many scenes being released in the dark and rain. I have to admit that although I appreciated Hanks' performance, the movie hasn't brought me in full. 4/10
