BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Not slasher or gore. Rich glass and mirrors in this French trimmer and writer / director Sean Ellis. Successful Radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) leads the strange world because her life seems to be under control. When you visit the birthday of your father (Richard Jenkins), guests will be stunned when they are obviously not reflecting on the floor. Things are really strange when he knows a woman who is himself driving a car like this to London. Gina jumps to her doppelganger apartment and finds her father's picture. He drives away and takes part in a collision. Then his boyfriend is not mysteriously the same; Being an accurate family and friends is not her trust. Is Gina next to her? Is he in the parallel world? Her nightmares become more terrible ... is she broken? <br /> <br /> Tissue if you can figure it out ... it's not easy. Editing cannot be stricter. Lighting is questionable. Other players are Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
