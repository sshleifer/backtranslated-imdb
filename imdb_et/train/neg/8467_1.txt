My friends and I rent it from Blockbuster because we saw the name of the Nana Visitor box. This movie is travesty, I hope he denies his CV. <br /> <br /> The "plot" was losing and uncomfortable, acting partially partially dry and unbearable. The film didn't make any sense. The unprocessed plot of human-infected alien parasites has been made many times by much better scripts, such as body-snatchers and faculty invasion. <br /> <br /> If you have ever had a failure with this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How it moves as a horror movie, if you didn't use fear, intercourse, gore, terror or any of the usual horror film techniques that I don't know, but if you still want to watch this movie, I recommend a lot of sugar before hand so you will find this part funny.
