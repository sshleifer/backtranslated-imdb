(it may be a bit of a fraudulent side) I would like to start by saying that I didn't watch the whole film, nor did it, because the first hour showed I was incredibly disappointed. Of course, this is a problem many people believe is an amazing book and making it a Disney Made-TV movie. <br /> <br /> A timeless wrinkle should have been an amazing movie a long time ago. It has a great story that can grab children and adults. Plus it has built a high quality sequel. But Disney-fying wasn't the way to go. The problem with the film is that all the things they changed to make it a visual story were so great about the book. It is a difficult and emotional story for children. Charles Wallace had no reason to be "clean" because it was the easiest way to explain it. There is no reason to write a struggle between the three ladies W as an extra boost, without which the tension is enough. There was no reason to remove Megi's glasses that took us away from what might have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg, what happens in the book. , but I also think that bigger things like the direction of art were turned off. Take, for example, how they saw the look of Camazotz, their strangely darkened sky. The book emerged that Camazotz may be the Earth. It looks like a land. There are people who look like people. The sky is blue, the grass is green and the kids are playing. But something is a bit down. Directors decided to make Camazotz a whole, instead of taking a lesson in the book and directing it in the general direction of the film. Of course, Camazotz may be Earth, that is, we forget how to love. It would have been a beautiful afternoon as they walk down the street where the kids hit the balls with the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I didn't see the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney is confused. <br /> <br /> In general, artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
