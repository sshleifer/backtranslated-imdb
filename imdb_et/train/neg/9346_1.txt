This movie was fun from headlines to credit, it's boring to tedium and acts as wood and stylish! Of course, it was directed by Richard Jobson, who led the debut, but who wrote on the earth on a green background such a badly developed script? The second money seems to be in a drainage project (the Scottish screen is surprised, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and, unfortunately, my review must be more restrained than that. Please, please, Mr Jobson, which you have ever done before directing the film sedative, go back!
