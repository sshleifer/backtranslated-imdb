I can put this movie together in 20 words or less. Too predictable story that has the potential to be funny but falls on his face. Look at 19 words, but I didn't put this star in just one star, but I decided to drag it to two stars, because Julie Bowen smokes hot and gave me enough eye candy to keep me from ripping. DVD straight out of the machine and blows it with the M80. My advice, take the $ 4.00 rent you would have paid for seeing this movie, and just send it to me if you thank you for saving time and frustration from sitting on this train wreck, or you can send me a $ 50.00 replacement fee you would forced to take out their twelve gates to use this piece as a trash.
