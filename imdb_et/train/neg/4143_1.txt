Like myself and my other side are big garbage fans, we could not receive a movie that contained both surprises we were excited about! But for the 2004 film with Freddy Vs Jason's hangover, it's shameful! The worst film I've ever seen, but what to look for laugh when you can sit through it! <br /> <br /> Effective is a terrible effect ... I can handle the camera better so badly that they only disturb the zombies and put them on the neck, hand, and so on. There was no story, strange setbacks that didn't make sense and terrible script! <br /> <br /> "You broke my tooth!" from a vampire "you broke my cigar" was a response from a man who looked like Uncle Jessie's Dukes that baptized Santa!
