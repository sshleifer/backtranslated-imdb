Until the end, bad men always have the upper - always - what casts doubt on the competence of good boys. A couple of innocent-person accused-of-a-crime plots are irritating. Some unnecessary dialogues discussing various boring legal issues. This is just a mediocre stupid old west, so what is it pointless to try to make things "realistic"? Cagney's atypical presence in the west is one of the few - if not the only - entertainment thing in the movie. Somewhere in the middle is a ridiculously timed marriage proposal; as "Where is the boy hiding? Where is he ?! ... Oh, and by the way, do you marry me?"
