Effects (consequences) without reason are generally not possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remodeling it is not only possible but also necessary. Haunting has been given a computer procedure by a first-class operator-turner-director who had ever shown a promise (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since given a large budget line (Twister, Speed ​​2). <Br / The actor is superfluous for this film and seems to understand it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as they want them to be everywhere, but in this movie. Lili Taylor tries to add something to the procedure, but whatever it is, is unknown because the script seems to be missing half of it. Events just happen, good and bad ghosts appear without rhyme or reason, and then the story ends with the most disgruntled non-event designed to fail the previous 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is even no reason to see it because we all know that something can now be displayed. Why not watch good stories, not just for your own good?
