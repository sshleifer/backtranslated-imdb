This is an activity in the West. James Steart leads the scenic Northwest region, filmed with great glory. Landscape and costumes are great. There's action and adventure. Stewart plays a rich parent who runs against the curved government in the old Nothwand. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the stereotypical cynical that Hollywood has always made heroic. Even when this film was made, the cynic was a stereotypical hero, and one of Stewart's portraits really has little rescue. He is kind to his two partners and it gives him an additional dimension of credibility and attractiveness. <br /> <br /> But he's so hard for him to take care of him or take him. He is very similar to western letters to one-dimensional spaghetti (not so bad). <br /> <br /> However, minors are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others are worth it.
