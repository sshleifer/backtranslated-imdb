This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Robin Williams fits into this part of the rhinoceros, even if his performance was still pathetic. Kurt Russell was more plausible but still terrible. The plot left a lot to be desired and the rest of the action was terrible. The only thing this movie was about was a trailer that forced me to waste 90 minutes of life, which could have been better used if I wanted to hit my head. <br /> <br /> Use this movie to burn and burn when you have it. If not, just be happy.
