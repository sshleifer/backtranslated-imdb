Four Eyed Monsters follow a relationship between a shy, reclusive videographer and equally stranger artists, both living in Big Apple and developing an unlikely romance with an online dating site. This in itself is not so unusual, but what is their method of communication. Before verbally writing, they take notes for writing and then communicate via video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a relationship between the creator (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice) who, in addition to writing and directing, also takes the lead. With an avant-garde, anti-plot, and docudrama element, the film scatters the wind without being sure that there is a definite structure between the narcissism and the self-sensitivity. <br /> <br /> When you wear a film, the separation and degradation of any form of intriguing communication will become obsolete when the couple is faced with the difficulties of reality. Focusing only on internal conflict or relationships, the film fights the film through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor toxic. It could have been easily circumvented by adding a sub-block and an external conflict, and a third act that is not - just a monodram of melodrama that leads somewhere. <br /> <br /> It is even more aggravating that the film goes down from a story to a reality that suddenly ends with an open and dissatisfied finish. It would have been all right and dandy, but there is no question that would have been asked and any meaning that would need to be discovered or thought. <br /> <br /> (The side note is a beautiful animation and lively and moving sound in the film, one of the most interesting aspects of production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, watch the movie and decide for yourself.
