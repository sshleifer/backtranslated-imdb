This movie is very important because it suggested to me to consider it: sometimes you may want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to have a syndrome ... sometimes you like to have Goldfield syndrome ... so you d don't remember this boring movie ... and above all, you can't remember Adam's "superfluos" for Sandler ... sometimes you just want to ... you've rented another movie ... <br /> <br /> My voice? 3 out of 10. My proposal? If you're not a boring romantic comedy or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke, Adam Sandler's fan does not exist ... I want to count on it), save yourself ... Save someone? Drew Barrymore. ... maybe.
