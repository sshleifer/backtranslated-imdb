I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. Waiting for a lot of action. As Escape From New York was 16 years old in Germany, I went to the movie. It was so boring. Later I realized that it was just a mess where the husband exhibited his wife. I mean today that you are doing it over the Internet and you pay for immediate access. It's been more than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry with wasting my time with this movie. This is a soft porn for schoolchildren. Removing and Dyeing Bo Derek - Nice. But then they should call Undressing Bo and paint him.
