The inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing his donating / expanding machine to the Smithsonian institution because he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) are preparing for a long weekend from their son, Adamine (Bug Hall). Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Bankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteers to take care of Adam when his parents are away, but fortunately it would ( and the title would lead you to wait), adults are accidentally caught up in Wayne's shrinking radiation. As children run, their miniature people have to fight the enormous insects of the monsters, the wrinkles of the carpets that look like canyons, and other dangers. It was bad, as most of the straightforward videos are, Honey, Me Shrunk Ourselves was kind of ridiculous. I had to laugh at this "roach" movie Stuart Bank and party tempters were even more ridiculous, looking at their own risk!
