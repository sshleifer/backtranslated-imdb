The failure of this film (if it is possible), which is very expensive for marijuana smoking (which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films) provides reasonable credibility. That's far from it. The rest is just terrible. The plot is loaded with "wow" symbols that are designed to look good on the film but do not go anywhere. The main example is the giant peach, which apparently fell out of the city parade and donated by the local conservation plant. Just tempting was what hopefully was free, but still irrelevant, in proportion! The peach is given a colorful, inexplicable washing at one stage, but it ends. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a "black dot" traffic sign is provided, where Stephi's parents were killed. Escape from your past, but he escapes for what? He was pretty much where he was, especially given his vision-impaired and infinite, loving patience and understanding of his understanding, a young female guardian. <br /> <br /> The Guinness award for hard melodrama, however, goes to Alan's character. Alan is successfully striving for the brilliant role of the union store manager, but "to the rats" to his colleagues, becoming the guardian of the national - elevator! lift! As an instructor, Alan performs the boss's evil work. He leads redundancies up to surprise, surprisingly, the whole factory is closed and Alan himself is left to be miserable, unsuccessful. There are no clich√©-free zones. Not only that, but Alan also loses the tempting Steph's most unlikely relationship. If you think the plot is melodic and didactic, don't ask for details. What is the importance of shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why the hotel where the couple loves does not end up making someone illegally into one of their biggest bedrooms, and among other pandemics, the pages are regularly dirty - this is once remarkable. Summarizing this movie in one word: Avoid, Avoid, Avoid.
