This movie was not made by Who fans. Most of the great moments that fans are waiting for half an hour in Tommy's distance are just missed or broken: during Christmas they didn't show Daltry's sheep after the line "Tommy doesn't know what day it is ...", they showed almost * no * Townsend guitar pictures Pinball In the Wizard, there were too many crowd pictures that were made at the best moments and worst of MÃ¤ra's mirror, on the other side. We don't take it (listening) to you), they robbed us of almost every Pete's relaxing guitar chord picture. Huge movie pieces are shot on the back of the movie. This is a very depressing film that you can't watch and deliver. I don't know if director Murry Lerner is not at least a fan of him, or worse than he is * Who's a fan and it's all * eight * cameras that offer him. For credit, Tommy has some rare numbers, but also some drops that are very well shot and sometimes the editing is great. It may be enough for some viewers to be happy if you don't see Tommi. The overall sound was modest in DirecTV's broadcast; it may be different from video or DVD.
