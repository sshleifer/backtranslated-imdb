it was and was a simpler time (seventies), a simpler place (San Francisco) where a man could make a simple movie about the crazy psychotic crucifixion of drugs in Christ as a woman who never has endless dreams and cut offs, even though they have multiple races families, regardless of financial responsibility or moral consequences. <br /> <br /> This movie, tedious, slow, boring, is the worst example of such a pretentious heavy-handed art school that it passed in the mid-70s. and i love it! if this endless slow motion zoom and the reverbed echo chamber's acidic guitar cease, you can't take your eyes off before a ridiculous and absurd end. his cross between the superstar of Jesus Christ, which is above the puppet valley, and a really nervous acidic trip to the waterbed with his parents. at the same time a train wreck, a totally exciting, and also a great picture of the worst (or best) elements of the b-seventies phychadelic movie genre. <br /> <br /> Plot. <br /> <br /> I'm just telling you a plot because I hardly can tell what happens to the constant backlashes of events that may or may not have happened to characters who may or may not be themselves, and face a painted hipster nick endlessly cavorting about banal sequences of performance art level mime like street theater. <br /> <br /> "Logan" is a really annoying iconoclast movie maker who screams to distribute to people and is surrounded by a mostly quiet movie team who is always lowering the acid and having something that looks really bad under the orgy. Richard Dreyfus has an extraordinary role that seems like an accountant. the film's team seems to hate him for some reason and breaks the manic laugh or torture him. "Suzanne" is the title-haired blonde who quietly slips into space and prevents the crazy "artist" character. By the way, the "artist" goes completely crazy. or the surprising astonishment of his paintings. of course Susanne's terrible acts. There are other signs that randomly appear in the cigar chomping "man" character. who thinks everyone is hot for Suzanne. he has a monologue. I could never really understand what he had to do, except when everyone had to hate the "man" and you couldn't do the movie without it. is also a mute girl. silent girl will end up paying off, trust me, her incredibly stupid.
