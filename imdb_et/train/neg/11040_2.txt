You have to look at this example once to see them all. The formula is exactly the same in every episode. Jim does something he knows well, but he disturbs his wife, finally it turns out that what he did was very good for him, cares about his cheek and gives a strange smile when he looks gently. In fact, the story is both flat and shapely, so I'll take one now. <br /> <br /> Episode "Valentines Pay" <br /> <br /> Jim's husband notices that all of Jims' weekly pay has disappeared, he explains that he lost the casino. He screams and leaves the house when he is terrible. Then, on Valentine's Day, tickets to the limousine reach the ball (explaining the missing wages). He understands "His" error and the usual "Oh Jim, you're so cute". Another obvious point is that Jim's character is based on Homer Simpson, who is a character and an ignorant when attempted with human beings. not working and Jim just comes as a lofty self-centered jerk. IMO is the only reason why it is successful, just because we are so much now with television people, nowadays you may want to show a man who isolates the walls and want to see the audience. <br /> <br /> Two and a half men are fantastic and fun.
