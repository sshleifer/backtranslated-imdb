This film is deeply idiotic. The man wants revenge for the crime, but when he does his revenge, he has always shown him a video camera. What kind of person with a head cell would sit there and do it for so long in front of the camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script can never happen, unless anyone can dress up to destroy it for me, but I was intimidated !!! <br /> <br /> I think the script writers have some serious habits that feed their brain cells and make them touch holes that can be driven in the armored tank battalion PLOT: The man is looking for revenge for the deaths of his loved ones, but goes in the middle of the plot something totally wrong and then unexpectedly evolving. <br /> <br /> If only those people who wrote this story were not so stupid to write completely unrealistic plot revolutions that would never happen in this way. For the writers I say, look for help in solving your serious mental problem.
