I always wrote this series as a complete smile, because Jim Belushi was involved and strongly. But then one day there was a tragic event. After the white Sox game ended, I realized that the remote control was somehow on the other side of the room. Now I could have just stood up and walked through the room to get a remote control or even a TV to change the channel. But why not just get up and walk all over the country to watch TV in another country? "Nuts to," I said. So I decided to just hang on the couch and take all that Fate had for me. What Fate had been in store was the episode of this exhibition, an episode I remember very little, except that I had made a very broad, general sweep decision based on zero or objective evidence. and again i was absolutely right! This exhibition is a summary pie! Belush has all the furry comic delivery of the furry lighthouse. Women are physically attractive, but too Stepford has a real sense of viewer. There is no reason to stop yourself at a local TV station with a gasoline and flame dispenser, and send a copy of it to hell. <br /> <br /> Except .. <br /> <br /> Except for the wonderful comics of Larry Joe Campbell, America's largest comic book artist. This man plays Belush's brother, Andy, and he's gold. How good is he really? Well, next to it is funny, his job is to make Belush good. It's like trying to make the rear warts look good. But Campbell pulls it out of style. Someone should invent the Nobel Prize at Comic Buffoonery to win it every year. Without Larry Joe, this exhibition would have consisted of a few free views of Courtney Thorne-Smith, who would hit Belush with a head pan if he alternately strikes his chest and plays with his shoulders on the floor. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell, who named the comic, because he improves everything he has!
