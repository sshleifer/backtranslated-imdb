As an army veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. I find it shameful for those who fought in the Vietnam War. Allegedly, the true SF soldiers I knew were offended. If the film was presented as a satire or even a comic (it was), it would have been better. But it was taken seriously by many of my people, especially abroad. It seems that in the late 1980s I went to Europe, it seemed that this film appreciated me and the Americans in general. Unreal? Hmm, let's see. A monosilic, muscle-related cretan is pulled out of prison work to go into a secret mission to SE Asia to release some American troops. In the ongoing battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with a M-60 machine gun that never stops ammunition and never overheats. And he never misses, runs with a 32-weapon gun that was held with one hand. I could go ahead, but I get a headache. I just gave it 2/10 just because it is a little better than Rambo III.
