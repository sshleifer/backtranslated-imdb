I've just visited the Russian forum on our TV channel, which had shown this movie. Well ... 99% of Russian active audiences are disappointed. We wanted to see more of our facts in the movie. But the authors had something else ... :( We are big and beautiful countries where intelligent people live here. We are proud of all our space musicians, on the one hand real achievements in this field and on the other, science. So I would like to ask the author: Where is our LUNOHOD? And where, hell is our MIR station? Ah? I'm pretty sure that the events of LUNOHOD happened much earlier with Armstrong's "Walk of the Moon." And the scientific mistakes - I don't really have time and enough space here! in the forum www.1tv.ru
