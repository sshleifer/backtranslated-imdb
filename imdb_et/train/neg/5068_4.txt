I'm stunned to discover the number of fans this show has. It has not been said that Friends were at best "average" sitcom and not as big as others. Let's face it, if it wasn't for casting Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Matt Le Blanc, who knows if this show would last as long as it was done. I doubt it very much. Although as the series progressed, friends were increasingly predictable, flat and boring, so I didn't care less about the characters - the ones most appreciated in TV history - or their situation, or who's sleeping. And it went from funny first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even if he had all of these A-list Hollywood actors from the film world, I still didn't have to tune. Writing friends became obscure because I lost this show from the sixth season to the end And that was quite probably to say. <br /> <br /> But what was annoying was that it lasted for ten seasons, while some of my favorite exhibitions lasted only three, four seasons and were finally canceled and taken off the air. The performance should have stopped immediately when the majority wished for higher wages. Indeed, as far as the shrinking series, this exhibition was larger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I had so easily seen the back of this sitcom. Now we're talking about meeting friends, which shows us very quickly on our TV screen. And yet, I never want to wait for it.
