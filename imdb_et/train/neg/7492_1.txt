Apparently, most viewers do not know the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the timing of Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten surveys all over Europe) was the revenge and injustice of the winners. Why do you think there was no American, British, French or Soviet defendant after World War II? Were there no American, British, etc. war crimes? Hiroshita, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Dresden, Hamburg, Berlin, Katyn and so on were not? Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Woe to victis! Germany must die! It was also the title of the book in America in 1941. And first: full of hypocrisy. But not surprising ... Why was the Nuremberg process not enough? This movie is a nightmare. Darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin would become jealous of it ...
