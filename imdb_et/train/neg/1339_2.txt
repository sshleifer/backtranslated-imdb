Sad, sad sight is indeed Munster's revenge. Munsters has brought it back for the last time (Fred Gywnne got a huge salary to come back to the role of Herman Munster) in a film on television about grandfather and Herman wax copies that are "terrorizing" robots. city ​​as preparation for the mummy abduction at the exhibition. Police on their heels are trying to find out the two older TV icons who are actually deleting their names behind the crime. We see them dressed as waiters (the small point of the movie), the grandfather changes a few times with a cord with a fixed wire (once even travels to Transylvania, where Herman somehow relies on his frequent flyer miles), and the most annoying relative, Phantom, sings and crushes glass ad nausium! The most sad thing is difficult to pinpoint: whether Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis in both scenes look so harsh and so indifferent to the material. Is it a robotic costume that has the school's production values ​​looking at them. Maybe it's a ridiculous script. Sid Caesar crazy, mostly uncomfortable. Or maybe it sees something that brought me joy and pleasant memories like a child being treated with a super K-Marti fashion makeover. In any case, the result of Munster standards is definitely disappointing and stupid. As far as the rest is concerned, Yvonne De Carlo is enough in the quietest role (although she shows that she has more cleavage of her years and experiences). Martell C. Martell is making Eddie Munster so unsuccessful. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings, as the above-mentioned Phantom, sees and acts and talks most absurdly. The film also has a very cheap feeling for a TV movie.
