OKAY. It's not a bad movie if it comes from the original script. IF NOT! <br /> <br /> What part of this "story is not about women, except Fagata and Gagoola" in Haggard, do producers, managers and writers understand? I mean, it's pretty common English. I understood at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a wonderful description of the hidden and isolated kingdom of three different worlds, the colonial Africa, the unforgivable desert and the Kukuanaland. It should be more than enough for even the most mediocre manufacturers to work. But no, they have to "romance" it. Pathetic. A recommendation to all of your poor souls who actually thought it would be near the book. Give up. Until Peter Jackson wannabe arrives and "does it right", you can often read again. BTW, there's a sequel to the book (actually pre-quel) called Allan's wife. It gives the background to Quaterman's story. It's a little creepy, but good.
