What a piece of junk this movie was. The premise was okay, but even in the beginning, with ordinary sized people with huge blends (even Hercules' effects were better) I knew it would be bad. But the really terrible part of the film is the dialogues. It's totally inconsistent, stupid and stupid. I felt it would have been written in a 9th grade creative class and got D-. I want to let Casper van Diem and other participants follow this movie. <br /> <br /> I have had some of my cheese and bad movies (I love shaking), but ... I don't recommend it at all. It's silly and completely flabbergastingly bad dialogues make you compel.
