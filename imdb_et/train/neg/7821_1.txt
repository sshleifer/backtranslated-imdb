Did the filmmakers see it before they released it? The script pops up without giving much explanation. At first it doesn't explain if it's a pre-quartet or not. It starts with the beginning of Superman on Earth and then jumps to the point after the last movie - but it's not really the viewer. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is depicted as a potential home-carriage, stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character is rarely made by an interesting hero. The end is completely ridiculous. Superman finished the hospital just because he wanted to kill him. I'm looking forward to the SNL skit, where Superman appears to Maury Povich, and Maury says, "The results are - for Superman, you're a father." All in all - OK by acting on this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but with the HORRIBLE script. The film is basically unnoticeable.
