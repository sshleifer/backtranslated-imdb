102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous installment, and this tension is all the weaknesses of the first, silly padded storyline, Glenn Close's terrifying, worshiping every scene as if playing his own amusement and incredibly borrowers and interesting leaders participants. Dogs are once again the only "actors" who seem "real" and stretch. Another purposeful effort here. GRADE: D
