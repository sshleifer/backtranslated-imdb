This witch may have been recognized 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist films ever made by Indian Indians, played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a great racist in his real life, like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971 Stewart was actor Hal Williams who was fired from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series that graciously floped) just because Williams was black. As if it wasn't bad enough, this movie is dated and boring. Look for a less racist view instead of "Dances with Wolves". - Debra Paget. I'm surprised that it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
