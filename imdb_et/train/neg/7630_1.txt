A boring film from the boring city of the 50s. How can anyone think it's classic? The producer ended his career quite a lot by pushing his girlfriend Cybil Shepard into several films that were beyond his ability to act. I think this film gives an overview of how bad Peter Bogdonovitch's future films were. Cybil Shepard's career took a dive after being in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. Only "Moonlighting" did not start his career back. I thought the action was a bad transfer of the "Graduate". I've noticed that this movie hasn't been shown in the US. The only place I looked at was that it was late in Europe.
