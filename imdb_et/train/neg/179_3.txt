There was simply no need to return to Cabin by the lake. He must have a very small budget, because a fair amount of movie has to be filmed with a normal camcorder. So, in the same scene - you have some movie quality camera shots and simple camcorder shots. It makes a very strange mixture! I think they should have found some ways to not make a "home video" type effect! I think it's worth seeing if you've seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you don't see the original CBTL .... you never want to see it when you see it first! It probably seems too nervous and turns you off even taking care of the original.
