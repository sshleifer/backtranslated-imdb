How cynical are writers to do it. I can be an American citizen, but I don't need to see other Americans in an hour and a half to enjoy the movie. I am surprised that so few have commented on how the jingo, sentimental and tritical dialogue in this film really is. The film's historical inaccuracies are not as harsh and offensive as the "U-571" (which makes British submarines into the United States), but you are still walking away when you feel a bit sluggish. Indeed, the Germans of this movie do nothing but admire the Americans between the battle scenes! When sad, unnecessary! I just want to tell writers: for many of us it is obvious that you cannot hit real people under real pressure with real problems and that you have taken some very well-tested shortcuts. You are happy that there are always national nutjobs who appreciate your sugar-coated tank.
