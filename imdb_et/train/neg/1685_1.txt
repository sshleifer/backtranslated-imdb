All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at the age of 18). They have heard that this is a very scary film and they feel so cool when they watched it. I feel very sad kids do not see what is a good movie and what is a bad film. It was one of the worst films I saw in the months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it is impossible to properly prepare such a stupid story. This movie is just made to scare you, and if you're a little clever and you know about music, you know exactly when you're afraid. <br /> <br /> When the movie was finished and I turned to my friend and talked (a little loud) that it was a waste of money, some stupid guy seemed strange to me. These days, I can make Oscar with my goldfish home video if I only use the right marketing.
