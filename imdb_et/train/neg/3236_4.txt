I recently looked at the first Guinea Pig movie The Devil's Experiment and I have to admit I am disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on the list of any "nastiest" movies and maybe I was expecting more because of the leap. The truth is, I don't appreciate it. <br /> <br /> If I had observed that it opened up the text ("I found this tape ..."), I could have been a little disturbed, thinking it was real. Even without knowing that this is not real, I think I would have worked out that it wasn't really. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the girls reacted to what they were doing just not what they should be. He should yell as painful. The fact that it does not mean that it is not obviously real. I wouldn't want to see it if it were real, but if it were more convincing in its behavior, the film would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then the notorious scenes: nothing has affected me up to the scalpel at hand. Hot oil, breeds and guts didn't bother me. I'm not saying I'm "hard"; just that I couldn't stop my belief, partly because of the girl's inactivity. <br /> <br /> Skalpell put me a little, but the hammer hand just made a rubber. And the last scene with the eye was a bit tiring again, but nothing else. I didn't want to look and I didn't feel sick. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is twenty years old, or maybe I'm just jaded. The truth is that I didn't find this movie disturbing at all. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing you can expect to play as a loophole as the installation of modern art and training in removing characters, the story and so on and just leaving torture will work on some level. But as an amazing movie, it didn't work for me at least. <br /> <br /> I looked at Guinea Pig with my husband who is "it's just a movie" and wondered what all the noise was about. We have to discuss why I watch these films, and there are several reasons for this, but they contain a desire to influence the film. He said he didn't think the film could be so convincing that he would be disturbed and challenged by me. I played him irreversibly as a fire extinguisher scene and he was really upset. <br /> <br /> I am not sure that I have any points apart from both of us disrupting more than the horror genre film as any widespread movie that disturbs.
