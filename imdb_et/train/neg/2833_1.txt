With Bo Derek's film, viewers get exactly what they expect. A thin piece of paper and some pictures of Mrs. Derek without clothes. "Ghosts can't do it" is just that. The first fifteen minutes is the usual TV drama when Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with long-term experience in many different roles, but it seems that even a famous actor sometimes has to work for money. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly beautiful young woman with or without clothes. Film is a waste of time. If you want to see Quinnit, rent a Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad behavior, rent every porn movie.
