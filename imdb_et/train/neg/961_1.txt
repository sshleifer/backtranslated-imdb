Dirty, Simplified, and Short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: WOMAN) is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> This short (just over 60 minute) story is not so much inspired by the classic spaghetti Westerns it is Sam Raimi's 'QUICK & THE DEAD' (his acknowledged respect for spaghetti western countries) burst into a modern environment. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone is looking for a revenge sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was just a birthday, put her father's fate (a short Gary Blue hero) into her hands; he accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (leaning Ryoko Yonekura) is seeking revenge against the reluctant Mr Tojo (played by a minimalist Shingo Tsurum) who, when he was just born, put his father in the fate; he let him pull the foot off the clutch, and the dear truck pulled and dear dear dear. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is that Tojo is sadly Saki? Well, I won't break it if you decide to watch it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki? pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's "Man with No Name"? wearing a city? In principle, next to the American military base is a car shop and a tavern, so I think the city is enough? spoiled by Tojo, a local crimelord with ridiculously high prices on his head for reasons that were never explained or studied. Recognizing his true self-confidence as a bounty hunter, Saki takes on a local armed force whose choreography is more than a temporary similarity to Johnny To and John Woo's work. Of course, at the end of the film, Saki has suffered a fair amount of torture in the hands of the bad guys, but does he rise to the event? kneeling, a laughing attempt with surprise? and destroys all his enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Don't ask where he gets rocket launcher. See it for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> Image quality is average for DVD distribution. For multiple sequences, the grain quality is fine, but overall it is not a bad transfer. Sound quality sometimes leaves a little imagination, but again it is not a bad transmission. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie.
