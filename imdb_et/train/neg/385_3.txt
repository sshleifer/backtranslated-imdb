Bad written conspiracy drama / mystery about the government introduced AIDS. Wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers - to find someone in this foggy plot. Despite the fact that cinematography itself is praiseworthy, the camera's famine, unlike the actual depth characters, must be handed down by low, amateurs. Rating: D +
