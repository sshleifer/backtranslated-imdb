This movie was bad from the start. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a big body number. Operation was terrible. The killings were very bad. Like when Ally got off that toilet I think it was in an abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie is over and Molly and the other boy are in the salon, you see Ally that Angela should have gone here. The part that really got was when the black girl and Angela went to the booth and Angela took the guitar string and pulled her. One of it was terrible and two, why don't you just swirl and bitch?!?!? When Molly fails by Angela, if you have a neighbor's reason, why not just turn around and stab? So stupid. This movie sucked ...
