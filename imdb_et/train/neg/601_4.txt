!!!!! COURSE CHALLENGES !!!!! I am sure this project started as a screen writing seminar to avoid clichés in horror films: female protagonist - check bad things with drug users - make sure Heorine strikes the villain - make sure the hero does not notice the offender who recovers unconscious - check the frame in order so we we see behind the restored villain behind the heroine - Check Unfortunately, someone seems to have sent a list of this cliché to the movie studio instead of using it in the classroom. Dear, dear, if only London transport was as regular as the clichés up here. In fact, there are so many clichés and all of this before the moments that nobody thought of exactly what his name was, or how long he had killed people on earth. I have to believe that this is the result of some human test, and maybe this evening has not decided to take revenge against humanity, but it is so vague that it would be pointless. the producers thought they would make a movie that was going to wipe the oscars this year and there is always a horror movie market. I also doubt whether it costs too much to produce and has a DVD market rather than a cinema distribution, and I say it is a bit better than the DEATH LINE of 1972, which also had a murderer on the cannon that hid in the London Underground. it's just that if you think all the clichés have been used in this movie, there will be another cliché to raise your ugly head
