Yeah, I know I'm one of the few people who want to kill this movie for the dust. So let me tell you why I feel so. In fact, I could have enjoyed it like a Zombie movie or something like that, but I am completely completely speechless now. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what's wrong * Let's start with the first big drawback. If I didn't know that the movie was called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and if I didn't see some sequences where some people seem to be sucking blood, I wouldn't have seen the Vampires contact. I mean FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Another bad point: what about Metal? It seems that all the young, but mainly the so-called "vampires" belong to different metals, chiefly judging by their shirts! Don't do me wrong, I've been in extreme music for almost 15 years, but nobody scares me, showing me ridiculous teens in Iron Maiden (all bands !!!). shirts running around, pretending to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I could use here. <br /> <br /> Third Weakness: Actors. Wait a minute. WHAT PARTICIPANTS?! You're thinking of the director's wooden friends! Words would be waste here. <br /> <br /> Yes, well, the film is very gentle, but what's the difference? It would have been a strong point and nothing if the "briliant" director hadn't chosen to create the theme of the vampire ARTIFICIAL. I wanted to see vampires, but I treated some foolish children I would have loved using my baseball. The filmmakers should simply advertise the movie by saying "cheap B-class horror without a plot, but a lot of gore" !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is a blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it makes me sick.
