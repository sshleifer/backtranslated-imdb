My friends and we rent it to "Bad Movie Night" with great hope, but Brain was hit. The brain itself is gloriously funny but mostly just sitting on its small platform. Who thought it would be cool to get the brain out of just 94 out of three people? This film first has a number of things, including the Estevez-knockoff leader, who plays the rebellious gene (we are told that his enormous intelligence is misdirected to his sophisticated scams and school games involving placing a crazy glue on someone's chair). It also has some big lines, hilariously-out-out and breath, who just can't be anywhere, and yes, some chicks naked. However, the director desperately needs art education. In the last half, at least 3 or 4 meaningless, boring chase scenes that make up the average third of the plot will start to drag and continue. The scenes inside the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same staircase. I could have fixed this scenario for half an hour more cheese, more holes, more nudity, more brain. If you want to make a bad fear movie, at least give me something cool to see if my superego closes. Maybe the director really tried to bring the audience into his movie because I started to feel like a zombie town at the end of this crapfest.
