I loved the Batman series and I was very looking forward to it. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> Why they were the story of Adam West and Burt Ward was trying to get the batmobile back, was next to me. I don't want Burt or Adam to see how they are watching ..... 35 years after they appeared in Batman and Robin, but to see that they are dressed up and fought "badguys", it was sad . I'd rather see the former stars comment. The Batmobile side story was stupid. <br /> <br /> As for the rebound, I think it was too short and too much. That, in my opinion, was just a quick overview. I'd like more background. They showed that Penguin and Joker are just the same thing I knew for about a minute. The joker had makeup mustache and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was a former smoker. It was so in those 2. <br /> <br /> I would love to read the book. I'm sure it has more than it showed. Why There Were 2 Riddlers or Why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commishioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list goes on. As I said, those who were in it were hardly in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really horny.
