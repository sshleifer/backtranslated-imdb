The fact that most of this budget was likely to be on the list of heavy vehicles should not be important if it were staged with noisy and imagination and with some sympathy for the original satirical intent. Instead, we get unparalleled bad song and dance ensembles with picturesque beggars and whores, and the ultimate alienation is achieved by pulling back to show that the action has taken place at the stage of the music hall, enough to produce more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The acting talent is disgracefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good, but they don't have to try it very much: at least migraines have a great voice and some feeling about the material. Julia looks perfect like a Mack, but fights for the character fixed with a fake plum accent. Harris Peachum is embarrassing and Polly is cruel. Lyrics, script, and music customizations are often inconvenient: it was a bad step to make a film based on Marc Blitzstein's bowdlerized Broadway version, but at least his words were sung, unlike most interpolated in the loyalty gestures. And the attempt to fight low budgets by filming claustrophobic corners in fog-proof devices that are enlightened in delicate blues and oranges, as if some of the advantageous basements in Vittorio Storaro fail to fully - the film just looks cheap, merciful and thoughtlessly done. Disgraceful.
