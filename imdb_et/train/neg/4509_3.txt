"Geisha's Memories" is a visually stunning melodrama that seems to be in the camp rather than a queen satire as something for real people. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film firmly protects the geishas from being prostitutes and concubines that they are the embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty. But besides one breathtaking dance, the rest of the film is degenerating on the Storyville territory or at least for Vashti and Esther 'Pretty Baby' because all the efforts of women in art and artwork are much more entertaining, much older, drunk men. Perhaps it is Japanese prostitution, not just American infantry after World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is an English-speaking strain, but Ziyi Zhang hardly shows the great burns he showed in the "Flying Daggers House (Shi mian mai fu)" and "Hero (Ying xiong) ". Michelle Yeoh has a project from time to time showing her specific performance "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)." Only Li Gong shows real life. Otherwise, I photographed Charles Ludlam in different roles or even in Cillian Murphy, as well as in the Kabuki theater, especially as the cat pulled the cat after fighting the cat. <br /> <br /> The alleged love story is chemistry, mainly due to age differences, and I mostly felt sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped that his Hollywood payroll would compensate for his dignity loss as a mysterious "chairman". I remember more emotions in "Jennie's portrait" because a young girl wants to grow up with Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see a brief glimpse of reality when gays represent photographers with ordinary women. attractions and eternal Ziyi Zhang living in war years with very colorful kimono dying. The Final has little sense of normality. <br /> <br /> The result includes many traditional melodies by Yo Yo Ma's cello and Yitzhack Pearlman's violin, a traditional instrumental that is beautiful to listen to. Lovely cinematography when a person completely ignores a plot and rigidly works. <br /> <br /> As my mind was wrong, I was wondering how big Japanese leaders of samurai films had dealt with this story. have been more formal but much more emotional.
