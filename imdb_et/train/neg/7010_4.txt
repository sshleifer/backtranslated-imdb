I know nobody cares, but I do. This film is historical for one reason. This is the unity of the two heroes of the two great seventies of sci-fi. Well, one is great and one is pretty bad. Big is really great, actually it's the best. Bad is really bad, actually it's the worst. Of course I refer to Star Wars and note Mark Hamill, the "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this movie, who can sweep his Water and then go to Vegas (lead) and after many adventures it will eventually recover. (As he begins to approve cars, you think you can call him "Lube Skywalker." On his way he meets a golden heart whore and ends with the game of the 70s hero Kim Milford, the hero of the science fiction film "Laserblast", which, as I hinted earlier, what has ever been the worst sci-fi movie. Milford plays the lead that Hamill has to steal in his car. I understand that no one cares about these two big sci-fi hero encounters, but I do. And I also have to say that this is one of the best / worst movies ever. Mark Hamill's behavior needs strength, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the character of the whore played by Annie Pots can be the most annoying character of any time in any movie ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch over the weekend or the day of the week , late at night, very late, this is one of those films that tend to look for something but without finding it, but the whole purpose, like ba form jazz, just exist. And that is. And what is it is not so big, but you cannot say that it is not fun because you can feel for an hour and a half that you are hanging, but you do not feel cheated. So turn your mind off, relax and enjoy this unpleasant legacy without expectations and whether that power is always with you.
