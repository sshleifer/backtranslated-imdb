Chemical leakage makes people zombies. There are up to two doctors to survive the epidemic. This is Andreas Schnase's movie that you know what the course is about. Bad behavior, terribly terrible special effect and lack of budget. Duplication is ridiculous in the capital R and the saddest thing is that I have to write one word about this stool, much less there are ten lines that are mandatory because of the instructions given by IMDb. My initial review of just one word: Crap does not fly, so I have to look through it and go more than it is bad. But I don't know if I can, so .. wait, I think I might have enough words or traits to do this review. What's cool, I guess. So summing up: this movie sucks balls, don't look at it. <br /> <br /> My class: F
