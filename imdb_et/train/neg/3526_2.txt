(A spoiler comes in, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie can't be taken seriously. In some places it is so terribly foolish that I just can't laugh at it. Try me in a queue where Stallone's character jumps about a 20-meter climbing tool, or (and it's really my favorite) sniffing a bad boy, trying him on a stalactite. Yes, what divine power did he want for such competitions? I don't understand, but he gives money to reality.
