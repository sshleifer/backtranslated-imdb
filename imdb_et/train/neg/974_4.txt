This movie sounded like it can be fun and interesting about its description. But it was a little let me down. Very slow and difficult to track and see what happened. It would be like a single film by a filmmaker and threw them into the air and knocking them out, no matter how they landed (certainly not in sequential order). No consequences were also filmed. I've looked at quite a few different Korean films and I've noticed that a good part is well done and need to think about a viewer that is different from a typical Hollywood movie. But it ended up with me. I watched the movie for the second and third time, and it still didn't do anything. I still don't understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If I just wanted to show a typical daily part of a person's life, I think he managed. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
