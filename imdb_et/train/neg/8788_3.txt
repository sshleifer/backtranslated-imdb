What a shame is when a potentially fascinating and refreshingly low-key story can catch your interest at first and then gradually let you move on and move on until you have left your mystified head scratched when it reaches an excessive conclusion. Unfortunately, it happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It wasn't Michael Keaton's fault; it was a joy to see her return to a new movie, perhaps a little wrinkled, but still capable of giving a strong and sincere result. Like a man whose wife has recently died, he is obsessed with his spiritual spirit on the secondary market (not a new idea), probably by contacting him through this funky electric fuzz business you see on your TV screen if nothing is transmitted. br /> <br /> The idea of ​​communicating through liquids is called the EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who really believe it, so I'm not going to comment on what I think about it or them. Let me just say that I am all to stop disbelief when it comes to buying such fantastic movies, but what I can't tolerate does not understand what was going to happen to hell, which means I was left when the credit finally ended they started. Indeed, there are many static. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there are some movies that are completely confusing to me, but if the film can't make me clear, I tend to blame it for the filmmaker, not myself (if I didn't watch it when I was too tired) to focus or do something). Well, for WHITE NOISE, I was awake, bright with eyes and bushy - so I guess who's guilty?
