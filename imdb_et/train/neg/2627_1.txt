This bomb is just one "explosion" after another, without humor and only in absurd situations. Indeed, pyrotechnics is paramount. Reality is not one of its strengths. I'll give her one in 10. I would have made it zero, but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need money. And I'm still on this Tim Burton farce Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that it was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, this film is not even a tear. I would like to say, "Give me your money back". You can bet that if I could. But this is a problem with premium services, a choice of order.
