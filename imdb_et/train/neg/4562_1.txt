I didn't feel like I was raping like I did with CHRISTMAS, but BELLE's MAGICAL WORLD is still BEAUTY AND BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not so extreme. It's ugly, unpleasant, idiotic and writing is terribly bad. No stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB, they are a lot of pod people. I wanted to cut it off, but after a few minutes I gave up not having the claptrap seriously in their right mind. Here are three stories. "The Perfect Word" is an overwhelming, embarrassing study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" only works if you can agree that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she is the closet of James Bond, and that Lumiere is a female idiot. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind" as I like to call it) is probably the toughest. Beast hates birds? Since when? Don't look at this crap - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic, transcendental celebration of love, art, intelligence, and human soul.
