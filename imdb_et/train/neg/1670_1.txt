The premise of the film is horrible: a woman gets pregnant when she kisses a stranger at a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie begins, the terrible opening stage is that it is a C-type Sci-Fi TV Film. It's a great Star Trek and a bit of X-files, but more than anything else that's boring. <br /> <br /> When a movie starts, everything is predictable and cliche. It seemed more than 2 parter of a bad sci-fi TV series. There is no tension or excitement, but no lack of capture. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
