The film starts with a couple of campers, a man and a woman probably together, hiking alone in a large desert. Of course, that person hears something and he puts him so much that he is studying it. Our killer welcomes her on her stomach. Then he pursues the girl and cuts her throat. Camera opening during scene is in the killer sense. <br /> <br /> Next we will meet our four main characters, two pairs, one of which is on the rocks. Men joke how a woman can never do camping alone on a double date, creating a symbolic blonde's ambition to leave a week ago. Unexpectedly, men leave the same day and their car breaks down. They arrive in the evening. When men arrive, they are warned that people will disappear in the woods crazy Ralph doppleganger. They ignore the warning and bet on a dark night, and in the background of the eighties songs, there are lyrics about killing them in the dark forest. Men disappear. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not yet the Burning clone, but a ghost story! Women, scared and lonely, come on fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play Tom. Well, they are obviously ghosts, how their voices are echoing! Their mother feels the blood dripping from her forehead hole and asks the two ladies if they have seen their children before they disappear. <br /> <br /> The kids drive to Papa and talk about two beautiful women by the river. It causes confusion and rises, grabbing his knife from the fireplace. "The father continues to hunt," the little girl shouts badly. It is obvious that the father is not like his children a ghost. <br /> <br /> There is something in the woods outside, the symbolic blonde splits, dazzling at night with a knife. He meets a father who explains that he is hungry and it's fast. It makes no sense, because the panthers who have heard before will start to worry. The rain swells and men are looking for a refuge that turns out to be where the priest lives. It is clear that someone lives here because there is a fire and something strange to roast on it. Children will appear and warn them of the priest who will see the moments later. They disappear immediately after arrival. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer is still for women. He calls men to eat and tells us about his former wife. We'll be beating our wife's beating. The old man does not tell them, however, that he will kill him and his lover later, but dreams about it. We do not give children a cause of death. Men go to bed and remain intact. The next morning, men will discover their wife's empty camp. After a short discussion, they were divided. One is to stay at a campsite, the other goes and gets help. The one who goes back to his car stops his leg. Then we are reunited with the children when they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves for their mother's sorrow. They agree to help a woman reunite with her friends. <br /> <br /> The next scene will not let the logic of the movie when Papa kills a man waiting in camp. He was also a dating or married blonde. Somehow, children understand that he is being murdered and told to the woman. He decides to see it, and probably the killer gets. Fortunately, the children stop him, threatening to leave him forever. You know where it goes. <br /> <br /> In general, the film deserves ten stars out of four stars and is generous. In all your doubts, the musical result is well done. It is still traceable. There are some camera angles that look professional and some kits are well done. The plot is incredible. There is such a thing as an incredible ready suspension, but with a toad at 6 miles; I can't imagine a symbolic blonde being in the middle of the evening at that time. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
