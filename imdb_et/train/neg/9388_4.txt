A former biased eye-turned security worker is ditching his last droning job and is immediately offered the opportunity to return to his previous profession. His task: to force a mysterious French woman who has arrived in California recently ... and apparently wanted suit-ties. An unsuccessful attempt to refresh the genre of the film's noir, without sufficient stitching or thought (or ground dynamics), in the scenario. Director and co-founder Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the picture was taken without his involvement) does not impress the high respect of his 40th films for his "Chandler"; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter and somewhat indifferent. Handling is curiously, proudly low, and Warren Oates is the '70's ​​version of the' private egg 'archetype, but the film has no picture. Nice to see Leslie Caroni and Gloria Graham - although neither of them is much to do, Caron's hot and cold running nature is irritating. A lively movie by Alan Stensvold, a nice place to take a picture, but it won't boil. * 1/2 from ****
