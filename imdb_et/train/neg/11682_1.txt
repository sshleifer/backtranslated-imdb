Not now? Given all the good work done by danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film never became more than a terrible die-hard / heist movie. Yes, a couple of jokes, no unpredictable twists, to be honest, are the only unpredictable moments, because both the director and the editor made some foolish mistakes, for them it is a shame and a waste of time. If somebody can tell me why they were digging on the earth, who the fuck is Rebe, and how on earth they know that diamonds were in a particular cell, it may just be my day, but it seems that Spike asks us in this matter for granted take too many things and don't lift your eyebrows if something seems stupid ... this one more studio movie will relax and enjoy ...
