When it was released, it was the biggest hit and soon it became Blockbuster. But to be honest, the film is a ridiculous clock with a plot that praises the loser. The film is Tag-line - "Preet Madhura, Tyaga Amara", which means sweetness of love, but the victim is immortal. In the film, the film's hero (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for a leading woman (Pooja Gandhi), although two loved one another! His reasoning is the meaning of the bridge line. This film influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this "Loser-like sacrifice" attitude to be very thoughtful and became a cult film if they had moved on with their lives. Ganesh acts in Amateurish, Crass and Childishly stupid. She sees the song (Onde Ondu Sari ...) funny when she should be all stylish and cool. His appearance also does not play a leading role. Her hair style is badly made in most parts of the film. GIVE GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are terrible and inconsistent in the film. <br /> <br /> The good part of the movie is my Murthy's great cinematic art and brilliant music, which is actually the true savor of the movie. Also Jayant All's words are very well recorded. Director Yograj Bhati must be respectfully decorated with songs. <br /> <br /> Anyway, except for songs, the movie is very common !!!!!!
