There have been some moments in my life when I'm confused and depressed. One of them was sitting in the Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were there. There is no premiere (even the stars did not want to participate) and there were no comments in the magazines. The only reason I sat in the movie was in the hope that I could get to sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing about the movie was explained. Talking was idiotic. I was delighted at one moment when the film's director had shot, then to my growing despair, it turned out that he wasn't really thrilling. I sincerely hope that all those involved in the film will hang for this cruelty. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mostly unwanted humor. For example, a scene where the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the need to manually release the toilet, while telling the next cab that he will put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can't explain the anger that I feel, so I'll stop it. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: For sadists, wastes and regressives who want to torture themselves.
