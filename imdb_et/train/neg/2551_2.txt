Deceiving twilight lies on the cover, "fun like an American pie", my girlfriend, and I sat in front of the TV, waiting for comedy ... and that's definitely not one. You probably do not laugh once, if you are not one of those Jackass-like eternal minds. It's not even an erotic movie, at least something, because it's related to sex ... <br /> <br /> What is that? The uneven plot deals with a man who wants to lose his innocence (zero in originality, I remember losing one) and his circle of friends. The remaining characters (i.e., girls) come and do not go credibly. Come on, there's even a dwarf (so simple: "dwarves are fun ho ho ...") The actor is very television-like (just like watching the video in the whole movie) and definitely an amateur for most girls. ... <br /> <br /> Acute movie. Amateur, poorly produced, and NOT ALL. Children and teenagers love to watch it with friends because they have sworn and have sex. Apart from that, even the rental of this movie does not matter.
