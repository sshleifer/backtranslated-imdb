I read this Thornton Wilder game last year in eighth grade. I was forced to sit on the screen with this weak translation. Let me tell you, it's not a terrible game, it's just overrun, but a person deserves a much better fire. The action was really incomplete, the landscapes that were honest with God looked like it was designed by three-year-old groups of cardboard. As if it did not deteriorate, the sound quality is weak ... this is the moody "buzz" when the actor speaks ... and I too could not notice that chemistry between George and Emily, well, is nonexistent. The actors all seem very uncomfortable there. No music. It's black and white, which would be OK, but it brings out the cheese. In any case, I think if you intend to see this movie, which I really don't want, then your hopes will not be high. The game is probably better than it is.
