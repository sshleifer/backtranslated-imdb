This movie is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actors - all! It's hard to imagine that we will see a worse film this year or the following years. "The Brother of Love" (a group of immigrants from Australia in Australia) offers nothing more than Italian culture, and it says that even Italians in Italy and Italy speak English in the film. Movie message - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - it's really inconvenient. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good in films like "Suburbia" or "Lost in Translation," but here's his pseudo-Italian accent hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash bin!
