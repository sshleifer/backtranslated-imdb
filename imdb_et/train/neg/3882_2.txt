Why do I do it myself? I mean, it's really there in the title - "Incredible Melting". What else do I expect? I have to admit that I am almost something I encounter on the Monster HD channel, but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be the legendary work of the legendary Rick Baker. Like the horrible, I give this horny old geezer couple who sucks the lemons just before the lights. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something that I could never think of as terrifying was why the victims of the monster simply did not run away when they were virtual destruction. Like a chick in the cab. You knew that the door in the kitchen was perfectly visible, so that she could drive away at any time. The incredible Steve-O couldn't collect much more than a brisk walk, so why not just blow him? I don't know, maybe I'm missing something. <br /> <br /> This flick was a bit of a "Tales From The Crypt" episode, but "Tales" was usually a cool or grotesque twist that often didn't see coming. It was one picture that you didn't get in hand when you came or go. For example, you can clearly point out in the early scene that the melting man's eyeball fell out of his head, so how did he manage the rest of the story? I don't think we should ask for it. <br /> <br /> Eighty-four minutes, this picture was about one and a half hours long. When it was all over, I was ready to take up my general recommendation from General Perry - "I could really drink right now".
