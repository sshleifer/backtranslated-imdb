This is the biggest bunch I ever watched. DO NOT rent! The makers of this movie should be a band that never makes a second movie. It starts with some of the plot, something disappears quickly. I think I'd rather look at the color when I look at the cover. The actors were terrible, the plot speed and filming were a lot of work to do. Not one good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie, you waste your money. I really enjoy the National Lampoon movies, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to lead. I feel like I should complain about those a-holes that made this movie for the money wasted on rental costs and lost time.
