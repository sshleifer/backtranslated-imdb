What can I say? I'm a secret fan of "up" and horror movies. Especially when it comes to lots of humor and enthusiasm, but I'm not a Scheduled Snake fan. <br /> <br /> There are three potential drawings for this movie: ?? Situation comedy; ? Horror; and ?? The novelty of a hundred snake is a plane. First of all, this movie is not written as a language-in-cheek horror or comedy, and there is only 1 or 2 point movie where you smile yourself. If you want to feel the movie, the trailer really represents the movie, horror. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you are expecting a movie full of action and shock, you will not be disappointed. It is no different from other movies, but it always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Third, although the novelty of Plane's snakes doesn't go away, but you leave cinema thinking "what was all the noise". <br /> <br /> I know this film has a high rating, but it doesn't add. A) Many reviews written before the release of the movie, and B) The distribution of user ratings is much less variable than the usual 77% of people who appreciate the film, only 7% of people give it 9/10 - Why the difference?
