I'm surprised how many anti-Christian pseudo-documentary films got a good rating. Now I respect the boy's opinion and belief, I myself am not a believer in the Christian doctrine taught in this state. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a somewhat different issue. <br /> <br /> This movie has the right points, but they are very small and represented in a very biased context. I don't recommend seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more than the possibility given by the director to Christian teachings. Instead of asking a question, it seems that it is a Christian school that influenced his childhood. It also often depicts Christians, both incredibly naive and fundamentalist, with some moderation. <br /> <br /> The director uses the scenes of the film without Christ's passion, creates an interview with his director in a former school and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I found that the director is the lowest person and I think his attitude is completely justified. I also doubt that some of the interviewed Christians were believed after being questioned or even the purpose of the interview. <br /> <br /> That's definitely new and interesting facts. here and some very original ideas about Christianity. But how this whole thinks is often offensive, very unprofessional, and terribly biased.
