Stanley Kramer manages the action thriller and omits the two main things: action and excitement. The principle of DOMINO includes a convicted offender from Gene Hackman to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his employees - they probably work for the government, but like most of the film's line, it has never been made clear. Hackman asks many questions you NEVER answer so that the movie goes anywhere. While DOMINO PRINCIPLE is trying to be NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, it's confusing and confusing with confusion and boredom. The film is very well photographed, but even against it. Kramer's direction is not in any style. This is a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> The actor is good with Hackman, proving he can't be bad. Widmark and Wallach are inappropriately disgusting and Albert is a cruel shortage of Widmark. Even the usual unpleasant Mickey Rooney is pretty good at Hackman's sidekick. But it is strange to cast Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We were told he had been in prison for a while and he seemed to be trying to put some kind of lunch. Kramer's idea to make him a trailer trash is to wear a ugly brown wig. This role is better for Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
