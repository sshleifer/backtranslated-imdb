What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean, first, that I love Seagal. I love all my movies until the mid-2000s. His early things are the best in the genre. However, this does not correspond to its excellent name. Assault Force (with Marshall Lawson's {Seagal} protagonist) is expected to be a frantic action movie on a one-liner ass shot with Seagal. But what we get is a criminal secret that is little or no border with a political thriller. Seagal is always in the shade because of his shadow. I couldn't follow that story. There are people who mutate to superhumons when they take the medicine. What happened in this movie. Seagal duplication is a disgrace, shame and shame. Why copy a man? The story is terrible. It got me on a 2/10 scene where Seagal asks for backups with the army with him, and a fun fighting scene where his hands move like a camera! "Revenge is a Two Way Street" Seagal says in this movie ... forget about revenge Steven, you need redemption!
