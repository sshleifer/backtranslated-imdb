I thank G_d for being bombarded, or we could treat such joy as "Skate Fu", where we see, like Brian Boitano, who fills the triple lutz & slashing bad guys with tapes with their sharp skates, but I'm grounding. One thing that could have helped this turkey be a little T&A by Mrs Agbayan. It's not like the world would have seen something new (at least the part of the world that saw its Playboy spread). One explanation for Kurt Thomas's presence may be traumatic brain damage. It is good that IOC was not as careful about "doping" as it is now, or Kurt would have been removed from his medals. Must be avoided at all costs.
