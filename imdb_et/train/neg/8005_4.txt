Gwoemul (Host) - Due to the pollution of the Han River, the mutated beast goes into rampage. The youngest member of the best family is stolen by the beast and his remaining family must find him before he gets the last meal of the beast. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love monsters movies: Mutated bears, alligators too big, bunches of Komodo dragons, a whole lot. Creature functions are my favorite horror movie. So, I really wanted to be The Host, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> There were three main problems: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen quickly on IMDb <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci -Fi / Triller <br /> <br /> Too many fucking genres. It took the comedy too seriously, but it was too easy for the heart to have a real message (though it seemed trying to make a statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in confusing mish-mash with all other styles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the first monster attack, almost nothing will happen to the whole movie. The central family travels to look for one, while Korean and American governments probably do nothing. And that is the way they just migrate, occasionally striking each other, probably a bit of comedy relief. This kind of disruption made me stand out and apparently did the same for the director, because the whole plot's threads are unresolved (the mysterious plague created by the bad Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). > Finally, the film is harshly political. It paints the Americans stupid and evil, but doesn't give us any deeper American characters than a comic. Opening the scene is the most obvious silly American vs smart Korean moment. Korean morgue assistant who asked his boss, the coroner, not to carry chemicals into Han. An American coroner all but breaks manic when he tells the assistant to continue. It's also racist, it's lazy making movies, and there's no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is good, a mix of relics and deep rise. Some motion effects are quite cool and the initial monster chase through the park is fun. The movie also has some nice shots. Some of them remind me strangely how Firefly was filmed (shaking cameras, focus shots, etc.). Finally, there is also a nice scene where the hero and the little boy he has recorded are sitting in the family. mobile food awning. It is at night and the snow falls, the street light gives cold light, but the grocery store is hot. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very disappointed with this movie. I was waiting for a decent creature, and instead I get a pseudo-political, horror-comedy lite. Looking at IMDb's comments, I can't guess that if it had been US production, it would have split. Just because it's a foreign flick, it doesn't mean anything good. In recent years, Korea has released great films (such as trilogy of revenge and fraternity), but it is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> Once I am in favor of remake. Tighten control, improve scripting, and it could have been a nice movie. As it is, it's not worth a few hours for someone.
