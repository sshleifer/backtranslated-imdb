Nowadays, there is a tendency to look at all exhibitions as a classic from the beginning of the 90s (people are so easily blinded to nostalgia), and although some of these exhibitions were / are undoubtedly good, it's just pure. I looked at this example a lot these days, because he then got a lot of TV again and didn't even like it as a child. Even 8-year-olds see how much Power Rangers are overwhelming and how much special FX sucks back. If the exhibition is not used painfully for bad "fighting scenes", it will hit the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera for a teenage group, and they are always small social problems. I don't know about you, but I didn't give it to the rats, and it's the main filler until they have to fight some guys again in a very nice alien costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. You never feel in any way "involved" with this example, and the fact that most of the actors act as there is no interest in the wallet but increases the lack of hours. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing memorable about this show, and it's surprising that he got so much spin-off (Beetleborg is a good example). All this is just a quick way to make money. I challenge every "fan" to tell me exactly what it looks like in episodes that should be so good because I could not find something that is even somewhat attractive to children. I think most of the Power Rangers fans tell me that I just don't get it, or something on this line. I really don't care about it; it was then a mess and it still craps.
