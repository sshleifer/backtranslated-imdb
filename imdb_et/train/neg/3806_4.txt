My wife and I thought this film was a TV version of Manhattan's mystery of murder ... (which is in itself a good but not a big one). The story is characterized by little character and chemistry, not a lot of plot. The character of Woody Allen is just a moving mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson have nothing more. I must be disappointed, I have to say. Ian McShane's role is just an expanded outfit. <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was "I don't know how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to get out of Manhattan?" He needs this money, and they must have demanded their call to expand their audience outside the youth market, which has been moved to two stars. I'm going to give 3 stars instead of this movie because it's a strange background noise. If you want something to happen during the knitting or sorting of your stamp collection, it works. I don't have to rent it again.
