Here is one of those short films made for learning the lives of unknown people. This time, the target group is the preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, is probably sponsored by Kotex. <br /> <br /> It begins with an explanation of how hormones grow and develop. With animation and a female narrator, this shows how the body, especially the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, work and why it all causes menstruation. It is almost amazing, becoming a comic here, how to avoid gender issues. Even this word is not mentioned, although "furtilized" goes once. I don't really know why I saw it, but because it is one of those rare short films that could give the impression of innocent time, you might want to try it.
