It can often be said that the film did not prove to be difficult for the narrator to use. This movie contains this device. Richard Jobson is not entirely happy to write direct and even financial resources. This film adds excerpts from its semi-autobiographical writing when reading its credit, which, in combination with some editing, can shine, which is a boring frustrating story he must mislead for a true art building. Kevin McKidd does well. All others are fine. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints meant that all scenes were shot in daylight, although most of them are probably at night, even though if you know serious alcoholics, they mostly work on the day, so that adds to this realistic touch. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is the waitress, who can't one day in the 20th few years between his performances - the more extreme version of the problem on McKidd is the one who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than her clothes. Blessing.
