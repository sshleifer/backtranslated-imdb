If we were in a youth school, some of our boys would have dropped stinkbombs from time to time. It was funny then. But the producers, directors and directors of "Semana Santa" ("The Angel of Death") are adults in your local video DVD and have set them down at STILL. <br /> <br /> Like the previous reviewer who was wondering if it was cast to go home and go home, I doubt more than one scene has been made. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, the hot "Mighty Aphrodite" and elsewhere in the estimated films, has signed the project. His action is not at all, limited mainly to fascinating characters, which should show how "sensitive" he is to the situation of the various victims of the film. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - don't be the next victim! When you find it on the shelf, get away from the DVD. Tbere does not have much good footprints on Mira (the only higher points I can find in the film) and the supportive cast quality is worse by providing a poorly made dialogue with the embarrassing "Spanish" accent that deserves the best high school theater production.
