My husband rented it from a video store, I thought it was a relationship. (She never reads the summary). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be funny if the thing was traceable. It's just not. Same thing over and over again, intrigue, and where did they find the leading person? The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even feasible, especially for the role he has given. Also, sexual harassment at work is something you want to see, rent Michael Crichton's "Disclosure". At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is usually observable, is embarrassed here. There are also light effects cheaper than your home web cam. Don't even waste time renting it. 0/10.
