This movie tried to do too many things at once: a passionate political satire, a Hollywood fear game, a lovely romantic comedy, family values ​​promo ... the list goes on and on. All of them failed, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off to the end. <br /> <br /> Though I appreciate the soul behind WAR, INC. inconvenient effort, especially if its targets reflect the lack of serious criticism, not just the poor writing, directing and production of this film. <br /> <br /> Criticism of War Corporation. But having fun in this way reduces what's happening. Reminds me of a bit of THREE KINGS, which is similarly trivializing real concern.
