There seems to be a little curse when it comes to gay movies. Namely, happy endings are not very common. Apart from the beautiful Thing, gay movies tend to end in broken relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, just end in the ... period. The creators of this terrible nonsense have a thing or two to learn about the plot, direction and schedule. In the first ten minutes of this movie, I found myself a little confused and even more so after the first glimpse of the character of Jeremie Elkim who had a small psychological session. This film seems to have been randomly cut without trying to be consistent or consistent. There is no real chance to say if you look at the current or some kind of ethereal rebound. I could only do so much before it became really unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden The New York Times called this movie "... brightly beautiful and absolutely real." Well, it seems that Stephen invested in beer goggles before viewing, because it is really far from beautiful. Thanks to the praise given to this film, I was expecting something worth seeing. Unfortunately, the film lived on its title. At the end of the movie (which did not give any resolution, I can add) it is clear that all the writers, the director and the film have all come.
