Not sure why this movie seems to have received such dirty comments. The whole film seems to be something other than the filmmaker's practice of meaningless, artistic fartsy feeling. The fact that the director / writer goes with a single moniker, but strengthens this pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> People interested in indie flicks would be better off searching for something better written and dare to say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.
