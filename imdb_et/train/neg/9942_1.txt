At least the theaters in the theater were comfortable and I ate pop music as loud as possible to lower the inferior dialogue. It's not an absolutely girls' movie. All those who like it are the ones we definitely can't get. Dark story, mediocre dialogue and a general cheap movie. I've seen many movies, but it's a new winner in a bad category. When you see it, one thing you expect is the end. So you can end up with the theater as soon as possible.
