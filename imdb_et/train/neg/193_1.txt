Norman Maclean's story is crafting; Redford's film is mediocre. He adds the banal scenes of Maclean brothers that go over the fall and double-acquaintance with the seeding bar, which was not even hinted at. The symbol, Brad Pitt, who tries to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, out of genius, proves that it is foolish or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the flying scenes are beautiful. Tom Skerritt, as father and Craig Sheffer Norman, is also strong and masculine, as men were once expected. No woman is impressed by the film, which is unfortunate, because Maclean loved her story and made it clear, even poetic.
