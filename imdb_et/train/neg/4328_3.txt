The title of each "National Lampoon" is completely guaranteed to die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It may be a US institution, but in Europe, this virtually unknown "National Lamp of Europe" is not capable of improving this situation. The terrible Griswald is just that - terrible. They're not funny. It is clear that Mr. Chevy Chase thinks he is funny after Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot of fun, but he gets paid for it and did not pay 2.50 pounds for the privilege. England has a typical part. The same old old TV artists, Idle Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman, threw the same old old tired clich√©s, Mr. Chase disappeared in the hotel corridor. fuck, fuck .. Bucking - ham's palace, big ben ...... I feel cheated that we didn't see two bicycles twice on bicycles ......... rosie red cheeks - dren, i have to go ? English is buffalo, French witch - tongued Yank-haters.The Germans pompous and puffed up, (don't mention war, Clark) and Italians lecherous north-pinchers.Have I forgotten something? Every possible "comic" situation has worked to death, Mr Chase desperately throws, Miss di Angelo pleasantly, the children are embarrassingly bad. The fact that this franchise ran as long as it happened must bring comfort to those who claim that you will never lose money by underestimating the public taste.
