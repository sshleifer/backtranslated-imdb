Wow ... OK. So, after I barely read here, I decided to see this movie for myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching it. We strongly advise you to clean the cabinet instead of watching the movie, get more spooked / entertained. <br /> <br /> This is a small budget with bad actions. <br /> <br /> Who makes this movie in 10 is completely wrong and should not be counted. <br /> <br /> I am in no way involved with any other reviewer. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth it. <br / Very <br /> Very very shy movie.
