Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books, and this may be a great literature, this cinema adaptation sucks because it is more like fighting a dream than enjoying some cinematic delicacies. The story speaks of an old couple whose son died and lives a life that is heavily dominated by poverty and where the main character is a cock, which I hope will one day lead to money for future racing. I have no mood to spread more words with this unnecessary piece of pretense, maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but are you sitting 90 minutes on your screen just for that? No Gracias .....
