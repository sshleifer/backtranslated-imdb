Having become a heart and seeing his way wrong, a bad guy Jim wants to become a sheriff and confess, but Pete shoots him. Jim has been telling his doctor and his sister Anne at the time of the blow. In the unbelievable scene, Anne rushes to the center of the sheriff for a bomb attack between the right boys and the villains. <br /> <br /> The Desert Trail is one of Lone Star's John Wayne western peoples. Productions during this era. Noticeably, George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both are usually in these oaks. If you are a fan of John Wayne, you have to see it once, but that's enough.
