This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If anyone offers you this for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you know as a criminal that you watched it. The plot is not even the worst part of this movie ..... its functioning, camera work, lighting and sound. there is nothing pleasant about this movie. who has paid for this movie is now broken. I hope the director will never get the movie green. This movie was protected quickly to try to take advantage of the actual capture of the BTK killer, but I've seen films of the week that looked like Oscar winners.
