In the first coagulation, we introduce a world where there are werewolves and are somewhat organized. There is some point in this film; The TV reporter is investigating this and trying to discover the truth. He must finally kill many of them, including his boyfriend, who gets one. Then he shows the world that they exist, making a living television. Special effects were just ridiculous in the first movie and they don't get better. Whether it's transformations or bad dolls or superpowers that show superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not so bad; they must kill the werewolf manager for some reason. It doesn't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the werewolves threat because it ... they just want to kill him. I think there was some blur for this, but it really disappears in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the "end" of the movie, we have a 10-minute movie we watched and every other scene is one where the witch's female driver hangs on her top exposing her big breasts while some Devo-esquire band is playing crowd crowd. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie even traceable is Christopher Lee.
