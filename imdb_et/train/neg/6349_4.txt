Woody Allen has made some of the greatest comedies and I would seriously consider Annie Hall to be the biggest film ever, but if I really think about it, I probably think of one or two that is better, but that would be difficult. He has, of course, been some of the films that are not very good, but not as bad as the mystery of the Manhattan murder and Sweet and Lowdown, but he has never been such a bad film as Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and so weird that his movies are usually funny and fun, but how did it happen, is it still our old Woody? The plot has about four friends who eat with dinner. Two are feature films and one of the others mentions the funny story that happened to his friend. It's about a young woman who suddenly breaks a dinner party. We never hear the rest because these two games start with a debate about whether it makes a better comedy or tragedy. When we see two views. Both are named as Melinda, who has problems with both drugs and her former husband. In a tragedy, she is a friend of an old family who, after attempting suicide, obviously decided, without reason, to appear in front of her older friends. Comedy is Melida, who goes after dinner after opening 28 sleep drops. Both move with the wind of natural revolutions that never make sense or fit and do not laugh more than once or twice. Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrelli have performed some nice shows, but they can't put it together. They won't stop it deeper than most other movies this year.
