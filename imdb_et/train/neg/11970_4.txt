... that Lt would have chosen it. First, the film was not terrible, it was just Hollywood. The worst case when I need a-this-case-or-email-non-movie scenario: when Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but he was firmly convinced that his "people" would make the missionary out, he would have put it first chopper and marched these refugees to the border without him. He would not have threatened his package for refugees. It is not like that. But as I noted, it's Hollywood, we have to have a drama. That's why we make movies because reality is not that complicated. But I thought Willis and a good doctor had a reliable chemistry. This means there are some well-made battle scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, "Sun Tears" is worth the dvd charge. Check it out on a rainy day and you're happy.
