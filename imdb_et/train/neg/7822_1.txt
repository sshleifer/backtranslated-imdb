This movie is a very bad attempt to make money with the classic theme. I loved the Superman movies, but it made me want to shoot myself. Very bad performance, unheard of special effects and plot equal to zero. In summary: Superman leaves the country because the scientists discovered the pieces of their home plan, some were in the space (duh), not telling their girlfriend before leaving (again), rising on the spacecraft (?!?), Coming back I think 5 years later, and I look forward to grabbing my girlfriend (who now kidnaps her son, whose son, in my humble opinion, is at least 7 years old). And how does Lex Luthor? Trying to grow a new continent to sell land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I will vote for one of 10 movies just because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have some time in your time, don't go see this movie and even if you have nothing else to do, stay home and watch TV!
