I say this a lot - this director is RAW-images ... things that most of us are not ready to confront. Sex, suicide, murder, and images that relieve people are constantly being bombarded by the viewer, so I don't know if the director tried to release or release. Although I don't think I can ever see this movie, I say the director has a good eye. The movie really had nice shots and "moments of the picture" (fans, hair fish in your hair), but the story needed more than that (strictly because we left ourselves wondering what the hell we did) look only? "). <br /> <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to grasp or vomit easily, you will not see this movie.
