Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. It's a good idea and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times in countless movies. The higher the learning after the package sets, it is that it deals with the issue of racism, which is the most tempting and predictable way, yes, it is also in college. <br /> <br /> This film discusses the racism of this problem, how Frankenstein deals with most of the problems, it puts you over and over again brutally and slowly. Most characters are cartoons, one-dimensional caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man) who react as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of protecting stereotypes, this film has survived with them. Angry black men feel deceived, feminists hate men, and so on. (One feminist even has a sign that says "Dead Men Don't Rape." See what I mean?) I don't want to give away anything but a movie if someone seems like a sparse individual or a journalist they're likely to behave exactly . The changes that the signs go through are obvious to everyone except the people in the film. The great twist of the plot depends on whether the violent neo-Nazis act like violent neo-Nazis. I think you just have to look to find out what happens. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this movie is that it should be "sharp" and "hard to catch", but they are making the Nazis bad. I agree that the Nazis are evil, but that is my thing. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; we don't break any new bases. The Nazis have been depicted in roses since the 1930s. The film does not contradict any point of view and makes bold statements. It only deals with the problems we all know about the clumsy, post-school characteristics. The fight against violence, anti-racism and anti-Nazis is not a difficult stance on a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Higher education is predictable, caricature and the word "stupid". Avoid at all costs.
