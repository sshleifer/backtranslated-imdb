I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to get very hard on it. Speaking of Vivah, this man, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have lost it. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with fun wedding videos. Vivah is so funny that Badjatyas is behind Johars and Chopras. <br /> <br /> There was no moment in the movie where I can say, "Oh! at least this is good ”. Aloknath makes her daughter in the role of a cliché, Shahid Door looks like fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another catastrophe, in addition to the ugly look, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monster stepmother, aspirations to act, acoustic background music cheap tracks. Now, as a spoiler, I warn you that like all his films, after the end of an unhappy movie, a happy note.
