When Edward Woodward was the film that was watching this movie, he scared it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but enough. We had to get Carter, the Italian job, Alfie and now it. What are similarities? No. It's not exactly a coincidence that three original stars Maurice Micklewhite and other stars are another great British actor. The main common ingredient of these originals is the Britishity of films. They didn't impress Hollywood. They were peculiar English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that cannot be repeated in the United States. The word is CULT and what better way to destroy the cult film, not to rewrite it or even to follow it. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 was a difficult task before it even reached the road. Wicker 73 is even more strange that other mentioned cult films; it violates genre, intelligent scripts, A-class actors, music scores, inappropriate pieces, and all the stories surrounding the movie. <br /> <br /> So here you have to do it again. Do not worry. Originals were not damaged when making this redesign. For the modern US, some of the main aspects of the story had to be recast - communications, paganism, virgins. But this is almost the whole assumption. So we give the policeman a Nam-style trauma that has been overcome by shock-music setbacks for cheap fears. Then without the mobile phone masts on the island that sort the communication - but in the real world it wouldn't happen. Cops just don't go missing. Give him the blood link to motivation, not to collision with beliefs, and you have a remake. Lay thin, isn't it? <br /> <br /> It was just that it was put together with the bell. The name changes were just hammy, almost Carry On, there was no community feeling on the island, no center to catch your bearings, but some houses dotted around the forest and that was it. Willow was just annoying because he didn't give any information and Cage was useless to go away with him. When he went well, I knew he would lock it. The scenario was finished to the end - and you just wanted it to be fast and complete. The epilogue was completely fun and didn't know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This end is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. One ends with the most beautiful sunset after the most terrible day. The other ends are the explanation of the final product-it-all-to-the-thickies type conclusion. <br /> <br /> I loved the original, but I went to the cinema openly and was glad to see the movie. I was grateful, knowing that this film could probably end up on the road somewhere when it was forgotten forever.
