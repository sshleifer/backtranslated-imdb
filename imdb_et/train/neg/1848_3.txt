There are some bad films, so there are so bad movies that they are becoming almost art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still both shocked by the shock, knowing, watching the space and torment! You can say that the people involved (I hope they changed their name to protect themselves) were burst and they were certainly not shy. I give it one out of ten out of ten just because it's free and very bad. I laughed loudly during most of the film, so I think I could say that it showed me a good time. Beware the viewer, the words above do not mean in any way that this is a good movie because it is not. All I can say about my defense is that such a GREAT title could not be passed on to the movie!
