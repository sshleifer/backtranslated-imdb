Well, I'm gonna admit I'm not a John Ford fan. (I looked at the "informer" just because I was trying my way through the "greatide" list.) So if you are, just pass by because you disagree with me. /> <br /> What it is a piece of burned and dated fool! I say here is a good movie idea (it made me think how few movies are in the Irish Revolution), but as usual, Ford has decided to bury it with a too functional and cheap mindset. I think for some time it is somewhat interesting to see that the quieter "chat rooms" made less than a smooth transition - some principals' action styles are such that early quality is early films and the film does not feel it could play better with title cards than talked about dialogue. (Of course, title cards prevent Ford from repeating emotional emotions every month.) What dialogue is usually "They are always Lucky Charms after me!" quality, which is aggravated by the fact that each participant seems to be allowed to use their own version of Irish accents. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are reminding us that we are in Ireland because the kits look mostly like they were pulled from some of the next pieces of German film expressionist filmed. (It looks like an eagle's eye would see some villagers stay in the burner with Dr. Frankenstein.) <br /> <br /> Techniques are changing. Tasting changes. So I'm not going to look how crazy it seems that this movie was so well recognized today. But this is not one of the classics that keeps a fairer warning of what is an overly simplified malarkey that Ford was going to devote to his career.
