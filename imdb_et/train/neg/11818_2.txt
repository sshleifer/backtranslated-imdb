On a distant planet, the psychoate of the cosmos is saved from being filled. He releases a couple of companions and leaves the prison on the spacecraft. They are docking ridiculously on a huge spacecraft that comes from a supernova star. There are only three people living in this huge craft, probably because the film's budget does not extend to hiring many participants. Anyway, for a short story to cut short, the three goodies reach the game of malignant cats and mice. <br /> <br /> The psychopath in this movie is curious that he is annoying. "Disturbing" is not generally a term that could be used to describe lunatic - unhinged, scary, dangerous maybe but not "annoying" but it is. Three people who have driven a gigantic ship are seriously unconvinced that they consider such important roles to be right - this ship is practically the size of the city! Given that the film will be around 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge artificial craft may exist, not to forget that it is used to perform such a relatively daily task. Despite the large size of the spacecraft, the crew is all terribly wrinkled, small rooms and dining rooms consist of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The film works pretty well and works as an average sci-fi thriller. But something big.
