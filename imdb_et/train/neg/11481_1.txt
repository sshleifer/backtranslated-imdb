If they could get Ed Asner, why didn't they get other actors, not people who go to the same church as the producers? And why the main character stopped the land when he was never in danger. It forced the old man to frustrate the pride of the injury and the young boy was guilty of leaving him with a life-long disability. I think that is why the main character refuses for money and why the old man works for him as a dog even when he does extra work as a volunteer. If a d-bag boy is a bad guy because he is a long-distance boyfriend, why is a soldier better. He has a good reason to be jealous, a good reason to stay away from his home town and under the control of a protective, manipulative father. All the symbols that are meant to be pleasing are not, and everyone else is a "bad" boy. How did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a sawmill worker?
