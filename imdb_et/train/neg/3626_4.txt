I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they have to see some pretty hard things to see if he can give it the Oscar with the best picture. I know that fortunately this was Gene Kelly's play or it would have been twice as bad as I believe. First of all, I don't think Leslie Caron was very suitable for playing such a role. He's not so talented, he's not a big dancer, and isn't good at all. It is a shame that one actor or actor can destroy a movie as he plays, because if Leslie Caron hadn't done it, she could have made a fantastic movie. The story was smart, management was not bad, and as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all about Leslie Caron to criticize her. I'm just saying this because I think it's the worst part of the movie. He's probably a good actor, but I can't say it because I haven't seen anything else, but I think he was pretty "American in Paris". So if you want to see it, go ahead, but I'll tell you you're looking at "Sing's" rain.
