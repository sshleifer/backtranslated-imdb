I saw this director's "woman on the beach" and didn't understand good big reviews. This film is very similar to two people who have been detained in relationships that have very little dynamic and even less interest. Like other movies, you need to listen to a silent dialogue, win very little and be able to capture hidden, rather uninteresting characters. If you feel like this movie, don't let my review stop you. I like minimalism in movies, but I feel that Tsai Ming-Liang's movies are much better. She is a pretty horrible actor in her films Lee Kang-Sheng. There's nothing here. I wish the IU liked it, but I don't. Oh, well.
