My one line summary should explain it all, but I'm going to go with it. <br /> <br /> Get-goi seemed like a superfluous soap opera, and that's all I can comment on. There were some interesting scenes like "Big" that hit the middle of the movie, but wait what is it? Earthquake * wakes up *, wait! This is Dante's tip! Well, its parts bought in and shot in. I can't believe how bad this film was, "borrowing" scenes from other, much better films. One wonders what the director thought the viewers were foolish enough to believe that the large wooded mountainous areas are downtown LA, Dante's peak. <br /> <br /> My recommendation, forget Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go to the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak randomly.) <br /> <br />
