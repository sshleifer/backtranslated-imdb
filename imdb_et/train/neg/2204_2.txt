I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. In theory, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best film ever. <br /> <br /> It's not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like Power Rangers and has about the same rubber movement. It may be okay if the makers are not as proud of their design as they seem. This means that for a large rubber costume that acts on a / scifi / horror flick that could benefit from some mystery, shark gets a lot of screen time. In this case, it is usually shaky and insecure. I think you should expect it to be so scary that the camera boy scares. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to the person who starts to eat, the camera sharks. The camera goes back to the eating person, only now they scream and armless. And so on. <br /> <br /> Costume is bad, actor is bad and special effects are all-par, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly, so more people can eat or something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made this movie definitely went on more explosions = better thinking. The characters are shooting cars and there is a huge explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a huge explosion. Barrels, stones, trees, WHATEVER, they all explode so much that freaking sharks even explode. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this, I don't care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that someone thinks they are trying to make a giant half-shark with a woman sexual to make amazing shark people children is a good idea. This means that this person is the mad scientist of this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that the film is so casual (and sometimes boring) that even this bad thing is not really enough to keep a person's long-term interest. MST3K may be good for your friends, but earlier, if you catch this bad boy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
