This film was potential, but what makes it really bad is the action of Lindsay Crouse. I've never seen her before and maybe there are some Crouse fans she likes, but her performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> His delivery is a robot. When he delivered his lines, he seemed to be trying to make sure he was on the line and read it off the list. So his voice is very little. I can't believe that someone who acted badly took the lead in the film. He must know someone who is a biz. <br /> <br /> Now I hate that means her, but the comment must be "long" and her performance is more than anything else. br /> <br /> But I liked where the story went, so I kept watching it. The first half of the script has a good movie. But the end was disappointing. Perhaps, if his action had been better, I would have liked it.
