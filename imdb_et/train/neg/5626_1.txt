I caught this movie on the tube on Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked at it in IMDb to see what others thought of it. I was not surprised by the stupid people who enjoyed this trial. However, I was surprised when I looked at the comments to read the hated categories only to find that their categories were not. I was shocked by it; I always look at hate because they are always the ones hating the movie no matter how good it is. In some way, this movie did it by the angry people I didn't say and proudly announce that I hate this movie! I know I should investigate in detail why I hate this movie, but only the film it deserves to do.
