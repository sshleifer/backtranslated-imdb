OK and another movie that I and Joe Swatman bought. OK, this is not the worst film I've been reviewing for a week, but it's still breastfeeding. we had fun watching this chick. <br /> <br /> Monster Jigsaw is the mish mash of all of these dysfunctional student ideas, u just know it's in trouble when someone supplies him with buzzsaw and the shotgun shot is not as gory as we hoped, it means death from heart attack. Again, I think the actor sucks, the amount of actors must be porn stars and one gets into his underwear for any reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the end, which leaves it open to some Jigsaw 2, but it is never the case. </p> <p> </p> <p> My Ratings: <br /> <br /> Funny 4/100 Mock (How Much Fun Have We Mocked) 73/100 Acting 8/100 Generally 12/100
