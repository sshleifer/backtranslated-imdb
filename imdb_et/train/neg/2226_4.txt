The DD movies were fucking, fucking fools and they had a plot that looked tough thin, but these days it was at least a plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just comedy, but melodrama, romance, and everything <br /> <br /> Every drama scene has been cleaned proportionally <br /> <br /> Comedy is funny but too funny But the movie keeps you entertained, the days when Govinda's movies were hard, crasses, but they had funny moments people enjoyed <br /> <br /> David Dhawan doing a good job Music is fine <br /> <br /> Govinda works well in comedy and drama Charisma in decent parts and irritates parts of Kader is like usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra is typical. Shakti is fun
