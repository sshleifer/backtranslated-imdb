I have to admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. It seemed good, acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and touching. Great Hollywood movie. But ... No one mentioned it so far (at least in the last 20 comments) when it came to the courtroom, and the character of Brat Pitti followed his plan to save his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, I felt cheated. This movie insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept their wrong alibi, which the priest admitted? If these two men were with him, why shouldn't they say it during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a jury judge or member, would you believe it? Is it worthwhile giving away the motives of the murderers? <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but in the end this story is very weak and it frustrates me. This film had great potential. 4/10
