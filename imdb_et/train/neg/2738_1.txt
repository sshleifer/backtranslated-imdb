The trash / bad movies are usually not bad because I find them enjoyable. It is so bad that I have spoken out of these words - below is "bad". At the beginning of the movie, there is a command that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, tutoring and a dozen beers couldn't sit with the whole movie. One tagliner compares it to KILLBILL, which is surely unthinkable and offensive to our intelligent. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you when buying this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting it, put it down! If you think about buying, don't think! If you don't want to play this dvd, throw it right into the trash.
