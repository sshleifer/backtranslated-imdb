Why do I watch such movies? If I have something strange misleading masochistic belief that one day I will find a real pearl between all that I can't think of. This movie tended to go from beginning to end, but half-fun. Where else, but in a poor Italian dubbed movie, you might want to find a surreal English-language exchange like an honest military type and secret X-files, like an organization dedicated to hiding "The Truth": \ t best until we can prove that UFOs have no bellic motives. <br /> <br /> Military Type: In any case, I find your abnormalities abusive. <br /> <br /> Man in black: Who needs to put his will in place is <br /> <br /> around the DVD (you know what I mean) is a good half a dozen times and I still can't get them Rows make something reasonable. My second stupid was: <br /> <br /> "We can be quite difficult for those who break our interests." <br /> <br /> This is English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this film, my eternal plotter, were completely separated from the beginning of the photographer's character. Suffering from the worst hairstyles of EVER in all history, the man just looked around, looking like a stunned fish wig until he was kidnapped and forced to look at some alien plexiglas. Aliens are not considered to be the most efficient POV cameras with fish-eye lenses - first horrible, but used over and over again, it lost its power (by chance, if it is the angle of view) This means that aliens will always get away from the room for some reason. ) <br /> <br /> The movie was set in "England". This meant that Spanish Italian language artists put some British license plates in a few English cars and put Jack on the Union for our hero's press card ... and that was it. No other attempt to make it out of the UK. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When Foley's artists didn't notice that the characters they were famous for (had such a word?), They didn't go to the gravel anymore, but were now on the lawn to have their legs cracked! Noise. In addition, another 90-minute waste disposal in my life. I hope they will prove that these UFOs will not soon have military motives ...
