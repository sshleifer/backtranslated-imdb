I looked for free money last night, and it was my 90+ minutes long. With such intriguing pain, I thought I was a treat - especially since I'm a Brando fan. ERROR! What a waste of talent. It is almost embarrassing to look from time to time (like a cattle-breeding scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setting (why didn't they show Charlie Sheen's character back to Brando's truck?) Ugh. It's trying to be a tiny comedy, but I just didn't buy it. Leave it out. Only for die-hard Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give it to 2 out of 10 because I think that the worst movie ever made was Skidoo.
