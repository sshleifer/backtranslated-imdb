I know that actors and actors want to try different movies - hey, nobody wants to get a forecast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known it better. "Angels in Outfield" is another movie where everything seems lost until someone or something magically arrives and saves the day. Do I even need to say how it ends? The film is just a little escapism (examples of high esapism are different sci-fi films from the 50s). If these films had any political undertones - or at least gave us a new look at life - then they would be fine; it's just pointless. Much closer to the devil than to the angel. Also starring at Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, I suspect that they do not want to emphasize it as they continue.
