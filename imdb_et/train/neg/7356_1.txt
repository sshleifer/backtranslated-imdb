I got that flick as it started, even in the afternoon, where I was at home with the flu - otherwise I would have forgotten it. It would probably have been the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good performers - and I thought it might be worth it. It turned out to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories that is so terrible that Zoes McLellan has little to suggest with his talents except his busty Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson. Unfortunately, his ability to act - at least here - makes comparing Mansfield and Anderson to Garbo or Davis. <br /> <br /> The white nut of the young nut case, the owner's cat, the young walnut head, whose owner was raised and stiffened in his home, and a number of doophuses (including young walnut blush) running around the biological threat facility, and an absurd conclusion. I waited at least for some scene or plot element to contain at least reality, credibility or the ability to create empathy / compassion, but it turned out to be in vain.
