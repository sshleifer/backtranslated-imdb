Sergio Leone spins in his grave ... If there was a movie that drives a person's life, it works under it. The "solitary wolf" of the lead character is spooky and flat, and the script was probably written by a monkey with eight classes of education. Whoever has the idea should be whipped by the horse. The only reason I spend time is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. The family of Sergio Leone should sue, not because it is crap, but since MST 3000 is dead. Nasty. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey makes a fucking attack on anyone, but cocaine users and weapon experts ... this movie is a pure goddess.
