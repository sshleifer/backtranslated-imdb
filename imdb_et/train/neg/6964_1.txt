I usually watch the MTV film awards to see a smart, entertaining show that offers a unique award (Chewbacca wins for example a lifetime achievement award). So this year was not different. Although I am not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott is always a joke to me. Am I laughing at Stiffler in American Pie movies and enjoying her at Dude Where's My Car? But the MTV film awards were just scary. Nothing was cohesive, humorous or fun. Justin Timberlake should sing and dance; he's sure hell can't act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about who the writers were for this show. Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar's last year's performance was extremely funny (Lord of the Rings alone is worth seeing the whole show), but this year it was completely different. Did anyone understand Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They watch the movie together but never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just went into their flat dialogue, but never referred to Timberlake's jokes. And Seann took the full talent, not even smiling, but smiled. And what was the idea of ​​Harrison Ford's one liner? Did they make sense to anyone? Maybe MTV writers thought that young viewers only know about Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones or the president of Air Force One. I'm confused. And would anyone tell me Adrian Brod? How old is this man and how old does he think he is? The boy looks 30, trying again to act 19 ... give it up, show some class (like your best actress academy in the prize call) and act at your age! <br /> <br /> I give this 1 star of the show just because of Gollam's speech for the best visual performance. It was very creative, well done and caused the only real laugh all night.
