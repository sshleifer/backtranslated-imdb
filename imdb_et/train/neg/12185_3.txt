What was Martin Scorcese ever about to recycle this movie? And not only did he recycle it, completely destroyed it? The pointless decision to make Robert DeNiro (in his most superfluous performances and that which says a lot) the character of a religious fanatic is ridiculous and an example of Hollywood's (especially Mr. Scorcese's) attitudes - attitudes that force writers to think that the best way to make a bad character is Tattoo a cross slip on your back. In any case, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br />
