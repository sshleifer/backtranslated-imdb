There is no way to take care of these stars on earth. A number of spoiled middle class, who have grown up as children, take drugs for some parties and give up and claim each other. I just saw it on television and I didn't think it would be a "movie", rather a post-'This Life 'indulgence that doesn't really have any resonance or right drama. We can order such things from a long time ago, unfortunately an insignificant middle class "lifestyle" that takes itself too seriously. It has David Baddiel and this city out of Cold Feet, you know what to expect. There were many such things in 2000, it was especially a bad British feeling ... "they are educated and doing drugs? Friends, but insecure and incestuous relationships? Such a mess and after Guy Ritchie's comedy-gangster ... blind days. there is taste, then it disturbs you against violence.
