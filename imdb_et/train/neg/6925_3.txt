I feel that this film is much less generous than others. The crazy depiction of this century has always been made so strange as the different species. Their antics are so cruel that they are completely fictitious. Everyone is Napoleon or any other historical figure; or they are against the birds. They are made or beat each other. Just like a scriptwriter would have said what I can do for them without the idea of ​​what madness or even mental illness is. Look at the wonderful human image "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where the diseases are plausible and real. I once worked at a national mental hospital. I didn't see any of these men. They are too intelligent and compute to put them into practice.
