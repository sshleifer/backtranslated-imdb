When you reach the scenes of Albert Brooks without your shirt ... try not to punish the fur. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I've seen the most, if not all, of his films, but it was the first time I saw it. Modern romance is an interesting topic of love. There are also a few films that deal with the despair of love or as openly as the modern novel, although the 1979 chilli scenes in the winter are very close. They are both essentially obsessed with men who are too psychologically minded / obsessed with these women. <br /> <br /> Where the winter scenes in the winter restrict the lurking of this theme, this film is a basic principle of love, because both people are already in relationships and relationships. And back again. <br /> <br /> And because it's a movie that appeared in 1981, it's time for styles and things. This is the main reason I like this movie. My main rule when it comes to movies is "If it sucks at least it can have historical significance" then you know the stuff of the time capsule. <br /> <br /> What takes me to Albert Brooks's sans bright scene. <br /> <br /> The man is hair. Very hair. As he wears a black curly fur sweater. And worse, he almost sees a burnt victim. It's not a pleasant sight and scenes with him without a shirt forward and on. In the early 1980s, furry men were considered normal and nothing was shocking. But in 2009 something like this is striking. Sorry, Albert! At some point, someone said, "Hey, let's try this scene, but wearing a simple t-shirt with you, I mean you can scare people." It's just very bad and I'm sorry for a pretty pretty actor who had to deal with Albert Brooks's naked body. He probably pulled his hair out of his teeth the day after. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's OK. It might have been better for me not to see Albert Brooks without his shirt, which seemed like a 10-minute continuous minute, as it would change my movie forever.
