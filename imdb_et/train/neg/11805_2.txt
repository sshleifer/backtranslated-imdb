See the original with the same title since 1944! It's made for a TV movie, it's just terrible! Although it uses (as far as I can) almost the same dialogue, it just doesn't work! Is it acting, bad governance? OK, so it's done on TV, but why are you looking at a bad copy when you get your hands on a great original? Especially since you get damaged on the plot and don't enjoy the original as much as you would have seen it for the first time! <br /> <br /> There are some things that differ from the original (it's shorter once), but it's all worse! Participants who play here simply don't fit the bill! You just do not believe them and who could bring Edward G. Robinson first? If you want, just look at it after you have seen the original and even then you are very brave when you look at it! It's almost a sanctity!
