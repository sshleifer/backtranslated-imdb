Like many media experiments, this amateur effort is the seed of a very interesting social commentary. 5+ years after its release, it is a prerequisite that the real events of software development have become more uncomfortable, and I found that it is less boring than the previous commentator, I imagine ... The director is clearly a fan of Hitchcock is too bad for the film to fail better to do, but in fact it is almost a parody of cellulose fabrication, including by us, if we should pay attention. Nicknames and capital letters are almost visible on the yellow page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I found it quite fun for all these reasons. Sometimes it is slippery for us to offer, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yeah - and while the seams showed and pulled a lot, my heart rate rose and I didn't want to get up and pause.
