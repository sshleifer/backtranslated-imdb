Wow. I've seen very bad movies in my time, but it's really a cake. This is the worst film I've seen in the last decade - not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a US military veteran in the war in Afghanistan, I found that this ridiculous movie wasn't even over, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was no attempt to find "authenticity" in the film. Not so small with small crushing. It seemed to have been written by an 8-year-old child who got all his concepts of war (and military behavior) straight from comics. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a clue, but even it cannot fully explain the fearsome production values ​​of the trash that passed through this cliché. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical errors, but it will take virtually forever. Old-day shoulder patches that have not been seen or worn after the Second World War and character labels such as "ColCollins" ("Colonel Collins"), which was actually written using the opposite mirror image "N" in the Russian alphabet (not The US alphabet continues and continues. Uniform, outfit, plot, and especially the behavior of these characters - every scene was simply ridiculous with errors, inaccuracies, and totally pointless clichés. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters were not the least reliable or plausible. It was all ridiculously childish, extreme. It was obviously a film that was supposed to praise the puberty boys, and I have little doubt that even if they find this film completely absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie has no redemption features at all. It's a waste of time. I strongly recommend that someone read this to pass on the garbage; It doesn't really make sense to waste one moment.
