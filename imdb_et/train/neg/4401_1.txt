We went to a group with the group because the game we were going to was canceled. This is undoubtedly one of the worst films. Not that I don't like cult movies. But nothing happens in the movie. Do not feel any connection with the characters. endless times without dialogue. And the car. How do they carry huge tent and bed chairs and clothes every day in this car? It's two-digit! However, I have to say that the landscape is beautiful, but not in the movie, the director should have taken a photo of the film so we could skip the 80 minutes of useless time if something happens. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this because it's a waste of your time
