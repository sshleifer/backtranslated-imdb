Seriously, I love those old movies and their simplicity, but I looked at it for the first time last night and it easily covered myself in all times. Was it supposed to be a love story or zombies? This movie was so bad that after he mercilessly ended, I can just laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Fortunately, I am too anal to turn off the movie without seeing the whole thing, or I would not be able to watch it throughout the session! I think something positive can be said about life so that, in line with this theory, I recognize this film's most positive asset, it was very short for a full-length movie.
