There is no story in this production. Action is embarrassing. Promising Dutch Television Sophie Hilbrand star should not include this movie in her CV. His actions are far from perfect and I personally think he has crossed the line of professional dignity; how he publishes himself in this film. This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, a vulgar sexual scene, and a rude language. It also shows the Dutch lie (as most movies do). Don't bother to watch this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money, and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who has proved to be better than his screen.
