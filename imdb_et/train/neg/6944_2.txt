The prerequisite for the film is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutally - and given the opportunity to retaliate when he was placed in a room (after a post-traumatic stress disorder treatment) where he was guided to the chair and said it was the culprit. She has a large tool table that can offer revenge: drills, bats, nails, elbows, torches, whatever you think someone might want to use another person physically hurt. <br /> <br /> We go too many torture scenes before explaining that the man Archer is torture is not the person who committed the crime. These two then create an uncomfortable union; who put them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done, we don't really care ...
