... because it was just terrible. 101 Dalamatians were funny even when it was formal, but it is nothing more than a bumpy one. The same plot, except when it has been surrendered; the most intelligent and awful annoying in the world; Tim McInnerny proves that he can't really do comedy (everone remembers Percy in Blackadder, but it was his high point - it's all downhill); so weak that if a group of college students had done it, throw it in the trash and tell them to do it again - this time properly. Ieuan Grufford gets better at Hornblower, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should go hiding for several years. <br /> <br /> Maybe I could be too harsh; After all, I couldn't sit through the whole movie. It gets 1/10; just because I can't give it to 0.
