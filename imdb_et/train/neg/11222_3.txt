Cybil Richards manages the second erotica masterpiece Full Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in silver silver fabric) is destined to destroy all evidence of sexual activity. But she can't resist watching the tapes and she likes them. Sex scenes are well filmed and set for a great soundtrack (at least for such a movie). Cast is mostly terrible and also very average. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and looking at the sex files she is able to expose her chest and a little down. She also fits in a little lesbian activity. Frankly speaking, Lovell deserves a better price than such a price. Here he sees a great deal of nakedness, but in fact he is much more attractive when he talks about "drama" in silver clothing. Totally garbage film with Lovell and the only real salvation function of the soundtrack. Mediocre even for Surrendian production and a clear new budget for them too.
