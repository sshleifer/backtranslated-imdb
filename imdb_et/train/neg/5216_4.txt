"Metamoprhis" is a story of a young scientist who is revered in a local college and is being researched by financial institutions for the college. It forces him to take shortcuts in a typical bad Hollywood melodramatic way. <br /> <br /> My first thought after this movie ended was this. "Not good, but not bad in the early eighties." Of course I realized that it was done in 1990, which almost pulled it to “4” but decided to keep it at noon “5” so it is. <br /> <br /> 'Metamorphis' a few times, it seems like a good movie desperately trying to get out. A functional, though not a star, is usually competent. You can even see the occasional modest quality. Pacing is a big problem with the movie. Thinking I was ninety minutes, I realized I was looking at only one hour. Special effects are not stars, but the director seems to be competent enough to overcome this weakness. <br /> <br /> The lead, a slightly charismatic man who seems to have tried the Tom Cruise and Christopher combined canalization of Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon's character in nature. A female hero does OK work, but she doesn't distinguish her. Here's the role of a "naughty girl" and the actor does what she can do with it, but it doesn't seem to be much. It is a child artist that the director cannot decide whether he is terrible, cheerful or just strange. <br /> <br /> Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem in this movie, until the last battle with the bad guy who makes the Power Ranger blush. It's strange and inexplicable to the final scene, which should be dramatic, but just fun, saturated with every bad camera trick and overturning that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> A decent one-time look at the Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack. Something that brings you back and something to buy.
