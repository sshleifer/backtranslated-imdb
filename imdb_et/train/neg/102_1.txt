My girlfriend once brought the Zombie chronicle around to watch the fun. Little did we realize that joking was one pound for him. Looking at this movie, I started doing things I would rather do than viewing the Zombie chronicle. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) drinker 2) sand rubbing in my eyes 3) writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Reintroducing American Civil War 5) Tax Declarations 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with Old Lady . <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The man couldn't even dig a hole. The best thing he did would hit the door (the best part of the movie). It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen white noise: light. The film never has so many mistakes. My girlfriend left it here, so now I am ashamed to have this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> News: Owen Wilson looked at this movie and tried to kill her. Fact. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE
