Pathetic. This happens when the director gets to work only because someone pays him. <br /> <br /> Intentions were good, great places, and settings for epic proportions. But the show, fucking! I swear that, in some shots, you can see the attachments in the background when looking at the camera or watching the participants, because no one told them what they should do when they hear "Action!" The battle scenes are so bad that you don't know if these people are real? They could have done more harm by hugging each other. In occasional scenes, you see people on the battlefield who are walking around or standing and waving hands. <br /> <br /> Only the foreground action is somehow highlighted. But what? The story is so illogical and intermittent, the random situation seems to be in chronological order, sometimes not even. Dialogues are stupid, the plot of love is more embarrassing and ridiculous than Hong Kong movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million, you'll see the dollar you invested on every screen, at best, the ultimate result of all this tremendous effort is the glossy round laser disc in a thin wrapper. in a video store on the shelf.
