This film mainly deals with the Inspector Gadget Archive Doctor who has returned to the peaceful city of Metropolis many years ago. Claw's plan is to fix Gadget once and for all using a newer "cooler" criminal to help destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately, the film failed unfortunately, the series was great, but it was restored almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, it just won't cut; Dr. Claw is not only visually less intimidating, but sounds more cold than his original scary self. It is a children's film, but the plot is so painfully weak (heaven forbid mentioning animation), which it has compared to the original series. Someone has also decided to upgrade to Pvend to bring him two decades faster, now he has a quasi-punk rebellious dress style and he doesn't play half of the role he did in the TV series. Gadgetmobile speaks, as well as the corner of the plot, which focuses on all ON-talking cars. Maybe I am just a child who loved the example who has grown up, but I thought the live-action version was more painful than I can wear, but now they're going to have a full soldering of this quality TV series. It's more than I can.
