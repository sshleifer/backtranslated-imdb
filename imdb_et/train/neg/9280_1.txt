Frankly, I don't know what's funny, this terrible remake or comments from the board. In the Masterpiece Review, I had tears, it was so funny. Anyway, this movie is one of the worst movies that ever exists, and certainly queues for a barrel. The title of "Omen" made me stop and watch it in the HBO this morning, but it's the face of the other three, especially the original. There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite is the man who strives for a fairly just fair juggler! good times! This movie is for Omen's series, "Scary Movie" for the whole genre. Avoid if you are looking for a good laugh.
