Often Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film enthusiasts voted out of China's biggest film, and frankly, I can't do it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodies that could be imagined, gently managed and acted, along with the main fighter. Wei Wei (do not laugh) is this young man, a young married woman who has suffered in recent years alongside her tubercular spouse (Yu Shi). It is after the Second World War and they live with their husband's secondary sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a broken home, where there is not much money (the man was rich in marriage). It is the man's oldest best friend (Wei Li) who was also the boy's boyfriend. He has to go away from this husband's husband, while the spouse misses a lot, thinking he might be able to involve his little sister with his friend. It is a structure and it does not go anywhere where it is not expected. I've actually seen remake, directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It takes half an hour longer, and it is actually boring, but at least it was pretty beautiful. This supposed classic is quite intolerable.
