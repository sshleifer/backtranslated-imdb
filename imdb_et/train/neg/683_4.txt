Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and has nothing in her life. He enters the Miss France contest against the wishes of his son Andrei (Georges Charlia) and he wins. She leaves Miss Europe title behind her boyfriend. He wins again, but returns to Andrei because he has asked him. Back together, his life turns into everyday life, so one night he writes a note to him and misses the fame that awaits him as Miss Europe. Andre follows her ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent movie with piano music. It has also picked up so everything seems fast. After that, a limited dialogue has been added and it is very fake. Casting is fine, bearing in mind that it is a silent film. The best part of the movie comes at the end, but the story goes a little too long. After I look at it, I'm not quite sure what the big thing was about the look of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible hairdresser that makes her face fat. I don't have to look at it again.
