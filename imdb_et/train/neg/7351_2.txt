Sometimes you have to see good movies to understand the good ones. This is my opinion anyway. It's always a bad movie category, just because everything except Shu Qi's performance was terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel talks about Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief immediately after leaving her lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years earlier. But his past returns to worship him because Chi Lam has been kidnapped by Cat's security software for ransom. To rescue her, she calls her old friends on her children's home days, six other poor women to save the day ... <br /> <br /> Maybe I said cheerfully, but that's an exciting story. In fact, there was no overall quality of the script and no direction at all. Much of the dialogue was pointless and with a stain that was as thin as rice paper in water. If I could sum it up, take the bad Jackie Chan movie, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw away the budget, and you have Martial Angels: a formal work that has no imagination at all. <br /> <br Remember that I have to give credit when the credit is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person who was terribly frightened because it was his performance. Okay, you can't say he was great - he had nothing to do with him, but he managed to take him out of his character. In addition, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin impressed - though they were mostly light and very short. <br /> <br /> The movie just fell into pieces elsewhere. Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable, special effects were obviously made inexpensively, without trying to clean up the edges between people and blue screen masks, with poor editing, involving numerous uninterrupted attempts, camera corners that were elementary and uneven and the direction I am missing from the dog better seen. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was too many chefs. The budget was probably over-enthusiastic about having seven babes on the same silver screen. It didn't leave much else. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie was made like a cheap porn movie without a portnet. Charlie's angels, it's not. In fact, if nurses can do it themselves, none of this was really obvious here. <br /> <br /> It must be forgotten.
