As a former teacher (!) I have to admit the failure of many scenes - "although I looked to the end. Interesting why ?! (Maybe boredom) :-) <br /> <br /> Initial opening scenes hit me incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed. Also, the plot, although there were some good ideas - for example, relief teacher difficulties - were not sufficiently focused on any third direction of development. <br /> <br /> None of Nolte's finer moments. As regards young Mr Macchio, does he talk about it so * for every * movie? br />
