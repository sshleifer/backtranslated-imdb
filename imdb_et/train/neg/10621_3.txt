I'm not adding a plot overview, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> A very unlikely children's home in Balas. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their height. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful landscapes. <br /> <br /> Good for the face, and I quote: "Look at the mouth, which is from Cassie, fools and horses." <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the poor British film industry is an example. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was something else and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> Redemption Feature? Before the success, it was free to watch the horror channel. I disagree with that.
