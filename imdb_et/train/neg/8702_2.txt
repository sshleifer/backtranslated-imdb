This is one of the hardest films I've ever had to look at! I should have waited for it after the first two, but I enter such films when the idea "Maybe it did right now". No, not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? How about the special effects ... To give you the idea of ​​what SFX is going to do in this movie, a soldier "Raptor" will shoot at one point because it runs down the corridor. Even if the screen time is less than the other, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man who has a tail for him. Bad bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> How does it work? If that's what you can name it. There is one sign that I think should be from the south. But after lunch for six years, I've never heard that talk. Maybe he has some kind of strange disability - inability to speak normally. In my opinion, it is interesting that the character does nothing that requires him to have such an accent, so the actor had no reason to try to do it. It's quite common - Raptors flee, people with weapons have to shoot them down. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs of these films always seem to be in the closest tunnel system ... would they get outside the catch? Well, at least they have a good idea to appear in a very little movie that is supposed to turn around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Suppose you are in a building and you know that there is a guy who eats robbers who run around. Would you decide to take the time to get an argument about who is better - army or maritime? And then decide that you would have a hand-wrestling contest to solve it? How would you be an idiotic idea that they had to steal the robbers - split into two groups. Have they ever seen any horror movie (or at least Scooby Doo episode)? In short, this is one of the movies out there. Leave it out if you don't want to go through the movie.
