R Balki tries to tell you that Ram Gopal Verma Nishabdis had spoken before. This time it is mixed with mature humor. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owns Indian cuisine in London. She is very dominant and arrogant and respects her work like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. Still, Hyderabad Biryan can't do it right. <br /> <br /> Enter Taboo who sends her the right Hyderabad Biryan made by her and will soon meet and finally love each other? Amitabh is 65 and Taboo is 35? No probs! But one hook! Taboo's Father Paresh Rawal! Couples decide to meet their father for marriage approval. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger to him. And the complications begin? The result is wise all three participants. The movie script is very dense and interesting. Movie dialogues are memorable. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. Comedy is sometimes not correctly understood. The film also tries to go a long way in some parts. Camera work is good. Director R Balki could have done much better with this manuscript. But in the second half, he seems to be confused. Father's "Satyagrah" scene seemed irritating. But Amitabh Bachchan's talks during this scene are worthy of. Cheen Kum has needed more sugar!
