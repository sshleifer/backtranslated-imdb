From the beginning of the movie I had the feeling that it was a movie about another Jason from Friday 13th. And this is ... The dispute that the film starts interesting. But when the time just goes to the pointless, silent, supernatural, silent killer of the movie. I mean he goes under the boy's bed without the sound that no one can see. He had to remain blind after unsuccessful execution, but he walks and kills people as he used to be. I'm tired of it. For me, it's all the same thing. <br /> <br /> In other words, unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. <br /> <br /> Well, where a woman with a rising stream seemed impressive, but just for the first time:} For this and the intriguing intro 2 star.
