It must be the worst of all times, the stupid, the slowest. It's a complete joke that it's even in theaters. It's sort of like looking at the Loch Ness monster in America. This film deserves a visual toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. People who are tied to the pile of this trash must be lobbied. Wait! Maybe I'll give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobbying before filming. How else can you explain what a nonsense stupidity is that this bucket contains. Don't waste time watching your life. Don't even waste your time sending review.
