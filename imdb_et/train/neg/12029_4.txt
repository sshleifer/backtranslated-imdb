In general, I've found that if you don't see a movie before seeing a DVD, it's probably a good reason. I had never heard of this movie until I was blocked the other day and saw it on the shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented out (the ones I wanted to see), I thought I'd give it one. genre such as The Singles Ward or RM If you have entered such films, you will probably enjoy it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, this movie will probably not appear to you. There is no way to avoid the publicly-believable (mormon) message and sometimes it is inappropriate and cheesy. Ultimately, if you are not part of the Mormon demographic, it's probably better to look at something else. it was enough to save the movie together.
