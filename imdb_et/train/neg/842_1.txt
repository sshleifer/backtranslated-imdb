It's not Michael Madsen's fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just terrible. If you want to laugh and be bored, check out this movie. Words cannot be described as idiots. Excuse me, Michael. The cinema was dark. All other participants are unknown. Looking at it, it looks like it is soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This movie was sexual because it is an underground S & M killer. Action was bad, except for Michael Madsen's parts. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he did well for this terrible movie. This is something I would not be proud of. It's not even a B cable for cable, it's more like F and should never be shown.
