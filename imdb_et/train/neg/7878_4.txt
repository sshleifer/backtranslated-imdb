I'm a big fan of the original book, and this customization is just bad. First of all, she had a hard time deciding whether it was a baby or an adult that caused a strange adult story and some violent scenes with a silly little party that keeps the funny moments at first. br /> <br /> But it is hardly important that the film is just boring, immovable and not the original story. It just can't transfer all the points that Orwell tried to make in his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> The Second Revolution? !! Have they learned anything? Who's next Napoleon? Benjamin? !!
