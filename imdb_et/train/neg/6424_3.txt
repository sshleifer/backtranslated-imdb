Broke would be a scriptwriter and he would be an agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) forced to live in a self-preserve headed by an eccentric and scary leader (Ron Perlman) whom they believe is a serial killer who terrorizes the city, "costume" (so called because after injecting victims with Windex, she dresses them in foolish costumes). They persuade her that her biography would make a great movie and would gather the group's filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of making a film can be a murder. <br /> <br /> This movie has more, but it was unfortunately on the floor of the editing room and it shows (the rumor is that the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors who all make fine jobs and deserve better), because it has an extraordinary black comedy, but only rises to a mediocre cute. <br /> <br /> If you are Ron Perlman, then it is quite worthwhile to just put on his performance. His comedic timing is great and he has the opportunity to make some very big impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said Hellboy's movie comment that he needs interference when he gets in Jerry Lewis mode). He's just just having fun watching it. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also looks like a double-layered (but central) role.
