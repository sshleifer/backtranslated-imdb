"Laughter is a state of mind," says the label, and I hesitated to comment on Barry Levinson. What should she have been thinking about when making toys? When he looked, he looked at a successful, funny fantasy? If so, he works on a different plane than I. This is a scary picture, where product development is 90% of the thing (and even cartoon colors are disappointing). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack have been humiliated as the brother and sister of the mogul of the toy, who has passed the factory's heirs when their father dies. Here is nothing funny (satirical or secret) here. It's evenly filthy, ugly, and one of the worst "bigger" movies ever made. NO STARS from ****
