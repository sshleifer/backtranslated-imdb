Don't do me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love both series and movies, but enough already: death in the nose. Everyone has done it! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough! Mr Suchet could have used this awesome talent in another Agatha Christie novel. I say the action of all participants was great. Sets were terrible and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was amazed at how he looked 'terrible'. I hope he doesn't see such a way in real life! I do not remember honestly from other films whether that end was the same. Somehow I don't believe. I thought it was a pretty brilliant touch whether Mrs Christie wrote it. I'd rather stop it than be wasted in prison!
