I'm very bad about sci / fi and horror movies - I've been watching them since the age of 4 or 5, so I've seen really bad things, but I'm working on it. I've even looked at a lot of SciFi Channel movies so I don't know much to expect - usually a promising movie that doesn't have an end to talk about. Hope rises forever, I think - or the triumph of hope for experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this dog has been from the beginning and I knew it, but like a flame moth, I thought something interesting. This is not. All actors give a decent result - because of the script - I don't know how they all saw it right. It has nothing to do with collagen hunger worm parasites that slowly take over humanity, one body at a time. There's an evil plastic surgeon working with enemies, giving them a look ... don't worry, he'll get what's coming to him. The hungry themselves do not really know where they came from, they think they could travel by sea, which landed, but ... somehow they know that there is royalties amongst them - the princess of the check has managed to grow with a human being who knows she is a worm king and loves him for himself ... oh, do I have to go? Please, I beg you, don't waste 2 hours of watching your life ... something better ... think about the worst, least enjoyable way to spend two hours ... it would be better than that.
