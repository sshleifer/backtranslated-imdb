I say it again: this movie was completely flat. Children love it, but adults ... doubt it. The whole thing was basically the transformation of the original, which should be expected, as they studied quite a whole concept in the first film, but did they have to re-create the whole movie? I mean, everything is done by Little Mermaid. The worst part is Morgana's "Ursula's Crazy Sister" who appears somewhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous because Triton is there with his magical trident. Why didn't Triton do anything? Because he didn't have to do anything because of the plot. I could go ahead, but I don't want to. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to collect some money from Mermaid, and obviously was thrown away without thought, because they knew it was selling. In general, it is a terrible waste.
