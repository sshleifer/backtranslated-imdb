I had no idea what the film was before I saw it, because Tashan had only teaser trailers when they were advertised. So I asked my friends if they knew about it and said "Vijay Krishna Acharya is the director's debut, who wrote the Dhoom 1 & 2 scenarios and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim debuts in the movie, playing him as a child's return". <br /> <br /> After I saw it, I realized why they were not the right trailer because there was nothing to show in the movie. The story was extremely dum and even a 10-year-old child can come to a better story. There was hardly anything to be done and the camera shook at every possible angle and it is hard to see who kills. It was also uneven and unrealistic, e.g. One man with a hand gun was able to kill about 100 men with guns. <br /> <br /> Looking at Tashan, he reminded me of 3 films: <br /> <br /> Sin City: Opening Credits Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English as Amrish Puri Koylas. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: Anxiously ridiculous jokes that aren't even funny. <br /> <I've also heard that the budget is 40 crores, which is the same as Dhoom 2 and I don't know where all the money went. Anyway, if you didn't like Dhoom 2, there is no way you like Tashan. Race was hot heels and it's a million times better. <br /> <br /> Only two good songs are Dil Haara and Challiya, and both songs are made in Greece in good places, but what is its use as a garbage film? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English language couldn't save that inconvenience.
