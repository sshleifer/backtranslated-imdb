Who's me? No, I'm not kidding. That's what it says about videos. <br /> <br /> Land; short version: Beautiful woman is smiling. It makes for some reason all people kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where Ariel ... Don't Find Ariel ..." He's behind you, you idiot. <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this terrible little Space Opera has already been said, looks. <br /> <br /> The first attacker, who mostly plays convicts, arrives very soon after the first players have been selected. Then they get the same way. Each scene is transmitted about fifteen minutes in advance. Perhaps this was a draw on the shoulders to see which participants had the most time and greater pay control. Alien virus / hologram / VR witch / disorder seems physically powerless and does nothing. Why can't he just stay on the computer instead of doing his "teleporting vampire" routine? (In fact, it would have been more interesting if he had been a vampire or would do more than just standing in the eyes of the people he's ever doing. It's enough for all men to kill each other.) <br /> <br /> This is not really a space. The Easy Rider of the 1950s, the western part of the old, has many more shots, the film of the film's nightclub, even in the fantasy countryside, none of which has any real depth or sense. The nightclub scene is, of course, black and white. Worked with "Ozi Wizard". Not working as well. This is probably a good thing, because the few shots they do show space, are depressingly stupid. You probably wept during those moments, especially when you see a rotating "spacecraft" that looks about three inches in length. <br /> <br /> Nothing knows a character, not because they are convicted or have no personality, but because they need serious lessons, except Billy Dee Williams, who really sees depression and loss, probably in this work ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that, when viewed with friends, cause extremely "loud" silences, especially when the nerd throws out his experiment with a comic strip liner (including a line that touches a French kiss with a meteor ... ? Did I hear it Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girls can "kill" something that doesn't mean they're not even real at first. Well, the other "characters" are not, but it's next to the point. Haha. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that the scene that surrounds the video is a skull-horror alien who watches it (a green filter is attached to it to give it more a ... Green Look) which is actually an Android after death and ultimately nothing to do with anything else. <br /> <br /> Another strange thing I noticed. Every time there is an explosion (at least in my cheap DVD copy), all the pixels will change. I can think of LITTLE pixelated, I mean huge blocks of about 1 / 16th screen size. Wow.
