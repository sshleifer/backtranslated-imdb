Boy, this was one tough movie! Although I have not seen all of Burton / Taylor's cooperation, I can say for sure that this is the worst. This rich but sick woman (of course Taylor) owns this beautiful island in Meditteranean, deciding over dedicated staff when she unexpectedly visits the traveling poet who is carrying her mouth. In fact, the whole movie is just a talk festival where a lot of the speech doesn't make sense. Even in 1968, no one could do this embarrassing mess, and the passage of time makes it even clearer. If it were not beautiful cinematography and landscape, it would be worth the negative rating. The only thing this film is good about is the unintentional laughing at the expense of the stars.
