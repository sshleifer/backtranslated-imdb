This is a remake of at least the third of this movie, so if you look at it, there is the idea of ​​deja vu, not surprised. Everything they did changed the setting of the story and talked about it differently, but the differences are not important. And it doesn't improve because the plot is faulty at first. It never works. And like his predecessors, the actor is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen a movie before, but the end won't fit the story. If that movie had ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and would have been very satisfying and I would be worth it. But here's the spoiler and finally the crime costs it because the offender is not caught. I never like the movie that comes from the movie.
