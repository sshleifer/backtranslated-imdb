First of all, let me say that I am not a fan of the Dukes, but after that the film seemed like a law and an order. The worst was casting Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg and even worse was M.C. Gainey like Roscoe when they ever saw that Roscoe wasn't a hard ass. He was more of a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has common errors, cars break and continue as nothing happened. The worst example of this is when General General meets Billy Prickett and General has got into a dirt hill, which probably slows down to a stop, but continues to win.
