Listening and enjoying Harvey Bernhard's Omen II comments, I was surprised to find that he was behind this absolute rubbish. It's like a really bad TV movie that you might see in the middle of the day, if you have the flu and are too sick to reach remote access. I think a little bit where Michael Lerner is facing what I can only describe as a lie at Les Miserables High School, my mouth hung incredibly. And then my mouth went up and down because I laughed so much. Dire. I do not know why I have to write at least ten lines, I have said my point briefly, not all wise about this modern verbal.
