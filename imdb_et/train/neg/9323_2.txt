What was I just watching? I spent 90 minutes of your precious life watching one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serum killer clown is actually a rather frightening vision that there are many people who are afraid of clowns .... but having this 300 pound nursery rhyme that tells the killer clown, makes genre mocking. I still don't know how Mark could not get away from the clown ... he's 300 pounds, he's finally tired. All over, I made up and literally said, "What am I just looking at?" Obviously, Brandon is a cousin of Denise .... and they got in the middle of the movie, which means he was having sex with his cousin ..... yeah, that's something people want to see * shudders *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found fun foolish was the opening plan where the clown stabs the woman and says, "What did you do?" Well, what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second when the protagonist beat the hacker and called him ac * nt and then 5 minutes later, saying that violence didn't help anything .... did the script writer give the line a wrong guy? None of this film makes sense. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less stupid, low-budget porn that I bought (all 3.99) and no one after sex scenes didn't get entertained. I'm surprised that the fat clown hasn't joined the orgy, it would be right. I was hoping that the film would have some entertaining value like other B movies, but I was wrong. It's a moral garbage that's not even worth it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
