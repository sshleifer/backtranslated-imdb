I already know that critics and some audiences say it was satire, a lot of political and social messages, names refer to another name, and so on. I can't understand such things (I don't want to do it anyway) because I'm not interested in cinema. As for the film itself, it is said again that the film is smart and dramatically powerful. I didn't see anything we didn't see in the monster movies, except for the scene that takes place in the office in the second half. Yes, this scene says something about humanity, but it doesn't make the film brilliant. The movie is fun (somewhat) and exciting at some moments or scenes, but no more. As for the biggest mistake in the film, it is a visual effect. It was just shocking, I couldn't beat it for a while because I was waiting for a realistic monster because it's not one of the old Gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it wasn't. It's like if you don't think it's a monster, you can't care about it. If you agree with me, I suggest that you are extremely realistic at Cloverfield. Monster's design is not interesting, but at least the effort is planned. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics talk about it as a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is a drama rather than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I don't want to compare a host with other monster movies, but I'm trying to mean that Host doesn't do anything other monster movies do. By the way, it may be that people call the masterpiece of the film because they are sympathy for the Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's the fact.
