It's so incredibly bad. Poor participants. You can say that they are really trying to polish, but we all know you can't. Writing is so obvious and straightforward, it's sad looking at trying to sell it. Humor and stimulation are so painstaking that it is hard to believe that any of these good players have signed it. <br /> <br /> That means it's so terrible that we have a time-out of the screen. We just have to know where the train is going. But that's just because we got it on television. If we had paid for it, we would be annoyed. <br /> <br /> So it gets 2 stars to be at least fun / excitingly bad. And casual music (as opposed to trying too hard on the indie soundtrack) is ridiculously reminiscent of the Scooby-Doo episode ... but not so good.
