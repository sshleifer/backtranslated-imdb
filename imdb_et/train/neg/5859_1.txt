Turkish cinema is a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folklore but want to be international. This kind of film results in lice. Even Turkish audience after 10 years. They act like dolls. <br /> <br /> A movie in a cube in Cuba, but nothing is included in Cuba. This is how Cuba is considered a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Waste of money, waste of time.
