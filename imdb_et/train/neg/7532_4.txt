Something that I really love about this woman's short films was difficult to understand - especially "Life with happiness". This film has nice beginnings - an unusual location and the potential for strange cinematographic treatment, but it fails to succeed in a clever display, uneven performance and very television. <br /> <br /> This is a captivating television and a very common cinema. The ideas are so precise that they know almost television. But the mood is good so we can't make too many complaints. <br /> <br /> I really would love to see this director make a full-length animation and try to work with a producer who doesn't require so much boredom.
