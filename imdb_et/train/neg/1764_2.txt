Although I agree with the comments of other reviewers in several ways. I find the plot and the idea very good. Many supporters were very good. The deadly problem with this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor" How this person has ever been in a movie or television, I can't imagine. I think he would be bigger than Wal-Mart. To see the low talent involved in paying roles, ask a question ...... "Who knows"? I would very much like to see this film recover with some talent. I'm not telling the writer about the failure of this movie to watch it.
