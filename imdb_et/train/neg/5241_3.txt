Tell the truth that I'm a little dizzy to see all of these positive comments by so many people, which is also the main reason I decide to see this movie. And after seeing it, I was really disappointed and it comes from the one who loves this movie genre. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at this movie completely - it's like a child's film with nudity for absolutely any reason, and it's all about little kids who tease and swear. I'm not fair at all, but it's been too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The story of two men sent a big brother to the program for their reckless behavior. There they met an obsession with one child and the other was a medieval freak. <br /> <br /> Just a name that it doesn't own is not really a story at all. They are not exemplary and do nothing but serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and humor is flat. And we don't have so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?) That have seen the same characters (played by Mc Lovin). I think I laugh three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, when casting was fine, that's what creates the scenario. It works as expected when you watch this type of movie. And what direction does one expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer and this movie sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring some stars to attract his terrifying movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I felt like I was not whipping completely, but a waste of time. The best part of the movie is just naked scenes. You can't really see why I should recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not funny, terrible story, nudity, and kids don't mess. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Rating: F)
