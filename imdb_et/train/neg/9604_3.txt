The first thing I noticed of this movie, of course, was unnecessary nudity. It is not negligible nudity or anything but much that was not needed. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman who believes her families are ghost stories that her ancestor, who reminds her of eerily, was a werewolf and believes that their fate is the same. What actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was meant to be a completely psychological film, but Universal threw a real Wolf man you never had to see for n or extra. I find that the concept that no one really is a werewolf is interesting. Unfortunately, this movie is not what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> We do not know that it is not a werewolf from the beginning, so there is no excitement or twisting, nor do they try to make a movie, as it actually happened in the scenario. They do not enter one or two parts of the film, suggesting that it is a reality. At first I was excited about reading the movie description. But I slowly realized that it was on the cover so that they could reveal the main characters as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is a decent actor with a great psychotic role, or a very bad actor who plays a psychotic role. Because the character Danniel has no brain and it's just a nut that runs around mad and shines and grabs like a wolf, it's a little skill. He has moments when his performance breaks in a horrible moment, but the work and light of a bad camera quickly destroys it. The idea is great, but amazingly for the whole movie. 3/10
