This flick reminded me of these flat "erotic thrillers" that I used late and looking at Cinemax when I was 13. I'll mark this flick with a softer core because there's no simply simulated bumps and grinder. But there is also a lot of nudity - the opening scene is in the bar club, we see Kane Hodder's chester (or at least the back of the stunts) and then the inexplicable 10-minute lesbian dance picture in the middle of the movie and the naked female werewolf that looks like MÃ¼nster's costume. 13-year-old boys rejoice. <br /> <br /> Other than that, werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen for years. The scenes look like the Resident Evil video game with FMV quality. The wolf is too bad to explain, and despite the poor quality of the suit, it's too many times. <br /> <br /> Plot and action don't make sense. There is some funny story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - Darkwolf is the last one, but what I can say about hybrids is all the same werewolf man, becoming a wolf to kill people. Darkwolf tries to find a companion, but he can't find a partner, but he can sniff someone he touches. What's more, these skills turn out to be less useful because Darkwolf ends up killing several people whose target has never touched, met, or even seen as well as possible. A friend does not know that he is a werewolf and he is fighting for transformation or something. <br /> <br /> You think it's easy when it's a simple monster movie, but they did. Want a quality werewolf movement, go for rent Dog soldiers want a ton of R&D that is your flick.
