As a child, I believed my friends and I all that Gymkata was still the most violent and bloody film. I'm not sure who started this rumor. It was probably due to a 10-year-old disappointment who could not see it for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata's release, it became a multi-year late night cable movie and as a result I've been able to make up for the lost time. I've had to see the scenes of this terrible excuse for the film over a dozen times and I can always see it for 1-2 seconds of the screen time. However, besides the forced unification of gymnastics and martial arts, poor dubbing, stiff dialogue and terribly complicated story, the film has some things. All that is visually bad about the film is a lot of fun. Never before has so little force and so many volumes landed! Canned kung-fu sounds are funny but slowed and fallen music, and the nearly 5-minute slow-down scene is really strange. Passing through demented, bleeding villagers is not as tense as it irritates, and there are enough bad wigs and accessories that all look into the camera and wave to make this train wreck a little fun. Could it go to a cult classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
