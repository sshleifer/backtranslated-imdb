I watched this movie really did not expect much, I got it in a pack of 5 movies, all of which were terribly terrible in their own way, a fig game I could expect? and you know what i was right, they were all terrible, this movie has some (and some have stretched) interesting points, the casual camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, ie damn annoying and it's really that the problem is that it is just so boring, in what I can only assume, was an effort to build tension, nothing happens and if it is a completely annoying (I had a quick thumb) forward button that is ready to press for most movies but gave it further) and seriously that this is a very interesting band singer, coz they can not tell how beautiful his hell is, i thought he saw a bit like mated, all this and i haven't even mentioned the killer, i won't go even in, just don't deserve explanation. As far as I am concerned, Star and London are almost the only reason to watch it and except London (who was actually quite funny), it wasn't because of their ability to act, I've seen much worse, but I've also seen much better. Best to avoid when your boring looking color dry.
