This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamonds' theory of weapons, germs and steel, explaining how Europeans dominate the world. <br /> <br /> The version of this document was seen on 2 disks that covered 3 hours. I think the information could have been delivered in 20 minutes. There are absolutely useless scenes: Professor Jared Diamond looks at the birds through the binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond did not use the bow and arrow properly, Professor Jared Diamond shot the muzzle-loader badly. Did this documentary "make a hero of Professor Jared"? This part of the documentary was so bad that it could have been a scam. The worst thing was when Diamond was shown in a break and crying when she was in a malaria department at an African hospital. None of this helps me to understand his theory of "weapons, germs, and steel". BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" are said about 100 times. "Can Europeans get weapons, microbes and steel out of this terrible situation? When he finally comes to business, his theory is equal and interesting and boring. Europeans have conquered the indigenous peoples of other countries because they had weapons and fines with stone and wood weapons. parts of the theory that explain how Europeans allow conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paper-thin. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think the documentary tried only to convince me that Europeans are as capable as Europeans, if I am not racist, I already know. If I am racist, Jared Diamond does not intend to persuade me with convincing local aids. Children may still enjoy it more than I do. this documentary is much better than a documentary.
