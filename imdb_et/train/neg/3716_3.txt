The main character Lance Barton is killed and heaven before his time. When the sky learns from the error that is given to him, he has just become a dead rich old and white Mr Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black boy in the body of an old white man, who still acts like a young black man, may be funny if you see this old white actor. In this film I reminded me several times: "Chris Rock should be an old white man". <br /> <br /> The whole concept is not as intended: "Illusion" is not well transported and the love story is not at all plausible. The fact that everything you see is Chris Rock, who plays a young black man, because the old white person everyone should see is only shown in small scenes, this is a great challenge for viewers to "stop the infidelity".
