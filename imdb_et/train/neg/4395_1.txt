The December holiday offers, as well as the original Frosty, should be richly produced with high quality music and a healthy but light spirit. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the saints. In principle, they should see, feel and feel ... well, "special" and they should have a decent and appropriate December holiday context. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the Legend of Frosty, the snowman on the TV listings, I got my kids (6 and 8) pumped into it, telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionately how much I I enjoyed it as a child. When my wife and children started watching the film, the expectations were high, but after 10 minutes my children were awake and my wife and I were "watching" each other and rolling our eyes. After 35 minutes, my kids actually asked to sleep - I think they were tired of unknown languages ​​and nonsense, inseparable segments. I was really embarrassed by my (and my) disappointment about this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the legendary Frosty snowman is more than a bad unusual parental episode that has been overcome by a worse episode. Sponge Bob as a classic holiday movie. Don't do me wrong ... these shows are good and I like them as much as the next boy, but when I look at pretty odd parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (mediocre, color, null subtext, mind numbing episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We picked some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the embarrassingly bad Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
