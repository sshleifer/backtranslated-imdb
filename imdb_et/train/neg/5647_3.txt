We bought this series on DVD because all of the glowing views that we saw here. I gave her three letters because there is no doubt that sometimes acting, leadership and writing are brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we didn't see the propaganda that was so smoothly communicated in the series. When someone looks closely at it, the Fox (Faux) news network sees the radical right-wing lithium. To avoid spoilers, I will refrain from all tens of specific cases. A brief overview of the plots found in the IMDb reveals that everything from torture to arms control to the right to provide "Infomercials" and to call these news is justifiable when some of the best actors are provided with intelligent screws and surprised calls. in the world. We looked at many exhibitions and finally abandoned the rage when they justified torture with General Prosecutor Gonzales, because it is a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used to protect all of us. The series also succeeds in weakening men's and women's gays by using them as plots of people depicting evil people. All in all, the radical religious right wing is a complete litany. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, future historians use the popularity of this program as evidence that America lost its way at the beginning of this century. As a student of history, I would describe this program as Goebbels' propaganda produced by Hitler and some propaganda produced by Hollywood for Estonians during the WWW. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use it as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can do it anyway. Just make sure to buy a cheap used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right wings of the Faux Network who produced it travesty.
