It's not really important that Superman comic books are incredibly naive and target ten years old. Importantly, "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> At first, the question for you Dear readers, how many of you really believe that superman will be beaten by bald Kevin Spacey? Someone? Just like I thought. There's no spoiler here. So let's go on some important questions now. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film looks like a commercial (scene of drinking Superman / Clark Kent on Budweiser is the only scene that seems to be intended). Imagine Superman's trade for two and a half hours. Let us be serious that this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You feel this movie is too long. And the special effects are not so special. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenario is silly. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable as a comic, it just seems stupid in the cinema. That is the case in this case. Of course, dialogues are disgraceful. I can't believe someone took the money to write them. How many times are men's calls fed? How many times are the laws of physics raped? (Jesus, it is not only the strength of Superman, but also the resistance of the materials it deals with.) How many times does Lois Lane fail? How many times do Hollywood producers search for tricks in comics? Because a good story is hard to do, why is the novice a weak story? It just doesn't work. Guys, get a grip. Please try harder. Or just stay with this strike forever who cares. I had the feeling that WGA was a strike permanently. No offense. I do not question the people to whom the money is paid, but the quality of the product being delivered. In this case, there is no quality at all. (Here you can ask yourself: is it so bad? Yes, that is.) Third, acting is weak, which is quite surprising because Bryan Singer (ordinary suspects) is in charge. Kevin Spacey is fun, but he's the only one. The target audience is rather the mood of jokes. The thing is that the comic book hero can become a true person with clear motivations, but also doubts, fears, some depth. In this case, nobody did this job and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the creators' entire effort makes this movie a parody. The second unit is so bad that it attracts attention because there is nothing interesting on the screen. The harder they try (if they try), it is funny (but it is not ridiculous). <br /> <br /> The final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular film, ladies and gentlemen, is a camp. Don't waste your time and don't waste your money. Stay home, read the book.
