In 1972, Elvis Presley left Linda Thompson after leaving her husband. Miss Thompson, a good-humored, long-haired, cute, shaped beauty queen, has been mapped to fill Elvis's life gap. When Elvis's divorce became final, Linda was a lively girlfriend and companion to a legendary performer back in 1976. <br /> <br /> It's a tough look at their love and companionship. Linda sincerely inclines to the needs and wishes of her lover. And even a handful of your ingesting medications and introducing him to his valion of love. Sometimes this film is tough and dark; a very unpleasant look at the "king" and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely terrible than Elvis. Being over the hilt is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks Linda's classicism, but it does the job quite well. The cast is supported by John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching it is more than enough for me, but don't let this review check it out. For most Elvis fans I've provided, it's not a preferred presentation.
