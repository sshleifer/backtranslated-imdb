The strange film producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's greatest advances, Band said he would never make "real killer films" because he thought that small dolls and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the movies better - people who kill each other are therefore real and less fun. A nice philosophy and a real shame that Band, by destroying a full-moon studio through possible twilight business transactions, turned home theater into such desperation that it began to do exactly what Blockbuster wanted, and thus sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind it also worked for Delta Delta Die! and "Syndrome" - so full moon standards are so equal. Debbie Rochon is here in the usual gang of dude and dude, who decide to make a murder club. He - as he would probably - does everything he can to join and then panic, because it was not a real story, and foolish Mrs. Rochon believed it and now everyone has to run with blood and maybe kill each other or not be. The choice is there and for this movie that is yours ... not recommended, but not entirely bad.
