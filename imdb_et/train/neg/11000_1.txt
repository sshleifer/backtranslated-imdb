Words cannot describe how this film is completely exhausting. It is a series of random, rude videos of everything from stupid Batman fraud to a guy who gets this old dead lady (REALLY disturbing). Just a little further entertaining thing about Underground Comedy Movie is Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor of this movie. It is also rated NC-17 by removing the only people who tolerate it.
