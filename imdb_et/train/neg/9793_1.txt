Mighty Morphin Power Rangers must be the worst TV show ever made. There is no plot, but a bunch of stupid costume children who use martial arts while dressed in second-class spandex equipment. <br /> <br /> Special effects look like they are in the 70s, costumes look like nothing. bad comedy and show is just terrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is worse than the TV show is the toys, the plastic rubbish that is fed to our second child. <br /> <br /> It's much better for your kids to watch! <br /> <br /> Try to give your children something nickelodean, these patterns are really some intelligence, unlike power limiters.
