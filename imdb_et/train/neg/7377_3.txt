Even though the plot was very detailed and the story was understandable, it was embarrassing that Steven Seagals' voice was dubbed by another through most of the film because you were not sure who was talking. There were many parts where he began to speak his deep heavy voice, and then the next one spoke to him. However, I don't know the reason why he had difficulty with his voice at the time the movie was created, so I think they could have restored events that hadn't restarted his own voice. I have rated this movie from 10 out of 10 based on the quality of the film. If someone pays for a movie, whether it is in a theater or on a DVD, that movie wasn't paid for it. I've been a long-time follower of Steven Seagal and all of his films in recent years. By that time, I think it's one of the worst we've seen
