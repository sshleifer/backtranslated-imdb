I gave this film a very fair opportunity and it betrayed me. It's a little more than a black and white excuse to bring hell out of the public, even if the egotist Bogdanavich (who did better with TARGET) gets his "big items" in his debut. This movie comes with a lot of teen sex, such as Doing the Teacher's Wife, impotence, making an ugly prostitute (which has been very cumbersome to shoot and grind things completely, not to have things somewhere else) and skinny dipping I think this movie is funny because it's all nonsense of sex, it was just annoying to me. I was seriously more entertained when I cleaned my fingernail than watching this confusion.
