If I write an overview of the film, maybe it will stay with me ... but in general I look forward to forgetting that I've only seen it for two weeks. So why bother? Because I look again at a low rating movie that was fun to watch. I didn't expect to be there while I was in the room. <br /> <br /> It wasn't great, but at least it was not intolerable ... not a comedy of mistakes that always makes me. It was just a sweet fluff ... and if you can't, stay in the dressing room boys. I agree with those who are defending this film because it is sure to please your targeted demographics, and it is not completely pure for adults. <br /> <br /> It offers a couple of good checks here and there, but nary side divider. Of course, it is silly and only slightly fun, but at least it's not a miracle (as so many have said). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to classify the clock curve so that 4.5 or 6 is actually a rating in my book. Giving it to 4 is worthwhile and strengthens its evaluation at the time of writing. Giving it to 1 or 10, as most have done so far, makes rating numbers meaningless. I can't believe how strongly people feel about this forgotten fluff in one way or another (or I've even written about it). Do I miss anything? Anyway, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs Clairedycat's role quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel, who often writes in b * ch roles, is not disappointed with his character. You can also recognize Bruce Spence, who plays Leonard, although his role is remote. <br /> <br /> You can definitely miss it if you are an adult. But if you have a girl in your life, rent this movie for her ... and be ready not to hate it (even enjoy it).
