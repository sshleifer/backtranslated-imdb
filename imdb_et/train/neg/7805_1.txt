The actor's first film is usually something that can be afforded - often the first job where the lack of experience of each participating film is really displayed and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than that, even with the 1982 standards, it's so bad, it's hysterically funny. Fully filmed in the Chicago area with a very low budget, most of the cast actors are rigid, wood and comic - a cross between high school and a bad community theater. The noise from nearby traffic often comes out of dialogue and dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that is forced and expedient as natural and organic. Scenes are animated and pristine, and even if the characters pass through the years, children and adults are not at all. <br /> <br /> I believe it is possible to make a Christian film that is a pleasing, secular audience, but too often, the creators of such films focus on the message or, in this case, on their own autobiographical links with the project that good film production values ​​have been excluded. (I'm sure it is no coincidence that the headmaster has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and the cast member.) Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting and more credible in his later films. A career, like her, is definitely not such a movie.
