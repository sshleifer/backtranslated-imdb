This video contains a covert way to confuse and manipulate Americans with Islam. Unfortunately, the people who did so believe that the American people are so faithful that perhaps, like an American citizen, every human being will be against it. If you want to know the truth about Islam, don't let anyone tell you ... WHAT IS PUBLIC! You can read it yourself and decide if what they say is true or wrong ... <br /> <br /> Video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies that are aimed at manipulating and tying things that are not even tied. The music used at some points makes the public hate what they see, even if they don't understand what's going on there. They use an inaccurate picture of their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment I would like to ponder ... Don't you think you can make the same exact movie with every religion in the world?
