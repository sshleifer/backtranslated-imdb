I'm an avid B-Rate horror film and I've been watching my fair share of slasher pictures so I have a significant measure to rate this movie. It is at the top of the worst horror films of the 1980s. It's not as scary as the demons' night, it's not as gore as Re-Animator and has no camping value. There is no value in this film. Keep in mind that cinema is a completely different film. The photos on the back of the DVD box were not taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> $ $ $$ (There is a lot of violence, but we've seen it before. Students and occasional members who cut the throat and all the other tired killings that horror movies use). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: None <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes, who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after making the film - people who accept teaching at university will die and Forbes believes that the killer is his target, frankly it is impossible to take care of, because the script does not fill any symbols outside Forbes.) <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (terrible at all levels. it is because college students can do it better - Forbes introduces some talent, such as Seminara as one of the students, but all others are "extra" caliber).
