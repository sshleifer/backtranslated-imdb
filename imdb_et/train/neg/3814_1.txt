I see the little girls who enjoy this show, but it's called a family event is ridiculous. I am surprised how well to remember that this is after these years. It is an extremely unpleasant and stupid exhibition of three living dads who live with their dead wife's brother and his stupid friend's school, and other seasons. All plot lines generally have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of every episode, someone else is angry and every episode they make ends with a mild unusual joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was a painfully father to his mother. Dave Coulier is one comment about joke 30, a year old that makes a comic and acts like a child, and he is terrible. John Stamos was the most acceptable character, but he was so clich√© that he was hard to see. At the show, the oldest girl DJ was a really bad actor and never showed emotions. The average girl Stephanie was too annoying as a tedious little sister. The youngest girl, Michelle, showed what bad actors Olsen twins were. You can always tell when to turn them off. The plot has too many stories that were so unrealistic that it was worthy. It is a "family" that showed that it was trying to replace any good substance with brilliance and love, and although it is necessary to show the family, it went too far. This is remembered in the 80's and 90's of my least favorite sit-com. TVG 30 minutes.
