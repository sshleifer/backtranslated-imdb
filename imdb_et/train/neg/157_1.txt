First, the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s. I was shocked to find out that it was released in 2001. Had there been a short prologue or introduction, this story would have been better. I also appreciate fantasy, but this movie was too much. It was strange and filmed badly. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were strange. It was difficult to follow and maybe it was a translation, but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films, but if you are looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film, I would recommend this promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development), not this film. Beware that you are disappointed.
