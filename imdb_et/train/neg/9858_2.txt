This movie is not funny. It simply takes D & D nerve stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters do less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they are all socially retarded and have no luck with women. Jokes are terrible and unimaginable, for example, two players killed by a black dwarf, because one of them had a hooded view of the FAQ (this was his wizard's costume) and another man was warmed by John Rocker (oh if funny, he's crying he won't know about sport). Maybe you need to be a childish high school to find something funny. Poorly made mockmuntaries are so painful to look at, but probably extremely cheap. I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I think these are the only options that hotties can take from their main roads.
