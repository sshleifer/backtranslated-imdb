1999 goes down in history when the film critic misrepresented the public. First they were sent to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they jumped to BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is the worst film of the year. What is it talking about? Who knows the devil. He is full of self-consciousness and poorly functioning. I always like to stay on credit and watch, but when that was over, I didn't get cinemas fast enough. Most of the audience attending the show seemed the same way. Dates were both with each other and with strangers. It's a ugly and angry movie that makes you feel ugly and hateful.
