Howling II (1985) was the first film in the first film. The first film was a horrible and horrible film. The other was buggy and cheesy. The production values ​​on it are pretty bad and the behavior is cruel. The anchorman's werewolf partly wants to know what happened to his content. The "scene" of the first scene was badly created. A skinny ordinary woman, accompanied by a bro (Reb Brown) in an old country (Romania) to discover the mystery of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee will appear and disappear now and then as a stack / guide for two. Sybil Danning and his two biggest assets are Stirba, a Romanian brain werewolf. She also suffers the morning face, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There's nothing good about this smell. I'm surprised that Philippe Mora was leading this picture because he is usually a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that you need to look at the flashlight (not, not the content, but the movie itself). To switch the movie, you get a funny "punk" funny "Babel". Perhaps, if they had peeled over a few extra bucks, they would have become a real deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> It's best to avoid being desperate or losing control and being too lazy to change the channel.
