Sometimes some evil people made a movie into a space man who had to go to Saturn, but only to some shades of solar energy, and then he gets a nose bleeding and before you know he puts his head in the hospital and gets an overweight sister with bad inappropriate uniform and eat the man who had to melt all over the place but never seems to lose weight, and then NASA or at least one man in NASA is upset about it and invites another guy to hunt him, but the guy they went to hunt down the melting man, go home and present the soup, and his strange-looking woman forgot the crackers so that he doesn't get crackers, and then he has to go out and look for the man to melt with the geiger counter, and it doesn't really work, so he really only follows half-dead corpses trail, and then there's something about the sheriff and two ugly old lemon trees, and the women who have the cutters, some industry a company that has happy security guards, and since i can't tell you how the movies end, then i can say that Jonathan Demme is somewhere who has the stupid Burr DeBenning name, and if there is any justice in the world, anyone who has this film-bound, died of an outrageous, violent death and couldn't make more movies and the world lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER - THE END!
