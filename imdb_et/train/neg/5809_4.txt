I don't see why filmmakers are rebuilding this movie. The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. He has no passion for his game. The original "Getaway" activity was also fantastic. But the remake has no action! It is almost boring, despite the fact that the film in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how Baldwin was imprisoned from Mexico. I think it's a story error. So I think it was not necessary to do this, or if they decided to do classical work, they have to choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
