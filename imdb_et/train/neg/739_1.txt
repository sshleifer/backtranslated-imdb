The perpetrators of this crime, Hines and Goforth, start the wrong foot in the first step, assuming that Wells wrote a gothic horror and that all his lines are serious. It's just not true. Wells was a legacy of enlightenment and his main concern was that Victorian satisfaction could leave the British unprepared, so that the new technology could - as good or bad - be. <br /> <br /> The two following terrible consequences - the main character is depicted as a strange career (I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), not a man trying to live the irony of an incredible disaster; and in the "Victorianism" dialogue, it was seriously said that Welles had to be clearly on the cheeks with tongue. <br /> <br /> All of this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood, having a huge budget to waste the CGI effect. In a way that has been so badly achieved, the Warner Bros. (The blood of the bleeding looked like red balloons, I was expecting them to swim in a minute.) Think of a yellow submarine as the old EC comic did. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the disappearance of the subject, which attacks the film for any reason. Although the authors of this film donate their story to their Victorian newspaper, they remain completely empty, as Wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - a fact that Wells himself did not notice who, after the war, changed the subject of "Shape in Things". </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> / p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> There is a lot of people out there who run balloons if they don't really try to produce high school , this is the worst, most useless drum that I have suffered, because a friend told me that thirty years ago I saw the comic book "Fantastic Planet" in Eastern Europe. . This film was so deliberately boring, my friend and myself and the two strangers abandoned the ridicule about half way and sat near the playing cards of the screen, using the film as a light to see the cards - its only benefit, If anyone of us could say. <br /> <br /> But I already have an electric light in my apartment, so I didn't need to deduct this well. <br /> <br /> Don't avoid this movie - Steal every copy you can (don't pay a cent) and burn each one. God in our wisdom created us just for that.
