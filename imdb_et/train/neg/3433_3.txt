It's such a strange movie, you can call it terrible, or if you sit with your friends, it can kill you. Strangely comes to mind again and again. Officially, it worked even worse and in directions, maybe not. Special effects are funny, but the music accompanying the flying demon is definitely the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But don't try to take it seriously. This should be a prize for the "Porno Holocaust" ,. Since I have not seen it, I can assume from this respect that it is so bad. It should have given it 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it gets 3. Too great a glory, the only thing someone worked for. Stay away, if you're comfortable, more than laughing. Don't you know if the makers had a laugh?
