All this amazing waste of stockpile needs is Count Floyd, which opens every sixty seconds. Somehow they got a set of Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flahertyle and didn't get five miles, about eight kilometers from the actual movie. BOY sucks it. There is no original line, thinking, shooting, or effect on the temporary opening sequence near the brain. Five simple pieces of magical, essential Susan Anspach - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. Big mistake - boring. If this is a scary film, Buttercream Gang is a documentary. Seriously, every bad film contains an explanation of its badness. Usually it's an open credit - "Written, Staged and Produced" by one man. Or, at the heart of the action, some bimbo are so talented that you know that this is the only reason that this turkey got. Here you will not know until the end of the last credit, where the co-operation of about ten sub-functions by the Canadian government is grateful. <br /> <br /> I am now looking at MST taking Beast of Yucca Flats to get my taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what healing.
