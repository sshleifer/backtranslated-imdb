It's just Robert De Niro's movie I really hate. It's a stupid movie with a terrible act (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to do his mafia movies like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma's mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro also worked with Palmpa twice, greetings and wedding parties. I did, though, that the wedding party was also OK (I didn't look at the greetings). The scenario is really bad and uncomfortable. There is no scene where I can even smile once. The film lost the chance to be a funny style even in the "Be Black baby" scene and I also don't like the scene where the boy's sexual organ appeared. So, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! only the worst. I hate it.
