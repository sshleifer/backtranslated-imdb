The first Cube movie was an art film. It created a world in which all the great archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled with a hostile world they did not understand. It was literally a "human and cruel nature", where a person representing innocence and goodness came to the end, triumphing with a new, undefined world beyond the man's small bundles; a world where there was no more fighting, but peace. I appreciated Cube from 10 out of 10 and this is a movie that was never meant for after-results. <br /> <br /> Another movie, Hypercube, was a huge disappointment. Some ideas were cool, but in the context of the original film, both story and setting didn't make any sense and had no meaning. However, being quite entertaining, I rated it from 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third film, Cube Zero, the second, ignoring, plays like the first, more magnificent commercial B-film rehash, symbolizes. There is no "respect" or "respect" here; there is only ripping. A similar plot where some elements have been idiotically changed (like letters instead of stars - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that it is a rip-off with no originality and nothing to say). br /> <br /> The fact that we see something "behind the scenes" does not mean that the observers are only part of the Big Bad Experiment that the architects did not hear. And in this movie, those who pass the exit (as well as Kazan at the end of the first film) are killed, where exactly is that feeling? It's just stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​and action in Cube Zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are not so inspired that this film can only get me from 3 out of 10.
