I'm here again in your local mall (of course, this is where high school kids get !!!!!) to show how terrible "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" is actually !!!!! To prove how bad this DCOM joke is ... <br /> <br /> ... we take these four sumo wrestlers and put them in this photocabin. How ... cozy !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How terrible is it ????? It's so bad that the Disney Channel loses its money again, with exciting but still 10-second promotions, keeping viewers thinking, "HOW IS THIS YEAR?" And then, suddenly, when it comes, it didn't just get a higher TV rating than usual, but it was only visible once !!!!! Oh, no !!!!! Once upon a time !!!!! Plus, this movie is about high school and stuff, and believe me, I'm not going beyond what else is there ..... <br /> <br /> Say ch ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. 0/10
