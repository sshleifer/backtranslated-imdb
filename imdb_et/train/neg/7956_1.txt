The film should be in the top 100. The actor is so terrible that when my son and I looked at it, we were almost physically sick. And the story is worse. I could go on and on how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to the francbob review when I see someone else hasn't done it yet. Don't waste your time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thanks for the goodness we saw it on television, so we didn't spend anything on it. If we had been forced to write down the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to perish in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed the work of Carrie Fisher. But I'm sad to say he's not worth watching this movie. Don't ruin your opinion about Carrie by looking at it.
