I don't even understand why so many Godzilla fans think it's great, one of the best Godzilla movies. This movie is terrible and one of the few Gojira films I can't watch again (the other is G. vs Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too combative to be in the Heise series, an attempt to change the bonafide movie of an aging Godzilla franchise, reversing ideas that seemed to be much better in 1974 in 1991. It just sounded ridiculous, especially for some subjects, for example, listening to the death of Godzill's grief, grieving and serious tone when listening to the WW2 scene with Japanese soldiers, and take a former headmaster to capitalism and to his death, a serious vision in a film that fans somehow mean laughing when funny foolish innocents with illogical amusements as if it is just one of the most tasteful movies I've seen, but I think it's more likely that filmmakers lacked just talent, and that was the case when the straight-face action film went bad. It became even worse due to the fact that the special effects are amazing compared to the jet packages to android, all the hesitant sound effects that are impossible to take seriously, but the film is waiting for you, the camera has no nuances. <br /> <br /> Like almost all Godzilla films, it is meaningless romance and it is no exception, although something can be said that it is especially pointless and inexplicable. There is literally no reason for romance, it just happens and there is 360 degrees. In addition, another horrible aspect of this film is dialogue, both Japanese and English, which is terrible, terrible, and perhaps inspired by Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> The Tristra DVD combines problems, making everything sharp, blurry, dim, and simply ugly, as was the case with sound. For the first time in Japan, I saw the 2nd region version and the differences are night and day, with original bright colors and texture, especially a remarkable score, especially the fighting scenes are actually traceable. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heise series is a disappointment, except for Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is little praise here and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is the case of this failure. It does not go as far as fame and fans deserve. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
