The first movie is pretty good. That's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Recovers a lot of video footage (including opening credit and end title) crazy about crime. The video footage of the new video is really bad. The scenes lack the right lighting, sometimes the sound is almost unheard of, there are even video shocks like rolling the picture and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all bad queues, this basically simply repeats the first story. Ethel kills everyone who shares his living space, often for reasons related to what they want to get the food he wants. <br /> <br /> At least this is just the first DVD that contains the same director's Satan's Black Wedding. However, Death Nurse movies are not too bad.
