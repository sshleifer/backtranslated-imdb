The revolution is a terrible film, I don't care if you are a history teacher, a news writer, a fan of Al Pacino, but this movie can't be justifiably justified in earning a "10". <br /> <br /> The key to this point is Tom Dobb (Al), who is trying to get the money he got from the boat to radical patriots. Everybody turns around this note. Tom's son joins the army to offset, turning Tom to the army, they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later the war has ended and they can finally notice their boat. . End. <br /> <br /> It was some battle scenes and at best they were pretty mediocre. Transitions between scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters into the famous historical battle. The love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is just difficult to follow. So save your notes and watch the patriot instead.
