I had always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is the name of Wonder Woman's movie only. the right costume [he must have refused or ordered big changes] and the plot goes like a poor man's James Bond. There is nothing here that has made the comic book heroine a success, ie a supernatural force or a decisive will. bad dream.I don't even think Cathy is attractive anyway. I'm not wasting your time.
