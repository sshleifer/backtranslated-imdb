Unfortunately, I do not remember this book anymore, but I recall that I was fascinated by the songs of Edgar Wallace. This film is a typical German low quality product. It doesn't keep my attention - although the story itself is good, it's just badly accepted. Overly simplified and exaggerated characters are at the heart of misery - they have no nuances in their performances. Even well-known and loved German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy can't save this bad spectacle. But there is hope ... I have been told that the films that follow are better and better. In conclusion, I have to say that this film does not deserve a cinematic screen, but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
