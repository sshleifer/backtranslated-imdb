This film is undoubtedly the worst horror I've ever seen. And it says a lot, considering that I've seen such smellers as the Paradise Demon, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is close to the other). But I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell my username, it really stops. Sometimes nothing is more fun than a poorly made slasher. As far as this film is concerned, it seems that there is no effect on the film at the opening place where the woman bakes in the parking cabinet, especially since the film does not tell you that the event took place 2 years before the rest of the film. Action is non-existent and most camera shots are from female areas that are shrinking into spandex. The police was the monotonous actor in front of the stone I have ever seen. However, the best / worst part of this movie must be a murder weapon. Huge Belt?! What did they mean? Who is the killer? Frustrated "Huggies" Employee? I have to give this film a general zero, but if I didn't see this explosion, I have nothing
