Student Seduction finds a recorded Bell Alumni at Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the table and attracts young and hunky Corey Sevier attention. Speaking of myself, I can really say that no teacher will ever save something that was for me when I was a student. It was Mrs Diaz, who was a music teacher at a young high school. Even as a young boy, I saw what he did with the rest of the class. He was the only teacher I had, who Elizabeth Berkley could have played in some way. <br /> <br /> Corey is hotty, she's also used to her own way with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents confirms this belief. He is a flocking chemistry that Berkley teaches and agrees with a tutor to keep his GPA up, but he no longer believes. <br /> <br /> So if he tries to rape and doesn't get an answer, it damages his ego. When Berkley goes out of the canals and the crime is reported to the police, the police do not have to remember the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau. Sevier's parents have a good public spin for their boy. <br /> <br /> Picking up a student, which is the wrong example of a title, once it has been, is the end of the trash. After beating what Berkley took for Showgirls, this movie wasn't up.
