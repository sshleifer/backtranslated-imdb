I wanted like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (what I liked). 4 different lives / stories that will eventually come together, but Magnolia took half the wrong turn towards the movie and I lost. I stopped it right away and almost away, but I felt like I had to hold it to the end, a little I know it would be another embarrassing 1 1/2 hour. Thank God I rented instead of seeing it in the theater. I was disappointed after almost 2 hours. The biggest impact of the straps was the endless frog. My DVD player is still not forgiven and I do not blame it a bit. It was a unique film, but a bad, boring and pointless film.
