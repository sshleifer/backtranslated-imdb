Really, if he puts it down, this movie isn't just funny. Josh Kornbluth is a funny opponent, but he thinks he's fun. The plot of 17 letters was good first, until Joshi "looks at me, I'm crazy" approach to infect every scene. The joke of the Jewish priest may have been the least funny thing I've ever had, and it says quite a bit because it has tough competition for all the other movie jokes. And like the incredible overuse of Pixies' Debzer, I only have one thing to say: What did Pixies ever do to earn such a destiny? What did someone with Josh Kornbluth say he wrote / direct / product / denotes such a horrible movie?
