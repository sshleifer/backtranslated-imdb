A really terrible, terrible, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems to be beautiful with his actress Detmer's beautiful face and face - and who can blame him? But maybe maybe he should have paid a little more attention to making a good, interesting movie. I hate it if the sex film is an "art film" just to become more "respectable". The only reason for the existence of this film is frequent, occasionally hot sexual scenes. Whether they pay for the rest of the picture is a matter of strict taste. (*)
