This is another bad film that you should probably avoid. The plot could be much thicker than it really is and it would be better to do than blocking film. <br /> <br /> The actor leaves something unwanted, even though you can't put your finger on something that's one of them. <br /> <br /> This is one of the things you look at on late night television, perhaps in the US, just because you can't sleep. Look at it if you want, but don't wait too much for it.
