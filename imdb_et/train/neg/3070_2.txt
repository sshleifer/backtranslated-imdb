Oh, dear lord .... They've changed what was quite a meaningful provocative film that was a powerful testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this film was clearly vague about our heroine. He was a man who was trying to ride from Denver to San Francisco. Why did he want to risk his life with a handful of top price? We're not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had a few setbacks that gave us a picture that he was an adrenaline junkie, and he probably had led his whole life trying to lose it. This is the point you see far away, where the left and right shoulder of the road come together and the road itself disappears. He only lives to be free, and does not mean illness. We saw several times there were accidents that he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before he moved on, even the policemen who followed him. <br /> <br /> When he saw his expediency in vain, he took his life instead of arresting and living in captivity. He died as he lived, wide open. <br /> <br /> In transformation, Kowalsk has all history (including first name, even.) He is trying to get to the hospital where his wife suffers from complications due to his pregnancy. She is a dedicated husband and an exciting anticipated father. He decides to take his life after hearing his wife's death, but they even leave the question when they show that he can jump out of the car before he gets into the bulldozers. They even gave a "super soul", a dark DJ (in the original picture of Clevon Little), JASONI PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Leave me alone.
