Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die is led by Bradford May, the same man who made the first Darkman stage. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2, and I think it's not special. Larry Drake is no longer the main villain currently played by big Jeff Fahey, whose character wants to get Darkman back on the job and this time to create some very strong people to get the leadership of the whole city. The film is pretty much the same as Darkman 2 for pieces and embodiments, but I was mostly irritated by Darkman's 2 scenes. These sequences were made in a short time and little money, so such decisions had to be made. A couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exciting, but it is still quite tired and often irritating. The characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying. The film has no philosophical depth, and it's like a remake of Darkman 2, which it can't even equate. Darkman had a lot of great scenes and stylish camera work, and Larry Drake's ability to play big villains. Darkman 3 only offers some nice scenes and moments, but mostly this movie is tired and full of clich√©s. The few positive things in this movie are the setbacks edits (Westlake nightmares) and a couple of really surprising land turns and tricks. And it is worth mentioning the pretty nasty scene of the main villain, which was a pretty comic book like and inventive without gore. Much more interesting than the death of the main cable in the second part. <br /> <br /> Darkman 3 is the worst in the series and we must remember that these two sequences were made directly into the video and they won't even come closer to Raim's original Darkman with Liam Neeson. Darkman 2 was a good player with lots of great scenes and tension, but the last (?) Entry is tired and often stupid and boring. This has some advantages, as mentioned, but it is a general feeling that it should not be done first. Mai is a talented director, so hopefully she will get even more remarkable projects in the future. <br /> <br /> 3/10
