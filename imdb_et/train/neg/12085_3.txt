There is really no need to start with this little review of the plot summary. I mean, this is Shakespeare's Hamlet for goodness? probably one of the best known ever. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to Hamlet's version of how most people are from IMDb? Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to rate a movie, I can't imagine that I try to watch it without comics. In short, this German version of Hamlet, made on television, is tough. 152 minutes? Not possible! It's too dark and frustrating to have something I want to spend almost three hours. I have said it many times, but entertainment is for me. And this wrist block is far from fun. However, I will give it a few points about what I felt to be a bit of good action. 3/10 sounds right to me. <br /> <br /> As far as I like MST3K, their comments won't help make Hamlet more delicious. Here and there are some good riffs, but generally Hamlet MST3K is just the wrong film. Shakespeare is too talkative that comedy would have some kind of rhythm or stream. As much as it hurts me, I have to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
