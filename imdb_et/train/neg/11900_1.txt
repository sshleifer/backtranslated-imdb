How wonderful. Another movie about America, if somebody who has probably visited here half a dozen times a day and believes himself to be an "expert" in the country. Sheesh. I would like to travel to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie from Germany as a Nazi country or something. Wim IL boy, you should agree with Lars von Trier and make a ULTIMATE movie about the Americans. Of course we all know that it is a conscientious left "we are the world" Europe to make a "real" film about America. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. On a continent that did not start one, but two world wars, Europe will certainly have many opinions about America's wrong "foreign policy". <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't worry, Wim IL boy, there's a lot of UC-Berkeley Americans who love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think that George W. Bush is the worst hit by Hitler, and that the tasty soup painting is "just a genius"!
