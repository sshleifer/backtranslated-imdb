It starts with a nice note to kick off quickly and unexpectedly. . The rest of the drama is how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem to be forced. <br /> <br /> About the story, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actress, I thought she was wasting Moody's cook. Akshay Kumar is acceptable, John Abraham is very badly holding furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only rescue arm in the movie. <br /> <br /> The other side of the movie is funny at times, but in all DUDs (songs are boring) and great hope when you hope for some healthy entertainment and comedy.
