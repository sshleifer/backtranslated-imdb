When theatrical workers find an old movie, they decide to show it on a living dead night when it's an old preview reel. Unfortunately, this is actually an old Nazi mind control attempt that makes the audience meaningless mixing zombies. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the hatred of this movie. It is a low-budget independent production with many bearings, but it does not deserve IMDb "1.1". It's just so much fun. It is obvious that filmmakers have reasonable knowledge and love for old horror films and have created an entertaining respect for them that is sprinkled with references and respect to them. It feels like things like the night of living dead (in very many ways, very similarly), the evil dead 2, and the army of darkness, and many others. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how zombies, though really just hypnotized, think they are zombies, maybe they have the incredible physical qualities of dead people, but I appreciate the efforts of writers to explain it. Gore effects were good for the budget, the operation was fine and the story was fun. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
