I didn't know Willem Dafoe was so hard to bribe him in such a shocking astonishment in this monster. Hell: I'll give you the money I send to Ethiopia when he's desperate. I've never seen a pathetic and disgusting movie for a long time ... who paid for it? They pull a tax scam or crazy. A five-year-old would have shamed the plot and I get cancer rather than sit more than an hour, which I already suffered. Anyone involved should be locked into the wing of the third world prison sodomy within one year. Avoid at all costs. I would give it minus 10 if possible ... incredible.
