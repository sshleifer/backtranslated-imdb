* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes titled "Life Forever". This is often a reference to the final scene, but more precisely describes how dead and buried this re-evaluated series is after this sloppy and illogical transmission. <br /> <br /> There are "hey kids, put on the show air for the telemovie that may be in the places. Some fans feel like insiders because they enjoy all the different stage images. Co-author, co-producer Tom Fontana and his sons are offering Friends and favorites from other shows as well as real Baltimore people. <br /> <br /> It was almost all TV shows had different choices, old favorites and later non-favorites. <br /> <br /> , which laid the foundations of quality-conscious producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team for budget-conscious NBC execs, who simply wanted eleven more poisonous police procedures like "Nash Bridges", which won regular "Homicide" ratings. , collided with the riveting reality that crossed this form and weakened the sensationalism, threw it in a towel. from this series of stories, it added a line of unlikely and artistically fruitless new plot and put a burden on the weaker cast member to carry all the weakness. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, some time has passed since the last episode of the show. The former heart of the Baltimore Slaughterhouse, Yaphet Kotto as Mr Al Giardello, is now a mayor candidate like Kurt Schmoke, and Schmoke himself makes a comedy look. But this promising start will immediately and incredibly tragic. <br /> <br /> Attention is given to Giancarlo Espositole Giardello's son Mike. A stylish man who has done a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of the most beautiful faces that brought late to live in the television series. But the question of the audience was always the following: is Mike uncomfortable as the son of Gee, or is Esposito, which is uncomfortable? <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito cannot play the main story without interruption. The reason for this is that the writers choose this moment to revive another story that attacked the intelligence of the loyal voters of the exhibition. <br /> <br /> Visible sniffing video was promoted and then it seemed to happen on the internet. After some red herring, detectives were arrested by a repulsive suspect. But Zaljko Ivanek, the vice-president, who was harassed and overworked, forgot to make timely proposals and the suspect was released to be murdered later. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, he forgot to submit documents because it was not the most sensational case of his career, as mayor, Attorney General, Governor, All Maryland Legislator, US Attorney General, NBC, Court TV, BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, Johannesburg and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World ask about the status of the case every 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the old detective and companion band is back to Baltimore to help. There are quite a few talents on the screen. Unfortunately, there are a limited number of dialogues, some of which are only displayed. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest players, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, have been abused, while Jon wastes time and could be better promoted by Michael Michelle. Writers seem to be satirizing by presenting Jason Priestleyl as the last major transaction detective. On the other hand, they provide easy-to-come, easy-to-navigate Michelle Forbes highly influencing the scene. <br /> <br /> There is some other clever casting with the actual governor Gary D'Addario, who is the centerpiece of the book. gave the show by playing another detective. Guests will leave other exhibitions, such as Whitney Allen, who will make her body and married Miss Sally's children's show, loved by the inmates of Fontana's "Oz". Dina Napoli WBAL TV will appear on its own. <br /> <br /> Even if entertaining, these guests may be disturbed. Ed Begley Jr. In fact, the story promotes its short look by playing dr. Victor Ehrlichi Fontana's "St. Elsewhere". He's still a living character and suits the hospital. Then you remember if St. Is Elegius not a fantasy of an autistic boy? <br /> <br /> The most useful reflection reflects the company's synergy. This film was made when the court bought the TV with re-directed rights. This network contributed to legal certainty for Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the killing group and later appeared with Oz. The TV correspondent is doing an efficient job of collecting news, that is, landing points for latexomers. <br /> <br /> Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns to the side, Lucaitis carries a little physical comedy with Esposito. She shows more juice with Lucaitis in her scenes than her regular colleagues. Maybe the two should have been spin-off. <br /> <br /> When the film falls, the molded bark will rise. Although they lose the loser script, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor surpassed it. Their performances remind viewers of what made Homicide, a significant stretch, the best show air and one of the best television productions. <br /> <br /> It's fun to look at top profiles for top profiles; it's just a shame that this movie doesn't give them more options. Hard fans can still see this movie, but you can live without it.
