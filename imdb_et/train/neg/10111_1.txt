A terrible act, a bad story, a cheesy makeup and it's just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes I decided to go ahead to see if something redemption would happen ... It wasn't. (Apart from a nice breast) The film was probably filmed in some furniture store and at least 90% of the kits were used in the same warehouse. You can see the same red chair in many different "places". If you plan to make a movie at least rent an office building and an apartment, not a warehouse that repeats your actress's dialogue. (Note to Manufacturers) Renting a small office space and a one-month apartment is much cheaper than the entire warehouse, and both are quite a lot more versatile and credible. If you spend your money to rent this person, I hope you got it with a guarantee of return ... You have demanded your money back ... I spent just $ 2.99 this evening and I feel it.
