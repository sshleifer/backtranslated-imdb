Sky Captain is probably the best terrible movie I've ever seen. The amazing CG and special effects, equipped with the A-list (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and endlessly pleasing Giovanni Ribisi) and racing with the excess, but Indiana Jones-esquire, should have been great for watching the movie. <br /> <br /> "Of course, this should be the main concept here. <br /> <br /> The Jewish Law plays Joe Sky's captain with an agonizing accent and plenty of over-the-back shoulder, the heart melts with smirks, but you can't do anything and even his unpleasant supplies and the boy's good looks won't save the film's rock dialogue. (If he had hit Giovanni Ribis upside down and said, "Good boy, Dex," just once, I could have prevented the whole boy in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, like Polly Perkins, is nothing but a nervous. His nasal and non-sarcastic comments get older in the first ten minutes of the movie. Maybe he made too much effort to play a stereotyped 30th comic book who knows? I waited for him more. An example of playing a similar character (and well played) is the "The Phantom" at the end of the 90s, starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent a movie and find out what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were savvy in the movie. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot on this eyelid. I admit it.) In some short scenes, both participants managed to get up higher than the tired material and provide more riveting results than their dry two-dimensional boxes. br /> <br /> The progress of the plot and the permanent story was old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene in the action film over the past thirty years. Speed ​​is the fast fire in the first half of the movie and the pace of action is second, giving the audience enough time not only to finalize the movie, but also to find out who is also the main villain. Pairing is pretty funny, as Polly Perkins and Sky Captain reunite after a few years of bitterly ending romance, and their story is not as charming and eclectic as it is tedious and inappropriate. When they end up with their mutual feelings at the end of their movie, no one is surprised and nobody cares about it. <br /> <br /> Can a director who appreciates Bai Ling enough to dress her up with shiny vinyl for the entire film and intriguing sepia tones that were the colors. But Sky Captain, despite having all the important films, falls on his face. Not even worth $ 2.75, which I paid to enter the theater.
