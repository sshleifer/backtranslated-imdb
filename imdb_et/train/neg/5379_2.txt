Published on DVD in the UK as Ax, The Choke is a teenage slasher who is unable to perform in almost all departments: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a film composed mostly of people circulating in a dark building; except for the two characters (which are obviously intended for the survivors of the film), everyone is deeply reluctant, which means that the viewer cannot kill less of the maintenance; Deaths are not enough (unless your stomach is short on a fake blood-cured minced meat); and there is no nudity besides a free birthday picture (an unforgivable mistake made by slasher flick!). <br /> <br /> The Vodka's piece sees the punk band members locked, which seems to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless abandoned corridors and spaces, unlike any club I've ever seen), where they can't be seen by an invisible attacker . For a low budget effort, production values ​​are right and cast all seem to be quite capable actors, but not quite real fears, reluctance to really get dirty (this is slasher, where is graphical spray?), Too much terrible dialogue (especially non-dead) -An early enough drummer) and some bad recommended sticky video techniques to add some style, the movie quickly becomes very boring.
