I like the end of the day movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping I'd like this movie. <br /> <br /> I can ignore the bad effects, often the frightening music, the glowing lines. I could ignore the inexplicable events and the fact that the film is constantly dependent on deus ex machin is an excusable subject. I could ignore the fact that people who are fighting hunger and trying to reach world peace are bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it is just plain and simple to bored. Nothing really happens; almost all of the scenes on the film are meant to look at the morals of filmmakers, a single story, or any mid-term review. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fun B-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
