This film was not as double as compared to the first two stages. It is led by Martin Kitrosser on Friday 13th. Action is really very bad, but gore and special effects make it interesting. This is one of the things I like about Screaming Mad George (making up the film's effect as an artist), his effects are both wall and bizarre that they look at you to watch a bad movie to find out how they get crazy. The movie isn't all about it, but in the middle is an extremely unpleasant eyeball munching that includes a toy (which !?) Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic but needed the money at that time? If you liked the strange 4th installment (the favorite of all of me), you probably like it. I liked it better than the matrix! Enjoy.
