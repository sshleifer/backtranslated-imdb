Why? Because for one reason, there has never been anything more wonderful in the movies than Ann Margret sang when opening "Bye Bye Birdie". He repeats it at the end (in a different mood!). Both are wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if it's all you look at. You agree I'm sure. <br /> <br /> All the original was so great that you just don't need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all this new version of the actors and singers gave their "all", but it's like "Casablanca" improvement - it just can't do! It is even tedious to find yourself, compared to the two mentally, when you try to do it, and that is simply the fault of the participants.
