I saw the film on the late night cable and couldn't believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but it was so reluctant that it wasn't even fun. Some of the highlights of this movie are absurd music that is constantly playing throughout the movie, nervous special effects (if someone lets with a laser device, neon green and breaks down immediately) and nasty. In fact, what I feel about stealing an exhibition is. I didn't know any of the film's participants and I hope I never have to see them again. In general, I recommend renting this movie (if you find it; I can't imagine the video store that littered it) just to learn how to evaluate high quality movies after seeing the trash.
