It is often said that films can never be equated with the original book. In this case, not only is the film not as good as the book, it is an insult to the book. I see the fire of Milan Kundera rather than "something" that the director probably calls "adaptation". <br /> <br /> Any beautiful philosophy that asks, "Is it better to carry a heavy burden on your shoulders or cope with an intolerable situation?" has been abandoned and instead all films are dealt with by Daniel Day Lewis (I can't say to Tomas) sexual adventures with his fool, his mistress and his other mistresses. Fran√ßois Truffaut said this already: bad leaders make bad films. Don't waste your time and money. Read the book, it's really worth it.
