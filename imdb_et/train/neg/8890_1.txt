On the first stage of Shakespeare's tasty stage, I can't believe what these people did well. <br /> <br /> - Do we start with good, do we? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogue could have provided more feelings. The rest of the participants had to pull it down. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why aren't you dead yet, Romeo? The actress, though not just wood and dead, couldn't read her lines at all. He was totally uneven, had difficulties even with Julian's eyesight and absolutely no grace he gave. Anyone who makes him deserves punishment. Juliet is almost satisfactory, but she doesn't give her character a depth and it seems the game is completely touched. Mercutio was incredibly horrible and completely absent for all of his dialogue. Benvolio was unknown and merciless with his line. <br /> <br /> I was forced to endure this Roman and Juliet semi-mature production. The actors were stylish and the costumes were not disturbing. I have seen kindergarten doll exhibitions with more effort. I just want to give this movie to zero.
