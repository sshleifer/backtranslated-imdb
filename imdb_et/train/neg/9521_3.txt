This movie has recently played a lot in HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they expect people to be interested in the same name as the captain of Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks. The only reason to see it is the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I have to say that Matt was a tooth for more than a long time to play in college. If she were a woman, they would have played her as a mother of a high school! (Is it just me, or does his daughter look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Typical teenagers playing with adults.
