Maybe it's duplication, maybe it's scenes of endless, silent, or otherwise continuing people, but I found that Europa '51 is one of the most burnt (and therefore annoying) movies I've ever seen. The film begins as promising, as familiar, because Mother Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled son (Sandro Franchina). While mommy and dad (Blessed Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests during a dinner party, the child tries to kill himself, starting with a series of life-changing events that find that Bergman spends time with mercies and the poor. Inspired by the Communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), he will soon spend more time with his wife who will soon lock her into a crazy shelter. Bergman plays a sacred role by listening to his role in 1948, Joan of Arcina and Rossellini doing great lighting and filming him best. Unfortunately, the script captures the tooth in his home area, as Andrea and his mother take turns alternating between Marxist and Christian. In the last tear-tapped scene, I had more of these tiring characters than my full. A real step towards Rossellin when he stepped away from neo-realism and in turn took over the 1950s. The mythical and mystical themes of Francis flowers.
