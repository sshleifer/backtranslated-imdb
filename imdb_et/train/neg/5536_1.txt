Zombie rebellion has no redeeming qualities. I'm tired of people claiming that it's not so bad, and that the effects must be more weighed in 1936. I suspect this is not true: it is not as IQ has risen sharply over the past 7 decades. The 1936 average viewer was probably as boring as the garbage as the average viewer. Why? Just try to look at the first scenes and read the breaks between the breaks that take place, the terrible choices of when to cut close-ups. Pay attention to a completely redundant dialogue: "I'll do some / go outside / read my book now." "Are you?" "Yes, I am." This exchange takes place several times. Usually I love it, being a huge fan of bad movies, but see what hopeful actors are trotting their tricky and annoying traits, and all the desire to smile from the film slowly disappears. This unselfish, pot-boiling timepiece is much worse than an energetic, imaginative mind-blower like Plan Nine from Space or Santa Captures Mars. For those who claim to be "better" than more interesting movies, entertainment is afterwards. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw is open in astonishment: it is bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly bored. What is much worse.
