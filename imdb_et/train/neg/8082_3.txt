It was one of those late nights, "It's There," I saw it. Sometimes they are big. It was terrible, but it shouldn't have been. <br /> <br /> The movie was really good. How can you fail if you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking here about the Oscar winners. It had good special effects. She even had some very good tits! And I mean nicely shown, full breasted nipple and even a beaver at one point. But this does not compensate for one missing ingredient - the story! The plot was ridiculous. I don't mean the "sunshine" sun is exploding, but it was bad enough. It was the rest of things - oh so stupid and completely predictable evil business stuff. A person who just WILL! No number of good-performing or cool spacecraft or fighting scenes can go around it. <br /> <br /> I've seen that the same cast members are incredibly good. I've seen wonderful science fiction with little loud and budgeting. All the difference is in writing.
