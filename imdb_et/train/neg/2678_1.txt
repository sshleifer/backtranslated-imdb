Something positive to say. Moving the consonance, nervousness, and swelling of the "message". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (remembered), but many have a cardboard bundle and a post-asbestos flavor (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). It is a null void type. Acting would be terrible, if not so, that sustainable grace was completely unappealing and incompetent editing, which is sometimes so terrible that it interferes with the impotence of the actors. Special prize for a cameraman to make sure every shot is shaky (would anyone realize that Blair Witch has had 15 seconds of undesirable fame?) And is aimed at pre-teens of attention deficit who fall behind CounterStrike and masturbation. Female lead creates and tries to seduce too often, male antihero needs a dictation bus (though genetics is not bad: rather expressive eyes.) One (average) finger on this unofficial heap. Anyone who looks at it positively is the cousin of the "road" (distant).
