In the 80s and 90s I spent eight years in cinemas. It was by far the worst film I ever showed to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that he was trying to be a big, inspiring film. Even the great Gregory Peck couldn't save this terrible save much less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis demonstrated early on the role of a non-horror film clearly that he had not yet studied (he's still tried it, but it doesn't get much better). <br /> <br /> I am sorry and here is a spoiler, international nuclear disarmament never happens just because it makes children afraid to play a little too much baseball! Even Nick's and Disney's shows are not stupid enough to try to believe that this is a dreck. <br /> <br /> It's not a worthwhile time to waste it on cable TV. It's not worth the cost of renting a movie; your dollars would be better spent on a microwave popcorn to go with another selected movie (because it may be better than it).
