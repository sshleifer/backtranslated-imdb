What did they mean by Cannes? One of the most irritating movies. Every detail of this movie, no matter how pointless it was. If I had to look at how to put them in their shoes, I think I would have called. If the idea of ​​this film was to show how pathetic the life was on Rosetta, it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the credits would have to work. But no, we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over again. The whole thing was full of improbable and atypical signs. They deserved Rosetta. And I think I went up to "Tumbleweeds" to see this jumping movie boredom. It was like watching the grass, but it was more exciting.
