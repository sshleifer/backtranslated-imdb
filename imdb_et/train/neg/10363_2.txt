I have grown up over the stories of wrinkles in time chronicles. My dream was that one day the screenwriter will meet her child, sitting on a large couch, reading A Winkle in Time and wondering what this amazing film is doing. Unfortunately, the screenwriter failed, changing characters, fluttering in humor, and all destroying the plot. I know turning a very beloved novel into a movie is a difficult task. But why can't you resist the book? Why do you need to change the way people think and function? For those of you who haven't read the book, find it, find a soft sofa and let your imagination go wild.
