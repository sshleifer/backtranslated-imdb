Tubling a romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood, about loving relationships that grow between gentle (Kay Lenz) and Los Angeles real estate agents in their golden years (William Holden, surprisingly pleasant in this highly customized arrangement). The script is small, but without some thoughtful paragraphs; However, the scenario is now a middle-aged clich√© that most of the images come out clean. It may have worked much better with different drivers: Holden and Lenz are not well suited (his growth is so small that he puts a tower around him), making their intimate scenes less confusing than just uncomfortable. Date, foggy-romantic and mostly unmemorable. ** from ****
