Here's the horror version of PRISCILLA: DESERT Queen (they want!) Starring Melinda / Mindy (RETURN TO THE PLACE OF RESIDENCE 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert who pulls the boy's head with his friend Johnny (Jason Durr). He arrives at a sadistic prison headed by the overuping Robert Englund toupees. He and his beloved pet stores are hiding in a gas station in the monastery until they have been recently redesigned by a fallen meteor. Dogs become uncomfortable with the dragon's "females" and Candy is developing very long, talking about killing a carved tongue she can't control. Thugs, who are looking for stolen looting and other mixed samples, add additional complications. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is fantastic and makes this movie. You look at him and you see someone very funny during scenes, very convincingly during horror scenes and very sexy in various wigs and disguises, including striking, skin-tight latex body ... and don't know how this actor is not a big star. It is too bad that the rest of this cult game does not fulfill its promise. <br /> <br /> Blame Director / Scripter Sciamma, who thinks that a stand-alone assumption is enough to keep laughing ... but his vulgar, annoying supportive characters, and stupid dialogue will not replace the true sense of humor. Another pound at the coffin; The film looks cheap, with many delicate colors and kits being strangely silenced by muddy photography and dusty desert. Fortunately, Sciamma is that Clarke is in her movie because she alone keeps watching you.
