Unbelievable. Does this have some sort of murder? There is no way. Even the stupidity of this movie would be ashamed of Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If there was a mediocre dialogue in the first half of the series and the other was a bad dialogue, this dialogue is cumbersome. Amazing. But this time the story has also fallen to the level of dialogue. Despite the exemplary and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will certainly kill the franchise. A completely moronic primer so obviously derives from a frustrated left flange pencil. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, you do not know whether these leftists even understand how they are democracy and dictatorship. In this film, are they apparently directed to the US? democracy. Why aren't they aimed at military films in Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc.? Of course, most of these places may not be able to quickly make such a cube, but it is next to the point. It is obvious that such garbage writers admire such regimes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even like to say that at any time, who is constantly attacking US foreign policy, it has democratic beliefs at its core. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. that it's no longer funny, the film has a lot of obvious illogicality. For example, for some reason, two men who run a cube have been doing it for a while and they are not aware of the pain and sadism associated with the project, but the first one unexpectedly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea of ​​human nature just sees this idiot. Or how this terrifying character, one-eyed evil bureaucrat, who speaks like he's bad Mel Brooks in comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses the seriousness of ALL and thus all the possibilities to be exciting: it really becomes comedy.
