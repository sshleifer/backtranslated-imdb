I can see where some of the people involved in this attack wrote comments to share with their story, and I thought what they wrote was useful for understanding it. The fact that they made excuses in principle - rewriting, budget constraints, production formats, etc. - simply emphasizes how bad this film is. And my criticism in panning is not personally directed, but just a warning that it doesn't make a paragraph. <br /> <br /> It's traceable, but hardly. There are holes in the plot in each corner, the dialogue is just ridiculous and the end is a mile away with the telegraph. The modestly interesting feature of the hologram communicating with the reconstruction team is the foolish dialogue that makes the meal in the middle of what should be tense and lethal contact with an unknown enemy. Could you get us some Hamburger Helper Sally killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently, this elite team, equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tube, has no access to MREs. When they get into the latter rooms, they treat the place more than four-star motel as a deadly collision zone. <br /> <br /> The logic of a frightening Rook meeting is that you can't kill him with one hand. But only one scene back, the hero gave up the case to King to do it exactly. Ah? Vivian Woo was attractive and adheres to the film's best-performing character. But it doesn't talk much.
