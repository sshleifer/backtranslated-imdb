What can you say about this movie? It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good! Two days earlier I was watching Lilliesit and it was one of the best Gay movies I've ever seen. So it was not the best time to watch a mediocre Gay Flick. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid and the actor was OK. It wasn't bad enough to turn off, but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotypes. It wasn't very well cast. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No, you're wasting your time and money. I do not understand why such films have been made and who finances them. Spend your time looking at Noah's Arc instead. I think this is where this movie tried to go, but never got there.
