Some have commented here that this is a WORST Elvis film ever made. Well, they are only partially correct. For me, this is a POSSIBLE FILM WITH NO TIME! I've never seen anything so profound about the raw material and offensive and whistle and human nature as this movie. The real embarrassment of the film industry, it's not so bad, good. There's no soft fun here, like some of Elvis's other bad movies like Clambake. It's so fussy to sit through your pain. Pure Garbage. Native Americans should complain about their bad clich√© and stereotypical treatment. In fact, all human beings should sue for the crime and serve this movie for the whole species with 0 stars, seriously. Rating: F
