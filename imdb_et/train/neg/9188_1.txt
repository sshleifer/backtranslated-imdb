This is the only movie I've seen, made by Uwe Boll, I knew he was probably the worst director who always made video-based movies even when "dead house" is one of the bottom 100 of IMDb. But I wanted it still watch because i am a big fan of the game and i wanted to see what the movie is so bad about. After watching it, I agree that it is crap, there was no story on the film. In the first 15-20 minutes, there was nothing but topless teenage girls who had no brains (for a while I thought zombies were the brain? Or the girls?), Then the zombies jumped out at night. and began to attack people later, the woman began to shoot them. I mean, it will take you to one place, then another every 5 minutes. Should this be a comedy? Or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up at the end of the credit, so I couldn't look at what was good! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please don't make more movies. Thanks!
