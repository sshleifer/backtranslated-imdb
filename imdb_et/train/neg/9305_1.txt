I and my friend rented this movie because it sounded very good. But we were wrong. First acted .... wow ... the operation was the worst, the effect was also very bad, the movie seemed to be a college kid. The plot was pretty good, but it was done. The actors most killed the films. The main guy was the worst actor ever ... it's a shame that I call him even an actor. The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad that it was funny ... so if you want to laugh look at it .... but other than that ... stay far from it. I usually love B list movies and such, but this ... I don't know how to transfer it to the video - it's the worst I've seen ... and I've seen some bad ones.
