Kid (Prince), song singer song, on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife's beating father (Clarence Williams III!) And his own destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater in 1984. I wasn't a big Prince fan, but I liked the three big songs of this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry". The scenes of this movie's concert are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is a very small part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is intimidating and has been done many times - and much better. The sub-blocks are, nicely placed, poorly handled. The love triangle between Love Love Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I was actually offended. Her husband, who beat the father, needs a story, but the scenes are treated so badly (acting and heading) that I couldn't believe it. The script is terrible - a sad dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. And here's a ton of failure - the boy's mother kicks; The boy strikes Appolonia and (for some reason) stripes of Appolonia and goes swimming in a dirty river. Williams and Princes' characters also treat women constantly and terribly. <br /> <br /> This is where this movie really fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but not an actor. And the prince is (just) WORST actor I've ever seen. His empty face and wooden dialogue are so bad that I couldn't believe it. This movie only lives during concert scenes, but not so much. "Dramatic" scenes are so badly behaved and handled that they make it a movie. They should have done that for a concert. I'll give it 2 - just for music.
