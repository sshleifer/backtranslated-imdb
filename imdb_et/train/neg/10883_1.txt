This movie was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I've seen it under the name "fantafestival". I find this terrible because some scenes seem chaotic and blind as music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no stop. film. Music is a complete story and I have no words describing visual effects. When you look at the first scene, it seems that the movie is interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy. needs a full review.
