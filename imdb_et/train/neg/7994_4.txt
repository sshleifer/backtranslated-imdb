A pretty worthless TV movie that pretty much follows the killer's insect script. Ants becomes mysteriously murderers near the hotel. I think this is the hotel food because the water in the hotel kitchen flows directly into the anti-bed. There is no tension in this film and it is not scary either. Looking at a number of ants in their victims is not very terrible. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Section The hero's stupidity is almost incredible. He is said to be a health inspector that ants cannot be a hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says it, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys a huge colony. It disturbs millions of ants and tries to catch the hotel people. <br /> <br /> Final Spoilers Overall, this movie is very flat. I do not understand why he got a DVD, if so many films are not worth it. My only guess for a DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is on the film. This is a movie that must be avoided.
