This movie is hidden and unchecked. It's far from the 89 Batman he's trying to break. That women are singers who can't act on her name, and we see why her filmmaker died. Notice how this movie died in the box, and no one can see this movie on TV. My uncle and dad waited for Batman and the film's impression was Cop Rock. No fee to rent 3/10
