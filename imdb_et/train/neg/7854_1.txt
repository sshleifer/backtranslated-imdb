wow this is the worst movie ever. the only reason I signed up for IMDb was that I could complain about this movie. I've never left the theater or stopped the DVD, but I almost stopped it (and I had to). but I looked at it to the end just to finish the terribly terrible end. wow if it is all that the waven craven can produce its time is long up. I've never seen the first one ever before. his terrible act with a terrible plot. He sees someone reflecting the mirror with us. And the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD, it was attacked forever. so I feel bad for all the people who saw this spam.
