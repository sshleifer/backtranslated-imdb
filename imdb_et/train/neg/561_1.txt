Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it is unfortunately worse than you think. First, the plot is idiotic, it doesn't make any sense. The scenario is full of deliberate funny dialogues. Audience laughed several times. And the relationship is very low. The actors play it, except for Sharon Stone, who has some good moments, but also some terribly bad actions. The saddest parts are when he tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want to * I whisper to you" and seem to say it, gently, a very mature woman who is acting rude and not sexy. The erotic voltage of BI1 is completely gone. The Basic Instincti 2 technical point is mediocre film - better than typical straight to DVD, but much lower than the original film. For example, the mad joy of the scene is badly done. The Basic Instinct 2 Director is not Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and its exhibitions. The script is made by people who do not fit Joe Eszterhas. Michael Douglas will not replace it. The film seems to be inexpensive and poorly edited from time to time. I'm sorry, but my first thought after leaving the theater was, "Why didn't the sky make this movie earlier and the success of the first movie with original talents?" All that is in the original film is similar to Kane. The first basic instinct is classic and was a popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. It was the best career in Sharon Stone's career. It had this particular Paul Verhoeven style. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an accidentally funny movie, badly targeted and confident in many categories of Razzie award winner. It is a pity they made this movie.
