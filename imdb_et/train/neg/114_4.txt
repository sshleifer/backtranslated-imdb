It's not cast. The finer the group of participants, you didn't find. This is not a device. The director is in love with New York and by the end of the movie we are all! Woody Allen couldn't do what Bogdonovich has done here. If you're going to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the movie's problem is the script. Missing. Actors fall in love at first glance, words are not needed. It is the director's own experience in Hollywood that happens when they go to work. It is a reality for him and his peers, but it is a fantasy for most of our real world. So in the end, the movie is hollow and low and message-free.
