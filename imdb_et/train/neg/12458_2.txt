The premise of this film is so simple and obvious that only Texas millionaire with high oil and whiskey would have trouble understanding it when someone called it over the old car park. To sum up, the oil industry is with the government (or, if you like, with Gummint), Gummint is with the Middle East despots, and the CIA is the only double-acting sons (English word) ready to support all the lines that come their way. The only people who have gone through are good, like Mr Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is caused by the poverty that globalization causes when evil multinationals lurk in the world, looking for delicious takeover or three. It is well suited to the profiles of the 9th well-off criminals. <br /> <br /> In Syria, this light-hearted temptation of political half-characters and Hollywood holograms turns and turns through its insignificant sections until the poor viewer alone concludes that: <br /> <br /> 1. " The director "(good joke)" should never be shot again near the camera. <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt know how to act, but they don't know how to choose a script. <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a movie that deals with big business and state corruption, go and see Claude Chabroli's "L'ivresse du pouvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acting. <br /> <br /> The empty, doom-laden sententious piffle was turned into an evening of destructive length.
