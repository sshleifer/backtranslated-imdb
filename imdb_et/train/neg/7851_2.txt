As has been said countless times, the "The Hills Have Eyes 2" (Wilson Craven's original 1977) is not the result (generally ignored) since the mid-1980s. But wishing to give this postmodern sequel to the official temple of "Reducing Returns", Craven himself (double the danger of his son Jonathan) decided to make a film of the same quality - in English, HORRIBLE. Former music video director Martin Weisz takes over Alexandre Aja's boards and is clearly over his head, but wonders how someone could have written 101 movies on the Cravens screen. Not only the characters (in this case the disciples of the national guards of the waiter sent to investigate the turbulent mountains of the original remake) are totally uncomfortable and tend to be really annoying pitfalls (played without irony licking, remember you), but they are always cracking jokes that are not funny . After looking at their full intuition during training, their fate against reluctant roaming callers is painfully obvious. Only at this time - as in the original 80s order - is the script so simple (hardly exist, actually) that any potential subtext is occupied to complement the annoying shocks (we have a combined labor) during the opening credit and free rape for those who haven't released the center DVD!). Even the mutants of this trip are not memorable person-free freaks - the sticky, rubber-looking makeup FX seems like the rest of the movie, trying to hide its face from embarrassment. I really silenced the lame 'surprise' at the end of the otherwise excellent movie and the producers literally went to the end of the "Hills 2", setting the stage - VERY lamely setting the stage - third installment ... but Cravens and Weisz have created a movie that is such cynical bastardisation , which made the 1977/2006 versions work that they would have found in the audience after this offensive blow.
