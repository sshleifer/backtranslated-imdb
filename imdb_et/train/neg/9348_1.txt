I found this film embarrassing. I felt that it would be a mess to ruin my throat if I couldn't take the nuances because I needed a voice to write them all out for me. <br /> <br /> From a father who is still alcoholic, I didn't feel that it was a movie of alcohol as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics, I think are very lonely people. They have a hard time communicating, something that the main character did not actually have, unless he had a problem with DID, saying I loved you in one place - a bit of a weak effort to determine his cold character. He was constantly surrounded by people! <br /> <br /> I felt that it was a fraud that at one point we were not really alone in nature to really feel our inner loneliness and instability. I couldn't deal with it and had no connection with my father. I didn't feel anything at all when it was finished, just relief was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actress, but not a tough guy! The yellow orange thing was as subtle as the brick. McKidd was too old for teenagers, they should have had three different characters or prevent a teenager and focused more on adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> Good note I felt a little boy actor was really good at the beginning of the movie !!
