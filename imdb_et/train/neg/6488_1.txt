Yes, the topic is a direct quotation from the movie and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so pointless to die with this pointless effort. Everything is blinking, etc., which doesn't make sense in the first 20 minutes, it's just a bad movie + If you are epileptic, you would have died at least five times. Of course, all David Lynch fans would lift the flag of this type of turkey to be "the best movie ever made" because it doesn't make sense and if it doesn't make sense that it must be art and art film is always good. Is it? I'm saying WRONG. This kind of artificial gripping of art is just a pathetic way to try to show you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins, as an excellent actor, should simply remain in action.
