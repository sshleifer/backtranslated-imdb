I looked for the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with an irritatingly too dramatic "camera maker"). <br /> <br /> When I realized it was all staged, I thought, "Why do I want to waste my time looking at it?" So I turned it off and came online to warn other people. Characters do not work credibly. too many immature emotions. when a man travels around the world, he acted like a child. and I don't think it was because "his character was so upset about the mall's bomb attacks". <br /> <br /> Very tricky and stupid. <br /> <br /> Have you seen "The Lost City" Kids? French Dark Fantasy Films of Boys Who kidnap and steal their dreams ... I liked it!
