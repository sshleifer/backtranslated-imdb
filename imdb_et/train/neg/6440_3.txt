It was one of Wrestleman's worst visions. It just didn't look like it. The card was smart, I thought it would be pretty good, but every game seemed short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the best matches. Benoit wore it. I just didn't think the MVP was so big, but Benoit saved this game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs Khali Wow, these two guys don't mix. Or maybe it is Khali and any other living person. Amazing game play. Melina vs. Ashley I'm not a fan of woman wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals and New Breed I was excited about this game until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs CM Punk vs King Booker vs Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB match. Just a big shot for many people around the same time. It just didn't live. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga O.K. not particularly impressive, but not the worst night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs Undertaker It was probably the best night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs Shawn Michaels I really feel this game is the last one. People do Batista v. Undertaker, but it was just as good. I'm gonna get sick if I see the price win every game. It's a little old. Now I have to say that I feel this game is the best night, but I'm a big Shawn Michaels fan so I'm a little biased. Batista vs. 'Taker might have been better, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games of the night and everything else was really short.
