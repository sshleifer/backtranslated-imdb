I chose this movie with the cover that was a bad move. It wasn't funny at all, and the main characters were reluctant. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the acting were terrible. It had nothing to do with surfing. A terrible movie with a surf "subject" that didn't have anything to do with surfing or real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the film seems to be reviving because she is now in the limelight, married to Gordon Gekko and everything, but if you haven't seen it, it won't waste your time. Bad film, big surfing, REAL surfers and AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL cinema was in God's hands.
