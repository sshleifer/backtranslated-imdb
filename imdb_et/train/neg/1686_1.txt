Imagine your date asking what kind of movie you want to see, and you remember that the Grudge has a pretty intriguing trailer. So we recommend watching this movie in good faith. After all, it's the Halloween season. And it happened to the bofokontor last weekend, so it must be pretty good ... so you're going. <br /> <br /> And you're really in shock when the movie ends like it does. and you hear yourself audibly, "it can't be the end of the movie." But unfortunately it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine displacing the movie theater is embarrassing and shameful to recommend such a movie dog. You think your date thinks you are surprising to suggest such cruelty, and your proposal will definitely end with a promising relationship. In fact, it was so bad that we both cracked laughing, how bad it was. I do not see Miss Gellar in the future of the film and do not recommend that she remain on TV in the future. In fact, it is not a long time before it is sent to the flea market conventions sold for Buffy memorials, and it cannot happen quickly when you ask me. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The plot didn't make sense; Continuity was terrible. It is obvious that the whole end ended with "Grudge II -" With the return of the Cat-boy "."
