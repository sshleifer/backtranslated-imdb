This film had such a great potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and a clearly decent budget. I'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of them was wasted. The story went somewhere, the characters were insignificant, and the result was a very boring, pointless waste of the movie. I hated it. Judging by the other votes, I am in a minority here and it must be some sort of freak. But I thought this movie was terrible. I had great hopes, but I was very disappointed. Particular disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A very bright "fixer" is a nice idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went somewhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - enjoyable, but nothing new.
