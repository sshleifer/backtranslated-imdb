I'd give it a negative assessment if I could. I went to the movie that didn't wait much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! Snakes are probably fake and the first two things they bite are boy and boys johnson. Oh, how the original; if I were a 12-year-old boy, I could laugh at it. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously, the worst I've ever seen. I was not entertaining, it wasn't funny, I wasn't even bored! I was nothing. It wasn't so bad that it was good, it's just bad. Ridiculous in fact. Please don't waste your money on this movie. Don't even rent this movie. No idea how it is so high.
