The problem is the role of the characters in the film. A person to man shows a British anthropologist who kidnaps two pygmies and takes them to Scotland and realizes that they are neither animals nor subhuman, but actually equivalent to themselves. The problem is the role of the Pygmies in the film - two people who have been abducted are treated like animals, but have such a low stereotypical role in the film ... The abductor (British anthropologist) arrives at the hero's hero movie because he "drives" to associate with the Pygmies ... the idea of ​​how two hostages feel their challenge ... ... I find it a low film with a one-sided racist view ... it will never get away from the "white man" view
