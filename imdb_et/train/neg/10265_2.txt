Kirstie Alley, looking a bit weaker, but just a little bit, is confused with a man who looks like MacGuyver, bleached blonde hair and everything. The prerequisite for this film is an older woman (50 !!!) who does not receive her scenario because of age discrimination, so she sends her younger nephew as a writer. Not an original idea and not a very good film with a sad actor, a lame dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot for the character of the coffin and the writer who creates admiration, which is why it is a mystery. The actor depicting Kirstie's brother is so woody and imperfect, torture was watching these scenes. What to say about this movie. Avoid it.
