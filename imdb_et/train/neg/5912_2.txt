Having enjoyed Mike Myers' earlier work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations for looting 60s bonds were quite high. After the first minute, it became clear that it was an exercise to be as pure and unusual as possible. I stopped off after ten minutes. I watched this second day the second time to see if I was first unfair. I turned it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe that even a twelve-year-old boy could find it funny. Dialogue is a failure, Myers is painful to look (like Heather Graham) and the sequence of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes things even worse. After the design of the slightly amusing title and psychedelic set, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Personally, I recommend that you avoid it like a plague, although many of my friends enjoyed it (maybe they were blinded at that time).
