I'm watching this movie right now on WTN because it was the channel the TV turned to when I turned it on. This is not a very reliable and quite boring story of the minister's wife (Alexandra Paul) who has Corey Sevier's young studs (washing machine abs). There may or may not be a plot. Corey whips her shirt and Alexandra swoons. I have the feeling that he should be no good, and that's why he's confused with lean Alexandra Paul. It's not really important because, as I said, he takes his shirt off and I just tried to look at the crack of the ass. Music has a lot of scissors that are just painful.
