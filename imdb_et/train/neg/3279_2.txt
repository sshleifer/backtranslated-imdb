Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies I want to see there ... I stayed with my nephew over the weekend and he wanted to - Yes ... <br /> <br /> I used this example to I was in college ... it was pointless, confident and somewhat activity-oriented. The exhibition had a good heart ... and the characters were lovely; nobody ever killed or even hurt wrong ... it was like a comic in life. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? It does not work. As others have said, it's not just a single story and the performances are weird ... almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters ... the whole thing is like a mad TV skit and it lasts over 100 minutes! It was one of the few times I've been watching the EMBARRASSED movie. What did they mean? As I can best say, you must have been in product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is that it dies quickly. It makes the original Duke of Hazzard a seemingly masterpiece theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only television remake is Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
