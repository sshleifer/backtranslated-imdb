I don't know what it was about this movie that made me react so visually. Perhaps those characters were so unlikely and not caring enough. Maybe it was an inconsistent storyline. Perhaps it was a fact that Rob Lowe wore a long silver earring and eyeliner. Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all burst into the song. Maybe it was because the 1980s was never the 80s. Maybe it was because everything was a gentle hyperbole. Perhaps it was because the character pumped his fist away from the camera while he was away. I don't know what it was, what made me hate, but if that means looking at it again, I don't want to know it.
