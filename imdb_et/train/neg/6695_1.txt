I've been doing something for this Kari chick for a while, and as far as he was watching this movie, there are no complaints. But after he tried last night in DEFINING THE HEIGHT, I'm sure this is the only thing that isn't inferior. The script is terrible, the behavior is terrible, the direction is terrible. In another comment I saw someone commenting on how big the sexual scenes were ... what? Not at all. If the film is bad, you can simply soften it with porn, but I can see some pasty white dude that prevents me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that don't offer me anything but tease. They would have had to go to the cinema, so the film wouldn't be a waste of time, but not. With the script, they should frighten Wuhrer's appearance, as it is a single professor of film. 2/10, just because he was so hot.
