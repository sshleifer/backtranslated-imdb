- I was planning to write something that explains what I didn't like about this movie, but it's harder than I thought. Honestly, I don't remember that much. I looked at it just three days ago and it didn't impress me. This is usually a sign of a real stinker. The only thing I remember was that most of it was boring. The similarity of Humphrey Bogart's appearance, as the detective wore, was a real hurry. It would be different if he could act, but he is a single-minded entertainer. The scenes of killing were handled amateurly and did not bring any relation to them. If you don't see a murderer in five minutes, you need to see more Euro-horror. Casting is the corpse's killer identity.
