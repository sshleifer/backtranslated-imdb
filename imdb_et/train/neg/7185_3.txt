I was interested in seeing this movie after seeing this plot and my desire to watch the horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment it became a comedy as a horror. The film's functioning, dialogue and flow were all very badly done. Much of this didn't make sense. For example, there is a party of about 30, and they all fear one person, despite being in a secret place and all healthy, young adults, and the men who threaten them are haggard. I thought maybe it was a parody of another movie, such as Scary Movie, but they tried too hard to make it terrible - the emphasis on the test. <br /> <br /> Blood and gore are also badly done. I've seen that Halloween costumes are more plausible. The boy who had the head cleaned it off ... looked clean - there are no signs of bone, meat, blood, and even head. Striking down the body with an ax would put something in it ... it seemed that the boy turned a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Discovering who the main villain was to be twisted but contradicting the story with other parts. What was the boy's mind to get out of this way? If there is a twist, you should at least build it up by adding mystery and intercourse.
