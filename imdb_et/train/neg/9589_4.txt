This movie is terrible when you pay attention to it. This is the perfect movie when you look at the colorful pictures that are danced across the screen - each of them has no obvious connection with another. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and I appreciate music. In the final, Bowie had a total of ten minutes in the movie, and the songs and dance series were rare and left something to be desired. The story of morality was really terrible. I could not say whether it concerned or not to sell racial issues in London in the 1950s. In the first half of the movie, I was ridiculous when it was, but I liked the "don't sell" message. When the black people started murdering, I thought my tape had crashed. Maybe I rented half of two different films? No, there was a song and dance sequence "Keep Britain White". Sorry, but World War II is nothing you can write about music. At least not musical, which could be thought of as "campy", as I have in this review several times. In general, I would like to say that this film could do much better if it built up its mind and better actors. (And David Bowie made it more godly for longer!) My rating: C-
