Andie McDowell is a beautiful 40-year-old woman, whose late start in a serious relationship leads her to a significantly younger man and a downstream with two long-standing best girldfriends. <br /> <br /> The Goldsmith's sincere young man, the "girl friends" who are dead when this "stupid relationship" is over, goes beyond the obligation to invite his friend to "help" (who is obviously a complex game of this gigolo.) <br /> <br /> The order of the short situations is absolutely ridiculous. The pulled-in does not cover it any more, without these incredible scenes being a hope for a sweet love story. The head is involuntarily shaking - these things just won't happen! that he has great expectations for this movie, most (like me) are very disappointed, on a scale of 1 to 10, this is weak for me 4, there is a much better material not worth my time.
