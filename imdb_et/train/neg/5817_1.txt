The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive. The characters were stereotypical "white-bins", the "plot" was stapled from the beginning, and the worst feature of this film was that nakedness was twice as funny from the body. Unfortunately, it was the only funny thing in the movie. Mrs Jenkins would be better off if she refrained from using her biography for entertainment in the future. It was just so bad. One of the positive aspects of this movie (it has nothing to do with the lack of film quality) is that my brother picked out this stinker money.
