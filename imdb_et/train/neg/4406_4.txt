This budget-hungry Italian action / sci-fi hybrid contains David Warbeck as a Miami reporter, selected by the Atlantean people's ghosts (!) To stop the use of a telepathic fetus by an evil businessman (Academy Award candidate John Ireland) using asteroids spores to rule the world. You got all this? Despite this remarkable plot, it really is pretty clean, and ATLANTIS RAIDERS despise it with contempt. To be honest, the most (most deliberate) creative thing about this flick is the easy reprocessing of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for opening titles. The most inadvertently creative bit involves a scene in a lab, which has been unexplained twice back and forth. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted us to get all the avant-gardes in his career in the dark? I was going to announce that this worst movie in Ireland will restart, but then I saw there was SATAN CHEERLEADERS there. I would also like to firmly declare that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do this and Hitchcock VERTIGO.
