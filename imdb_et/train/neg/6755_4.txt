Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman with mental instability who has a difficult past who goes more than she wanted when she goes to a pool with a nice co-worker. If his date and his friends say they belong to the "Murder Club", Maddy takes it seriously and moves directly to "Level 3", pushing the woman's brain into the parking house (car for teeth!). But is Maddy the one who carries the plastic and kills other members of the group or has anyone lost it? <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly prepared, full of slits and spirals that are completely under control before the ridiculous, left-hand shutdown ends. Part of the dialogue is ridiculous. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the supportive majority was terrible. At the same time, I managed to sit down carefully with the release of this full moon. There's a lot of skin and blood and it's a perfect nerve movement to sit with your group of friends and pick out. Horror fans can also enjoy Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (like Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (early victim). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
