I'm really having trouble evaluating this movie. That's great looking, it's obviously a lot of money. Gere and Danes are intense (although his screen personality could use a little more definition and spicing), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, this is one really really sick movie that can't help but don't know if the director wants to play specific scenes, and yes, can't help but don't know how many copies inspire such a movie. in a purely artistic sense, it is 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a film.
