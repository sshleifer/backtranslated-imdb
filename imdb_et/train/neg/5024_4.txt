There is not much to say about this. Gammera is a kind of fire breathing turtle. He's open because of the explosion of nuclear pressure. He drives the land and begins to destroy buildings and tanks and other spam (oh yes, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, at the beginning of the film, he communicates with a little boy and instead of just throwing him away or breaking him, he puts him down. Safe. Since then, we have to look at this chubby little twerma that appears and runs away, show up and runs away, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera can hear this boy 20,000 meters away. Well, the plot's goal is to try to get to Gammera where it can be put into rocket and space. As usual, the monster is unmoved and uncoordinated (a man in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and fire to solve the sovereign debt, and of course it does not do good. They should still know it. We have seen many monsters in Tokyo. Don't put them down because they can be fun, but that's not really good.
