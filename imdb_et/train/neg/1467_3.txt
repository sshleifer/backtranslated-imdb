No wonder the historian Ian Kershaw, the author of the original Hitler biography, who was originally a scientific consultant for this film, was separated from it. The film is historically too wrong. Errors begin as soon as Hitler's father Alois dies at home, but he actually died in the pub. In 1914, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich, but in fact he moved to Munich in 1913. Hitler's childhood and young people are depicted as too short, making it very difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the nature of this disappointed neurotic person. At the start of the party, there are important individuals, such as Hitler's father's friend Dietrich Eckart or the party "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengli is very problematic. The film depicts him as a noble who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfstaengli's own gloss, which is his own biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaeng was anti-Semitic and was crazy about "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem with the film is the portrayal of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly, has no charisma or charm and constantly commands everyone. After watching the film, it is wondering how such a nasty person could ever get any followers. Because we all know what Hitler was an evil criminal, of course, every scriptwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as totally disgusting and unhealthy. But the facts are that privately he can be quite charming and fun. His comrades did not follow him because he cried them constantly, but because they liked this strange man. In addition to these historical mistakes, the film is well done, the actors are first-rate, the location shots and the production design give an incredible impression to the era.
