In my opinion, this film does not support a new idea. it seems to me that I took the spear into the spear, despite the side! the director has a agenda! Duh! I find that there is no rationality and there is room for an alternative view. I'm usually on the naysayer side for one, but this film lacks credibility because it is based on the fantastic observations of a man / woman on the street. Indeed, now that you want to prove a credible alternative to a religion that has been detained for 2000+ years, you need to make more efforts to allow the other party to express their opinions. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie it seemed like an attack on Cristian's faith, I am unkind for one, but I promise the beliefs of others and do not want them to be ridiculous, but try to understand and tolerate.
