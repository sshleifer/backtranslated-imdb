It had to be one of the worst films I've seen and I'm 64 years old and a football fan. I was waiting for a football movie. After about 10 minutes, I began to think exactly how such a bad film (especially the actor) would have come to the theater. About half I whispered to my husband that it was terrible and explained to me the facts behind the film. Although I was a little offended (and see how some might be very offended if they are not Christians), they were announced in cinemas, it was not such a big deal. However, such predictability and unrealistic behavior, and in particular the quality of action, was a big deal. This is a suitable film for the church's outing, but it is shown in the church auditorium and not in the theater. Will I go to church? Yes, yes. Do I want to go to church for a movie visit? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not !!!
