Assuming not quite ridiculous, WAS was certainly ridiculous. What Tritter should have at the second meeting was that Tritter should simply be wasted. The house hires some guy and embodies Tritter. In real life, Tritter would have been pulled up for harassment, the episode of the rectum thermometer would have come into contact with the court, giving the motive and opportunity, and the hospital lawyers would have made Tritter and the ministry in the ministry. He would be in prison as if someone were involved in the harassment of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddin. The court proceedings would have won House's delicious solution that would have been enough to keep her with Vicadin at an early age. Although Tritter ended up running somewhere in the cab, trying to restore himself, doing a good job for two years before people fell before they saw it before.
