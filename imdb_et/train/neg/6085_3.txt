In this paranoia-based potboiler, our reporter fights heroic power, duplicating colleagues, UFO demolitionists, and silent, steadfast foreigners. (Although they can remotely control and zappate objects, it takes about two dozen buttons from three control panels.) The script clicks on events to the event, leaving it complicated. Why did foreigners put the dog blind? Why do they fry the soldiers when they patrol only an empty landing? And what space is worthy of the month's cheese, robbing the first unsightly photographer instead of his model? Investigators want to know! Writer-director Mario Gariazzo explored his theme by stacking UFO-themed tabloids, as he did in the double function of Sunn Classics. (The indexing of the termination screen is proud to be based on actual events ... like "Plan 9!") Some may feel burned by a steep finale, but it should nevertheless turn against conspiracy.
