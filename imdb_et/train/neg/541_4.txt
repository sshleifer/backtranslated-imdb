I found this movie pretty strange. I found very close that this movie was extremely difficult, and now, after thinking a little, I can quite accurately specify why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him with bits (I think Zentropa is one of the best films ever made), is pretty dark here, and although I can't see my life, which is better, I'm sure someone would be could have taken his place quite easily and made this movie. Everything else is good, except for the sticking out of the weak comedies ("Meet the Parents Joke is not really necessary, filmmakers!") And I like Richard E. Grant as British Major. It just suffers one thing .. Jean-Marc.
