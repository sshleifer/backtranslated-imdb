As usual, I'll make a crazy scratch to see the movies I'm not yet waiting for the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because it seemed right to my alley. I can't figure out why this movie has got this buzz for my life. No story! A group of boys are leaning around Iraq. One day, they've scattered the bomb here. Tomorrow they will have tools around the countryside, themselves no less and start sniper fire. Don't wait, they're back in Baghdad. There is no single story. The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are just cartoons. This means we have a sweet boy who is afraid to die. We have a hardened soldier who is practical and just wants to get back safely. And then we have a crazy cowboy who doesn't follow the rules, but has a soft spot for a small Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think will happen? Well, do you think that a cowboy soldier who has been injured by the rules of the rules will not follow suit? Why yes! Do you think that a Iraqi boy who is a cowboy soldier has a dead place and will make him crazy? Why yes! There's no story here. The script is minor and predictable! Shake the camera a lot to see "artsy". And for all of you who think it is such a great warfare, go for a "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Don't waste time or money on this boring movie!
