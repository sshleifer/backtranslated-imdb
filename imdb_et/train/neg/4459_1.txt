I'm not saying this because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. This girl who is wearing her hair? Did we really need to sit there for a long time and see that he could see it for 5 minutes on the same spot? It was terrible, lighting was just bad. You can hardly see anything and when the characters speak, you hardly heard what they said. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course I don't miss most of this, and I don't want to hear someone say I have to look at all this thing first. This film was so badly made and executed that even with an independent and low budget standard it is just terrible. An amazing movie ... don't waste that time if you don't want to laugh, but even then it's not because of the "funny" lines of the actors, but because the production is badly bad.
