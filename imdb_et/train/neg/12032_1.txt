This movie was terrible. It was a very difficult time for me to look at it all the time. I didn't get a movie point. What was the idea of ​​this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the action was bad and the story uninspiring. The two main characters of the movie were very boring and their dialogue was interesting. None of the cast members had chemistry. I don't know this fact, but I suspect that most of the participants were the first timers. The film could have been easily cut for about half an hour without losing the plot. This shows how much useless scenes in the movie were. Within two hours of the movie, I would have a root canal. I want these two hours ago! If you want to look at a good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a lot of Mormons, look at Napoleon Dynamite instead.
