Okay ... so I've seen a lot of really wonderful / unusual movies. Fear and fear in Las Vegas come to mind when I think about it. Not anymore ... out of here when someone asks me, "hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I say! And I don't mean "unusual" in good ways. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie it was obvious that it was one of the "trippy camera effect" movies. With this, I mean, a few things, such as blinking images on the screen, rewinding and fast transmitting people's words and scenes, displaying the color of the message on the screen, moving on with the flash, and constantly supporting the flash ... then you have the actual action yourself. People accidentally get into violence, shoot things / people, say weird things that just don't do much, but make no sense. <br /> <br /> The film is a writer who starts mixing the real life with a book he has written and because of the lack of a better way to explain it, he basically sees the "journey" he continues throughout the movie. The thing is that Johnny Depp went on the same trip to Las Vegas in Fear and Lure, but the only difference is that his trip was interesting to watch, not painful! To be honest, I had a real difficulty even when Slipstream stopped. It's a little hurt in my brain. <br /> <br /> I see some movie buffers claiming that this movie has certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the dementia ... blah, blah, blah. The point is that this movie hurts your brain when you look at it .... it's just a little point, it takes all of your concentration to even try it far and understand what's happening and even at the end, the only thing you will be happy about is the fact that it is over ... and you can say that you have actually been through it! So, closing down if you want to see a movie that tells you "what the hell" over and over with both your head and head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check it out. <Br / Mr. Hopkins, although I commend you as an actor and praise your choice to lead .... please never make such a movie again. Next time try something that is based on a bit of narration than camera techniques that tend to leave the headache of the viewer.
