An interesting film about the actual event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. It will keep my attention to the end and I will not regret watching it. I've never read this attack, so I was curious whether the insurgents pulled it off. I enjoy the historical films of this era. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is a confederate uniform. They look too good! Operation was sometimes a little stiff. I like an old man who eats potato puree because he had no teeth. The wounded wounded soldier was a little strange. In general, it was a descent.
