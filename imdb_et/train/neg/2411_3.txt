The hell of living dead is about a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in the city of Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one evening, Rick's brother arrives at a stroke that drives down the street, who had fought with him earlier. In desperation, Rick calls on his research associate to bring the last formula they work to bring sick blood cells to health. The formula has not been tested on a human or even on a dead body, but Rick has decided to bring his brother to life. He gives the body a double dose, but nothing happens. So Rick is calling 911, and the body is driving only to get him back to life and party. Now, Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is dead. The dead hood of the lively one is a trash. The plot is a direct hang of Resident Evil, acting just as terrible, especially for Rick's counterfeiting, because his weapons are so fake because every time a weapon is fired, it sends out and the glow is just flat. It's just a fake blood that covers the face of the actors. Zombies are also changed. They run, crumble and have to let the heart die! Zombies should only mix, exhaust, and be forced into the brain! This movie is so terrible that this movie is the only real moment. The Living Dead hood comes in 3 out of 10, a little fun here and there, but it only succeeds with a low budget.
