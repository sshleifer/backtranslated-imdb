It's 1984. The hanging of the "Gremlins" of the year is probably the biggest train of the film ever made. Even for the B-Class movie, all the cheap horror movies on the same platform dwarf the film's plot, show and goodness. <br /> <br /> It starts with a random old guard and a younger punky security officer whose name is not important. Why? Because for a couple of minutes in the film he walks "forbidden" safe and killed when he lives in his fantasy that he is a cheap star in the pub. <br /> <br /> It's just a misfortune. completed main line. The main character KEVIN fights at different times to prove himself more than the whole pussy. Maybe he will succeed in the film, but he will prove to the audience as something other than a bad actor. Kevin gets to work with an old security officer and is guided by his security mission to an abandoned studio (wait). Yes, why barely make a set if you can just use the studio yourself. Back to the movie. Kevin opens the forbidden safe somehow and releases Hobgoblins. Hobgoblins forces people to live their most fabulous fantasies and kill them for some reason. They need to be returned before sunrise or otherwise ... or what? Exactly. <br /> <br /> Other characters are Kevin's maso army friend NICK, Nick's “DAPHNE” wife, whose character is no longer a female bitch attitude and prostitute-worthy outfit. It is Kevin's manipulative and "reserved" girlfriend AMY, whose deepest desire is probably to be a poorly portrayed Cher with a pair of knickers with a pair of blue grandmother panties. Don't ask how it works. Quite likely, the most fun character is KYLE. How such friendships have been made is a question. Kyle has a perverted slip that cannot stimulate for an hour without itself. His hobbies are calling sex lines from other people's houses and most likely underpants. <br /> <br /> The story comes when heroes are looking for Hobgoblins: knee creatures (so-called hand-made dolls) that, for some reason, try to travel beyond the boundaries of the local neighborhood. Every character finally lives with his most fabulous fantasy that never has anything to do with millions of dollars ... or a movie with a big budget. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: The twist at the end of this movie leaves the observer "What?" Hobgoblins are returned to the safe ... their free will. Maybe they lost patience to wait for the destruction of sunrise, or maybe the story was cramped and decided not to finish. Going back, the old security guard "What he learned in the army" opens explosives that destroy the safe by signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller-skater; better to install on an escalator. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad enough to send someone to tears. If you are planning to look at it, I would recommend that you consider some alcoholic drinks in the future.
