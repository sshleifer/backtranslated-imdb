I can't believe that the Indian film industry will continue to drop such a third rate to Waqt. For starters, the storyline is absolutely incredible? a spoiled son is thrown out of the family home to teach him some independence. So what does he do? He starts to win some national talent competitions right now, making some star jumps in front of the judges panel (I don't help here honestly). Meanwhile, his father dies of lung cancer, but keeps his son secret, but he lives long enough to see his son famous, see his new grandson and make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> Is it tiring to act on your hamminess? one of the main actors in this film was not tried to convince in any way. As usual with Indian films, the family lived in a large mansion and seemed relatively untouched by real world concerns. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the main losers, when making such horrible movies, are intelligent viewers. who made a mistake in seeing such a movie. Actors such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar continue to honor gods by people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
