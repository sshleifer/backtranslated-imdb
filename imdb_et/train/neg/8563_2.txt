It's like the title of this topic. The only impression from this film is that Marlee Matlin's character was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. His character's first date with the character of William Hurt, where they danced, was stupid. All in all, I've been trying to watch the movie four times and fall asleep four times. I would watch this movie with one intention ... beat my insomnia problem, because all he does is put me to sleep. Sweet sleep.
