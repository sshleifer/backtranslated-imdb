This is a direct sequel to The Mummy's Hand (1940), as the token, Stephen Banning (playing Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and associates the story (with archive material) with his son's fiancée. There are only two unusual aspects in the film: Banning's early death and Turhan Bey's presence. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney as Mummy Kharis gets the best bills, although his role as a character he has little to do when dragging his hand or kicking. There is nothing terrible about his presence except his attempt to take away the betting Isobel (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran gets another bill but he's been killed in the first fifteen minutes! We have to wait until "Psycho" (1960) when the lead figure (Janet Leigh) dies before the end of the movie! Banning's friend from the first movie, Babe Jenson (now Henson), shows a little later, much, older, and not doing the comic he did in the original. It's hard to believe it's the same actor! Unfortunately, it is wasteful work because Kharis kills after only two short scenes. Then Banning's son John (playing a little bit of John Hubbard) played to stalk the cemetery - NO! The sheriff manages the generation that carries the Banning house from the mobile to burn and kill the mummy. Sound universally familiar? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey will be introduced to the audience as the new high priest Mehmet Bey, who takes care of and eats Tana's leaves to Kharis. With his "exotic" voice and appearance, it is too bad for him to be so easily killed. A better film would have been "Babe" to pay for the Von Möm type for mummy tracking, the final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But instead we have the previous Universal Horror Movies footprints reconstructed by Griffin Jay, who wrote many other Universal Clicks, even though he did "Don Winslow of the Navy" (1942) and "Coast Guard Don Winslow" (1943). ), who also had Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox played Anne How in six Joe Palooka films (1946-1949) and of course Turhan Bey, who had 43 movies and TV credits, is great "The Amazing Dr. X "(1948) in the title role. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (there are many noirish shadows in the Sheriff's office) than the first" Kharise "mummy film, but there is little interest or excitement. <br /> <br /> I'll give her 3.
