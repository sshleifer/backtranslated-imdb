Let me first say that I enjoy watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these movies leave a more lasting impression than really great. This movie is annoyingly maliciously bad. This vehicle of Sam Mraovich's delusional ego is not only limited to talent intuition, but has redefined the meaning of words. It should always be a barometer of bad movies. Mendoza line for the movie. Mr. Mavovich writes, directs, and celebrates as a blunt object Arthur Sailes fights with the nervous spouses and Christian forces of evil, as he and his partner Ben "dead behind the eyes". The leaves are fighting for marital status. As a libertarian, I believe that gays should have the right to marry. Ben & Arthur is more damaging to this cause than the homophobic army. The depiction of all Christian images is so ugly and fisted, the trademark is Movovich that you cannot take either of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor, the freak of Jesus, the Bible is so frightening that it is extremely evil / ephemeral gay that you have to think about how he was cast in this role. This is because Sam's "multitegum" in Movovich was also a director. The worst of all is Sam Mavovich himself. If you think the leading man makes the words pastes, balding and chubby? Sam also offers features like Domino pizza, cold and usually wrong. The latter speaks: you are writing in writing, directing, acting and pouring. This is Ed Wood's fourfold crown. Congratulations to you, terrible little man.
