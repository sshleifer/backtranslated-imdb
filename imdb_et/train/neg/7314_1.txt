Anyone who has read my review of "Alone In The Dark" by Uwe Boll remembers that I compared this impenetrable task of the human generation to pull every coat. Well, take this analogy a step further with this reducing gutter and try to imagine the pain that causes tooth extraction without novakine. Do it, and you have a general idea of ​​what Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" means. <br /> <br /> I've never believed that any film would be able to fill the embarrassing end that Uwe Boll wrists like "ever made movie". But to be honest, I have to say "Cabin Fever" is very close. This is another sad excuse for a film that had no valid reason to meet a certain theater release. For someone who claims to love the genre of fear as much as Eli Roth does, he has created one of the most annoying and complicated movies I think I've ever seen in my life. How do you turn this kind of story? Think of the potential that this plot would have been without badly written characters, without poor writing and without this unnecessary and uncomfortable comedy. The film about the virus eating grotesque meat could and should have been so much better than what Roth gave us out here. This script failed with so many levels with me. And although I have no doubt that this director is the obvious talent, I know that he hit the ball with a big time idea that would have been very successful in redefining the genre of fear. <br /> <br /> To say that this was a missed opportunity would indeed be a big word game. A lot of blood and unpleasant special effects can't even be saved and this is one of the things I usually do. There was nothing about "Cabin Fever" that I could easily recommend to anyone. If three-quarters of the population goes outside the theater, you know that the film is drowning quickly. My best tips for reading this would be just renting before buying. One view was more than enough for me to know that I would never bother with it.
