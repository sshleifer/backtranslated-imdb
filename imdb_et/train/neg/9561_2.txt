As many others have commented here before, I have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've seen. In this comment, there are no direct references to film images or sequences because I hate the spoiler. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that I was watching a TV show episode or something where they had kept some extra $ $ to spend on CGI (I've seen them worse) ... All in all, this viewer is for offensive, at least if you have any knowledge about computers and / or technology at all. These insults are just too much to make me feel comfortable and I just found myself begging for it to end - fast - halfway through. In addition, there are countless "easy way out" scenarios, which is also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking person ... <br /> <br /> This movie will be destroyed by the old "Wargames" and I think it's a shame that they even called this sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars for me, just one thing and one thing: the actors' performances are not half-bad, given the regurgitation of the script they had to work on. However, they should never sign up for this movie. Not really a career movement, but I think we all have to pay bills. <br /> <br /> For those who gave the top score of this movie, you must be on the studio payroll or something that is my only explanation. <br /> <br /> For anyone who hasn't seen it, look at it and make your mind. But lower your expectations to the floor (and then to some).
