Jack Black can usually just breathe me, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> In addition to direction, writing, lack of plot, continuous looting (helping and constantly browsing camera images) and 0.050 jokes on average, it was still a waste of time . The idea sounds promising, but what potential could be wasted on the lack of comedy and some of the worst things I've seen on your tube. <br /> <br /> I heard that this film depicted the Mexicans very negatively. Although this is undoubtedly true, I really do not believe this film is intended to be racist. I think it's a "creative" team that is desperately trying to find something like that. You can almost hear how they cry behind the camera: "Listen, it's a bad Mexican! Laugh, people! Please love all things, LAUGH!" <br /> <br /> But put racism charges aside. When you get to that, it's someone who made good money and time to look at the ruin that was offended, offended, IMO.
