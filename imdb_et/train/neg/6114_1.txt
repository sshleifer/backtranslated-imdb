Because that's all he does throughout this movie, being naked for no good reason. When Tarzan is bitten by a snake, he suddenly removes his clothes. When is a poisonous boa, how is Tarzan poisoned? This whole movie is screwed up. They didn't get this movie properly from animal species. What does Orangutang do to hang these chimpanzees? He must have traveled a lot from a better movie. The Cannibal tribal group looks at caucas. Why? And why Bo and his father painted when they were eaten later? It was probably just a flat apology to show your breasts and curves again. During his hunting, his father approaches and acts foolishly around the bull's elephant too close to it. Any real African bull elephant that was not in the circus would have finished this moor's ass. Every smart hunter would have taken a minute to see it. when the camera was in LSD because it showed a variety of scenes that went slowly without good reason. It wasn't at all reasonable. Boa constrictor by Tarzan in water wrestling, looks like one of these 12 Ft rubber snakes can be purchased at local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan was weird sp eechless in this movie, maybe from Bo flashes himself so much.I'm sorry, but it's a messy classic black and white Tarzan movie, which has a similar but better story. I saw everyone forgot to mention. * (SPOILERS ALERT) * The scene in which he tries to save Jane and his father is too close to him on the drop of running water. It seemed that he seemed to urinate someone under him. He and Jane also talk about jumping and killing perverted monkeys on the beach. He certainly took his father's death really well. * (END OF SPOILERS) * This movie should have a surgeon warning. Seeing that Boab is too naked in this movie, makes you blind.
