I used the idea of ​​Wesley Snippes to go ahead and watch a new, untried movie in which she appears. So, for the first time, my Snipes method has not been successful in the movie's recommendation. Completely. First I would have come here to see these comments. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow his other serious efforts to waste on a "contractor". <br /> <br /> One of my worst fears has come to bitter fruit. I was afraid that the trembling, blurred, pseudo-documents, "ignorant" leadership and editing style (highlighted by Paul Greengrass-led "Bloody Sunday") can spread to other films. Greengass's sick style was then stunned to new heights on the last two Bourne trilogy films. My fear was over. In my opinion, these films really make them bad by the methods that cause their illness, which are mistaken for blurred wipers to "improve performance". But "Bourne Franchise", such as Greengrass so loving, calls his money for a cow, probably convinced others in Hollywood to go for a quick and big bucks to be unprofessional. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, you Hollywood types. The action must be clearly photographed and presented, not just clues to bad, lazy cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" goes so far as to mimic The Bourne Ultimatum, which is repeatedly repeated in bites. hopes that their minors (probably prized) will not know them. For example, when I hear the police radio "Yankee-Romeo" breaking again, I just scream. Opportunities are good. I can't hear that anymore: surely I don't see the "contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend to those who have not yet seen the "contractor": just be content with the peace of mind that this shortage offers you. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I am tempted to reduce it 1.
