OMG! The only reason I get 1 instead of this movie is that Tom Hanks is funny as Elvis-in-the-box. In addition, how did this semi-decent light make such a flat film? Maybe it was a good idea at this time ... No laugh to mention, stereotypes are pathetic, cast is wasted, direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, most are probably guilty of director Joel Zwick. He brings out all the enthusiastic items involved. Don't waste your time like me; but then i enjoy a good train wreck. Geez, now the system tells me I need more lines - here goes: this movie should be called Back to the sender. Okay, now that it was more fun than anything in the movie ...
