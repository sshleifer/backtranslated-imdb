You know the plot right away. Divorced couple's daughter trying to get her mother and father together again. Yes, it was the theme of Elder Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the spooky thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills, who played the distressing roles of her daughter (s), Durbin sees a lot older than adults. And so do all his so-called siblings. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between an adult and a child is all over the film. Girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits, but they look ridiculous because the director seems aching to lead the big tops and pussy of his movie. So you are always torn between their thinking as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start to "hit", you will feel that they are pedophiles, and you can be the one to notice the tushies and tops that the director directed. Teenagers or bullying, little girls or small foxes, you are never quite sure what you should think about. <br /> <br /> Parents also look very old and the whole movie seems to be very outdated <br /> <br /> This is the older version of Trap and must be avoided or at least make sure the tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me.
