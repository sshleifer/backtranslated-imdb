In fact, I paid for watching this movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> This would be a 1-rating, but the battle between the robots is fine and surprise. <br /> <br /> I understand that some movies have bigger budgets than others. I have no problems with that. Unfortunately, for the most obvious reasons, films in the scientific literature suffer the most with a low budget. But one way this movie fails is that almost every part of the set seemed cheesy and inexpensive. I mean, they couldn't even "look" for it? Another important reason why this movie is terrible is to act. When I watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I could just enjoy it for the cheese factor, but at that time I was expecting a good movie and I had no idea how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience was only 85 minutes.
