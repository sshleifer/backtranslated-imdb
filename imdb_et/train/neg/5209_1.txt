Ok, so I was bored and I looked at it all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is light, unpleasant and weak. The story is so gentle that it bites the opening titles. The tails of two "traumatized" children who learned the "God" of fairy tales, which, frankly, was rather traumatized. He uses Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way that he hopes that the real Irish will never see it. For a child who, frankly, would turn off the "OIRISH" accent after the first attempt. All in all, why they pump them out.
