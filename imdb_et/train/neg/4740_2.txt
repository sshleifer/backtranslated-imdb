I've been so offended by this movie, it's not even funny ... And I thought Mulan was incredible! But few of my expectations for Disney have changed, I never thought they would do anything so stereotypical that so. There is no respect here for genuine Chinese culture, but for the occasional Hollywood tradition of martial arts. teenage girls - especially Asian teenage girls - are so much less obsessed with such low-life areas. And from a cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are popular and fashionable, but they are quite rare. And even those who are, are still quite decent scientists. Maybe another stereotype, but quite real. Because Chinese parents work so. That's how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to get authenticated, they would have made Wendy's relationship with glasses and love-hatred with his family. Asian culture does not mean meditation and vague, nature-oriented phrases that are reasonable. We do not walk all the time smiling with a smile and we all do not know any form of martial arts. We are PEOPLE and I would appreciate it if someone writes an Asian part that doesn't represent us as a sad cartoon.
