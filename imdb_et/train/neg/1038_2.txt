The Winner's Ascension is just a bad film. None of the negative or ad-dollar-supported ads changed this sadness. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Peter Sollett saw he had no money to make the film he wanted to do, and decided to do a simple way to make a bad movie that cynically tempts the current "sharp movies" . Maybe he just doesn't know better. It's hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is hard to say is the result. Except for some viewers who are trying to pseudo-realism to make an intellectually bad movie, some of them can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> Help yourself and deliver this movie.
