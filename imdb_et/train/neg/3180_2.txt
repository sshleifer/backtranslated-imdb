What a boring movie! All in all, it was just Nana Patekar, who beat her daughter Karisma Kapoor, trying to escape with her son in the village. Can anyone say BORING ??? The concept was not too bad, but it was badly done. Canadians and some village scenes were nicely captured. In general, cinematography was short. The story could have been great, but the film seemed to just drag. There is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was the song "Ishq Kamina" and it was only five minutes long. Moreover, this film was fine.
