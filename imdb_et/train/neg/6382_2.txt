It's hard to know what went through the heads of Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote "Gayniggers from Space" - the film is rated as comedy, but there are no real jokes alongside the real jokes (Captain B. Dick, Shaved Balls). The rest of the movie is (probably) an unintentionally funny thing with ridiculously non-synchronized voice commands ("actors" basically read their lines without feeling touched), "futuristic" computer screens that are full of spelling mistakes, and a plot that, although almost 65% of viewers are in this movie Out of 10 perfect 10 movies, this is the perfect opposite of the movie. Maybe it's fun to look at friends, but this movie deserves only about two out of ten ... a slightly higher potential rating only because the writers have somehow managed to get some black men from the star of this movie.
