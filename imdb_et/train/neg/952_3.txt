Happy Go Lovely is a waste of all time and talent, including the audience. The lightness of the false identity of the old hat and the lines of the faux scandals is highly forgiving. Very few people watched these films for their plots. However, they usually had some interesting smaller characters related to the sub-blocks - not here. Usually they had interesting choreography and a breathtaking dance and memorable song. Not happy. And Vera-Ellen, like a female leader, played the whole movie as another banana, who desperately sought the star to play it - and instead invited her to wear a movie and couldn't do it. The Scottish locality was wasted. Scotland's fears are usually absent everywhere. Photography was a pedestrian. Musical numbers were pedestrians. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional appearance, chewing on the landscape, because no one else did his part as producers, often played by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is just fine and nobody got David Niven as David Niven. At the end of the day, as I adore Niven, as I do, there is reason to go to Happy Go Lovely after 90 minutes. If not, skip it.
