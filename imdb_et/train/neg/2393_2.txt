I read Tom Robbins' FULL BREEDS, HOW BLUESID IS A TEEN. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny and full of enchanting landscapes and beautiful letters. But when I saw the movie, I couldn't believe what was boring, sour, cheerful junk. How did it happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and submitted it to "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (This is the title of the Library of Congress theme.) Now, anyone over the age of 12 who reads the book knows that he has nothing to do with real lesbians, more than STAR WARS from actual space travel. The book was obviously - and I mean ATTENTION - written by a heterosexual man who loves lesbian IDEA (naked, all the time) but never met in any way. <br /> <br /> Somebody in Hollywood said, "Oh oh, better to give this gay director or Gay People make trouble." So they gave it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing is a man, but - though Gay can really be - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy about innocent girl / girl activities and men's voyeurism made it a boring, literally entertaining Lesbian Power recruitment poster. It's like changing Oscar Wilde's comedy into Arthur Miller's tragedy. Not quite. <br /> <br /> The main idea that Gus Van Sant had no idea what to do with the source material is stunningly bad casting. His influence allowed him to hire the best. His ignorance of the real subtext of the novel (straight man's fantasy, not the gay pride recruiting poster) gave him choices that were not only bad, but odd. <br /> <br /> Meet EVEN COWGIRLS GET at BLUES. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "CHINK" Okay, there is little name recognition for Asian participants. And Pat Morita, HAPPY DAYS, was pretty funny. But when he was elected as CHINK, it was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morital has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus didn't tell him.) Pat doesn't even know Chink is. . . well, SEXY !!! He is not a wise parent of Mr Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! She is a randy old goat and she knows a lot about the pleasant nub and responsive Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, these are not really lesbians in the book. Do you get that it's still a straight man's fantasy?) JOHN HURT as "COUNTESS". Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he's serious, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR !!!! For this role, you need someone who is fun and camp. John Hurt is cast like a wolf, as the count is tragic and sad. I was expecting Paul Scofield to walk in everything like Thomas More and unfortunately shook his head. "Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul completely. Shame, my former student!" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) than Caligula. But it was BLACK humor, not playful and windy humor like a book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean". No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book, Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film, she is sullen, passive, inexpressible and boring. Robbins in his book puts this taste on women. "God knows I love women, but nothing can be for a man who fits." U, Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN is "Sissy Hankshaw". This is a difficult role. In the book, Sissy is really an unusually passive and timid heroine. What's more, better actors should have blinked their eyes or walked to see some hidden power or hidden pleasure in their adventures. Uma won't pull it out, probably because Gus didn't tell him that Sissy should be ENJOY with a beautiful body and giant thumb. Uma plays more than she is from a girl who has died of leukemia in a television movie. <br /> <br /> This film is sour and dull. And I blame YOU, Gus Van Sant!
