I watched this movie clean. It was filmed in the old hotel where the friend's owner is. The plot was predictable, the actor was at best average, fears were all big, not real fears. Many things to remember. They didn't even use the full potential of the hotel ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on the peninsula. During the escape, you can walk to the castle for almost a quarter of a mile, which is a terrible phenomenon in the morning or late evening when the wind breaks through the cracks. <br /> <br /> How to see this movie, there is a remote control in hand so you can move forward quickly (and I use that concept loosely) scenes and stop the beauty of the surroundings!
