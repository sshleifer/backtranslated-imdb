I've been trying to see this so-called comedy, but it's hard to wear. It's a bad, narrow-minded and clich√© movie. Surely it is not funny but very boring and annoying. Bad script, bad behavior. It's a complete waste of time - and there's nothing to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
