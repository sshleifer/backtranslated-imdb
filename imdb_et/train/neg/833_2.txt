There wasn't really much story in this movie. It was loosely based on the events of the first Lion King movie. It should be how Timon and Pumbaa met through their unity. But that's not much more. <br /> <br /> This mixes some scenes from the original, so it's ab-libs about how this movie changed a little. But is it? I was hoping for a little more. Instead, everything I have to show is an empty plot with little explanation. <br /> <br /> I think that if you want to see other masterpieces in the Lion King universe, that's it. But there is little justice for animators. Disney really should stop these direct-video products. It was really quite boring and could have been used by Jason Stathami. "D-"
