I was going to look at this movie with low expectations, but I was hoping I'd find the movie in my hometown. Unfortunately, that's all I have. The story includes a familiar territory (high school meeting), but the plot is complicated and the supernatural element adds little to the worn subject. Although the quality of the action was generally good, the film's content was terrible. The sexism of the film was blatant - women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, working or both (although it was a feminist choice). Worse still was racism - an exciting Jewish mother, a black man still living at home - and free cruelty (class geek torture). We should be ashamed when these characters represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be humiliated so that they have brought such a broad and cruel stereotype.
