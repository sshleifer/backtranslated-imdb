It must be the worst horror I've ever seen. I remember seeing it years ago when it originally came out of the video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I went to buy a DVD when it appeared ... what a tragic mistake! I don't even want to go to the plot because it is so transparent that you can see it anyway. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to cheesy effects and bad behavior, but these people take it to a completely different level. It's almost as if they are deliberately trying to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if that was their goal, they were successful. If they were going to make a movie that was supposed to frighten you or believe you in any way, shape or form that it was real, they couldn't ... MISERABLY! Avoid this movie ... read the plot summary and you have seen it!
