Obviously, the famous "acting" talents of the 1950s stripper Misty Ayers are shown. Too bad he can't act. <br /> <br /> A boring little story of sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) who is stunned and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets Tommy Cole, who falls in love with her. He wants to help him escape, but can he? You really don't care. <br /> <br /> There's no real skin here - Ayers just slips his underwear slowly (twice). The rest is just a boring little story of bad behavior, cruel "comedy" (never thought that prostitution was funny, but what do I know?) And a terrible post-duplicated dialogue. I admit that at the end there was a twist I didn't see, but that's not enough to sit through it. Ayeri's efforts to act are also hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
