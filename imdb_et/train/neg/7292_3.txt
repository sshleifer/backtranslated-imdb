Sunshine is an import in Hungary from 1880 to 1980, an epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally means sunshine. The family is humble, flourishing, moving upward, changing its name, and hoping to assimilate Hungarian society so that successive generations can move forward professionally. The story is spoken in the eyes of the eldest son in all three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the Second World War and the European Holocaust, Sonnenschein's approach to life is not working very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is known as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity unanswered. The dominant story of world history is predictable and transparent; it is reinforced with voice talk narration and newspaper footage. Family "kruntib" from one predictable event [ie. Hapsburgs, WW-I, World War II, fascism, communism, etc. The subject of Jewish assimilation is purposeful and important sub-topics [secret diary and family philosophy] that may have given the character and credibility of the family until the end. Alternatively, filmmakers offer a generation of continuity using common incest / fidelity issues. The "3 on" casting format is distracted by the viewer and seems like a cheap movie trick than a good theater. Sunlight is basically a Hungarian "History Channel" material. It has a look and feel that Forrest Gump has been wrapped up with some sex-related Forrest Gump. <br /> <br />
