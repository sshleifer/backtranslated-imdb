For some reason, different Italian couples shared some young couples hiking to see who first came to their campsite. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters the cave, finds the skeleton of an old ancient demonic gladiator, and changes in the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts a helmet on the body. Then he spends the rest of the movie running in the woods hunting his friends and hacking his limbs to add some stacks to bring Undead "Demonicus" back. This digital full moon release is stupid, pointless, terrible and sound, and Los Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. But in the unintentional range of laughter it is quite high, mainly due to the burnt lead performance. Whether Kenyon's ridiculous facial expression and uncomfortable delivery must be unbelievable, be it with cheap fingers swords or nervous Latin gibberies that are demons and resurrection. Well, at least he's not bored like most of the rest cast.
