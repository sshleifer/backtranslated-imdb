6/10 Action, not a big but good actor. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The director makes some stupid decisions about this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, story doesn't make sense at all and there are many mistakes. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The overall score for this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave this film 4 and it may be too much. The characters are so exaggerated that they can ever be in real life, and some pretty unexplained things happen in "storywise", not in good ways. Because of this style, the movie is filmed in 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motion and camera shake and fast forward). It is always good that the film uses music to make the story smoother, but there are too many songs in it. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
