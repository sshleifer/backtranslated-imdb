It's a German movie since 1974, which has something to do with some women who come to the castle and beyond, I can't really tell you the purpose or even the purpose of the movie. I can tell you that there are several women who are also in the six-light as servants of that particular castle, dragging, putting the body color and gyrate on the bongs, as they were in the Goth Kit-Kat Club, and this seems to be a good part of the time when this movie was launched. Yeah, it looks like something is fucking worshiping and vampires, and girls have a girl, etc., but the main focus seems to be the painted babes in the basement. Rather, I liked the rush of one of the main housekeeper / devil worshipers, which gave the authenticity of the procedure and made it even worse. Was it Wanda's evil lesbian (how was the credit debited)? Does not matter. If you're not too funny about worshiping your lesbian fucking, you might like it, otherwise it's pretty boring and I couldn't even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10
