The music that nerves on the nerves like the fingerboard, acting like a zombie, was disgraceful that they would be thrown away without making another film; picking everyone like a real zombies --- Sabrina's cast of earned witches as heroes ... movie so terribly that if "stoners" were still around, they could be considered a cult film, but so amateur, scripts could also be played by actors moving around, reading their lines when they slowly slipped through the film --- banal, illogical kits modeled after the LA subdivisions, props directly from ToysRus! Has the movie ever been made, it's so completely and completely empty ??? The logic flies to the wind in this pointless, pointless, pointless, and "monster" that is so stupid and uncoordinated that it failed the turtle's fridge --- lowcut, leggy --- and Amazon! It keeps my attention all the time; The way the terrible, ongoing chain crash mist on many vehicles keeps one view complete ... as after the ridiculous ray-gun struggle on the other planet, the pneumatically unfavorable sexy and mentally unbalanced ball hunter captures the slow landed refugee --- on earth! Don't let anyone in your popcorn, maybe you enjoy it. It's so bad!
