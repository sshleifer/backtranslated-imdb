I managed to watch it with MST3K and the boy, even with the film's reeling, was scary bad. Imagine that someone whose competence could be done with a camera would be a monkey. <br /> <br /> Attention (little was) came from special effects that were "OK". Mostly, "OK" also worked; although nothing special, it was higher than the other B movies seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is badly bad, Camera's work often looks like they just put the camera on the man's roller skates and pushed him away. The story (if you can name it) is so full of holes that it's almost funny. It never explains why hell survived, or needs human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialog slides simply on the plane. The movie's climax (if it exists) is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can't find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
