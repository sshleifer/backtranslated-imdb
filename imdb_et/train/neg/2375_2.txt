Freddy's Dead: The ultimate nightmare, the sixth installment of the crust in the Elm Street series and another bad sequel. I think it's related to the last stage of a child of dreams. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare Elm Street Series Box DVD for my birthday so I saw all the sequel. Can I say that I am increasingly disappointed with the last two of these two descendants, but it seems that Freddy has lost his edge. It's almost like writers tried to give Fredd a breath and they just destroy it instead of reinventing the story. It was a sequel that Robert did not give to Englund, but it was much smaller than what Freddy Krueger represented. daughter. Maggie, he's not aware that he is his father, but soon he will find out what his blind secrets are and he wants to help him. He must do his best to resist his abilities, but it is difficult for all the good memories he has of his loving father. Chronic, isn't it? But Freddy won't give up without manipulating him on his way. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The ultimate nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical? Notice sarcasm. This is one of the worst queues, it is related to the fifth stage of the nightmare of Elm Street series. It was just bad performance, stupid editing and almost all bad idea story. I didn't like this concept and it simply destroyed the whole idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, nightmares, not the father knows best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
