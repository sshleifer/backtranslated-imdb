After a day at work I sat down to relax and turn on the movie channels. The film came to the guide and sounded interesting, so I just tuned in before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but the lack of action in Jamie Foxx and slow plot movement helped me get up and find food. If there is any credit for acting in this movie, it should go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this movie night as a tenant.
