When you go to the open air cinema during the Greek summer season, you usually don't care what the film is! Edison really started a great effort for singers-who-want to be actors and once again great Morgan Freeman, but ... (The movie usually has a good start to grab the audience, do a bit boring story that fills in the middle of a movie that's more of the characters and less of the action, done and the third part is something very good to remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite policemen (full of weapons that are full of weapons able to demolish the building) shoot behind the car, not even hit him once, if he kills everything (but 3) and then the man takes the flame out (for the other 3 kills), you realize that the sky filled with Greek summer stars is too good to disturb such a movie!
