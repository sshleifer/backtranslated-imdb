"Happy guys with bad hairstyles !!" "Beautiful girls without a hint!" "Stupid gangsters who can't shoot straight!" From Dragon Dynasty comes Hong Kong gangster drama, "Dragon Heat". For reasons that apparently forever obscure completely, the production and selection of this "criminals-steroids" film was somehow a sign for both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn. But they can't do all this in this terrible slug festival. <br /> <br /> They are the two best modern actors each with their own biography and a list of achievements, and Biehn has been especially courageous to take on some rather complex and non-heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was a super-bad "May" "Live Free or Die Hardis", so nuff said. / / <br /> Biehn is, of course, a member of the future soldier who made the 1984 "Terminator" a plausible scientific literature / fantasy channel crashing against Big Arnold, who is now the ruler of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost completely wasted police drama in this terrible train rack. There is no reason for this, because an incredibly twisted plot - which is mainly in Chinese, because it is a Hong Kong story - could have been better developed than the foreign narrator. In other words, if Biehn had been used as an Interpol observer or coordinator, or as a deep-seated agent who had to give him every five or ten minutes, it would have been great. But no, he has been introduced as part of an odd special forces group who seem to be freelancers in the midst of their corrupt transaction in the midst of another corrupt transaction involving a local king of corrupt transactions. Yes, there, I said it all. Confused? Also me. "Welcome to the party, sir." <br /> <br /> The truly excellent Hong Kong criminal drama, known as its English-language "Breaking News", has a number of interesting characters at work, but has only one story on the line. <br /> <br /> Bad guys and good police. The Hong Kong triad or gang of the world into this grief and excessively violent violence seems to have little more hot-fired police force than a duck paradise shooting gallery, the way criminals mow them. br /> <br /> So it is not surprising that here is an almost incomprehensible scene (several scenes, in fact) where children try to play wooden ducks in the arcade game to win stuffed animal prizes. And so, hot-shot boy boys naturally intervene on their behalf, so the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> It is also a cordial attempt to create a "love interest" between one visiting police and the "visiting police" of a unique woman. <br /> <br /> Visiting police officers should be material witnesses against the Triad gangster leader who gets his Hijacking his trial, but not his own team, but mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q and some others). These killers want something, but we don't know what it is until the end of the movie! It was a foolish mistake in the general story. <br /> <br /> You can't build a criminal in a drama without getting anything or getting it very early. <Br /> <br /> Add some "cut scenes" made purely for artsy effects, all that show the recent past of bad boys and conventional bad boys, and any movie buffers will understand why this barking dog gets 1 rating for all things cinematic criminals and conspirators and Hongko ngiga.
