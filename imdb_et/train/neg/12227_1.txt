It can be the worst film ever made, and it can only be worth for that reason. The strike is ridiculously unbelievable as a young woman who depicts a man to learn Judaism. The soundtrack is embarrassing, characterizing some of the weakest films in Barbara's bow. And I can't even start on the plot. You get more checks from this movie than many comedies because it's so terrible. Streisand's crippled ego, I thought he could somehow raise that smell to the Oscar heights, making it a disaster. I'm pretty sure that writer Isaac Bashevis Singer hated this movie and never forgave Streisand. I can't blame her. This movie is similar to watching a two-hour slow-moving car wreck when the "Sound of Music" soundtrack is played back in an old disc player. It's really so bad. I'm surprised that someone from Streisand enjoyed this movie at the level it was intended for.
