This movie showed David Mamet more racial hatred against Jews than I ever met in American film. The stereotypes are so high that my ability to continue watching died. I was so disappointed at Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna, calling on the men in the New York Jewish Center who cleaned up the arms, sir, that common sense exceeded and I stopped. I'm deeply <br /> <br /> disturbed by the concept that Jews are not Americans and "different". I suggest that Mr Mamet is one of the causes of hatred, not the same healer.
