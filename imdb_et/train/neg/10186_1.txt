Where's Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the MST3K seasons, but it's a rare pre-1. The season flick (episdoe K-20) is just one of the worst movies. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace, and Burgess Meredith fought through the worst movie collections, featuring features to be written by a secret Dick Cheney-style team of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to reduce mass funding. studies on transit and energy efficiency. It looks like it was filmed in almost complete darkness, maybe in Super 8. Makes Logan run out like a kinematic Sistine chapel that has crossed with Shakespeare. I can't imagine watching it without commenting on Crow and Servo, because it is even invisible to it. It is clear that there is a need for some 401K in Hollywood that prevents participants from taking such bad movies to pay for their health services. With my "Pollution and Driving Freedom" theme, I finally expect to see Charlton Heston's arrival, where he speaks of "cold dead hands". Lee, could I have forgiven you for that in 1989, but in 1981 for forgiveness?
