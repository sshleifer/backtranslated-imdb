The only quality of redemption of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comic. Everything in this movie looks like the porn industry is dropping out. I've actually seen better-acting low-budget porn. Although I had actually rented some gay porn for this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You look at your (together): I'm not leaving you! <br /> <br /> The first sequence shows how terrible production is, but it's really funny: good guys are transformer weapons! In one scene, everyone has fake HK MP5 machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 copies! And when it's all turned off, they make some gun change between scenes with a couple of M-16 !! I think they had a budget deficit for weapons, not good boys and bad guys. Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake than all hell. You need to remove the needle / spoon from the grenade to explode. You cannot shoot any type of missile while driving in a helicopter. The weapons you throw away do not suddenly appear again. If the weapon is out of the bullets, it will be thrown out quite stupid. If you have no idea how to reload them. The big slow trucks that drive in the first gear cause discomfort. I really can't believe that such films are actually produced. This movie would be fun on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
