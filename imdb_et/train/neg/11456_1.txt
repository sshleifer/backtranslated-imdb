This is one of those films that makes you think: Hulk Hulk's "True America" ​​has done the same? Frankly, I don't think so and he would have been right. I am an Italian, I cannot proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not have attacked another team (for example in French) just because I am in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition, the protagonist does not remain in love with the British girl at the end of the film, but with the compatriots, so why is Yale rowing. As far as action is concerned, all players act very badly. And then, I knew I hated the "dead poets of society" atmosphere. In fact, this is another movie I hate.
