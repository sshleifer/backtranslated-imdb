This movie made me very crazy because the main characters or all characters have a southern accent. I have lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know there is no southern accent for people here. This film talks about a man who makes forests and I don't know the real plot or what the film presumes. It has some pretty graphic drugs and it is really offensive to see these people use as sugar. I lost my brother meth and this film makes me sick because it glamorizes the drug. The use of the film makes the medicine cool to use, but I was happy at the end when the man almost changed it to the state line. I also know that most women who have traumatic rape do not want to love their boyfriend or husband the next day. The film is simply wrong in all directions. I suggest "Basketball Diaries" if I would like to recommend a movie about drugs.
