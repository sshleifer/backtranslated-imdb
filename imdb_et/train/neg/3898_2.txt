I am terribly sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still called one of the greatest directors of post-war Germany, and most of his films are considered "masterpieces", but when I see "Lili Marlene" today, I don't know what everyone is up and away about this movie ! Actress is just terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all like a smile! Changes between the Nazi glamor and the battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks like it was done in the attic for two days. Probably that was the case, and many people seem to do it for "true art", but for me this film is just bad and cheap. Compare it to Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
