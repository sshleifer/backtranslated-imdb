You know you are having fun when you watch a movie that is so hard to be a serious, meaningful provocative movie and fail? If you can't help but break the smile of your screen in the trash can be very dreadful? "Dead House" is trying to achieve even this low level of cinema. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, the "dead house" will be able to revive the feeling as you wake up to find out that the cat has put its hand on you when you slept. From the very beginning, it is clear that female actors are cast to the size of their fission (which they use shamelessly), while men are in their difficult "kick-ass" attitude. I honestly didn't care about any sign of the movie from any moment and found that I really wanted my death to save me from this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered two hours of the actual game as a film. At least then can we do better? But not all the accusations can be put on the actors, because it is definitely a challenge to present a convincing film when faced with the script of this movie. It is undoubtedly the worst part of the film and actually contains features such as "These are pure and simple zombies" and "No cap, we must not go there! It's evil!" <br /> <br /> We all know that Zombie movies can never be thought provocative or meaningful; at best, they are harmless double action, blood and closet. Trash, yes, but fun in the trash. Not a trash that breaks out of your luggage bag when you drag it and smoke your shoes in sour cardboard and disintegrating bananas. According to IMDb, "dead house" got such bad comments that no Danish cinema bought the movie. If we only had the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final Score: 1/10.
