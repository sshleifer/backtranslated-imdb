It was the worst film I saw in WorldFest and later got the least applause! I can only guess that he will receive such recognition on the basis of the known number of participants in the film. It's nice to see J.Beals, but he's only in a few minutes. M. Parker is a much better actor than the allowed part. It is difficult to estimate the rest of the operations because the film is both ridiculous and predictable. The main character is completely atypical and therefore has to look. The story is not a real emotional depth. A film that comes up around an actor who can't do the job doesn't really feel very original to me. There is also no police development. It seems like one of the many direct-video movies I saw in the 90s ... and not even in these standards. <br /> <br />
