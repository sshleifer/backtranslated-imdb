this movie was a terrible excuse ... for a movie. firstly, the casting would have been better; Katelyn's main character didn't see anything on her TV mother. <br /> <br /> The plot was also trajectory. it was extremely cliché and predictable. The end was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I say about it). <br /> <br /> The nail bag was still a scene when Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) had to cry, but the girl couldn't cry! his face did not flow tears, but a few incredible slings. he is not a dynamic actor at all. he gave the same false laugh, which was identical to the mountain lizzie Maguire (sp?). that is, when the film went off, it was bad. he seemed to act. In short: this movie was very bad! it was sort of a mixture of every 1990s cliché-sons movie that everyone is sick - only worse! <br /> <br /> I'll give her "F" because it was just so hard to sit (b / t / w, I was babysitting when I saw it). <br /> <br /> But you can like it if you are 9 or below. ;)
