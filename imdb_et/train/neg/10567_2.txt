I thought this film seemed like a case study of how to make a movie mostly. Since I'm a filmmaker, I'll give it a continuity. . Computer-generated graphics were too many of the points for watching video games, and it seemed that the director did not try to add the story to real quality. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what he was supposed to work for, but he didn't find that information. <br /> <br /> This project seemed to have pushed the boundaries of a movie with too little budget too far. output that drags the viewer along with the story without incorporating their imagination. The participants were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
