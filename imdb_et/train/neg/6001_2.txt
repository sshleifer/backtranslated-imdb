It may seem crazy even for people who remember this show ... But I remembered it as a living activity. I don't think I ever saw a drawing. but the movie? may be. I remember it very clearly. The boy was in the building like a showroom. She even had a red jacket. It was in the dark and it turned into a red car and there was another boy who looked at him. The car / guy turned around and crashed through a large showroom type window and on the street. And then they drove away. That's all I can remember. I really hope that someone else will remember it too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope I'm not.
