I was very pleased to find this movie in a local video library - Cary Grantis, who was in service, Commissar Stanley Donen, so far as she didn't like it? This is a film that thinks of two things - when all the actors involved (including some known names) understand that they have turkey in their hands and which is the worst thing among several controversial aspects? Continuing to contemplate the first, but my last vote goes into a biased style, before the literally meaningless script, the lack of unstable tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of interaction between characters. You have to act very unevenly with regard to criticism, but it is understandable that the actors fought for it and seem to have a sub-mark. Often they are unable to bring out their rows quickly enough. Cary Grant tries to portray her usual charming and urban personality, but at times it seems uncomfortable in her delivery. However, I have to say that I am relieved when the initial suggestions associated with his character unimaginably vulgar with Jayne Mansfield leave with Suzy Parker. What about the movie? - For me, it is Parker's beauty, who is also restrained and with dignity similar to Grace Kelly. In general, the movie is nice to look at. Navy characters are very smart in their uniforms - but you really have to admire the black Fu Manchu tuner they use in their luxurious hotel suite. Even Grant doesn't look elegant. Back to Credit Ray Walston does a laudable job of its kind, and for me it was interesting to hear Hogan's heroes Werner Klemperer, who speaks without the expected German accent!
