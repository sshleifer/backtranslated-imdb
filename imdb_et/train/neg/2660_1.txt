Nonetheless, it is an amateur, expeditious film or an effort that is as interesting and courageous as a spirited high school student composition book full of death poetry. Certainly, it disturbs viewers who are pampered to disturb them, but success is attributed to themselves, not to the director. In order to truly get under the skin of the human being, sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent are needed, as well as the eye and ear. The film does not contain one pictorial image, which is still displayed (and also used for videos), but which has no development leading to it or away from it. If the director had been in sight, he would have seen it as an interesting starting point for the film.
