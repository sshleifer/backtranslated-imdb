If you see this turkey listed in the TV guide, DON'T RECOMMEND PLAGUE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> Don't start to describe how bad this movie is! There is only one funny scene (the memory eraser scene), but even the fact that the laughter has only 0.001 (out of 1000). Those who wrote this turkey should be banned from making their films throughout their lives.
