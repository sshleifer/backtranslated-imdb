Just a regular Jason movie, there were some movie parts that were funny. The undertone of movement is to live the life I think. These are the movies I think the 14-year-old girls are watching on dormant parties. That was the right movie. It's kind of one of those movies that you have on the back and look every now and then when you try to pay attention. I think Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a good story and plot. This is the kind of boy he's in for a movie. This is the perfect film they would show in the comedy Central. I'm glad I didn't see it in the movie theater, I'd be angry. But I think that's why I didn't see it in the theater.
