What the hell is in your mind? This movie sucks! I started to miss every minute. I tried to look at the end because I hope that something will happen at the end! But instead, I was amazed at how the endless end was treated ... What's the story of this bloody "bogeyman"? How does he die? He is a bloody man for God's sake! Only a boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago. Then what? His stay in a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This movie is fascinatingly stupid ... It's black. I'm selling it right now to a foolish man who understands this stupid movie.
