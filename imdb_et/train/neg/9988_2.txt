Cameron Diaz is a woman married to a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is good until she looks and things are a bit complicated. While I was watching this movie, I asked myself several times why I was that because the film is so ridiculous and blah and badly written without disbelief. Also, the audience doesn't really look at the car that happens. Even lovely Cameron can't save it on a scale of 1-10 ..2
