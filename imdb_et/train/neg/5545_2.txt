The "Zombie Rebellion" proves that redesigning and reusing the same director does not necessarily mean twice a flash. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, who are responsible for the horror classic "White Zombie", did it a little a few years later to fund their popularity and even recycle Lugos' eyes from this previous movie. The White Zombie movie rights owners met a battle who didn't want Halperin to use the word "zombie" in this title. This word was the only thing that could help this movie because, as everyone knows, bad films can make much more money than the word "Zombie" in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was able to do a couple of years ago makes it an uninteresting movie offensive. It looks like he has never directed another horror movie after that. The zombies here do not seem to have walked the dead, but simply the victims of hypnotism. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create a thought-controlled army of zombies? Be prepared to break a few eggs, including your own. <br /> <br /> LAME PLOT: A person loves a cordial woman who plays with her heart and only contacts her for the joy she loves. It sends a spiral of insanity to a person, in which he tries to use the zombie control technique to turn things in his favor, trying to win a woman who is not worth spying. <br /> <br /> The most outstanding drawings I've ever seen. You should be blind or foolish not to see the ending coming. Operation is not even good. This film changes the racially unreliable "king of zombies" (which appeared on the same double bill on the DVD that I bought) to feel the atmosphere of the masterpiece and reminds us that not every black and white film is classic. This makes the atomic sci-fi alien zombie festival "Invisible Invaders" like a serious drama. This is one big cheese ball that is so ridiculously melodramatic that it can probably make a lot of Korean film fans (South Korean films are often known for using melodrama). Credit lists list ironically the name of Lemmikfilmid. I'm not sure whose favorite movie it would be, but they're probably an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended: zombies, romance or classic movies.
