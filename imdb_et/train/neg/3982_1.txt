For God's love, don't look at this movie! A waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are romantic scenes. In trying to build too little, this film and its evil predictable villain are just flat. The characters are not developed and most of the film is cushioned with Roman frames, which is much more interesting than the actual film. First of all, this action is disgraceful. I know everyone is trying to find their niche, but it's really a disaster. I can't believe that someone actually paid for this movie, many millions of pounds. Don't waste money or time on this film, look at your grandmother or something of value.
