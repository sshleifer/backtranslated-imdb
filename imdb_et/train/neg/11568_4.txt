This British pot boasts one thing: the young men have an evenly good look. Older men have opinions, right Thatcheri, whose behavior brings back all of Reagan's / Thatcher's years. Young or old, but the moral in this three-part mini-series is generally accepted and nobody comes out very well. This is not important for the story, but it has an exceptionally beautiful head that makes viewing this fire much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend whose father, Gerald, is a rich conservative politician and babysitters to his sister Cat, while in the southern part of the family in southern France. They don't tell him that Cat is confusing with the choice of knives and other kitchen utensils. Nick carries his self-exclusion "gratitude" for affection and movement, explaining too late how much they despise and patronize. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years, but since the plot depends on that point, it's better not to ask. <br /> <br /> Although Nick is the most enjoyable watch, he is unacceptably disdainful. His coy subjugation to the abundant bigot was soon on my wall climbing. Deeply closed except Cat (she thinks her big secret from sight) as she does a bit of anonymous sex, so we know she's really gay. Although hardly seems possible, Nick takes out a lover who is even more closed than. <br /> <br /> Overweight stories scare and offend the two black people in the movie, so imagine the poison that rages when Nick's sexual orientation is tabloid. Gerald, in the true Tory way, has been involved in a number of personal and financial scandals, so revelations about Nick add his embarrassment. This gives Gerald the ultimate opportunity to disprove the unhappy boy. Is refusal, self-exchange, naivety or ignorance? You decide if you can sit all this thing without throwing anything in the set.
