This movie is a mess. I'm surprised that he even has a theatrical performance. Had Robin Williams done this, he would have gone straight to the video. It's badly written. That's badly targeted. It is a worse offense that it has taken an interesting issue and reduced it with a ridiculous and BORN thriller that has no excitement and no tension or internal or emotional logic. Especially after the first semester, the film fits into ridiculous pieces that are so uplifted that the audience I saw it laughed at. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it is neither tense nor excited - in fact, the film's really worst guilt is that it's just boring.
