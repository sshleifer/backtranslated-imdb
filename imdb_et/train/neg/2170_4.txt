This film passes through the fine between satire and stupidity. Although a bridge system that does not have rules can promote family harmony, it can't definitely beat the bridge, so satire didn't work for me. But there were some things I still enjoyed, especially between the big bridges between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk at the end of the film. It is treated like a championship boxing game. Not only is there a square area, such as a boxing ring, but also the judge and radio broadcast Roscoe Karns gives the event alternating. At one point he even lists "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if offering four diamonds was an attack event. And people were glued to their radio for everything that was a joint event in the championship. This spam really did work really well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a few actors offer comedy that is required to keep the prescribed satire. Paul Lukas does not have much comedy and it is disgraceful; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh didn't get enough good lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic at the beginning of the movie, which is a forgotten blonde, but after that she disappears practically. What a waste of talent!
