Gore Vidal's novel (one of America's greatest writers) is a customized hodge-podge that makes DAYS AND WILD FELLIN's artwork. Raquel Welch, who has an incredible body (and is not really very long) in a leading role (except KANSAS CITY BOMBER when he was pretty good) playing Rex Reed (a bad film reviewer, not a critic), but to drag it around queen (big chick) Mae West, horny John Huston, young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (before Lee Majors, what a shame) and other various slippery azoids to pretend to WAY if things don't have anything to do except for old staples (eg Widmark KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... JUST so they can get out of life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. Best Performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth it!
