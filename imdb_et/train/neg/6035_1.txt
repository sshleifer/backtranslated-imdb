I really want to give it a negative vote because I think I just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst movie ever put on the film. acting was just god terrible, i mean REALLLYYYY bad, dialogue was worse, script sounded like it was written .... i don't think anything terrible enough to say. And the day "outdoors" and night-time "inside" pictures make you think the events lasted for several days. Dreadfully acted, directed, written, etc. REMEMBER ALL COSTS. If my only salvation grace to stay in hell is to do one good thing, it must be said to the world that he will not look at it. This movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
