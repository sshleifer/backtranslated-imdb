John Candy. Do we say more? He's the main reason you should see this movie. Most people do not understand how he was a talented actor. Witness her by making the poor slip into a horny jerk. Just a simple (subtle) facial change and we go. There are a lot of big bits in this movie and a lot of really stupid ones. For me, the best moments are both KUNG FU U scenes and a great moment when John (trance) rises on the stage and tells how much he loves his girlfriend - this is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure that reading this might suggest that this sequence sounds really crude. This is, but it is also very funny mainly because John Candy does it. In general, the story is pretty flat and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni with Candy) don't get enough work in the movie. The album has its moments, especially in the movies at the end of the wedding (think Rod Serling) and the big scene when he talks to his mother on the phone. In general, a good movie is if you have had a hard day and you have to put your brain in fool. I'll give it to 4 out of ten.
