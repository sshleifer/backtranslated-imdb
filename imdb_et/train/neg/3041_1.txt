Yes, I rated this movie with one star. But this is the turn of my Christmas movies in the future. It's really so bad that it's good. This is another production by K.Gordon Murray (read: really buying a cheap / bad Mexican movie, spending zero money to duplicate it in English, and releasing it in the mid-1960s.) It's a shame that I put it so late in life, because I'm sure some "mood enhancers" would make it an even better experience. I'm not going to say again what so many other reviewers have already said, a movie with Merlin, a fucking, a mechanical reindeer, and some of the most pathetic kids I've never seen. I plan to go back to it during the holidays with the "A Christmas Carol" by Kelsey Grammar. Really is hell experience. Now that I can only find "all night good (aka Sloes)" on a DVD, I have a triple function that can't be won. You have to watch this movie. It moves so slowly that I don't think you're touching the back and forth button, especially for two dance routines! This thing feels like an expensive bleu cheese that you have to enjoy to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
