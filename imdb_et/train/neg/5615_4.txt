I just watched a DVD 1. The right program can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise it is a dirty fall of religious people. Just as Head Brian Flemming has only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm and knows with these tools that he can easily block his opposition. <br /> <br /> Flemming also moves extensively to their personal issues and takes over Film. He will never get back to the topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to discriminate against skeptics when their objections to religion are clearly rooted in abuse. The arguments of these victims seem irrational and therefore convincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people want more data. We don't have to say that religious people are nuts, more than American Jews have to talk about when the encouraging Christmas music will be in mid-December. <br /> <br /> From the best scene, Fleming Commander's Christian School of Childhood is rather motivated by the director. It seems to be the most honest part of the movie and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a little self-conscious, he might have a good story about his own (past and present) relationship with Christianity and abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth. <br /> <br /> And maybe he could borrow his "ever-walking land of Christ" material into a more serious documentary. I do not investigate Saul / Paul's writings to find out how this airproof is, but browsing Wikipedia quickly shows that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> Bonus interviews are pretty good, they don't support much of Fleming's thesis. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV and does not shine on those other non-Christian religions. Harrissa also has some good (and easily Google) interviews with Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
