Of course, I was not interested in things that come (the so-called "shape of things") as much as most viewers. This means there is a good chance that you will enjoy it more than I do. In any case, it may be helpful to listen to a movie described from another perspective. <br /> <br /> Director William Cameron Menzies, with so much experience as a product developer and even more as an art director This is a customization of HG Wells movie by the same name. In my eyes, it helps to show why a great novelist may not be a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The film opens in 1940 in London, in a similar Everytown. War is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it might reach them. It does. And it becomes a decades-long thing that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to jump in time to show us different scenes related to war and its consequences. We see two pilots, one of them lowering, to the consequences of their struggle. We meet a post-apocalyptic community dominated by a powerful warlord. We meet a man's growing futuristic society. We see how technology changes. Finally, we are going to complete the futuristic society that is around 2036, where leaders are discussing the usefulness of sending a person. <br /> <br /> It can all be very exciting, but it just doesn't work as a movie. Structurally, the film is too episodic, little to hit it. By the third segment, I completely lost interest in tracking these characters. I was barely able to sort them in the first few segments. The new face is constantly parade. We can't learn anything about them. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help that individual segments with a few exceptions tend to be cumbersome and edited. They are also manipulating from time to time - it can almost begin to become a propaganda film. However, perhaps contradictory, the segments are emotionally cold and dry. <br /> <br /> In fact, one excess part is a music video / industrial promotional video. If the functions represent the construction of a futuristic city with many large machines, a lot of welding, etc. At one point, a man who looks like astronaut waves in the camera through some futuristic glass. The music in this section is between the militarist and overcrowded choir. I cannot say that the things that come are the inclusion of drama-related material. <br /> <br /> But a common cry for things is that it is a "movie of ideas". This may be true, but there are a couple of problems. One, it still doesn't make it a movie, ie a visual and phonetic dramatic work, and two, here are too many ideas. <br /> <br /> The principle is that war and what it does for civilizations. It's a good thing to make a movie. It is also very remarkable during World War II because the things that came were written and filmed in 1935 (1936). Wells has interesting things to talk about war, some of which contradict the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the end seems to end with the breakdown of another war or at any moment. The general message seems pessimistic. Wells seems to have shown that war is just a part of human nature that cannot be removed, although it does not preclude "progress" - in fact, perhaps it will heat progress at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> That would be enough for one movie. However, there are still many ideas here. The scene between two pilots is one of the more special scenes in the movie. It deals with a complex dilemma. One pilot has shot you down, but now he needs help. But the pilot who had landed was carrying poisonous gas, now over the field. They can't breathe gas. The girl comes together. They only have two functioning gas masks. The pilot who shot down offers his mask as he says he will die anyway. What to do? It is not that this scene can be extended, but the ideas - both strange complexes and assisting and injuring each other in the midst of war - are enough to build a movie. <Br>> <br /> Another example. During possible scenes of war with the captain, the apocalyptic environment is a nasty infectious disease called "wandering". It becomes victims of soldered zombies. The usual procedure is putting the victims on the ground, trying to prevent the disease. This material is treated as if it were a follow-up. It's a great idea and served your movie. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells presents contradictory socialist ideas to the society of the future. It was also enough for his movie. It's just impossible to deal with so many things in 100 minutes, especially if it should be a movie's core instead of a dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> However, there is reason to give at least one view. If you're a sci-fi buff, it's a historically important movie. Given the background of Menzies, production and kit designs are interesting, even if cinematography seems to be extremely dated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was premature or retro-humorous in his predictions. I especially liked the way of distortion that strongly resembled George Méliès' journey to 1902 (aka Le Voyage dans la lune). Just don't wait too many things to come.
