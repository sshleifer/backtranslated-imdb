We looked at it twice in the theater because we couldn't believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we would have forgotten something ... the speed that was missing from the beginning. I went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting a day ago is now just so loose and fuzzy-headed. <br /> <br /> So the original problem with the film decided to do it at all and the rest of the train's wreck went from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior images are taken by accidentally placing the camera in the interior. All the actors look at the discomfort at least - Angie Dickenson looks positively pampered - except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression she is too aware that she understands how terrible her performance is. Dialogue is one, long and steadfast. The scenes are unreasonable from the other and, on the other hand, the connections between them do not exist. And yet, the film is blinding, convinced that he says something deep. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to even be funny; it's just scary. Gus Van Zant has made other good films that I encourage you to see and I'm happy he lived (and seems to have learned).
