In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee clearly has a lot of his mind. He thinks about the coloring of racism, media and hegemony, consumption and capitalism, religion, sexism, "hetero-sexism", drug war policy, and so on. itself is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are going to critically examine the key aspects of our daily lives; silent and invisible forces that dominate our societies. But just because Lee makes the controversial movies, he doesn't make a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What is Jungle Fever is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely due to two major failures: <br /> <br /> First, Lee is just trying too hard. He seems desperate for any political / social statement he thinks for 90 minutes. And as such, the end result seems to be confusing and irresistible as it does not allow itself to develop signs that can fully express the ideas it expects to present. And he casts out stereotypes and we have missed testimonies and very charged dialogues. The end result is very phased and unrealistic. Secondly, trying to exert such diverse social functions does not appear to be a concrete or original interpretation of the social / political issues. What comes over is a non-mindless regurgitation. You think he bought a baseline sociological textbook and put out all 500 pages. filmmaker's voice. She can't stay away from the work and let her talk for her. <br /> <br /> It does not work as a work of art or as a credible political argument. <br /> <br /> Though I still appreciate Lee, highlighting these important issues, I have to say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
