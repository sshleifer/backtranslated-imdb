It was a recent film classic by AMC and I had to laugh. I had great hopes for this adventure following the "Natural Tour" and "The Mysterious Island". I was painfully disappointed not only with the credentials, but with the stupid story that reads a five-year comic book. Be sure to watch the wires that are on the Pterdactyl wings when they capture half of the idiot "Ogari", lost to friends with adventure joy. Finally, it remained open for further transformation of the same effects "People who have forgotten the time". Don't waste your time.
