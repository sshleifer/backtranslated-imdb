I liked this movie, curious about how they have adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of depth with rich characters, terrible situations and social criticism could not become a bad film. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This flick is a terrible movie experience, not for its content, but for this form. In my sincere opinion, Director Ulrich Edel performs a terrible director's work that does not justify the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director; this film looks like a feeling that it is "poor" made. Some of my views on this bomb (** front spoilers **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of Directors' Creativity. Scenes are slow, seem slow, seem badly fired, and hardly ever anchored. The only freedom they take is the cinema, the dark tone. In addition, the film has the same technical creativity as the TV soap opera. <br /> <br /> - All actors are doing terrible work on these unfortunate characters. The problem is that adaptation does not solve the main element of plot development: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots without a clear motivation for action. They seem to be doing blue things like robots for no reason at all. Edel has every chance to enrich the character development without exploring the character's motivation and avoiding the full development of the personality of each character. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is evident in Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does this good job playing a prostitute, but his alcohol-induced decision to let the sailors spoil him. It looks very stupid as we see this character blue. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The film also has many secondary, symbolic characters that do nothing, do not know anything and do not add anything to the scheme. I would have liked to know more about, for example, Harry's wife and the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel is only approaching the evolution of character with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, just to screw it at the end and not to explain clearly his motivation. Pliers are also a joke about their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - Music is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Mark Knopfler's terrible job. I was seriously expecting more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his work in this film is seriously lacking. Sometimes, in a battle between trade unionists and the police, music seems to be completely rid of the film. It also seems totally bad and anachronic; I can swear that the whole soundtrack was made with the Casio toy keyboard. This draws attention to actual action. <br /> <br /> - Desmond Nakano's book adaptation is so literally losing the story. They seem to have tried so much to keep up with the strategy of action in the book, that they forgot the development of their characters and again their actions and motivation. <br /> <br /> You can't recommend this movie, not even for a Shelby fan, because it might break the original book. This is a very endless effort to adjust the novel and shows very little creative input.
