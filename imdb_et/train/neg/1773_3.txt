Oh dear to me! I rarely have a boring film for me, or make me laugh as much as that. After a pleasant start to the intriguing assumption, it goes far beyond just supernatural and sexual aside. Usually, this great Alice Krige is wasted and the plot twists are ridiculous. Don't worry if you're desperate. Rating: 3/10.
