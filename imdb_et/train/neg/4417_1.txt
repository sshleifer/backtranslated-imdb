I am a Catholic who has taught parakoles in primary schools by nuns taught by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but it is not considered "good Catholics" in the eyes of the Church because I do not believe in certain things and do not act in a certain way because the Church tells me. <br /> <br /> So back to the movie ... it's bad, because this nun kills two people who should be satire, the embodiment of a female religious leader. There is no comedy in this, because there is no satire in Diane Keaton's overall effect. I didn't see this game, but if it was very different, it might be good. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought the gun could be a fake and the first plan a female driver had. four former students tried to show sister Mary's emotional and intellectual transmission. But it turns out that the bullets were real and the story is a tragedy ... the tragedy of human casualties (in addition to the two former students ... the life of abandoned babies, the life of the pupil's mother), the authority of dogmatic tragedy about people's love, the tragedy of organized religion that replaces true faith in God. This is exactly the wrong with today's Islam and yesterday with Judaism and Christianity.
