I just rented (yes! I paid the money to see!) This movie. OMG. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. As another reviewer said, Mrs Colagrande, come out of the movies, PLEASE! Please never do or appear in another movie! The lady has a cantaloupe charisma. No, it is not a fair cantaloupe that is likely to have more of it. He doesn't know how to act; he influences haunting watching all the time (very much reminded me of my always young sister in Europe). He's not charming; she is not beautiful. There is no real story. And Editing! There was nothing I saw! It's pretty bad when you watch a movie and just press "forward" on the remote control and nothing happens to STILL! I mean ... ... I cried inadvertently, "Cut! Cut!" What did they mean? Of course, they thought they would make a movie together and get paid to love the screen! For them there is a pretty good offer; pretty raw offer to the viewer! I think I'm gonna go now.
