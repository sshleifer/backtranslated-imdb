I was bored, about 10:00, so I watched this movie. And I couldn't finish laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way children acted as they were older than 11 broke me. One child had a ring that allegedly killed people after 3 or more years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> Little kids are very difficult to take seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act like everything is as big a thing as Billy (the main character) does not eat worms, then the world ends. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for young children (except for the fact that 5-year-old says "penis"), but not for teenagers or adults who don't want to waste their time.
