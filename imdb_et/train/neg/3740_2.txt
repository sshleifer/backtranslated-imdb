Immediately, this film was ridiculous. Not that he did not redeem the aspects? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful backdrop. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that in the south there are no beautiful mountains like those in the west. I knew it was out of Utah immediately, but maybe Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so they had to apologize, saying it was a southern city. Raising his accent to the south was easier. Of course, the film has twists on the plot, but its unmistakable feeling was something I couldn't get to the past. It's not like Utah has no meta-tags ... so why did the writers think it was pretending to be south, next to me. <br /> <br /> Another thing that is in action lets me always think. Why do they always make a "summative" sound effect when a character pulls out an automatic gun? It seems that all other sound effects in this movie were "chuk-chich", which means that 9 mm was loaded and ready for fire. Of course the arms already had circles, so it was unnecessary. Finally, the pyrotechnic WAY was up. But hey, this movie was directed to a "market segment", I think ... It's too bad. Every participant can act, but this film was flat.
