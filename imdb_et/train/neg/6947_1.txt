Undoubtedly one of the worst films of recent years. The story focuses on four women traveling to bank robbery, with whom we should somehow express compassion. It is a heavy sympathy character who makes such stupid decisions. Oh no, the police are with us, they know who we are, what we do? ... We'll kidnap another bank, we're out here! What!?! Every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's dead.
