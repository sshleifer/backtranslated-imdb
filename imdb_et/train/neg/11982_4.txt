In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (like Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (like Lizzie Praskins) watch their children's wedding, Anita Page (Helen) and Norman Foster (like John). Before the celebration, Mrs Dressler turns her small town bank over to her son, Foster. Six years later, major depression brings about a lot of bank closures and financial uncertainty. Banker Foster is able to survive thanks to the wise planning of Mother Dressler. But Mrs. Moran is worried about her fortune and demands a loud full retreat. Other "Warren Bank" customers will hear Morani Ranch and start their own solvency survey. Soon the family will be in financial crisis. <br /> <br /> Dressler's tremendous critical and financial movie "Emma" was released at the beginning of the year and MGM wanted to get the new Dressler movie as soon as possible. Dressler's 1931 hits, "Reduction" and "Politics" were still making a lot of money; and Dressler had received the US # 1 Box Office Star of 1932, according to a list of industry standards compiled by Quigley. "Wellbeing" definitely marked Dressler status, but production seems insecure and hurry. The cast does well, given. Some more took care of direction and editing and would have helped some restarts? they probably needed it in theaters during the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
