captures my way of thinking about how this film got. I watched it when I was working at home writing and answering the phone - I was just looking at it because I was hoping that the "revenge" part would be good. Needless to say, the revenge and forced plot was not worth the e-mails they were watching. In fact, I am not even sure what finally happened. displaying was just as bad as the FBI file playback scenarios - the worst re-enforcements (really, only "detention and trial" can be so bad in re-settings). I didn't even know that the leading man was in the third eye in the dark until I watched the movie into IMDb, but its obvious reason why he didn't have it since then. I hope he is a good singer.
