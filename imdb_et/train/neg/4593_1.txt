As a physics student, I am aware of many idiot professors and other so-called experts. As I continue my studies, I learn more and more from actual physics experiments and people who do things right. <br /> <br /> Then my friends will talk about this "physics film" to see what they want. Knowing something, I'm excited hoping that the information will be presented well. <br /> <br /> I have made REAL quantum mechanics; it wasn't so. <br /> <br /> This film begins with the basic premise that everything that happens in the subatomic particle becomes and begins to appear to you when you just open your eyes. Let's just think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies consist of about 10 ^ 30 such subatomic particles. That's a million billion billion particles! Only with the "mysterious" quantum effects of two particles, the probability of 50% can be completely eliminated. Adding more and more particles to the mix will make it almost impossible to get a high net quota result. To tell us that this is a valid premise, without this rationality ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, including physics, and I read 3 facts in this movie. But they were presented in the most misleading way I ever saw. <br /> <br /> I can't say so much about the nervous part of the movie because I haven't had any medical training. It seemed that it might have reminded him a little more about the life in biology, but I can't tell. <br /> <br /> At least this movie was of redeeming quality: dance peptides (or whatever they were, actually) scene. Do not destroy the priceless plot that drives this film, but the main character goes to weddings where he sees all the different personalities that their peptides * lead, and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are connected between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides and full CG scene, full of dance peptides. At this point, the film tried to tell us how we are "emotionally dependent", so we treat the full song of this hit "Addicted to Love". <br /> <br /> This scene was redeeming because anyone who could review it and still take this movie seriously ... well, you are the ones who have to "open their eyes".
