If you want to make such a movie, the risk is real. Don't surround your patient with a Bonzos heap. There is no credibility here. The plot is boring and incredible. Operation is even worse. I thought I was looking at Lake Arthur (Dagwood), one of the main characters in history. Well, at some point he has to confront the music and fight the mad. I don't care. Are you? All these long scenes are in this oyster (furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People speak and smoke and do nothing. Most operations take place within five minutes. After that, it's over. Do not worry.
