I do not understand why making changes has become a trend. Every remake I've ever seen is terrible and it is no exception. If anyone of you has seen Ben Jones quoting it as a "sliding" trash, he is absolutely right. Why would they take an excellent TV show that I loved, never disappeared from the episode, and their seasons on 1-4 DVDs and destroyed it, I never know. The TV show was a family event, and although Daisy has a body, it was really flaunted, or even shown, to store equipment. The family exhibition has been introduced to dirty rubbish and I would not recommend anyone to see it. The other thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are great actors (with the rest of the original pain) and they are also very cute. The new Bo and Luke aren't even a little cute. It was one of the drawers in the exhibition. Casting is terrible. They could get a brunette for at least Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg. Every other role he has ever played has the opposite in this role. The only role they played half-decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but it is not a comparison. Denver Pyle is his own actor and it made him a perfect role. I think the casting is terrible, the story is terrible and everyone destroyed the wonderful show and turned it into a black, terrible film. I wouldn't recommend anyone seeing it. I only saw it curiously, plus a free ticket for the 4th season DVD. I would never have seen this movie, but it was free. DO NOT RETURN TO MOVES.
