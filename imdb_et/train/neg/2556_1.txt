Well, all of this has been talked about in this movie and I hate it when I write comments where everyone else already said what to say. But the thing is that I've seen zillions of movies and I am working on writing comments on all the movies I've seen. So, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> Actress is stupid. It's really stupid how the news anchor expresses its sadness with an air accident. The nun is a nice and professional assistant who has to take care of the child. The three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you don't know how stupid the filmmakers are. Don't they realize that even the rip-off is still scary. We don't see how granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die, you just don't recognize them. And the uncle's tony in the garage dies in a way that could have worked better. We just hear him yelling and we can't see anything!
