I rented this movie because I was browsing through the horror movies for some of the movies that nobody heard and could be a pearl. I saw it and since I am a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It got a rating of EM, which means: extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was entirely for violence and everyone else, I got it. The cell warning said: Extreme violence, extreme parachute and nudity. "Extreme violence" hit my fancy. The end of the movie was a pretty crazy cracker. It was one or two gory scenes, but I've seen a worse PG-13 movie. Of course, the gorees in the movie aren't all right? You also have a plot. Well, the plot was boring and there was nothing special. Don't try it. I'm telling the truth. I can't imagine how someone could really enjoy the point where they say, "I'll rent it again." It was the moment he held you, but I never see this movie.
