Kim Basinger stands for Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who gets into trouble when she is in a local mall, doing some last-minute Christmas shops. After placing a quick-scanned hate note on the paper and sticking the paper to the car that took the two parking spaces on the windshield, he finds that the car owners are white boys made up of a rose rainbow conference. Mexican, Chinese man and black. They are being touched by a note, covering the helpless security officer and being pursued. During the film, Della will hunt for a hunter when she fires her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I found it to be a little tense little thriller. The action was good enough (except for a few scenes, "Why God, why" was a bit worthy of its weakness, though it's bad). This is a bit of a blank because of the hateful / stupid foolish pursuit of Della Della. If they had no "home-alone" baddie intellect, maybe their final defeat would be something I would do to men instead of the reaction. The unbelievable factor I am willing to manage for both the director and one producer, participated in the "shoot em up" screen (a movie that was tremendously fun with the reliability of window throwing). This film has never reached the height of this film, it was good in its rights. <br /> <br /> My Class: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras in Anchor Bay: Comment by writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; 25 and a half minutes of "making-of"; a trailer and two TV shows for this movie; and trailer for lower learning
