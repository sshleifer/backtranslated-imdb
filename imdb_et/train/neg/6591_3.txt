It's the sound of Stan and Ollie in their graves. <br /> <br /> I am not worried about listing the main mistakes of this movie because they are so obvious they say. Small things like "all the new adventures of Laurel and Hardy", despite the fact that the stars have died for more than thirty years. Such small things. It would be a bad idea to be actors who play buffaloes, just like Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it is, it could have worked. Really a bad idea, try two actors for a duo. Okay, they can claim they're brothers, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot may be funny. Okay, forget his funny alien "Cousin Larry" in perfect strangers and watch him at True Romance. But here he smells. This is probably not all his fault, and as the director and the supporters - all who are better than the material - were probably just desperate. There are those who argue that it is difficult for Americans to cope with an effective English accent. This is not the reason Pinch does. What is Stan? Wales? Iran? Pakistan? Only Stane's brand yelpis is close to him, although if the jug is surprised to the tedium point, there is nothing to write home. Gailard Sartain makes a little better than Ollie, though it's like saying what's worse - getting into the dog's dirt or striking the attackers? <br /> <br /> Remember, the originals are shared a second time, intuitive teamwork and innate love? Well, it doesn't exist at all, it has been replaced by two foolish old men and jokes that are so bad that you could park buses through gaps. If the originals had plots that could be put together with a couple of panels, it had a long-lasting mummy hokum (and what a lous title!), Mixed with the boys brotherhood scenario. I can't claim to have seen every Laurel and Hardy 108 movie, but I think it's certain that even their lowest were leagues before that. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is that the originals were kind of playing or at least using their accents. It felt at least natural and compulsive, unlike the cartoons Pinchot and Sartain. And when did Stan do malapropis and so much? "I gave you permanent incineration"; "I would like my friend to marinate." Stop! <br /> <br /> Just a remarkable moment is a reference to the Bozo clown, a comic book who shared Larry Harmon's L & H comic. Harmon of course bought the name of copyright (how amazing to see Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this travesty. <br /> <br /> The questions are big. Will Stan and Ollie not go if they live today? Would they glaze our bottles with broken bottles? Is Stan relaxed on nervous nerves and finished a big CGI final? We hope not. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think it was just disbelief how terrible it is. Why was this film first made? Who did the makers? Perhaps the worst film I've ever seen is the absolute frightening that I watched in the first five minutes. Approximately as much fun as the head's head trapped while the red hot and embarrassing nettles are forced to forcibly return.
