"Nightmare Weekend" by Henry Sala is Troma's split mud. This is a minor, sloppy, and stupid low-budget horror film about some teenage girls who spend the weekend in the manor. Professor's evil assistant attracts girls with a strange scheme of brain implants, transforming his victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a completely braindic trash that contains a lot of nudity and cuddly gore, let alone a ridiculous musical score. is scary and the script is completely inconsistent. Why such a piece of piece is widespread is beyond me. Avoid this as broken1 out of 10.
