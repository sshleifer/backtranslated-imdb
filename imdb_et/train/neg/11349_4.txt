In fact, it's wrong, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated movie. I bought it on a DVD about 3 years ago. Didn't Bug's Life do that? I think it was in this tree at Disneyworld, so I say before they go and use this logo. Shrek 3d was also a Universal Studios motion simulator. They should still treat it as a movie because it appeared in a "theater" and you can buy it on a DVD. The movie was cute, at least small flights. I liked the IQ. I agree with animast, they did something out of God's work that is just a back and forth adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
