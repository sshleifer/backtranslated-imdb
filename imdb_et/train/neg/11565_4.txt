Until now, after a week, "Beauty" alone is a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are good as long as we only say it's just a drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is "factual" coverage of "Thatcher's" years - it's good than drama, but I feel that the award-winning book is still much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder whether the BBC will ever give us follow-up and the next part of the drama, and the years that follow "Things will only get better", ending in 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with this promise from a government full of divide.
