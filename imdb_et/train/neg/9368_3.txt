Oh, dimly, once the famous actor who played the mother's baby. It's BBC 1 on midnight, I don't know if ... yes, it's TVM <br /> <br /> You have to deliver this TVM to the producers, not the content of making a mediocre movie they give us two mediums a movie where two themes are mixed and NO HIDE is different. The first is a woman in danger who has been pollinated by a divorce issue with a woman suffering from pain, which means that we have a hero on the scene who lives over a murder attempt, followed by a scene where son Sam asks why he divorced? And being a TVM, he replies that the reason is that people change instead of saying something like "I right right blow" or your father's cruises to mens public sex, as happens in real divorce cases. it is young Sam, I am sorry, not only his parents divorced, but are as thick as two short plates. In fact, because he is so stupid, he deserves no compassion because he does not know that the man blushes the toilet is a drug dealer, not knowing that you can die when someone shoots you, and without knowing that I love LUCY has been painfully unsuccessful.If only our own childhood was so innocent, as well as Orwell said, "Ignorance is strength." Sam is a sudden marine life expert "Is this a character development or a bad scripting? I know what one of my money is. And it is strange that Sam boy in genu has not noticed that when the story was set in 1994, why do people often wear clothes, ride cars and drive 1950s?" Year at the time of the plot when it is the mother who is in the mannequin. Then there is the final plot that left me an idiot to see it
