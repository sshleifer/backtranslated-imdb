ba ba ba boring ...... this is the drowning of scientific literature beside the battlefield land. genie francis (aka general hospital laura) is small as a reporter and it should in itself say that this movie must be bad .... in this stinky and in some other way, ben kingsley (Academy Award-winning actor) are decent actors. You have to think about what they had to decide to make this terrible movie. Music is dramatically up and down as it's a dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the plot cannot be tracked. The effects are also mediocre and seem really dated. All participants speak with a monotonous voice and lack the realism of their dialogue. I could go on and on, how this is a bad film. At least with Battlefield Earth, it's so bad that it's funny, but it's just b. Avoid if you don't want to sleep.
