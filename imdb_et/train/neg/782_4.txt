Outside the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing has ever been funny about Lopez. I looked at his views and never looked like a laugh. <br /> <br /> His things emerge as honesty and his hostility towards white people falls out of every part of his body. > <br /> I laugh at white people with many comedians and love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy is fun that doesn't stop. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the Spaniards who only have this exhibition to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> The plots shown are always a Spanish-accented cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> Canned to laugh with the most unpleasant comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Maybe this show is always a 2AM replay.
