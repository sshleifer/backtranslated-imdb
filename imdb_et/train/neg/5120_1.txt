It's not a movie, it's an 111-minute evangelical Christian sermon surrounded by the red # American # 1 sport, high school football. Another long, serious message to the transformed person who is supposed to have shot enough to go abroad and convert his unsaved neighbors. <br /> <br /> Dialogue like "You Won the Great When You Were Received Christ" loses all possible camp tasks that are disturbed by the intensity of director / coach Alex Kendrick's sunken black eyes. Then there are "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for the rain, but only one prepared to take it out. Which of them do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is meant to predict a wonderful climax during which Coach asks for his terrible backup: "Son, do you think God could help you?" This is the kind of entertainment that we could have expected to receive ad-infinitum-based funding if only the evangelical Christian Bush administration's hegemonic exercises around the world would have persuaded us all to "lead" after their example. See that the poor giants coach in the apocalyptic finals, calling their team to cry: "Who is with me!" while Eagles, dedicated to the other side, went quietly to the work of the Lord. <br /> <br /> So, do you think our scared backup will hit you to lose those self-centered Goliaths? Well, we all know that eager ones can't lose. Put it like this: Take the playground to the Middle East desert, replace the Christian accusation, and this virulent mess can easily be repackaged into the Taliban super-placement that the divine worshipers of this garbage might think about a minute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, they don't care and do not have to: As a coach tells his team seriously about a pregame empty ship, the answers are all here in this book. And Christian law eats it by its robbery that the last victory has made its fields.
