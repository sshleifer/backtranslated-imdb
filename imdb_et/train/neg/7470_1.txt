SÃ£o Paulo is a high-class teenager with Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel joined the university, and on the eve of the open class, they attend a drug and chewing party. The next day, after these classes, Cristiano arrives at his home last night and three friends raping a girl. The girl dies, panic and decides to get rid of her body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, tells Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The Trio decides to dump and burn the bodies, but other tragedies happen at night. The polemic and shameful "Cama de Gato" is an overestimated pretentious mess about the alienation of young people. and it is definitely the worst Brazilian movie I've seen for years. The low, tragic and dark story is actually a bad taste of black humor comedy. The scenario is not funny, foolish lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative, and foolish footage with interviews with moor teenagers at the beginning and end. The action is terrible, probably with many improvisations, but there is no talent, and I was disappointed with this promising Caio Blat in this trash. Camera, framing, cinematography and edition are amateur and very low quality. The sound is terrible and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actors are talking about (probably this is a plus because it flick sucks). Gang Bang is very realistic and is used to promote this very mediocre marketing of the sexual exploitation of a movie. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cat Bed")
