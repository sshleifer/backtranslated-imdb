Hm. Although an enjoyable film for movie holes, it refers to a terrifying effect, a primitive (at best) special effect (all of which has led me to see this movie three times in the last six years), Severed is among the worst I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, but I know the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the murder picture of the dance floor. All in all, I don't like the film because only the first 30 minutes are pleasant, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialogue and images that can't make the story a logical conclusion (which I don't remember anyway).
