Okay. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Do you have to bump into Ecstasy tubes? There were so many of you. Did you do it for courage? Is this a cult? Or did Guy Richie register 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I'll say it. Just because you don't understand the movie doesn't mean it's not big. You may have had a bad day at work or you were sitting to watch a movie after you had a line with your husband and then you were not in the mood. Perhaps there is a deeper stumbling block, as you simply cannot get mental capacity or a sufficiently advanced philosophical sense to deal with it. BUT. And it is very, but very big. XXL Elephant mega-bet to end all butid. <br /> <br /> DO NOT confuse confusion and do not mix it for a two-hour non-squirrel movie. Really. You might think you're pretty smart. You might even think of yourself as a somewhat romantic figure: an independent thinker fighting the masterpiece against a sheep-like naysayer choir. Please don't. You're embarrassed. Revolver is a waste of time. If you were wondering if you would feel it for a few minutes. It was a waste of garbage, a waste of crew, a waste of catering businesses, and certainly a waste of valuable minutes (you can't get them back) who are unhappy to sit through this unchanging, miserable mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait," comes the voice in the dark. "You just don't understand. It's not LINEAR. That means the story doesn't go to STRAIGHT LINE. It's actually AUTEUR's COMPLEX and SUBTLE work. It's dealing with complex existing issues. CLUB when it first came out - Didn't you hear? ”“ Because they couldn't deal with COMPLEXITY. ”They now eat modest pies, but you hate Lynch movies, doncha?” Hate you disappointed, but I'm a pretty big Lynch fan. I rather like Memento, so the story told in an unusual way may not be scared of me. And although I've learned it a few years ago, I'm very interested in philosophy. For these reasons, I don't like Revolver. I do not like it because it means that it is a big, big braided theme, but it deals with them in such an insulting manner in a superficial way that it is ridiculous. I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works seems to be four years old. I don't like it because the characters, exclusively, have completely sold me out. "Aha!" shouts Richie's apologist. "Guy tends his hat to Brecht!" Maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he just can't write a proper script for toffee. <br /> <br /> Comparing the Revolver with the Fight Club is really instructive. The fighting club has a linguistic, nihilic dialogue on acid that makes you laugh. Revolver has a hidden fortune cookie that rejects one liner that makes your ears bleed. The fighting club has a great twist that makes you re-evaluate. As far as possible, Revolver has to say that a number of incomprehensible turns that do not provide satisfaction, because ... well, they don't make sense. If you leave the carpet under the people, they will eventually pull out of your house. And then they lock all the doors and windows. And they will never let you back. Guy Richie seems to have assumed that philosophical means repeating the mantras of small buzz phrases. Mostly they are spoken, but often they flash on the screen with attributes. It's almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie particularly remarkable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married to such married gangsters clichés. Ultimately, it is so irrelevant. You don't care about anything. You don't understand anything. You're going home. <br /> <br /> In fact, I had a little bit of what I really liked: a surprising assassin with a crisis of confidence. He's great. But I can't suggest you see the movie to see her. He's only in that few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. It's terrible.
