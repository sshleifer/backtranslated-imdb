I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We learned from the room. All the little kids want to go to the room, right? Well, after I saw it, I was so terrified of death that some psychotic robot would have one randomly "random" into space. I had no idea it was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something. I think it was my own version of the scare of the "World War" radio program. So, recently I can watch this movie again, knowing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was there (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you that I smiled at dramatic parts and smiled at the actor even harder. I mean, when Andy is in space, he's moving slowly, have you ever noticed it? I don't think being in space tells me it's slow or probably slow. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is unconscious of the oxygen tank and starts to move back when he closes. Little Max tries to pull her in. Maybe we could make Max's face big when he punishes (slowly) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
