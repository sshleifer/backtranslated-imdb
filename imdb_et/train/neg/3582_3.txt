No, it's not a horror movie ... It's actually a story of love. The ring is a silent film from 1927, which marks two boxers and a woman between them. He loves a boxer known as "one round" Jack. She loves her until the master goes, that is. Even when she marries one round, she starts flirting with the master craftsman until the end of the climate competition between one round and the master. He comes back to the corner of a circle, just as things look darker, and he feels wonderful to win and win his wife's love back. <br /> <br /> This movie was very early at the beginning of Hitch's career. but time constraints must not make him into lasting films. Although there are special movie games and some comedy reliefs, this film is not related to later work. It must be quite long for a disgraceful adulterous woman. It may have been pulled back in 1927. Looking at all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they can be redesigned today and really come out. Maybe I should be one ... <br /> <br /> Leave this movie out if you are not going to watch all the Hitchcock movies. You can fall asleep in the middle.
