In this violent film, some truly terrible ideas that would have been manifestly put into practice have made it a special thing about spaghetti-western bliss. Unfortunately, TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the most imaginative movies! Scenes start and end sharply, characters stay long, actors' performances (and accents) are quite contradictory, and so on. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) revolutionary who, after participating in the village wiping, remains a priest (!) ... ten years later the village is led by "Mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens comes to seek revenge for a man who killed his wife. Colonel Martin Landau is coming to look for Shaw. They all shout LOT to each other and they all shoot each other LOT. Fernando Rey is also in this (dark). The performances are not bad, but they are very uneven. There is sometimes pressure on Saval as well as Landau (who really grabs here). Shaw and Rey prove they can't really feel embarrassed and Stevens looks pretty crazy (if sweaty messy is a bit inappropriate).
