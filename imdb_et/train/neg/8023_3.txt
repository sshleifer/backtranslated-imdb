After watching the movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. The vote describes the film as surreal. Well, there is surreal and surreal. <br /> <br /> There was really only one part of the movie that seemed to me unreal, but frankly it was more confusing than surreal. Other unusual shapes, especially the dining room, where everything is on the floor, were so meaningless that they had no meaning. I don't mind images that mean nothing but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director tried to pass Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else to explain what's going on. Unfortunately, what I saw did not give me a clue what Logan was thinking about his perspective or even his emotional state. I can say that he was not particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he was crushed by a older boy. I thought the ending ended with a signal that the relationship between the boys had changed, but not much else. The deliberate matching of ambiguous scenes with those that were simpler seemed more like a cop than an artistic decision. Still, as tiring and as content was free for me, it was a definite change in pace. I really liked Madagascar's skin, and I felt that this film wanted such a narrative and even a style. It didn't even come close. There is no question for me about this: this film deserves an effort for A but fills D.
