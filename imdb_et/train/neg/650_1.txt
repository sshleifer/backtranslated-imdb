Why Hollywood feels the need to film such great movies (Texas Hillssaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes), but is it much worse why Hollywood feels the need to make those horror films that were not great to get started (Prom Night, Amityville's horror ) Much like their originals, these remakes may not create the atmosphere, character or real fears. The prom night is so flat and uninteresting that it's hard to look at, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a badly-run, massively uninteresting and ultimately boring excursion that does not succeed in everything that is intended. It is clear that Hollywood Horror is dead. Even like The Hills Have Eyes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to spoil their franchises stylishly with a belt and a decent plot. The prom night is almost bloodless and I don't even talk about how bad the plot is. Its inability to kill killers makes it the least suspicious horror film from ... original. <br /> <br /> One of the most famous films of the 1980s will return to terrorize filmmakers with this remake that just proves how terrible high school dance can be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now is the time to leave the past and celebrate his elder in a prominent style. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends are getting ready to enjoy her last big high school outbreak, living it up and partying until morning. But when Donna is ready to look at her nightmares and brighter future, she, who thought she had fled forever, returned to the last dance. An apprehended killer is open, and he kills everyone who is trying to stop him from reaching one and only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see the completion, and what will Donna do if she is forced to stand up to her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis celebrate slasher in a remake of smoky-clad teenagers everywhere nervously over their shoulders as they put on the dance floor. The piece of land that is likely to make you look at it. Witch, when you ask me, it's good. <br /> <br /> McCormick is trying to eliminate the tension in milk from the most banal situations without much work. At one point, the girl returns the floor lamp (lamp!) And McCormick tries to pump it to a jumping-scary moment. Desperate action is really needed in desperation. Since the last IKEA catalog, there have not been many frames. <br /> <br /> The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and Predator Capture Age is probably an astonishing, scary film mined from the glamor of the glamor and jealousy of society's youthful beauty. It's not the movie. <br /> <br /> My final decision? Avoid at all costs. Nobody likes Prom Night, it's even disappointing for those who usually enjoy hacking tasks. Given its complete lack of blood or fear. Luckily forget the night.
