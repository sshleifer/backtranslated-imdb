Horror movie? I can't believe how bad this movie was, what is this movie? about 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the first 70 minutes, it's just a sneak walking with this foolish vision on her face after an accident .... not at all, not even a lot of activities at all. i have to say that the last 20 meets got a little small action ... and was still stupid ....... and the end, my god, i don't know where to start, it ends up stupid to see lena face lol .. can't get me wrong I love Lena Headey, I think she is a great actor, but I don't know what happened to her to make this movie .. don't waste my time and watching it because this movie has no story .. and it makes no sense ... not to mention how slow this movie is and it seems that you look at it forever.
