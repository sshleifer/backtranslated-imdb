Opening this movie was the best thing because it gave us hope that you would see a passionate and well-designed independent film. The devil that opens hope for my hope. Since the "movie" went slowly, pleasantly, my thoughts changed to this "movie": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors pay the director in this "movie"? Did I get my ticket in the office? Yes, dear reader. I saw it in the movie theater! This would be the only exception I look at seeing a movie through a home theater because at home you can BASE. Were the Redemption Values? Peter Lemongell had his usual college "nerd" moments, especially at the dog's collar. Aside from the fact that this "film" was trying to be a comedy, the spiritual drama of the family drama. It didn't succeed on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was totally bad. His production was the only comedy I found.
