"Dahmer" is an interesting film, although I do not use "horror" or "thriller" to describe it. This is a more small character study that seems strangely sympathetic to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner depicts the serial number of Jeffrey Dahmer who was stunned, murdered and crushed by his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney, played well by Artel Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Rodney has a more interesting character: Dahmer's beloved and the escape of the attack will return Dahmer's sex and survive another attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is unequal because it represents a little depiction of the Dahmer years of formation, how events have created a human eye on the screen and offers Dahmer's conviction that he could create sexual zombies for his victims. <br /> <br /> The roles are well played, but the story is thin.
