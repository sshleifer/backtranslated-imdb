After seeing the previews, I felt that this movie was a pleasant improvement over its fast and furious series. So, I was already expecting it to have a short story, but at least at that time it is not loaded with a number of powerless societies with traps. Unfortunately I was wrong. If you could imagine a faster and more frightening movie that is worse than that, it means that movie for you. <br /> <br /> This is the absolute worst film I've ever seen. No, I would not take the baseball to my nuts, as others have said. The story was not only being, but also an action. I think the director thought they could just throw away women and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the man pushes the button and his Lamborghini starts to fly and flies over SLR McLaren. And after Eddy Griffin fought for one of his "girls" (Imus's comment works in this case), the girl asks to pull out of the PLANE and get out of there, and of course they do in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene, I couldn't take it anymore. So, I just saw it in favor. This is the first movie I've ever been out of. Later I had to stop that some drinks killed all my broken brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 because 0 is not an option. You go better to a local car show and stay home on the road. I keep all the viewers in my prayers.
