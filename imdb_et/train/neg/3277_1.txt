If you ever looked at the victims of Duke, you know that you will never have to worry about the apparent behavior of drugs or small children. If you've seen the movie you know, it's not like that anymore! This movie was HORRIBLE! The main drugs and thinking that it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment. They took an excellent show and simply changed it to the trash. Daisy, who was a bit flirting in the original show, looks and acts like he is on the corner of the street, getting paid for his services. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out, after 15 minutes of the movie I was about to leave. I was thinking that it had to get better, but it deteriorated by the moment. I wish I never saw this movie. It trashed a good show and left nothing but a terrible taste for my mouth when I left. Do it yourself, go see something worth your money because it's not just a waste of money, but a waste of 2 hours of life you never get back!
