Adrian has just come out of the shelter, being rich and without parents, it seems his life is empty. One day he meets a poor Gonzalo whose mother is a prostitute. In desperate for making money, Gonzalo Adrianil helps to look for his life and who to look for his parents. This is a film by a new director, which is quite clear in most movies: scenes that are not properly targeted, little forced dialogues, some confusions in the script ... Anyway, the end is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little) and it saves a little movie. Actors are known and of excellent quality, but they are not inspired by the film; all of them have made better papers in other films. The result of the film is boring and probably you spend most of the time thinking about how much time it will take until it ends. Of course, there are much worse movies, but definitely much better.
