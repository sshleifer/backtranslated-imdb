I went to watch this movie, which is waiting for "something really much" action. Open scene promised little action with comedy shades. It will hold you in the first half of the year until you wait for the time to take a boost. Well, nothing like that happens. The drops of the movie and the ending just cast you to the point you are upset. Think about what the director was. There was no point. The film lacked any aspect, had no real story, and seemed very hollow, even though "Rambo" was in it, I do not think he could have helped at all. There is no logic to the film. The ideal way to waste your time and money. By far the most irritating film I've ever seen, and I'm sure b will get others with the same perspective after that. Definitely not for people with little movie feelings.
