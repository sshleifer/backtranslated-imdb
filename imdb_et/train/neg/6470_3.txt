Disney is doing too many times when someone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID feels dirty. Celebrating the birth of her daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric are going to introduce her to King Triton. Ursula's sister Morgana, who is planning to use Melody as a defense for the king's trident, is attacking quickly. Stop the Attack Ariel and Eric are building the ocean around the wall, while Melody is growing, thinking why she can't go there. <br /> <br /> Awful and terrible is what describes it directly on video. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you look at seemed to come straight to other Disney movies. I think Disney can plagiarize himself! Don't tell me that the penguin and walnut do not like you from the second duo of LION KING. Other frustrating moments are between the pastor Sebastien and Louie. They were terribly down! The climax of Morgana and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I don't give anything away, but after 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly narrow and too much to handle. Embarrassing Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better left to rent and laugh. Then you can prepare the rest of the lakes that Disney is going to kill later.
