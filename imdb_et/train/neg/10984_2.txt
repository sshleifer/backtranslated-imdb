I watched this movie for two hours and I don't know what it is. Someone was murdered or maybe they didn't, and maybe someone did it or maybe they didn't. It brought back memories of the good old days (bad old days?), When all CBC Canadian films were stinkers. Recently, there are extraordinary smokers, but this confusing trend of feminism, reeling, and mumbled forms a lost time. I've never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This film continues the fine tradition of Canada. It's not easy to see. Maybe trendy people make a chi chi Toronto cocktail party that they love it. Our people boonies are a little less pretentious.
