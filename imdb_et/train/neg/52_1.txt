I was glad to watch the film in Catalu√±a at the Berlin competition. But after the presentation I was completely disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many topics. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was terrible. Revenge, very human behavior, not quite common, has been shown in countless films and plays, as well as between homosexual relationships and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr Villaronga is trying to do is a pseudo-tragedy that can be one of the worst in the film. It's really a pity that Angela Molina is in this movie. I don't recommend anyone to see this movie under any circumstances.
