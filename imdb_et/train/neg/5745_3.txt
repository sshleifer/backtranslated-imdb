This film was the recipient of the best animated short film of the 1990 Academy Award. Over the past few weeks, I have seen dozens of candidates and recipients of this award over the last 30 years, and I really think this film can be the worst - but it was not just a candidate, it won !! I assume that 1989 was a terrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The movie shows a group of characters that look like super-skinny Uncle Festers. These seem to be simple hinge numbers that are moved by stop-motion animation. Everything is identical - the same face, body and clothes. The only difference is that everyone has a different number from their back. They all stand on a large platform that is suspended in space as magic. Each has a post and their platform also has a box. The platform starts to tilt slightly and in response, the men move to balance the platform. It goes on and on and on for a long time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them works rather disgusting, but it's just not enough to look at that fun at least. Apart from the short animation animation, it doesn't offer me anything interesting .... NOT. By the way, a big short KNICK KNACK came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it wasn't among the candidates. It was very short and was much better than any of the candidates mentioned last year or a year earlier. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years has brought them biased, but KNICK KNACK is so smart and so funny that it has almost failed. Has Pixar not entered it? This seems unlikely.
