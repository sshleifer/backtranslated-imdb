this exhibition is one of the worst examples ALL! some original fun and they are always a year later. as in 2009, they finally talk about Michael Vick's struggle. all the cast members are people who wanted to be in the SNL, but had to go to the lowest, mad TV.its for the fun of a mad magazine that isn't funny, which is said by the terrible John Stewart. . so if you have any problems, tell me I'm happy to listen to the 3 people who watch this show. The man of the family put it well "Osama bin Ladin hid in a place where no one can see mad television. There is no reason why no one looks at this example.
