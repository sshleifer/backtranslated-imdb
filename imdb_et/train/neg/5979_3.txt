Pokemon 3 has little more than three or four episodes of a TV series that has been put together without the usual ads. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, struggle, and resolution where everyone is happy) and there is nothing original or unusual about the animation. Some plot holes are filled without explanation (closing credit!) And everything is just a little too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokemon, and for my sake, they're closer. Seeing the movie in the theater is still different from seeing it in the tube, and my sons enjoy the whole movie experience. I gave the movie 4, mostly from the perspective of my children. <br /> <br />
