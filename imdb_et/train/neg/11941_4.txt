Although it breaks strange good jokes, humor is usually pretty dry, the panel members often pull the face or use coarse language and wait for the crowd to laugh enough. another comment says I don't think it's the best RTE ever made, its really dry and sarcastic. The sarcasm is the smallest form of spirit, there are little really funny intelligent gags that would make you laugh out loud. Comedians seem to feel people as well-known names, not to decide what is the quality of gags, which is not really so good. Generally it is mediocre and some good good laughs, but often it can be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper's carrot or Dave Allens. I find Benny Hill funny.
