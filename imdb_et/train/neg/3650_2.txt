Don't laugh. Yes, I looked at the whole wreck of the train, but only so that I didn't know later that Cleese had reached his mind in the last part. (No, he wasn't.) <br /> <br /> It may be of historical interest to you young people to see that British "humor" contained black "jokes" like those thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What makes me even more astonished is to read the comments of other reviewers, who admit that it is not very good, but then turn around and give it a high voice.

I'm afraid it's the end of civilization when this stuff is really worth it. Next, you tell me that tabloid TV is popular. (
