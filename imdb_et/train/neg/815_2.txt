I just got the 4th Superman 1 UK special edition for about $ 5. Additional stuff includes Superman and Mole-Meni in 1951. So I'd hit it on a DVD player last night and here's my conclusions. <br /> <br /> Some initial disappointments - I hadn't checked and I think I had it mentally labeled as one of Kirk Alyn's series. I am not the greatest fan of George Reeves as Superman and I saw nothing but Kirk Aly's strange clip - but hey ho, never. <br /> <br /> This monochrome production process takes less than an hour. It feels that a couple of episodes is one of Reeves's early TV series, two-piece, put together to release a movie, although IMDb says he was filmed as a film release before the first TV series. In any case, this is a strange choice for the reasons I will get later. I am an age-old TV and movie producer, limited by one or two locations and sets, so there were no big surprises here. However, it is really a small budget for a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> The story touches the small town of Silsby - 1430 inhabitants - which is also amazingly home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story opens when the digger makes quick steps to close the well. This is in contradiction with the arrival of Metropolis journalists Kent and Lane to understand the well from the oil company. As Clark sniffs, the drill is formed into a radioactive cave under 6 miles, a couple of odd small men (small, big, black jumpers and eyebrows) outward. drillshaft, and start mooching round the city with puzzled expressions on your face. <br /> <br /> Now with a deep breath, here's the rest of the drawing picture. The little boys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (who plays the city's xenophobic rampage) encourages some of the plagues to kill these "creatures". Superman enters (moderately ineffective) and catches one of the small boys who have shot and takes him to a local hospital. Corey's pals burn hell, where another little companion is hidden and assumes he's been killed, but he escapes and kicks him down. Corey encourages lynch mobi (despite the sheriff who detained him) to hang a mole-man in the hospital. Superman stops them from entering the hospital and leads to the injured chappie shaft to return to their companions. A total of 4 Mole-Men appear with a weapon they shoot from Jeff Corey (I call it Aargh! Weapon, because his only effect seems to be going to Corey's 'Aargh') and Superman rescues him. He changes his way as soon as he was rescued by Superman, after he has acted, Mool men returning to the shaft. End. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is only an hour long, an unreasonable amount of circumcision, holding and pursuing - I have left out all "Mole-Man 1 slips from A to B, looking at no one Mole men have never dealt in any way - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, persecute and go back. They look a little scary, but hardly these are bug-eyed monsters that the city reaction means. > <br /> Reeves is a pretty good Clark Kent - a very hard-nosed reporter, much more than Phyllis Coates's rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he's a terrible, terrible Superman. He not only sees this part (at least his hair is black , which is healing compared to the mild hair she played in some TV episodes), the way she plays is wrong in my book.I'm sure she was told that it "creates" (what Superman is constantly doing), but someone should have told him that it should be a fist d, not fists, and he plays Superman as a rather strict and touch-sensitive school teacher - he can't really imagine it, but he can do it too. <br /> <br /> And Superman is doing a lot of walking around (I say a huge sum - he doesn't really have that much) and a little running. He pulls and lands a few times, but the flight doesn't see it at some point. Oh, some balls bounce him and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but without the accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are outstanding because of their lack and some small ones that are available are not very good. <br /> <br /> I have been trying to consider this effort by time standards: but even these standards are, in my opinion, a tough effort. Fortunately, the television production standards were higher and at least they were worried about finding stories that were a bit more for them. <br /> <br /> Nothing disappointing - I wouldn't look again.
