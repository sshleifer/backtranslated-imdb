I testify that I don't expect much from Roger Corman's movie. In general, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. However, I'm surprised here. <br /> <br /> Gunslinger is a story about a woman (played by dirty Beverly Garland) who takes the sheriff brutally after her husband's murder. Mrs Garland is a pretty good shooter who kills one murderer the next day at her husband's funeral. His first task is to close the local bar, which violates the city's hourly ride. The bar owner tries to buy the land, assuming that the (expected) railroad will buy it out. However, Mrs Garland is okay in her plans, and the bar matron hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> Ms. Garlandi plays her role honestly and realistically, no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers "She's a sheriff" joke. Except for a couple of faux pas (apartment doors that open from the outside, jeep tracks and two horsemen waiting to drive around the corner on the screen), the film becomes quite acceptable as a movie. However, Corman was unable to paddle his movie with the horse as he walked in other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno says Gunslinger is a horse opera that is worth your time.
