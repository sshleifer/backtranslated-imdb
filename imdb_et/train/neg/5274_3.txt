If you like movies of horrible cities, hotels, houses, countries (sub-Eagles "Hotel California", etc.) that have people who are "just going through", read almost every Stephen King novel instead. If you like the beginning of "disappearance", read the King's "Despair", but see "The Shining", "Salem's Lot" and "Needful Things". <br /> <br /> The crowd motif, desert, family desperate to escape or survive is tired. Why didn't they make a movie about "Desperation"? Maybe they approached the king and he started? Has to be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin are happy about reunion and they are both well-worn over the years, but they are still television and direct DVD players.
