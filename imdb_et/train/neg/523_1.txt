I am amazed at what is going on today. maybe i'm a dinosaur of the fifties and i'm not in touch with today's film generation and it's probably the case with this movie because so many people loved it. I found it wrong and vulgar. I haven't said that about many movies in my life, but it fits the bill. Humor is sofomorph and crude. I'm not a politically correct person, and even I found gay jokes, not just funny, but offensive (I'm not gay). The film's main character is not even a pleasant person, but pathetic. When the movie was finally over, I heard many people comment on how disappointed they were that they just had good money to see.
