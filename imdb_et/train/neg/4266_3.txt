Certainly, NOMAD has some of the best riding conditions, sword games and delicious landscape cinemas you probably see, but it doesn't make the movie good. It helps, but the story must stand out for those things. And this is where Nomad travels. <br /> <br /> The story is clever, suggesting that it was thrown just to make a "cool" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region where this story is taking place (and this is obviously the name of Lee and Hernandez). When filmmakers want us in culture like Jugars and Kazak, they make good use of the actors / actors who watch this part. The love of interest that separates our "heroes" is all touched, but with so little impact and time on the screen that most of the viewers brush them aside for the next fight order, next horse scene or landscape breathtaking beauty. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that during his filming some important changes were made to Nomad, namely the director and the operator. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov and Ueli Steiger (operator) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. On the one hand, Laustsen seems to have a better eye because his visions of the lands have made the final section we see here. Definitely a good thing. But switching to Bodrov as a director may not be a wiser choice. What I see here focuses on battles and not on the people I know come from the eyes of Bodrov, not from Passer. True version. <br /> <br /> The most disgraceful aspect is that it could have been a truly fantastic movie with both character and action. Unfortunately, the higher entrepreneurs probably decided that the action was what was needed and took a cheap (intellectually speaking) way out. <br /> <br /> Although I can't give a positive evaluation of this film, it's just worth watching an amazing cinematic work. But that's all.
