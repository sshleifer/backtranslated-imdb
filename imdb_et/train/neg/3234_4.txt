Well, how do you even rate such a movie like this? Does it even have a cinema value? This is a film that tries to get as close as possible to the snuff. Basically, the whole movie is a clean bunch of guys who torture a young girl. Not very appealing and, moreover, not so realistic. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. But this movie is just too fake to work out. Bursting and stumping are all soft and fake, as well as sounding. They often hit the floor, not the girl. The way a girl reacts to all the torments is also quite annoying. I think if it were real, he would have screamed it. It is quite threatening than shouting. <br /> <br /> Film is obviously a small budget and it is a big attempt to try to achieve something shocking and realistic with original and provocative, with very limited resources. Don't think that this film had a lot of impact, though it was released, although it must have done something well, because after that, six sequences have been released. <br /> <br /> Shock and gore are likely to be disappointed with this movie, although there are still some fetishes out there who get this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
