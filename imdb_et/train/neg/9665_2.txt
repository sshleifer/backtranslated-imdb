Interesting? Hardly. The "scientific evidence" that the film offers its point (which is basically that the Jews are cancer) is so stupid and flat, it is almost ridiculous (if we didn't know what happened at that time). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah. I can't imagine that the Germans (even in such a terrible time) would like to or would like this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl Triumf des Willens. Now it was the film I was impressed with. It's just silly rubbish. <br /> <br /> The "best" part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites), where (jew, as the scientist so beautifully reminds us) Lorre plays a child-mole and a murderer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, this can only be done with a bad mind. Uh ah. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even this Nazi propaganda genre. 2/10.
