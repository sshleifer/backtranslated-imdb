In the past, Shah has done a very impressive job as a filmmaker in the past. "Waqt - Time Race" and "Namaste London" were interesting and interesting to watch. "Singh Is Kinng" was the fun he produced. His last departure as a filmmaker "London Dreams" comes to the brink of his career. <br /> <br /> "London Dreams" is a mediocre story, that is, how success makes friendship hate. Agreed, it's potential, but when you look at London's dreams, you don't know what's going on? This movie may have been the worst in recent times. Vipul Shah, the writer, puts Vipul under Shah's director. The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again, the climax is terrible. How can someone forgive someone who decided to destroy you? I do not want to. Ajay Devgn decides to suddenly go to India and ask for forgiveness for his diaper friend, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When she arrives in India, not hitting or abusing her, Salman greets her with a mess and says she is the cause of the whole fiasco? Did Vipul Shah want to show the character of Salman as God? If yes, if you are completely unsuccessful. The only question I want to ask about Vipul Shah is that would you welcome the person who destroyed you with such a great reception? Write what you feel, do not fool us (audience), we are reasonable enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> It's musical, but Shankar-Eshaan-Loy's music is terrible. No song is left in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is great. He wears a movie on his shoulders and does it really, very well in emotional scenes. But again, his character is shown as God, which makes him out as a slower. Ajay is just as good, but Salman is completely shaded. Asin is wasted and is a great talent like Om Puri in this movie? Rannvijay hams, though Aditya Roy Kapoor stands out. Brinda Parekh is a vamp. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream is still a dream!
