Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the biggest comedy team ever, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson as a number of cheap, several major Hollywood attributes. Following a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued informal parody series at Joe Rock's smaller (and more uncertain) manufacturing plant. <br /> <br /> Most of Laurel's parody films at that time were just a little funny and even less funny for a modern audience who hasn't seen the original film Laurel parodies. "West of Hot Dog" is a fairly common paradise for cowboy shooting. This is a somewhat specific parody of "West of Pecos", released two years earlier, without major players. Since "West of Pecos" was never a great success, it is hard to see why Stan's film unit chose this particular movie as its lampoonery target, much less why they waited so long after it was released into parody. And where did they get the title "Hot of Hot Dog"? It may be that "Hot dog!" was the sexual interference that the American participants favored in the 1920s. (As at the opening of the production "Machinal.") "West of Hot Dog" was produced and directed by Joe Rock. Among his many other achievements, Rock Laurel introduced Lois to Neilson and later he was the best man in his wedding. Full Disclosure: In the last few years of my life, I had the privilege of being a friend of Joe Rock and interviewing him. Nearly ninety years old, Rock's memory was impressively clear ... but he didn't remember anything about the West of Hot Dog and I can't blame him. This movie is extremely forgotten. <br /> <br /> The leading female character is called a little mustard: if it is meant to be a parody in the west of Pecos, I won't get it. Here's a couple of 'impossible' clich√©s, including the Laurel method of equipping the horse. Just one moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the big Buster Keaton when he suddenly ran. "Hot of Hot Dog" is vaguely similar in theme and tone to Keaton's short comedy "Frozen bottom", but Keaton's version is much more fun. The graph of this film presupposes somewhat of a situation in Keaton's "Our Hospitality", but (again) suffers from comparisons: there are two harsh brothers, Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner has inherited it to the weak stallion Stan. However, when the brothers Stan die, they become the legal heirs of the brothers. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously: Is this legacy lawful? As soon as Stan takes possession of his property, his decision will definitely become a matter of ownership or inheritance, not a previous decision of the owner. I had ample time to look at the legal points when it comes to watching the dumb comedy. <br /> <br /> At one point, the hat includes some crude oil animation that is pulled directly into the movie's stock. It looks cheap and is not funny. <br /> <br /> This "hot dog" is no joke and no winner: it's just a whore. My rating: one point out of 10. Stay, Stan: In a few years you'll be half of the comedy legend.
