Twenty years ago, Michael Hawthorne, a five-year-old boy, saw his father killing his mother's ax with an empty road and commit suicide later. Today, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends to Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys ) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween with her grandparents on her farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes to represent their greatest inner fear, and, along with their Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), would present an ancient Indian celebration using a carved wooden mannequin Morty (Jon Fedele) to eliminate their fears forever. The biggest fear of Michael is to become a father-like serum murderer, but something goes wrong and Morty becomes his father by killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless slash of a movie that uses an interesting concept to eliminate every friend's greatest inner fear before it grows, but in a confused scenario full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs Betsy Palmer; others are very weak, but generally it works well. Unfortunately, there is no explanation of why the manikin lives; Further, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sadness when each of them dies. A low rate of more than fifty minutes could have been used to create a better dramatic situation. In the end, Michael shows his charm that his father was interested in not having missed the story. I don't know if the previous reference was delivered to a DVD released in Brazil in 87 minutes. For B-film, special effects are very reasonable. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night for Halloween")
