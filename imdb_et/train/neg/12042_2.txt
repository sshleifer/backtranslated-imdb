To recognize that Brad's fantasies are Pitt, this is a pretty tough entrance for the heterosexual. But what can I tell you? Perhaps it is a famous extra something each of which speaks and denotes a star. It goes beyond this barrier. It pulls you into an unknown and emotional territory. Brando had this pot, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and lately, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has redefined one concept. He's the only reason to go out, get in the car, find a parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get to the theater to see "Troy". If you liked the Jupiter's Darling-style epic, you can enjoy it. But if you don't, go the same way, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
