It's a very old and cheap film - a typical low-budget B-West in so many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star, and this film resembles much of John Wayne's earlier films made for the "line of poverty" studio apartments. With both participants, their familiar style and personality were not yet fully developed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not look exactly like Cooper a few years later (among other things he speaks faster in this early film). <br /> <br /> Unlike the average B movie, the era has at least some interesting elements that make the movie unique (if not good). If you want to see a woman who was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita celebrates a woman's interest in love and this is a very, very strange election, because she has a heavy accent (she was French) and was not even close to the "film star". By the way, he was married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and strange aspect of the film is the seemingly gay sub-block - like the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN since the 1930s (and we thought it was a new idea). The character of Gary Cooper was raised by two men who hate women and do whatever they can through films to keep Cooper clean from women. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues in the movie that the filmmakers are trying to portray them as a gay couple. After all, when one of them is killed, the other strikes the arrow and prevents death long enough to climb over his fallen friend's body and then fall - his hands baptized around him! It was a pretty nervous thing by that time, and I think it makes this dull movie very exciting today! As for Cooper and the plot, the film is a bit disappointing and very variable. If you're not curious about Damita or homosexual words, do yourself a favor and find a better Western.
