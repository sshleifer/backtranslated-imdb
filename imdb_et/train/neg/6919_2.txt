My roommates and I almost finished our TV with the many spits we did when we looked at this fun piece of the 1970s. I read about this camp for ages and scanned my local late night TV shows for years to look for this hard-to-understand swarm. Several years ago our local ABC partner knew that he showed his late-night weekend flick (eg "frogs", "sleepy night", etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 on Saturday night (over 5 years ago) there was! We were over 15 people and the flick wasn't disappointed! <br /> <br /> Look! Andy Griffith, who is "Stargate" by Jaye Davidson! William Shatner sports a variety of things with his head, which only resembles hair (or something organic). <br /> <br /> Hear! jaw droppingly 1970s psychobabble that makes "Chicken Soup of Soul" sounds like BF Skinner <br /> <br /> Feel like! Content that every decade was better than the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ..., the middle-level a-holes in the plot are surrounded by the Griffith, joining him at the Cross Dessert Contest that runs from California to Mexico . They all wear leather jackets that look more like Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way when they stop at Cantinas, drunken, smoky joints (vision by Robert "Mike Brady" Reed's smoke is a picture that you don't have to forget soon), start fighting, try to rape, and just act as a bunch of suburban middle class jack. Although I have a great copy that I recorded on TV, I would like it to appear on the video so that the whole world can enjoy its semi-bakery.
