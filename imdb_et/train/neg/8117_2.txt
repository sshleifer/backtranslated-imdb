"Dreadful people" should be a subtitle for this terrible movie. If you want ordinary people to do the usual things, check out your window in real life. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing stupid things, you have to watch this terrible movie from Mike Leigh. The characters speak for a long time, but never can communicate with each other. Why not? Probably because Leigh things we are all so ineffective and pathetic about his actors and he wants to film real life. But we are not and he failed.
