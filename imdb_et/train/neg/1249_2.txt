With disappointment, especially considering budget, available technical resources and put together talent. Does the basic rule of scientific literature / drama fail to create an unacceptable stop for the audience. The POA 2001 creates an incredible start that sucks us in, but later, Mr Burton forgets that his members have working brain. Helena Bonham Carter Champion Upper Liberal, the unlearning of people, the ease of their escape, the extraordinary equestrian skills (that is, the astronaut and the group of human primitives who suddenly ride on the slope), the massive and immediate human rebellion is all too incredible. Mark Wahlberg has never thought of any real fear, danger or setback. Compare with the original in which Chuck Heston's nakedness met metaphorically with his complete helplessness and surprise. Formatted Wahlberg retains its modesty, but also its obvious leadership and control over its inherent strange situation, and we never know about our well-being. Unlike Heston, he never seems to be in danger. Tim Burton should have used some competent scripts from the f / x budget. In fact, after this worse fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers were struggling with the strike of scriptwriters and directors. Let them walk. Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes in 2001. \ t I bet there are no repetitive views of this effort. It could have been a new franchise and a great imagination. The second chance was lost.
