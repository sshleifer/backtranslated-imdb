You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. Happy, tritical verse and it's $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with Hallmark. Here we get the ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine, who retires to find out that she hasn't really died as we thought. Bad Ernie, he's a poor soul married to Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a couple of weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps first on his feet and portrays a grandfather who links his long lost grandfather. We've seen it before. You can enjoy this movie, but please do not say you were not warned.
