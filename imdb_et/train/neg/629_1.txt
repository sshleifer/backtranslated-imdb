I desperately want to give this movie 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror films, are such a budget that they are good. An intelligent splitting ninja scarecrow capable of applying corn as a deadly weapon ... is definitely the system of "budget and shine". The depth of the film is definitely its strong side and the revolutions it takes to keep the audience at its seats really induces a horrible ... ninja ... with puberty ... before a thirty-year-old student ... a non-cowboy drawing ... wise. .. son-butterfly scarecrow in the limelight as a brighter nightmare of the year. All I really want to say is "can you dig it" and recommend movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy such a fun horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT IS HELL EFFECTIVE!?
