This movie was terrible. Sucking the plot, functioning was bad, editing was wrong and this film makes me want my eyes to fall out. I wish I had time to watch this movie back. The balloon scene was stupid, Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucked, I didn't see chemistry between the two chains, it's full of stereotypes, fools of local "celebrities" came ... most observed was Del "as fast as I want .." computer idiot. The worst thing is that these actors had to play on the spiritual side and even turn them. This film helps to create a long series of little efforts to integrate LDS beliefs into Hollywood. I.E. RM, church ball, etc etc. I'd give up watching this movie and I'll lead the brick for the first time instead. You have more fun than watching this bad excuse for the show.
