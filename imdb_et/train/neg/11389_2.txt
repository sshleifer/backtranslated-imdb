If you like movies that shrink a small plot with exposure that is sexually sexy, this movie is for you. On the plus side, the leader is an actress / actor (newcomer transsexual) with an interesting screen presence, but not enough to add much more than just an interesting movie - if it is. In principle, this film is about three social exodus (transsexual prostitute, male soldier and Russian, gay immigrant) who have somehow developed a bond. Why is it not clear. It is assumed that we agree that these malformations are the basic honest people who are able to love when they tear their bodies on the street. Right !! And Anna Nicole Smith loved her ninety something sugar daddy! The filmmaker shows the sharp, unpleasant side of life, but wants us to believe that all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal as they have a life that helps them to live their lives. Quite a fantasy, but unfortunately it is depicted here as a natural side. All in all, there is no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend a lot of time here. If of course you just don't like the gift!
