Bored. Minimum plot. No character. I went to this movie with great book expectations. It could have been a fantastic movie. It would probably have become a cult classic. No, it was a huge downfall. It was badly cast and had a terrible special effect. It was difficult to find out who the bad guys were: the rebels or the army or the church or all of them? There are still some mini-plots in the movie that are confusing to me. I have been stupid about certain aspects of the so-called "prophecy" that have never been fully explained. I felt like I was watching a mini series on a sci-fi channel. It seemed very similar to a TV movie. Don't look at this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
