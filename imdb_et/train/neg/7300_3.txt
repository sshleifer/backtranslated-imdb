This movie is a group of about five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of your friends is trying to kill a horrible meat-eating virus. Suddenly, friends turn each other into a desperate attempt to keep themselves sick. <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever is a terrible movie. For one, he tries to have a lot of genres at once. Should it be a tribute, a slasher, a black comedy or a scary movie with involuntary comedy? No one can say. At first it is a serious scene and another change, it becomes funny. When a movie tries to be funny, humor is a lot of fun, except the end. I really liked the end. <br /> <br /> But after the end I was quite disappointed and disgusting. Violence is worth the wrong, looking more away from the screen than scared. The tone changes in every scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary and sometimes quite casual. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What should we do about it? The same girl would bite one character. Was it supposed to be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were decent and many were quite amateurish. I don't care about most of the characters. I liked the plot, but filling was terrible. As a horror film, I didn't know what he was trying to be. I didn't find it funny, tense, or scary. Finally, you are indifferent, thinking, "What am I going through?" Unfortunately, you never know the answer to this question.
