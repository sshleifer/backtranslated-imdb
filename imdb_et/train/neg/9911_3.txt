If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you don't need Billy Burke, Coolio, or other troublesome things. Massive talent is "Three days to Vegas" completely lost, accusing the script exactly. My neighbor's holiday movies are about as interesting as this false movie. If you want to see how to use a good scripting veteran, see "Team". There are really no redemption factors here, and watching these wonderful actors with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the low script deceives the audience by giving something to the participants. - MERK
