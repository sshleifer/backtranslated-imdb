I couldn't believe it when I put this movie on my DVD player. I thought I had a good laugh because I played D & D for my life. I had to turn it off because I had a company, and they wondered what mess I was looking at. <br /> <br /> I finished it later, and I should just have left the beginning of porn in a soft core prison. No, they run jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, FAQs. This movie is sure everyone who has ever played D&D. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that Real D&D doesn't let them use their game. Who would like to add their name to it?
