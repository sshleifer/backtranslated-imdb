Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror films. I never look at them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it in Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I never saw happy feet, but I'm sure it's better than that ... movie? Anyway, we didn't expect it to be good ... we just laughed at it. Yes, with me ... I have a problem with the destruction of other people in the theater, but because it was just talking and making other pairs, it wasn't important. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, other people left to go to Borat, a movie I was happy to see. The film was not scary and not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It wasn't terrible as "Baby Genuises" terrible, it was terrible as ... not at all fun. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I am not an expert, but it seems that the horror industry problem these days is that you may have a PG-13 horror that is boring and not scary, or you may have an awful movie that is too bloody or too disgusting for people. <br /> <br /> Do you want a PG-13 horror that sucks but is funny? See "Grudge". Avoid this movie like a plague ... because it can literally lead to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
