Spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words will get you a terrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. EXHIBITION is perfect for these words. The terrible script, idiotic action and fun special effects make it a must for every BAD movie fan. Fear is fun. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes BRAIN admirable in the second half is trying to be good! Is there a bit of ingenuity and continuity that saves fun? <br /> <br /> It's at Christmas. Mother and daughter murder one of the most fun-looking rogues. A day later, the rebel teenager is struggling enough to be sent for psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> When the police head is cut and alienated with blood and a bloody ax told you. some kids did who you believe? What starts funny is going to end at the end and tiring to the end when BRAIN tries to be serious. Scary moments can not frighten a child. Crushing is too funny to try and be sharp. The Institute of Psychological Research is bigger than the main manufacturing companies! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit to draw some of the worst things I've seen. The viewer's discretion is high.
