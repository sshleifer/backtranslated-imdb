Disney has not yet met the film, at least two sequences could not be made. And it was no exception for Disney people to give a weak story to get a quick reward. Somehow, although I didn't look at it, I feel cheaper when I look at it. <br /> <br /> Ariel has now grown and had a daughter. However, the daughter does not allow the sea to go, because the sorcerer's sister of the dead sea creates some unexpected dangers. So here we go again. <br /> <br /> Daughter is deceived (of course) and helps at sea. After a non-glorious battle, he and the mermaids and people will live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to watch here. Go back to your life. "D-"
