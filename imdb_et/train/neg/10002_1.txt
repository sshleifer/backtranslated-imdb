Sorry everyone ,,, I know it should be an "art" movie, but wow, they should have issued weapons for screening so people could blow their brains and not watch. Although the scene design and photo guides were excellent, this story is too painful to look at. The lack of sound was brutal. Loooonnnnng shots were too long. How long can you watch two people sitting and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people. It was really hard for me to go through this movie. The performances were great, but how much of this dark, brilliant, unnecessary stuff can you get? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise, it was Bergman's ripoff. And I'm not his fan. I think anyone who says they had 1/2 hour of it is ,, lying.
