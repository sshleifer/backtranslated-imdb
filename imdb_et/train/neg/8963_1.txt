The killings of this movie are not so bad, but it is definitely a movie. It's even worse. It is not even worth the wear and tear it can cause when entering a DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear and tear that causes your shoulders to wear it from the DVD store, not to talk about money and the time you spend renting and watching. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> It's understandable how someone could say something positive about this movie. My past, which left no end to viewing, was just an empty masochistic tendency, adding to the pressure exerted by his companions. I hope you don't see it as fun because I see it as a fair warning. Don't waste your time watching this garbage!
