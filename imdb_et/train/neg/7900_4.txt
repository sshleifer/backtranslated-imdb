The title creatures destroy the city of a peaceful little desert. This is basically the whole plot of this movie, and while the scenes dedicated to Munchies are somewhat fun (in low form), all the rest is just a filler and a poor filler. "Hero", a painful Woody Allen wannabe, is an extremely foolish killer, and is one of the most irritating characters in the movie. There was a time when almost everyone was on the screen and I thought, "OK, at least the girl is cute, but why do we have to put together the rest of the moorings?". The film is also full of pop-ups (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which apparently did it already in the early 90s. (* 1/2)
