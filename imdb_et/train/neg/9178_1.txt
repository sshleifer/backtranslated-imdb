Calling the worst movie of all time the "death house" is that it is not really. There are inferior movies. I watch a lot of Hong Kong ninja movies, which is mainly due to the unfinished Japanese police drama that has ninja shots at the end to create something that could technically be called a "movie". <br /> <br /> House of The Dead is still one of the worst films I've seen in theaters. Walking halfway, I actually felt that I was somewhat damn that I put this 45-minute rubbish.
