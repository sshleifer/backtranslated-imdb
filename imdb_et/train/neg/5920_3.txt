Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual setting for American War movie, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> An unusual theme, four sisters, and their relationship with American soldiers carrying an illegal child. Senator's Dead Son, to another who lives with seven Navy (one at a time) before returning to return to POW New Zealander's spouse. <br /> <br /> It is unusual for Paul Newman to see such a bad result so quickly after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano's glorious "Somebody Up There Loves Me". <br /> <br /> Unusual two "Stars" for Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons to leave so little movie. <br /> <br /> It is unusual for me to work on a review of such a poor movie, give it something!
