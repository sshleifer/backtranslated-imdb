Before I watched this movie, I read an overview here, noting that this movie can be one of the best movies ever! ha ha The tension of the scenes grows well ... the annoying signs of this movie. A little girl who speaks and tries to sink a little boy to a killer who simply runs without notice (and who was a little boy on the beach !?) .. things just look and then go unanswered in this movie. When I looked, it seemed that the film went in one direction, it just didn't go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and on and on ... <br /> <br /> The actor is great, but writing is terrible. Every character, every scene, says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of peers / extras are just weird. There are no resolutions to the problems that have arisen during the film, which makes it confusing and ultimately a great waste of time.
