Well, it is not often that in the UK, we have a film made of urban life from the Afro-Caribbean perspective, the last example I remember was the undervalued Babylon road back in 1980. Bullet Boy, a movie spoken as a British version of La Haine! Well La Haine it's not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this film the authenticity that has been missed between the other British films, but my concern is that this film ends up being deliberately sad. <br /> <br /> The film intelligently tackles the growing problem of black violence, which is unfortunately all common in London, but I am concerned that filmmakers are now using type-making in plots as opposed to characters that are equally harmful. Saul Dibbil was a great way to make a movie that could be pleasing and inspiring to all of us, but unfortunately, a film was created that only reinforces the idea that London's young black man is the only future of violence and tragedy
