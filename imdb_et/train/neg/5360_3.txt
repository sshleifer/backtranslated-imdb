"Nada" was the most inadequate follow-up of "Les NOces Rouges", which now appears as the last good film "Nada" of Chabrol's Golden Age (1967-1973). Chabrol's first real attempt to completely political film in his earlier work "les Noces Rouges" was but also political elements, but it was a psychological thriller with a society with a traditional view of the provinces of France. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassador, hostage-taking, a lot of blood, not really Chabroli Heterogeneous pains give the film a coup: only Duchaussoy, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel is from scratch.Viviane Romance, one of the Duvivier actors ("La Belle Equipe") , "Panique") is wasted as Mrs. Gabrielle. The Italian actors (Fabio Test, Lou Castel) are terrible. <br /> <br /> What is "Nada" is another time for harsh inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violette Nozi√®res" before she was back to the top of her game.
