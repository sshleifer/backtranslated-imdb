I watched the episode. Yes, I sat through all the miserable experiences, and I have to say that this comedy brand is one of the worst. Imagine Peter Griffin, the fame of the family Guy. Imagine that Peter Griffin is a woman who is probably thin and minus glasses, except that she now has nothing to make her fun. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he doesn't know he's an idiot. Sarah has no real character, no action capability pulls her character out. Perhaps this trick, formal jokes that make comedy even smaller than its character, can take it. Maybe it's the lack of credible films. His unknown, dedicated person can turn to unknown, surprised people, unlike the massive complaint that Stephen Colbert's unreliable, encouraged character is. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates a tedious and unforgettable character. He has nothing to do with the satire genre, let alone the whole comedy world. What Sarah Silverman does not have is noticeable. And if you don't believe it and don't admit it, it's not funny anymore.
