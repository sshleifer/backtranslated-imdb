OK, so it was written in 1996, before September 9, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about the terrorists and the idea that the CIA manager will plot to defeat this dead plane from heaven before it is to blame world, it's premature. That's it. That's a good thing. Functional ... fair. The plot ... silly. "Twist" ... not necessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOMOM It is not like no one thought what to do when the plane gets polluted. Don't you think the bureaucrats have a handbook for "scourge" and how to limit them? Proper implementation of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It's not sending them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And when the virus is in the air, why did the airplane door open and "shooters stood there without protection? Actually, was it ever for someone who shot their feet?" I'm a mammal, I always watch a movie to see the end when I started it, but it was a waste of time and mostly predictable, I saw it with a recorder, so I didn't have to look at all the ads, it was a plus, that's good an example of why I watch so little network TV.
