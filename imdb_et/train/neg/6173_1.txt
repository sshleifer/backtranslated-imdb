This film is a left-wing blunt attempt by Hollywood to portray the Reagan administration as incompetent and disgusting. Some mistakes may have been made during the crisis, but I am not sure it is in this flat movie. My first reaction was that this movie was supposed to be led by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong this time. There are probably many others.
