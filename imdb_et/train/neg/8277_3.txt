It may be incredible, but this movie is $ 878,138 in Russia! It's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still works! Well, I have no idea why the distributors saw their particular "movie", which had no screening around the world. It's a mystery! Haha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that in the second film "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was almost exclusively published on DVD, there were big screenings in Russia and they received more than $ 1 million. Besides, both films had a lot of promotion, as there were banners all over the city, TV ads, etc. Speaking of the film, I would say it is boring and completely boring. It can really be better. Even if he has Jessica Simpson.
