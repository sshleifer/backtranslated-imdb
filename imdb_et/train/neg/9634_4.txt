Regardless of the rating I give, BOOM is only for Sardinia and Rome because of its excellent location photography. Otherwise, it is only for the heavy addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (below him) and RICHARD BURTON (his incorrect phase). Tennessee Williams wrote: "The milk train will not stop here" and should be very fond of customizing this game, but apparently he was the only one. Taylor allegedly hated it and Burton needed money. <br /> <br /> Whatever it means, the beans that Taylor's wearing and smoking tend to burst at the servants and replace the bad baby call with less than NOEL COWARD, who seems to be the second movie visitor when he finally appears. <br /> <br /> It is so campy that Taylor fans are considered to be "must-see" things. But if you can do it without a drink in your hand, then you're in front of me. Unfortunately, this is a film that marked the end of Taylor as a filmmaker, even after winning two Oscar. For Burton it was just as catastrophic and critics called it BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
