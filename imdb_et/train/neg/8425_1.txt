A really nasty, whistle movie with just a small amount of real humor. <br /> <br /> Especially the father's character is in extreme vulgar (intentionally, obviously) and most deplorable, My wife and I found this terribly annoying, absolutely no redemption feature at all. Frankly, I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> I think this British effort is a sick and hard torment. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed this movie are completely absent: rejoice with deep robbery and stupidity. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers should be ashamed.
