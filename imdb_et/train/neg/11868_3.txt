At first glance, this film has received everything the psychologist wants: a vampire story with a limit of "not less than 18", full of hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatics and even a gay necrophilia policeman! But then, this movie is a sequential bad story (so thin), bad behavior - with a ridiculous English accent that makes you believe you are watching a bad Monty Python - bad music (80s hard rock), video cutting is terrible. Pros are ridiculous for sex, gore is not very impressive. And these vampires reflect in the mirror and are not even afraid of daylight! You have to be very disappointed if you don't see it in "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlus will reach 100 on one day, because it is the real place. <br /> <br /> I would say it's nice to see if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> 3/10
