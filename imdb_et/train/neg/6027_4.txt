I grew up in a Baptist and I know the story that this movie is trying to say, although I don't believe the story anymore. I'm giving the film that I'm as good as a weekly average life film. Slightly interesting, mediocre action, a bit slow, the script is predictable, music is cute, and it's a bit melodramatic. And all the people who are left behind must never be the cleanest pure non-Christians. No curse of any of them. But I laughed loudly when the actor played a man who drew the UN as a "core" as a "nu-cu-ler" like Bush. Is there a Christian code of honor that obliges that since Bush claims to have been called by God, all Christians must stop their ignorance by formulating the word wrong as it does? LOL! I really had a hard time taking the film seriously. After the "nu-cu-ler" case, the film began to be packed, manipulated by propaganda. I was looking for something bold. In fact, I was looking for something that I could think of, but I couldn't find it here. If you are looking for meaningless entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
