The only good part of this movie is the beautiful landscape. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retreated from the pulpit when his son, Paul, erred in what he proclaimed. How many times has his boys introduced the name of the Lord in this film, which is the background of the Presbyterian? It doesn't fit. I wanted Paul to sweep down the boat from the beginning to save us from the stupid, stupid and selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler whom Norm wants to save, but not. This is very uninteresting. We see that hostile whites are due to the American who lives by Paul as his native language. It was the only part of interest that might have become a true "wild west". What we only see is a sleepy city where the two ministers' sons have nothing to do, but 1. Norm chase a girlfriend's girlfriend and her family and 2.Paul makes stupid stories in the newspaper shop while her head scratches and swings and binds lots of flies. I'd rather look at an exhibition about fishing that this movie can't get again.
