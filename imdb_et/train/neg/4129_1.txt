After about half of that, I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I suffered the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. Action is bad --- much worse than in the 80's R&D films. <br /> <br /> There are several attempts to humor that fail and the film is 100% predictable. Perhaps, if you are a teenager, this film has some complaints, but for those who have seen many movies, you know how the film will come out in the first 10 minutes. The rest of the time is spent on torture, waiting for the final credit to run. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking at it.
