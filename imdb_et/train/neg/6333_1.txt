I saw it in a movie theater. As soon as I handed my money to the cashier, he said two words I never heard in the theater, before or after: "There is no refund!" As soon as I heard these words, I should just have gone to my money and go home. But no, stupidly, I went and watched the movie. This movie didn't change anything in the theater. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Most of the time we sat there in a silent silence. Every ten minutes someone will hear "This movie SUCKS!" The audience applauded enthusiastically, then stood there, dull in silence for another ten minutes.
