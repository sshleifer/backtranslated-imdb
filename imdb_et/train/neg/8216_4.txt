And maybe, as Fred Sandford said earlier, "one over the lips". It's for those who released this film to an unsuspecting public. And maybe for the person "Rue Morgue" who named it "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. Five young girls who apparently take home a short-distance home from a high school football game will get lost and stop to ask for directions in any of the small stores somewhere in the middle. Although the driver accidentally hits a parked off-road vehicle and strikes the headlamp, but the girls decide to just leave and not look for a driver. But the driver doesn't come to find them, and it's not just that his vehicle headlamps are in, it's another reason that girls don't understand yet. When the driver catches them first, he (yes, he) marks the gun and puts them down and keeps them shouting, "how much did you see?". Of course, girls are afraid of death and do not know what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> As girls' night rollers get into the SUV leader in cat and mouse games, she drives them to inflict on all girls who are extremely resistant to firearms and screwdrivers that they didn't want. Finally, they find that after they leave, there is a reason for the psychotic rage in this store. And finally, they have the opportunity to retaliate and take it as far as possible. <br /> <br /> The elements of this movie are quite annoying and frightening, but unfortunately these moments are undermining badly acting bad dialogue and the expiration of tremendous credibility. One girl has been hit by a firearm blast and it seems to be deadly wounded and she feels cold, her life goes before her eyes, but she got better? And how far can a minibus with an almost empty gas tank at 80 miles per hour? I need one of these things, probably going for a big pass. <br /> <br /> Should be over when the girls got their revenge, but the movie will continue a little after what is the climax, but they will learn at least part of what the woman put away, and the driver is still worried about it that "mother bath aging", which is obviously the least worried. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's too amateur to be good and still a little too scary and terrible to be absolutely terrible. But it takes a lot of hysteria for the cake and you want it to look at two ears. By the way, I do not necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10.
