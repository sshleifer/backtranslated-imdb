I like a lot of actors / actors in this project, so insulting the film seemed even worse than using the unknown. The main problem was the film, which was obviously just a concept designed to turn to the baby boom. For 30 years, Nbc probably made such a film in the early 90's. I see it now in a black family where kids are involved in la riot's and white family have kids rebels and listen to grunge rock music. Soundtrack is a band like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden etc. as it is the same cheesy as in the 60's and i guarantee you NBC will do it. decade is a trendy retro.
