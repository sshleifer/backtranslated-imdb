The title should have been a walker. The man spends 90% of the film's walking. He doesn't know what he wants or what he is. Go through life, stealing the identity of people. He does not get any benefit, no money, nothing pretending to be another person. <br /> <br /> No institution could understand why it pretends to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was clear about this movie is that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest was nonsense. <br /> <br /> It may be that the director is relaxed, who would like to be someone else. But what he really should do is get a real job, because after his movie he doesn't think he has the chance to make a film producer.
