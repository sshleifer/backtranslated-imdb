I don't know what this movie is, actually. It's like a student art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it's always dark except seconds a day. There is no long-term interruption of insects without cause. What a little dialogue in the film is so ugly and meaningless as pictures. Black enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she gets pregnant overnight, then lets her head off. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon, followed by a white naked woman. I'm never so disappointed with how bad and pointless the film is. Frankly, I would like someone to see that they can tell me what they think. But I wouldn't want anyone else to hell.
