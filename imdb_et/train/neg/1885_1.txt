If you are looking for a movie, a middle class life caught in a network of non-communication and false ideals is a meaningless and boring existence, that's your movie. If you also film what the film is about and keeps your interest, you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that do much better. For example, try some of the darker Bergman movies. The filmmaker found that, in order to demonstrate the middle class mental poverty, he should look at the viewer one by one, consistently dull and incident, until the film finally reaches its embarrassing and pathetic end. If you value your time, it is a much better way to spend two hours, such as cleaning a house.
