This film may have weak production values, but it is so good. Special effects are big and well done. My favorite part of the movie was to be Chrissy, played by Janelle Brady. She is very hot and she also has a good naked scene. Robert Prichard as a gang leader is fun as well as other members. Indeed, this film tries to point out that nuclear waste is bad. 4/10 Fair Comedy, Great Extract.
