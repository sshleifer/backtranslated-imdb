This movie was terrible. Throughout the film I was confused and did not see any point on it. I had to go to this site and read it to finally understand what it was. This movie is not worth it at all. Not only is it sick and disgusting, but completely STUPID! Please do not look at if you are not one of those who want to watch bad movies. If this film casts doubt on Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, it is not a state I would not like to know. It's a totally ill movie !!!!!!!! I didn't enjoy it because it didn't make sense. My boyfriend and we were sitting there waiting to see if it was horror because it was what he was listed. It was a total disappointment.
