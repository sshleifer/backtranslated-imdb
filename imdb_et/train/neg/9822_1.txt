I wanted to be dead during the movie. The only reason I was detained was that I couldn't believe how bad it really was and I thought it should get better. It was really a horror movie. I was terrible that I wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that I would never get back. The other two hours I lost in grief. Please recommend this movie to anyone you want to torture and tell them that the arrests will kill them.
