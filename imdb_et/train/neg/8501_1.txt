<br /> <br /> This movie sucks a lot of time. It reminded me of the resurrection of the movie (Christopher Lambert), which I found very boring. And "Semana Santa" is a poorer film in every sense. <br /> <br /> The only fine for this movie is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the old women in the history of European film history. I loved his manic prospect "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I don't spend more time with this movie. I say one more good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to sleep very fast ...
