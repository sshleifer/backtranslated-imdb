The "Confidential" part was intended for the popular appeal of the popular magazine of the same name, while the topic of racketeering was associated with the day-congressional investigations. Despite class A movie and some good scripting ideas, the film is about 73 minutes long. It's cheap-jack production all the way. What is needed to offset bad product values ​​is some imagination, especially the unmanaged director Sidney Salkow. For example, some photos of sunlight would have helped relieve troubled studio sets. Stylish handyman, like Anthony Mann, could have done something with a thick ear, but Salkow treats it as just another paid workout. Too bad that Brian Keith's typical low-key style doesn't work here, coming over wood and lethargy, while Elisha Cook Jr. It is clear that Salkow is not an actor director. But you have to give it to Beverly Garland with a small number who treats her role with her characteristic vitality and dedication. Too bad, he was not responsible. My advice - skip it if you are not into ridiculous girls who do nothing but throw whiskey in a typical strait in the 50's.
