They would probably have called this movie "Card" because most of the stupid movie is turned around on the map of the cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring pictures on the map. The only thing they show more than the card itself is the small sweat beads that are constantly being built on the forehead of our main game. It was, of course, a way for filmmakers to show us how incredibly tense things are going to rise at Immortal Hills. Come on, did they just show us one of the death scenes? We hear a lot about how all the people on the card fall like flies, but we don't see anything. Some of the way I die of lively mangoes to keep my attention so I was fairly generous with that rating, but I don't recommend this movie to anyone. If you don't have deep indulgence with cards or sweat, I suggest you rent a better I movie, such as spit your grave or I drink your blood.
