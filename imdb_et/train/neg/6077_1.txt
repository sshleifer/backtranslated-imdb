Would anyone really look at this if it did not contain nude children? From a kinematic point of view, this is probably one of the worst films I've ever met. Some of the kittens woke up one day and thought I was making a movie with little girls and calling it art, stick to the landscape and there was no need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they didn't live everywhere or because the p * rn movies it doesn't need anything like that. I would comment on the rest of the movie, but I haven't marked the spoiler, so I'm just saying to avoid, avoid and find the right movie to watch
