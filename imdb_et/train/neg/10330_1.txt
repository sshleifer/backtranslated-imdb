Oh, here it is finally; action "movie" without action. With a real low budget setting (don't miss a flying flying saucer a few times), we'll see a future Seattle who wants to get his childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing even remotely original or interesting plot and actor performances are just stupidly competing with an event to steal from other movies, mostly from the "Matrix" without having any money for that. Yes, we see some running walls and slow motion (45 seconds), but these scenes are about as cool as stupid hard body attempts to make jokes about men's incompetence now and then. <br /> <br /> And, yes, we also have a number of wires that run absolutely anywhere, as if the script had been cast in the past for the thoughtful scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's as bad as possible. Actually, it's not worth taking it seriously, but maybe I can't rent another and save money.
