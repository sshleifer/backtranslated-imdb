Personally, I think this exhibition is pretty cheap. Some participants are terrible. They do it and seem fake. I can always say how it ends in the first 10 minutes or less, because they make it so transparent. It's not very well written. I love to laugh at it. You know the saying, "Is it so bad that it's good?" Well, this statement applies to this exhibition. I also want to see if I'm right when I think it's all over. So far I've been quite right. It's like a little game I play. It's nice if you're bored and you are laughing.
