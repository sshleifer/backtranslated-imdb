Slowly managed, harmless comedy, which allegedly violates the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" movies, but in fact it is not better except of course in a purely technical department (good makeup effect). And any scam that is worse than its target is doomed ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost every James Bond movie). After two hours, you heard the bright sounds of aliens, you pray for peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
