A bad rip test for "Seven", with a secondary example, a terrible job, a half-burned story and a strong flat propaganda aftertaste. Yes, they're "sex offenders", they live in the neighborhood and you get rape, really. <br /> <br /> There are no surprises from Vice-Women, she always works - as convincingly as a piece of wood. Richard Gere continues to slip down and down - and is about as low as Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The singer's wife with crazy eyes is the best when she's dead in bed; and even the wolf was a sub-par (although he was the best performer of the film) - maybe they fed him before the shot, or something. <br /> <br /> Unlike the "Seven", which had (made) up, but interesting, stories that one or more countries may be involved, it seems that this film focuses only on the US obsession. If "sex offenders" do not care much - and statistics show that the lack of physical activity and poor nutrition causes more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see it or be afraid. > <br /> There are some body parts fetishes and some snus, but gore is less mediocre and fails as an artistic device (because it is meaningless) as well as gore because it's not enough. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on it.
