How did the name of the movie, which is all holy, become? It looks like it has been hit with someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl's scenario into completely new depths. They literally scream the movie in 90 minutes. And that's all they do. There is no plot, tension, signs and not much action. Just screaming and screaming. <br /> <br /> I gave up in fifteen minutes and rushed through to see if anything happened. This is not, of course, except for shouting. Enough, it brings rapid progress through another problem - no need to talk about the camera. Every picture looks like every other shot - average distance, one angle, boring, boring, DULL. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad that it's good. It's just bad.
