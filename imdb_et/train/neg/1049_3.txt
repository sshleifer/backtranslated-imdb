This movie has a very Broadway feeling - background, actor, "noise" and all that is. Some Broadway without meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow-paced, the picture is separated, the song "jumps" to you so you may be reminded that it is musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointment: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Unknown: Sinatra's groom - definitely his voice pitch and accent was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Acceptable: sir "remember numbers on your dice" <br /> <br /> Delight: Brando's little singing (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: how much Jean Simmons sees like Vivien Leigh in his Havana scenes. It's a bone structure! How would I have killed to see Miss Leigh's role in Brando's challenge again?
