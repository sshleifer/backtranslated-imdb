I was calm to watch this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is the first fan. This movie is sucked in right! It had no first charm. You could actually understand every word that the mice said, the animation is dirty, the palace is a lot different from the first movie, there are new characters that were not mentioned before and who were terrible, fortunately the prince didn't have many lines that kept him stupid. Basically, it's like the Lion King 1/2, except for the different stories that the mice say. The reason I give it out of 10 out of 10 is that the songs that the characters didn't sing were the most enjoyable.
