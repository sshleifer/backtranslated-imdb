Depending on your personal mental state, if you look at it, "Christmas Evil" may prove to be an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most miserable and disgracefully flat vacation slashers ever made. Personally, I am tempted to choose the latter because I did not bother to do some research and just assumed that in the early 1980s, the bean was dressed in costume costume. Wrong! The film actually deals with a block called Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in the garbage factory and considers it his duty to order on Christmas Eve who deserves gifts and who deserves punishment. Harry's problems started when he saw Santa? his father in costume probably? pamper your mother's naked feet gently at a young age. After that, he simply became a social challenge, a much younger brother who was forced to shut down one (holi) day. I fully understand why some fans appreciate this eccentric horror film, but was it supposed to be so boring? There are a number of superficial and seemingly endless parts in the film that do not happen. I can forgive the gore of gore and outrageous bloodshed, but this film doesn't even benefit from an unpleasant atmosphere or an unexpectedly demented plot of twists (except for the remarkable exception of the finals, I have to admit). I would also have taken this concept more seriously if the crazy protagonist focused on punishing deadly naughty children! He does not kill and kills only adults. How should you take wannabe's controversial and original Christmas thrillers seriously if Santa Claus is not even one unhappy murderer? This would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic, but now it's just an unforgettable and merciless junk.
