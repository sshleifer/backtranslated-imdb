Below is a bit of a spoiler that can destroy an unexpected and truly funny scene as a surprise to one movie. There is also information on the first movie in this series. <br /> <br /> This movie I tried on a DVD that someone gave to my roommate as a gift. It was a set with the first movie "Blind Dead". <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely much worse than the first, "La Noche del Terror Ciego". In addition, the features of the first film were significantly changed. To launch the film, it was dubbed in English (the first with subtitles), which I tend to mix. <br /> <br /> Behind the series is the concept that in the distant past the Templar knights' local branch was involved in terrible and secret rituals. When these crimes were discovered, the local peasant put the Templars to death so that their eyes could no longer be used, thus preventing them from returning from Hell to refine their revenge. Then we jump into modern times where, due to an event, Templars rise out of the dead to refine their revenge against the villagers whose ancestors first confused them. Of course, because the Undead knights are not eyes, they can find their victims when they make some noise. <br /> <br /> The temples were secret since the 12th century, coming out of the Crusades. They were only about 150 years before they were pushed down by the Pope and others in the early 1300s. As they were secret, they were always rumors about their rumors, especially in the case of initiation. Also, because the society was organized, you did not necessarily have church officials who watched things, which meant that they didn't have things inside when things got hot. And because of the nature of these trials, they were tortured for confessions. The order was the strongest in France, but it existed in Portugal and Spain where the films take place. <br /> <br /> When the first film had a virgin victim and knights were drinking blood directly from the virgin body. the breasts of the breast here are, of course, a horror film, and when the knights return to life they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; at this stage it disappears. You still have the same scene (redone, not the same frame) of those who sacrifice the virgin, but they let the blood in the bowl and drink it. So when they come back, they just hack with their swords or kill people to death, which I have to say is a much less effective tool to disrupt my audience. There is also a time problem: the first film is dating much closer to the Templars, where they now say that 500 years are the boys who burn these boys, which would be around 1473. \ t that temples lose their eyes much less interesting. At first, these crows are pulled out. Now they are simply burned and in a rather ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and maybe it was just me, but it seemed like a lot of people appeared in this movie again in the first movie. dead). It is not really a problem, because the film is completely different and not in terms of continuation, but it is strange, not less. <br /> <br /> Highlighting this movie is a rich companion who uses a child who fails to undead when he looks for Jeep. This rich man had already breastfed his father to make Jeep so he walks and tells him to find his father. It's somewhat blue, and it's a more fun movie scene. Of course, why the child does not die at this moment is behind me and frustrated by horror. <br /> <br /> I could not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad that it becomes funny, so it's just a mediocre horror movie. Most of the film has been gathered by several people in the congregation who are trying to go alone to escape the dead who surround them. When the movie ends, you won't be surprised at all; actually frustrated. If you are new to seeing a Spanish horror movie, check out the first movie with at least some innovative ideas and not the expected results.
