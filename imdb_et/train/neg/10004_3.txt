"It seems that many critics find Woody Allen's drama unattractive." And for good reasons, they are Bergman's unbearable wood and pretentious. Don't let yourself be childish: critics mostly supported Allen Bergman's claims, despite Allen's accusations being reversed. What I can't do is: why did Allen generally recognize his originality for Bergman's imitation, but modern Brian DePalma was busy ripping Hitchcock in his arrest / horror films? According to Robin Wood, this is a strange form of cultural shock. I should agree.
