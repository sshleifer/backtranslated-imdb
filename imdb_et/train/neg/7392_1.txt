I'm still in the video shop looking at the shock of how Steven Seagal still has 3 movies with Badi movies that hit the shelf in less than a year. Sci Fi genre for our ever-expanding Seagal. The entertainment of bad movies flashed before my light eyes. However, this is not one thing where entertainment is not as bad as the movie they come from. <br /> <br /> Seagal recovered a little bit of Trashy but enjoyable Shadow Man last time we saw him. But the Attack Force must be his absolute worst movie ever! Do not challenge Kill, Ticker or even Black Dawn people. Septic tank bottom here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal's form should be forced to write a 100-page essay on "Taste". <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent / I am the highest bad ass called Lawson wants to revenge his team for killing him, which leads him to a nasty plot to spread really bad drugs to an unsuspecting public. from there. <br /> <br /> The whole production from directing to actors is bad. Was this movie dark? 2. Action is terrible and very badly done. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers have also decided decisively to do what fans hate the most: throw the stunt twice twice and terribly to Steven Seagal. show little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> Although it has been said that Attack Force was not a Stevie-signed movie (originally a Harvester) and certainly it must be better than the Attack Force. -product violation has not made it more consistent and made Seagall worse. I feel badly on the pin for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal because they are rated forever for poorly recommended production results. <br /> <br /> So, Seagal is now making it impossible for him to come to an agreement on this reconciliation. bad Attack Force has proved whether we really want him to make another movie?
