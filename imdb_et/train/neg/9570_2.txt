For the first time in years I have felt the need to sign up for IMDb today to clean this movie by writing a review, because it was just such a hassle-free watch. I read it hard because I thought the mystery thriller was minimal, claustrophobic phantom forest. Unfortunately, this is an eternal, tiring love story and too many creative and dumb "non-one-says-things-this-this-out-bad-movies" dialogues as bad as it is simply tempting. <br /> <br /> Here is the quick downfall of the worst offenses in this movie: <br /> <br /> - The script relies heavily on coincidences as well as unexplained and unforgivable stupidity. the main characters that it is just ridiculous. No, in fact, it's angry. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - In this regard: Cheap thrills. Long parade "just in time". <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Alright, it seems that the scriptwriter has never experienced real people in life, but has got all his knowledge of bad movies. So his characters are dull, lifeless, second generation clich√©s. These are just plots of equipment, site owners with no personality. They are "a man and a woman who crush, who still love each other". It has never been seen before, except in 100,000 movies and it is no longer realistic or enjoyable. Think of the coolest two-dimensional Hollywood price and you have it. There are no characters in this movie that are even far from fresh, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - A far-drawn, vague resolution that undermines very badly and requires only one drag, although the word "resolution" may be wrong here because the film is a hot mess that won't go anyway. By the time you are through, you will no longer care. The last third of the movie I just passed on because it was just so intolerable to watch. Okay, that's it. Regardless of the redemption of this movie, it is all buried under incompetence. Don't look at it.
