It is not worth the video rent or time or casual effort. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. * Action was over ... bad management. * Editing was very messy ... a lot of things didn't make sense or just looked free. * Audio was poorly copied. * Music was very inappropriate. * Casting was extremely out ... must be cracked. * Zombies that speak, not to mention ... flying, dancing, working ... just peeing me. * And a bad boy ... Holy Crap! Just as he was terribly cast, he was the best look for everyone. That doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> Cover art was good but very deceptive ... as well as the DVD main menu ... a great work of art and music. <br /> <br /> DON "TODAY!
