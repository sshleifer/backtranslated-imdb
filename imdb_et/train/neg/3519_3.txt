I like some of Stallone's movies, but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a number of terrorists attacking land in the desert are ready to live for at least two days. Also throughout this desert, Stallone and the company run over bridges and ladders that provide convenient short or priming tools. Also, the Treasury police do not seem to coordinate with local rescue workers. Also, the bad guys who couldn't control the weapons with the high-tech machines. <br /> <br /> I liked John Lithgow's villain, but this character is such a complete psychopath he doesn't. â€¢ Take care of your bad sons or kill them all. Finally, I just couldn't believe this character. <br /> <br /> There is no fee to rent the price, not even worth a look at the time.
