Although the movie is always worth it, Bruce Willis is better off. I watched it on television, so I didn't have to get the money for it. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The plot is slowly developing very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are quite plausible, it will eventually become more unbelievable. It is highly questionable whether a flavored soldier like leader Waters would not hear direct orders. And even if it were the rest of her. They know that he puts them in direct danger, and they know that they will die when they follow him, but what the hell, he is our leader, let's do what he says (regardless of direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> However, this movie has some nice scenes. They record somewhat of a village where the rebels are crowding the entire population. Well, they'll save a dozen villagers or so, the rest were already killed. The strange part of it was that they picked up the trucks that the insurgents left behind. They go rather on foot. Perhaps because the roads are insecure but not explained. Anyway. I think that was what made the movie one point I gave. <br /> <br /> What made this movie brain offensive and therefore totally unbelievable is that a group of seven soldiers can kill as many rebels without being hurt or killed. It just ends, they lose some comrades. And just because they have to fight almost 500 or more armies. Do you believe it? <br /> <br /> They fight so many armies, kill hundreds of them and lose only a few of them. And they have circles and ammunition. Never run out of it. Grenades and Claymore Mines, M60 Gun and even RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Wear it or what? They even got a laptop that shows them the actions of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that lasts for days. Really? Who thinks about this mess. <br /> <br /> I think that if you turn off your brain completely and you agree that rebels are a lot of idiots, you will give this movie a high rating. If not, skip it. It saves time.
