Getting Started Good: Many times Swayze talks to Zulu about his friends or hears the language among tribes. This is a great plus, as usual in the US and UK film audiences think all the people on this planet speak English (just when you're one of them: they won't). "tenenkrommend" as we say in the Netherlands (it makes your toes sad - and not well). I like Swayze, but it's terrible. His jaw muscles work overtime and he frowning across the film. No Patrick: It seems silly and compensation for lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has chosen a style of action that does not match the style of her co-workers. His activities are so relaxed that this film could have been set in the present days. And that's not. Your frock had a clue, Alison. Clear, warm and distinctive, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: This is mwah entertainment on a rainy day. Damage. Could be better. Sack Director.
