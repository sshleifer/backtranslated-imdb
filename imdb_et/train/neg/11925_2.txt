This is a very strange movie ... I wasn't really sure what it was, some in N London you will find a child in the forest that they all believe there is some kind of oracle and somehow they do everything in their own way, change something of their life that usually ends catastrophe. The film ended in about 90 minutes, leaving me unrecognizable, almost frustrated. I don't care about any of the characters - none of them got the chance to wear the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Am I dim? It was just odd. What happens to Runner? Why does Emilio let the boy down? ... it didn't make any sense, meaningless. Does anyone help me understand the confusion of the film?
