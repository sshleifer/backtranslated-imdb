The most important requirement for any film that follows the tricks of trust is that they must at least occasionally be able to pull us over, but also their stupid characters, cops, mobs and (ideally) each other. But this movie never pulls it. Any fraud can be seen out of miles (especially biggen!) They are also not very interesting, complicated or complex. Perhaps he hoped that Mammet would compensate for this delicate dialogue and complicated psychological relationships. If so, he failed. These lines are fine, but they are presented in such a harsh, unnatural, stylized way that I thought we had a smart point that works all the time ... but it wasn't. As for the psychological complexity, the protagonist is somewhat repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudians about his father who thinks he is a whore, but he gets over it. But I liked street scenes. I looked like Edward Hopper's painting.
