Oh, if I could give this garbage with less than one star! The whole movie had two lightly fun parts and that's it! one was where the songs did not sing the song or the two songs "Don't worry, Be Happy" and the other was where Roddy fell from the toilet roll and landed with his legs and feet so everything else he grounded down, hit him groin. It's that there was nothing more fun than at least not for me! Doctornappy2 is not right, saying, "Fully dreaded" Shrek "fans can enjoy, but" Wallace & Gromid "fans will probably be frightened." As I loved Shrek 1 and 3, and I also love Wallace and Gromiti. You see what he doesn't want, that if the animation is done very well, it is definitely worth it, but it was as far away as you could. Consistency errors were too big. Some sites were listed by the creators of this site. I don't mean everyone else, but here's some more to see: when the young daughter leaves at the beginning of the movie, the catch goes down the cage door and the part of the hook that is right on the right goes around the circular button, thus ensuring that Roddy can't come out and he just does it by kicking. At one point, the ruby ​​falls behind Roddy's back and Rita pulls the ship straight into the air. In the next scene Roddy is caught again. It is impossible. Seeing how the ship was moving forward, the only place where the ruby ​​was pulled behind Roddy's shirt was the only place he could land, not Roddy's. There was a third I wanted to point out, but now I have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> Too many, for lack of a better word, jokes were repeated in one way or another. enough time to create any link with any character, the characters were hollow, low, and empty, and the whole movie continued to get you who wanted to. Color drying or grass growing is two great choices!
