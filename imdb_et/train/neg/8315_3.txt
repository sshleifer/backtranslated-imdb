What a waste of opportunity to actually make an interesting movie about a complex subject. There is very little research on what it feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a homosexual sexual environment. Dancers talk about their art as they have no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes, but they are really sex workers who play fantasies and sell private sessions that offer more than dance. The film gives the impression that they mainly turn to women who go to gay clubs, and then finally work as private dancers. Even club shots only show women in front of the stage and "dancers" play only for the audience's women. It's not just the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to live in private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really know about their gay admirers and customers? We learn very little. Instead, we get the filler. Gay activist who didn't add anything directly to dancers. A manager who talks to us about costumes in the strokes, but doesn't give an overview of the dancers' life and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Mexican images are general. The sausage assembly, which shows the roasting of sausages, is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a completely simplified film that should only be of interest to those who want to see a couple of pictures of dancing boys. The rest of the movie is offensive to gay men.
