I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought he was great on the Top model and was very happy when he won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems to be a great man. But this show made me SICK! I'm so angry at both that happened to this show. I do not care that they were of different ages, I know that age cannot fall between love. But Adrianne, you had been ONLY this last month. It didn't surprise me at all what it didn't do. And I don't see the call to force someone to marry before they're ready. If it should be, why not just JUHTI love each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? Turning the ring ring into a ball and disc was completely unnecessary, it is stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame that you broke and offered him anyway! Have you been through two unfortunate marriages, how could you rush into each other just because he worshiped? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage was rushed for all the wrong reasons. Maybe they can now breathe and find the right reasons for marriage.
