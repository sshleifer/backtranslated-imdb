During Christmas holidays, the group's college friends stay behind to help prepare the dormitories to demolish and replace apartment buildings. To make the work somewhat more difficult, the murderous, Chucks-carrying psycho drives a dormitory to halls that attack the group in various violent ways. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of the 74 video players in the 1980s, Dorm That Dripped Blood in the United Kingdom had a good reputation for this first release. The term "video unattractive" resembles some excellent images of explicit gore, violence, sex, etc. All the things the spooky fan dreams of. So, after listening to all this information, I started in Pranks (below Title) to wait for a little experience. . . and that was what he was trying to do, but he couldn't quite do it completely. Visually, the film is not great. Cinematography, gore (except for a few scenes) and general direction fail. It's not just a pleasant look. Unigigenic script is missing and often throws random things without real reason (like opening error). There are some cool death scenes, including a pretty nice face melting (which can be seen on the poster), but it's positive. The action is pretty bad, the story seems irrelevant, the killer is neither cool nor frightening, and it suffers from one big mistake that every slip of mind should always avoid: it's a bit boring. In general, some UCLA film students have $ 90,000 for the film (which would be more than double today), Dorm Dripped Blood is not a complete confusion. It has a few good things and it is quite observable. . . But if slasher tends to look for such movies as The House is Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it just can't be compared. Don't expect much, and you can at least be entertaining. I hate to say this, but this is one of the few movies I've seen to be a better remake. . . And yet, they go after great work like a black Christmas. Oh well. . . <br /> <br /> Mandatory Horrors: <br /> <br /> - Subtitle: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some brutally cool killings and gore is fine. . . but nothing special. They also checked some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: It is a bit unpleasant (me) nudity, but not very much. <br /> <br /> Cool Killer (s): Nah. The killer's final monologue (s) made him pretty fruitless. <br /> <br /> Fears / Tensions: Jump on scary or two, but nothing too effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I think yes, but I just didn't care enough and it's as obvious as the nose killer. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final decision: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
