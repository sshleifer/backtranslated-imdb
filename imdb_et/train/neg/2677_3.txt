It is a true parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, humorous cheeses, and so is the actor. But after all, it is a soft core film that is expected and unimportant, because what you really want is sex. What comes to me as the biggest problem is hardly anything. What makes you feel like you're watching TV at 3 o'clock and independent movies are playing and one that is turned on is made by some college child who doesn't go in the industry. You stayed for a very long time to wait for a real sex event, many times you think something happens, you just left hanging. However, one (or two or two parts) that is actually going somewhere is very pleasant. Personally, I cannot recommend it if you did not find it for the dollar or for two to twenty. If you marvel at a good film plot and a good example, then you don't want it. If you are looking for a good soft core lesbian movie, then you don't want it either.
