(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I should think. The DVD didn't even show time or time. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I ever saw. It is much worse. Dont understand. The plot is thrown together. All that we would see too big breasts in a drawing that doesn't support them. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be a student film. It's got a C class. <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out that it doesn't stop.) The end didn't make any sense <br /> < br /> Replayable: 0/10
