I'm a big fan of the genre of a real crime, but I couldn't sit on that fine piece. It was almost like Dahmer was meant to be an erotic until the porn band's soundtrack. There was no look at what made Dahmer out of the cross, did not investigate who his victims were. Nothing other than "See how this guy is." And I have to give filmmakers a lot of it - their Dahmer is a shameful thing on the screen.
