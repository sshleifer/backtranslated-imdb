Oh, God, I have to see it when I was only 11 or 12 years old (don't ask how) I can be young, but I wasn't stupid. Everyone can see that this is a bad film, nasty, harsh, unpleasant and very silly. I've seen more impressive effects in Disneyland, I've seen better performances in school play, and I've seen a more zoo crocodile where they don't do anything but sit in the water, ignoring children touching the glass <br /> <br /> The story is based in northern Australia. Few ambitious young people try new water sports, surf the shark in full water. It soon becomes clear that there is something more dangerous in the water. After they learn, they get a grizzly middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to respect their family's eating. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen every last crocodile movie. fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid and the worst of which is its sequel. Blood Surf should be another worst croc flick I think Primeval and Crocodile tailing tightly behind. <br /> <br /> Australia's Saltwater Crodod is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths each year. However, films such as Blood Surf destroy not only the wild image of such a creature, but one and a half hours of the viewer's life. If you really don't want to see it, avoid bleeding.
