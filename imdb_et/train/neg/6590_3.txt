The reviews I read about this movie were pretty decent, so I decided to review it. THANK YOU! This is another movie about a ghost against a group of friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts of Ring's part with Prom Night, I have to know what you did in the previous summer, and add a little white woman's dash - now mix until it's completely pointless. There's nothing new on this plot, and reviewing the clich√©s I've grown up wasn't even fun this time. This movie jumps too much into the past and past, and when I understood it, I realized that it was still not worth it. Characters are blinking in the eye to a reasonable psycho killer. Speaking of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - greedy selfish lawyer, egocentric actress, baseball star, video voyeur, bitter girl, spooky quiet chick, more beautiful than a nice girl. , a black funny cat ... and I don't care about any of them. Perhaps it would be better to make a filmmaker, there were some good scenes, but in general it was a mess. I also have to mention some "videotape" that would have been impossible to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is by no means the worst horror in Asia, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some horrible pictures in the dark or just want to laugh out loud with some of the top examples, or just want to joke that you're stupid! on the screen or just want another Asian horror to pull your sleeve up when someone asks you how much you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent piece of land are looking elsewhere.
