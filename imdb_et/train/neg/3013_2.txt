Since the Chinese factory has a long-lasting exhibition of endless lines of contractors, Manufactured Landscapes is trying to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. Its drastic narrative assumes that China and elsewhere industrial development is absolutely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. The fact that there may be a link between the modern Asian car production and wealth and the past experience of hunger and terror is not mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time trying to present Edward Burtynsky photos of industrial waste is somehow "beautiful". Much of the movie is a slide show of these pictures. They are well-produced, museum-sized and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. However, they only show me that almost every photo can be made beautiful if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship between the photographs and the oral message of the film, if any, remains unclear. I do not want to point out that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush into industry. However, the landscapes that are made offer only strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like Noam Chomsky's two-hour lecture. Perhaps this is a little value as a false example to the left of America (and Canada).
