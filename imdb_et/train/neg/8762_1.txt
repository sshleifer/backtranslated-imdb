The scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) explains how to bring the dead to life. But they come back with marble faces. In the end, it all leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> A boring, completely predictable departure from the 1940s. It frightened me when I was a kid, but I miss me now. I had to stay awake! One exception is terrible. Such expressionless boring actors! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Carradine, in spite of the script, really produces very good results. And there are a couple of mildly creepy moments associated with the grand spirit that passes through the walls. There is also one of the worst drops in cinema history. However, none of this is fun enough to sit through. Avoid.
