Note that I haven't seen this movie because I discovered it in 2007 and my city is smaller and doesn't wear it. However, I want to say something about it. In fact, I am studying the university's research by Richard Maurice Bucke, and I would like to point out that the person whose main character is based was actually completely different !!! The ideas and artistic license of Hollywood people have been given, true Dr. Bucke fully supported hysterectomies to treat women with madness, and would never have practiced anything as liberal as in the movie. I think it's ridiculous to see the various film critics who write to legitimate newspapers who say that this film has a historical basis! The only real fact I see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time in the movie, ignoring the horror that real women experience in the doctor who has now been respected by the film industry.
