Now I am the first to admit when I say something that may be godly or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for how much I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> Summarize it too. I didn't like this movie. Specifically, I didn't like the concept of this movie. Cinema was good. The mood was great. And the demonstration was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> But the story is wrong, inaccurate, and misleading. It's also offensive. <br /> <br /> I am a quarter of Cree India, and for some reason I feel offended on a personal level due to the character of Whitaker. First, he's a black man. And this is not a racist remark, I swear. White, Spaniard, or even an Indian who covers the roof on the roof, is attacking everything that Katana represents. Katana represents the soul of the samurai, sinks with the souls of her ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. For Ghost Dog to use his weapons instead of Katana, it is an insult to the blade and the inside souls, and where the hell did he get? It must be one of those copies that insult the Samurai box even further. <br /> <br /> Ghost Dog also had no honor. At the end of the film, he strikes behind the bodyguard behind the window and then murders the man, letting him face through the tap drain. Not only is it a coward how to kill an enemy, but rather a ninja way; silent assassins; a group that denies samurai, but hates the least. <br /> <br /> Then he will try to kill his boss if he finds his boss is bad. You know what a real samurai is doing when he learns that his lord has turned out to be bad or dishonest? She kills herself to prove she's dying, then down to her doggish master level. So we have a great cinematic art, a good atmosphere, and so on that includes the satiricle plot and the premise (which, unfortunately, is the most important aspect of it), making it an unsatisfactory overall film and insulting everything that the honored bushi (samurai) has. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
