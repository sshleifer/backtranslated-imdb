Horror fans (I'm talking about more than 12 though I'm under 12 years old, sorry for what you could offend): In short, if you think your imagination is disturbed by well-written, original storytelling that is unpredictable well-planted through fears and convincing performances, I can heartily recommend - avoiding these warnings - made by directors who have probably been selling for a long time. It's no coincidence that almost every episode seems like it was done in the 1980s. Not to blame on the shoulders of these old boys (or even the 80s), because where we would be without movies like Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (actually Clive, WTF you're doing I'm glad to see Romerol was a good idea because it's sure he was asked to participate ...). Maybe we should direct our finger to the creator Mick Garris, whose mandate includes the offensive and frustrating advisory transformation of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a reference to the state of the television in today. Are we starving for such a good TV fear that we praise any old sloppy scripts that nets give our kits? Unfortunately, maybe so. <br /> <br /> Normally, I don't see a comment insertion point that does not dispute the mistakes and benefits of production, but I would appreciate it easily. However, since this series is completely inadequate (maybe the only exception to setting up the topic), I write more than a warning as an overview: DO NOT ATTENTION AND MONEY. If you do not agree with me, it is more than likely that you have not seen enough decent horror. Maybe some of these directors' earlier films would be a much better starting point, but if those horrible "masters" were only judged on their works, they would never have been able to graduate with a bachelor's degree. If, of course, they did not study for a degree at S ** University.
