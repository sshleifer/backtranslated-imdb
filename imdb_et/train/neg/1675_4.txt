The plot certainly seemed interesting. How can real life make a brutal murder a truly boring film? Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out. <br /> <br /> I had heard of the Wonderland murders before the release of this film and found it to be an interesting real story about some truly sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is near-zero development, so we never understand why it's all done, or get a good feeling between the characters. The pace of the directions was very annoying. All this brings an exceptionally boring movie. <br /> <br /> Given that Dawn Schiller, a key feature of Holmes's girlfriend, was an associate producer and that Holmes's husband was a film consultant, we should have had the opportunity to gain real knowledge of the characters.
