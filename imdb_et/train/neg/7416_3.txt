A fashion designer travels with a cat and gets into the pool, hitting a floating surface on her head. With a rather cheesy effect (it was a TV movie) she swims out of her body. She swims through the tunnels of orange smoke rings and black rigid figures fall into her view (they look like dummies in her apartment). I almost thought I was watching Jess Franco's movie .... When her friends revive her, her black hand grabs her wrist and she has to work hard. When he is revived, he remembers everything and has a nasty blue elbow. <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter, he will hit an almost uncontrollable car that comes up on his sidewalk. At Halloween, she decides to go on a Mexican vacation with her boyfriend. When he gets there, he's surprised he's dead. They are irritated by another American tourist who follows them, and he almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who have had death experiences. They are all experienced tunnels, but not black figures or recurring deaths. One of them is and he is very concerned. He is also encouraged to meet psychologically. <br /> <br /> Your doctor will tell him about the people he calls "walkers" (the name of this novel is based). They are people who allegedly died for one reason that, when they have been investigated, they are dead for another reason. Just as they continued walking after death until they died again, but he blames it for keeping poor records. <br /> <br /> I was watching it in a 102-minute video and it seemed terribly long. I can't imagine being a 192 minute version! Perhaps, if it were meant to be on television for more than two or more nights, it should be better tracked than one session. <br /> <br /> I read only one of Gary Brandner's novels, Floater, and if that is her work, she is not the most original writer. Floater had a common plot: the boy was picked to kill revenge. Even the variation was quite common: the boy died and killed people a year after revenge outside the grave. And in fact, this is a common point for this film, because the boy is engaged in astral projection and when he drops he swims out of his body like here. I do not know how close to his night his novels Walkers die. I understand that Howling's films are not much like his novels. <br /> <br /> This is a rather slow movie, and special effects and cinematography are indeed (expected) low budget and prepared-TV shortcomings. There are many easily recognizable characters in it. It also seems very dated from the early 1980s to the mid-1980s. I found it boring. A much better and low-budget movie that includes similar topics that I don't think is so bad that it's the only Survivor (1983) (undoubtedly the inspiration for 2000's Final Destination movies). It blows at night.
