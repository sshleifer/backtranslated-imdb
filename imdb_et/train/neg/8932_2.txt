I have to say that I was very curious about watching this movie and it was considered a notorious catastrophe when it appeared in 1970 in the 20th century fox. It has also appeared on several lists of critics of bad films, and it only aggravated the interest, as I just had to see what made this film so bad. I see that I have my answers. Although I say it makes it curious to look at, the example, direction and script are so ridiculous that the supposed satire is completely lost. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to wear a movie, but after opening the sex switching operation, the movie goes down the hill so that it can't solve this task alone. John Huston, like Uncle Buck Loner, is definitely not helpful when he licks and sees on the screen that sometimes he sees himself doing what he's doing there. Rex Reed bounces like Myron, Myra alter ego, and even has his own marked masturbation image. Bravo for your debut! Farrah Fawcett plays a fool blonde; he seemed convincing in this role. But, of course, the most notorious role went to the west of Mae. A 75-year-old woman, whose sexual innuendos made a plastic face, seemed more suitable for a horror film. I don't want to suppress it personally; but in this movie no one comes out good. The direction seems so insecure and non-existent that the film is not only bad, but also boring. Throw old-fashioned old film material and the film becomes even more loose. Everyone who enjoyed it, everyone, and I was glad I saw it at least, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be a disaster she was always proud of from the beginning.
