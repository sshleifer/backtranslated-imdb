I read the comments on this and I don't expect private savings from Ryan to wait for a movie containing a substance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the usual history and how the unit came from being. But right now it's 1944 and you're not sure where it is. The accents etc. are very bad because this unit should be Hawaiian / Asian American, but everyone speaks of a very poor Japanese man from Harvard's English imitation. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie out of 10 out of 10 after 10 minutes I couldn't watch it anymore. The characters were one-dimensional, and although they were probably based on real people, I had no sense of them and did not leave me to care for them. A very bad direction for a very medium television ad, which is shown on some cable TV at midnight. I would avoid and take care of better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, but it deserves better narration. You feel that the director had seen the brother's band and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and see the disappearance of brothers, Tuskegee, Glory or some other movie like trumpets ...
