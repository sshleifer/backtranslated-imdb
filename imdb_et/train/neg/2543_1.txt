talk about wasting your money .. im just wondering why Michael would be a movie in a turkey where ..... Michael is a great actor especially in a movie where he plays a cancer-dying man .. it was great. when she sees herself watching the son when she grows up. Michael is such a talented actor. I watched it and thought it was really stupid. I think at one time their career they are crappy movies .. especially "The Squeeze" I don't understand that one at all, and I feel his best result was "Pacific Heights", his character pulled me out ... and I really enjoyed "diversity". it was so fun !!! and she was just perfect for "Batman" role ... and I liked "Night Shift" and I also love "Johnny Dangerously". Too bad for some of them to make fun movies. ...
