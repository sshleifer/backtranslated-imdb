Despite the dirty surveys, this flick has accumulated in New Zealand, but the leap around any production is, unfortunately, little. In addition to the clichés, some weak acts, accents and a general lack of tension push the plot. <br /> <br /> Although the big budget (NZ) is big because of its overall look, it is definitely the small town of Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Have anyone seen the brothers? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who are immediately similar will choose .... I've heard comments that scenes like boys play basketball and so on. when it is forced, but it comes over as forced ... <br /> <br /> I believe Oscar Keightley sees himself deeply ironically, but again it seems his delivery just seems vaguely self-conscious. <br /> <br /> Those who have no doubt that an American speech, culture, and deeply, hopefully, have not been permanently present in the Samoan living-NZ culture are all that exists between them at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Robbie Maggie always looks good on the screen, but it is pushed down by the script. <br /> <br /> It always rubs me wrong when "comedy" has scenes that have been created in such an obvious way you feel as if you were a good cubic cliché - just want to be a white boy ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this movi It is fun, but this person has a notorious brain and he struggles to write his name when he is offered a million dollars .... <br /> <br /> mentality, OK, but not big, fun, but not funny ..... Wake up NZ - this is not a 5-star movie, despite all the glowing (middle-class white guilt? :-)) reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? if you look at it, break it first !!!
