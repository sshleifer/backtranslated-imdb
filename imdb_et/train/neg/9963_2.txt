I love Alec Guinness. And it says a lot after that movie. In fact, he is not bad about it. He just shines aside, being a bastard and his usual delight, but investing in nada. It is obvious that the girl she fits is feathers, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen him if he was young and obviously not very happy about it. <br /> <br /> An interesting character is the strange "Suzanne", another twit. "Donald" wants to be a French Heathcliff and I was expecting a source of his secret in vain. What's the deep blind secret behind him? Did he love his father's lover? Why did he put on Suzanne's hair when he was drawing to bring the different parts of this turkey to the earth's land? Or maybe he had just had an unpleasant action. <br /> <br /> The film would have been a charming and reminiscent of Paris and Guinness' older woman. It would have been a great story! Two beautiful experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why didn't anyone find it? I recommend looking at Alec Guinness 'Map', a little known but worthy movie.
