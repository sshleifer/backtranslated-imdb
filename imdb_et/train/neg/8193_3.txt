Okay, during this past Thanksgiving holidays, we decided that the whole family was watching the movie, and as Fred majority voted, what we went and say. <br /> <br /> To start the movie, there were so many holes in the plot that it was pathetic. The simple explanations why a particular event occurred were insignificant. for example; who's trying to close the hell? Is this a corporation? A little explanation would be nice. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film gave you some tiny signs that didn't give you sympathy for those feelings or actions. For example: a little elf named Willie and the only long girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and I could care less because this film didn't care about me. Third: I think it should be a family movie? Its rating was low in PG. There were several articles in the chat room for the family film. It didn't bother me, but if I were older, I saw the problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti seemed to be extremely boring for his role, but frankly he was the only one who was worth watching the film. Vaughn had some funny moments, but he played the same character he had in the last two films. mouth frat boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he's been good in other movies) <br /> <br /> so this movie comes from 3 out of 10 stars just because someone had to try to produce, film and release this flick. I think I'd definitely give it a flick, or if you have to see it, you have to save it for renting the rainy day.
