Seriously, the fact that this exhibition is so popular is deliberately limited. This exhibition is not funny, it is not wise, it is not original, but just a steamy bunch of bullfight. Let me start with the signs. Characters are all one-dimensional sounds with loud and exaggerated voices that sound like fingers on a whiteboard. The voter could have been better. Then there is animation. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just by looking at it. Everything is too flat, too sharp, too bright and too candy. Then there is humor or lack of it. It's completely idiotic! They just take those B-class jokes that aren't even such funny, and then repeat those deaths. They also cast some nonsense potty humor that is sick to me. And finally, the last and the least, music. It's just annoying. It looks like it's made up of a child's computer and doesn't create any emotion. I wish it was less than 1, I really did. This exhibition must be seriously canceled. This is a show I try to avoid like a plague. When I hear a song song, I turn off the TV immediately. If you've never watched this example, don't do it. See high-quality programming like Simpsons or Futurama.
