Actors did a great job in performing their duties - especially mother. However, when the film progressed, I found that I was looking at it more for my actions and not because I took care of people the least. And sometimes I felt an irresponsible irresponsible and hands-on approach to parenting that appeared over and over again. The daughter is a 17-year-old low-surface coating, whose main ambition in life is to get famous men's bedding and dancing bonfires. The son is a man with low self-esteem, who looks like relationships and friends very desperate - so much that he throws a movie party late. The husband and wife are both bored, but rather seek energy in their old relationships if they look for new partners (although the woman chooses badly because the man she "complains" happens to be a gay --- OOPS!). I just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and they had trouble taking care of such low breeds. I think the author's attempt was to show the complete banality and cavity of the capitalist system. However, given that these characters are not typical of a typical Western family, it seems inconvenient.
