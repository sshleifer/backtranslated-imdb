I watched it whimper because it was available and I heard Thumb movies were funny. It wasn't. Most of the jokes were based on the "Geranium" build and in turn Kate Winslet. I think it is very pathetic for the creators of "Thumbtanic" to go so low as to make waterfalls to a reputable actor because he didn't want to be a model of perfect modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing was the line that goes something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Swim with this alternating raft that no one else can see!" Thirty seconds after amusing a 26-minute movie, it doesn't let its value be redeemed.
