If you like the sapphire soap opera, this exhibition is for you because I don't like it because it doesn't work for me and after watching 3 episodes I can't watch it anymore. It is boring and slow and to show that the timeline is based on about 100,000+ years ago, when you relied on this battlestar galactica schedule for land arrival, they seem to have all the same things as the 100,000-year-old Chevy vans falling down the streets and people, who watch the 100,000-year-old popular name brand LCD TV. It is also the same for the rest of the exhibitions, there are only a lot of things that do not come with it today, I think they could have done a lot more work to solve these problems and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same problems, but not nearly as bad. Like the rest of the exhibition's price, it's not nearly as good as BSG and it's a bad prelude to it?
