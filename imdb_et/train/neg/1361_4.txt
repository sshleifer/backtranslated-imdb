I was glad I discovered this sixties comedy that looked at some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, very young Bob Newhart and of course Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was, therefore, even more so that the discovery of the film would not work in the form of comedy or a perfect film. Ustinov plays little time out of prisoners who set up their sites for a large American company based in London. Ustinov went along with the dimwitted CEO Karl Malden and tech geek from Newhart because he's going to work as a computer worker and is planning to take part in the film's "perfect hunt". To do this, he must pass a tamper-proof security system that protects the company's mainframe. And here's the problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the movie is very trustworthy and stupid. His flat excuses are taken at face value, and it must be the only computer center where video cameras are not. Another problem is the hoax (actually a scam) that takes place in the first 30 minutes of the movie, robbing the rest of the picture, which is under much dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is sad when Ustinov's neighbor / secretary just can't continue working. I love Maggie Smith, but she just seems too much together, too, together, some called a strange, physical comic. In addition, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, maybe this is the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, which is not real romance, is still a bit scary. Ustinov wrote the script and wrote it well in the era, but I found it to be a weird, curious and sad waste of great pain.
