I took this movie for a $ 5 dollar discount book, Adam Sandler is a fantastic actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. No story at all, bad jokes, and another comedian said "F-Word" for every other word he said, the passion usually didn't bother me, but it was up. And even worse than the story was missing, parts when Sandler started talking to the camera with random parts reminded me of Dora Explorer when they turned and looked at the screen and asked you questions. And finally, if they accidentally get into the movie's bikini pictures. I don't think this movie is a waste of money
