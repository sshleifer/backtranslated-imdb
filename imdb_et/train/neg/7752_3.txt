The film is an amusement park in the amusement park where teenagers are hunting for predators. Because there are no rules, they penetrate the building and start killing. Deaths are rodents and are stupid. But at least it had a better impact than sabretooth. I gave it to three because Stacy was in it and I loved Sabretooth. I thought it was okay, but some of the deaths were off the screen. There was a stupid scene where two teenagers kissing and a sabretooth head jumped out and the boy left his girlfriend leaving him with his complete fake red inside. Then the sabretooth rises into the holes and bites that the children fall behind their heads. The final death with the owner was completely fake graphics. Even this death was stupid because the tooth of the shapes went through his mouth and hung there as it supports it and there is a scene where the Gothic girl loses her contacts and can't find them and it seems she doesn't need it. The film is idiotic and a waste of time.
