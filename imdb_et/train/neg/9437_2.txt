I've never considered a "student" for watching a movie, I look at them, form an opinion, and that's it. But Unhinged changed it all. This film is undoubtedly the worst attempt to make the film I've ever seen. Any child who tends to think of a university as being the next Spielberg or Tarantino must be handed over to this movie with a handbook called "How not to film". Not only the story, filmmakers were not even competent enough to watch the movie. It has been some time since I saw it, but all I can say is to watch the scenes in the open scenes. They never stop! It is almost like teeth pulling, not just so much fun.
