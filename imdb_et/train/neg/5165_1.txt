I was waiting for this ride and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And it's easy for me to have fun on the rolling and amusement parks. <br /> <br /> The roller-skate was just fine - and it was about 30 seconds during a 90-second ride. <br /> <br /> It was visually boring and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> He desperately tried to be similar to much better Indiana Jones and Space Mountain and Disneyland blends and failed in every respect. <br /> <br /> It wasn't exciting or exciting at least.
