They say like a real cooked u'an gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangsters, but never confuses the film with the godfather I or II or Goodfella. It's not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film periodically painful is all those Italian Americans who hug the fall of bad gangstals in even worse counterfeiting. Pacino would have been great if they just called him. I was waiting to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their stenic accents broke the fun. <br /> <br /> Well, the script is not too hot. Don Corleone would have lost it five minutes after the meeting, smiling and beating him all the time.
