Okay, I'm not going to critically criticize this movie. I note that many of the past reviews have been before me and, as I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I've been hesitant for a long time to make an unpleasant comment - and in that way, almost a year has passed. But every time I see this DVD on my shelf, I feel the inner spirit. Anyway, let elogious voices over me! But for other cinephiles like me, be careful. <br /> <br /> In terms of the simplest and the lightest, here's my position: <br /> <br /> Political instability and the fall of this film was also the backdrop of my life - through the newspapers I read in my local center -European pub. At that time, I followed the newsletters, but could never fully understand what the hell was going through. Journalists had a tendency to report either political party conditions or conservatism that worried about any group that disturbed peace or pulled the rebellion against the agency. These were the times when other peace breaks turned through Paris, Berlin, Prague and various places in the United States, all of which I clearly understood at that time, but dictatorship or not, tended to treat the Portuguese government simply as a creation - not so well-developed "evil empire. "to use sliding weightlifting conditions. <br /> <br /> So, a week after a week, I read the disturbances, but never found an intelligent editorial that could provide the history behind them or the practice of dictatorship and socio-economic impact, and so on. <br /> <br /> So when buying a movie, I had at least two hopes: finally understand the details that lead to dissatisfaction and good ideas. This movie didn't give me too. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that viewers already have enough knowledge and deep emotions about historical facts. And drama - as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - it was a trick and low. <br /> <br /> I got a copy of my DVD from France - "Selection of Official Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard. The box shows smiling cleanly shaved actors, a leader who wins the mark in a way that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. I was wondering what the French would have to think about it - although if I, as a sensitive "cinema blood" with a sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural tendency to praise this "honesty", but ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Despite the chaleuruex sur la revolution" - a warm place? Try to describe Allende's fallen and murder "warm"! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with all the uprising and civilian attacks. <br /> <br /> Second Review : Maria de Medeiros renoue 'avec son, son enfance et son histoire.' Waste, garbage, garbage at least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities all over Europe, but my love for the city and the country does not change the silent movie. A Cancao de Lisboa Ancient VHS Tapes - In the meantime, I've been left with Zone 2 above, which can also go to the trash.
