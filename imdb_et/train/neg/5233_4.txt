Pretty terrible, but traceable and fun. This is the same old story (if you have lived through the 80s). Vietnamese veterinarians fight with friends against injustice. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time is running, soldiers are going home and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait - actually a friend is dead and his father is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is being killed by a super-pointy meat provider because he tries to protect his father's small shop from a local "defensive", despite being involved in war. Desperate is the help that his father speaks to Joey's old Vietnamese unit leader Sarge when Sarge appears at the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the dirty bike gets fat and old gang saddles up for the city. You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps his men planning and how they really do what they do when they plan for the future. But Joey wouldn't have placed a wheelchair in Vietnam if the unit hadn't been around! Then when things really work in the city when they fight gangs, they do it again. For some reason at all, they completely reject their plan and try to hit the nail without all being present. Phh !!!! I'll raise my hands for nothing. Foolishness! <br /> <br /> There is also a dubious moment when all current members of the unit are trying to try the heroin they pull out of the gang to make sure it's real. Each one of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Follow, I guess. The movie cannot be viewed, but it is bothersome. There are all the weather conditions when nothing happens. The most dramatic things that happen are those that were at the beginning of the movie - explosives in Vietnam, the battle of Joey's death and the gang who brutally beat the innocent teddy bear (bad Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I think my main beef with this film is that I feel it's being shot. Even the confusing subplots with "mystery helpers" and their strange purpose were not enough at the end to rescue. But one day maybe it's all right and they'll follow it. Ha ha ha ha !!!
