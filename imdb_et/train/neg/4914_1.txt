I love a good happy love story (and I'm a boy), but when I borrowed "Love Story," I prayed that the end would be as quick and painless as possible, and contrary to Ali McGraw's character. <br /> <br /> Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and annoyed my devil in the first 15 minutes. When we learn to have been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I couldn't wonder if his death would be so damaging to Oliver, or if someone who would watch this film care. If he hadn't died, his lattice personality would probably have pushed Oliver over the edge and eventually let them divorce. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it is one of the worst of the 70s.
