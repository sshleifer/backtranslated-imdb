I've been watching horror films since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then I have seen some good horror films and bad things, but this is undoubtedly the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen. Participants did everything possible with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus, it was just all the gate. I can have a lot of blood in the stomach, but it was just ridiculous! In one scene, the sign gets on the back and prevents its intestines! Easy stupid! Another problem with this film is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end is just stupid. But then again it goes with the rest! At the end, when a girl gets away from cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old lady. The old lady is doing her way, but when she talks to the girl, she is attacked by her! He became a cannibal! Slow motion movie.
