If you can do it through the "classical Meyer" title / intro, you can change something. But would you like it? I didn't find much of my teeth digging. I think if you go with that little enuff, you will be glad (la Charlie's angels.) But for my money I would like to have a little more, more visual, more mobile. More. It seems to me that begging would congratulate @ the captain's leg. the men got the goods. but he just doesn't share.
