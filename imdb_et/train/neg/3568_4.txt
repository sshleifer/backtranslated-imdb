The truth is that the film based on the Harold Robbins novel does not win prizes. This is no exception. "Lonely Lady" is a pure B picture in budget, casting and filling. Technically it looks like a movie on television. Operation is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly horrible. Anthony Holland is embarrassing. As one reviewer said about some of Katherine Hepburn's performances, her range ranges from A to B. Ms. Zedora is able to reach G. The rest of the majority is certain (and wastes their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. Nevertheless, the whole thing can be very fun, uncomfortable. Like Robbins, all sex and nudity rotate. If you are looking for fun ... and you are not too lazy ... it may be for you.
