Someone, but no one, got a delicious landscape like divine one, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" are a great example of why. Despite playing part of it, watch her when she speaks of Raliegh, writing the lyrics for her song, which her women expect: at this point she realizes how Elizabeth was able to dominate and rule! Other times he will make the script successful. If Elizabeth is to be vulnerable, she will be both weak and harsh. It has the extra power that undermines his power: if he blows his chimney and threatens to give up justice, it's hard to take him seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn expresses charm by making us see how Essex was able to make his way into the heart of Elizabeth, but he is completely intuitive to pass on human complexity and evil. It also does not help that Essex is badly secured. Why is he who wants to drop his queen, even if he swears fidelity to him, except that he is more blue blood, so more "worth"? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth with her and Essex's eavesdropping? He has no danger of falling, and we know where Essex (and his head) is controlled. Why does he risk his head, avoiding inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do for all $ $ $ $ he gave? He doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are played at the sound stage. She should have finished the tower with Elizabeth the first time; everything else that follows (especially the last scene between him and Essex) is not necessary. Costumes are fantastic. And is it me, or does Bette look like Susan Sarandon?
