I was interested in this film because I knew it was a Christian. The director had a good idea / intent when making this film, but it could have been better. I understand why somebody should still know who is the greatest love of their life. But I did not understand why the director made his friends so unknown, average and rude. The protagonist apologized to his friends when they meant him. They were not at all understandable and used God to explain their behavior. The main character and no one else knew whether the former girlfriend had been divorced, still married, etc., but they were against him, solving the old feelings that had to be addressed. His friends had to be Christians and should have been supported, whether or not they agreed with their decision. So many times we do things in life where we do not excuse those we have hurt in the past, and when he tried it, they were all against him. The ironic part was his new female friend, who accused her of simply hiding her old friend when she made her name, address and phone number ... she seemed to be a stalker! he didn't look like a friend at all, but looked out for himself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they were supposed to be, and I feel that the film made terrible injustice, it seems that God doesn't care about true love ... but that you are with someone with whom you made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... that's all you do to change. As I said, the film had the potential, but I was tired of repeatedly repeating a one-sided sight and pushing the viewers' throat with his "good friends". This film did not correspond to the faith of Christian love, but I give it to my efforts.
