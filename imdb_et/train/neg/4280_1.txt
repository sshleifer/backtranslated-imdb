This must be accompanied by a special assessment and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's obsession with the most dirty body functions becomes a real horror here. It is also obvious that a man is a malice, he hates all - his own people, his actors, his work. And this hatred makes him blind and forgets long ago a profession that has long been known. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is just a terrifying nasty image with no artistic value or professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and reason. Shame, shame, shame!
