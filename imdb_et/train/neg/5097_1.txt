Unlike most other commentators, I hate this series deeply. <br /> <br /> It starts with interesting, mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes until the last episode. At the end of it, I still don't understand what the alien attacks were about (maybe I missed something that knows?) And realized that I had been sitting through 26 episodes that consisted mainly of the hate of the characters themselves, selfishness and self-pity. It skips the alien / robots and their dark, flashing and off scenes, where one or more characters can simply say or shout: "I hate me / you / that" 10-12 times in a row. /> <br /> I don't really see either Shinji or Asuka (the two main characters) that show growth or change. (Nor do I see any other characters who do not learn or grow). Indeed, Shinj has a sort of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry, not charitable, and Asuka is such an unpleasant ignorance that I wanted to crush the television screen every time he watched. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything and often say it often. <br /> <br /> I am otherwise a big fan of anim√© and manga and I've never liked it before. I read that the writer / writer of the series wrote this suffering under depression and I can believe it; it made me look at it. Is this the purpose of this series? I ask honestly. Is it intended to confuse the viewer and annoy me? And if depression suffers, why not just write a book or biography instead of mixing it with aliens and mecha? This plot of an alien war can, in my opinion, lead to absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this explosive plots, I can't help but know how many of them actually find good, and how many say they do it because they have been told.
