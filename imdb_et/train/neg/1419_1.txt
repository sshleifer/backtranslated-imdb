It's a terrible little movie - and unfortunately, a few people did this brief summary. The short is essentially a joke idea that was not funny and can also offend you. It certainly made me uncomfortable looking at very young children (most of them appeared about 2 years old) who started and pretended they were adults - in this case a dance-girl and a bar room. It is such humor that you may be forced to laugh at your children when they pretended to be adults, but I don't see anyone who would like to see it - especially when the very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a rather slippery outfit and works like a vamp! And then, other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations. At that time, I'm sure they didn't try to turn to the pedophiles, but when you look at it today, it comes to mind! That's why this boring film will disappear against me and I hope it will never be seen again! Pretty weird and pretty terrible.
