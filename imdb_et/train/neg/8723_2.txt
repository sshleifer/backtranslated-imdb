Very bad movie. Very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but it's definitely not worth the hunt. This bursting of the Italian jaws usually doesn't take time and the rest doesn't make sense. "Alligator" is not at all convincing and many sub-plots do not go anywhere. If it's in a local video store, you might want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth the hunt.
