Or maybe this is the case. Anyway, "The Bat People" is about as flat as a carpet, cheerful flour and as exciting as a stone ... and as intelligent as all three combined. <br /> <br /> Okay, prime it shortly (installer ship ...): The doctor (Moss) gets a bite when he is in a cave at his wife (McAndrew), and then it becomes a bat - not exactly a bat, just a bat. like a creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills its victims from the perspective of the first person's camera .... <br /> <br /> But then the sheriff (Pataki) business is a sheriff of the WORST type: harsh. She hassles with people, she writes to married women, steals cocktails from galleries (FIEND!), She smokes with one cigarette holder in her mouth and speaks at the same time, making her look and sound like Buford T. Justice "Smokey and Bandit" and (it's the worst part) ... MOST OF THE DESCRIPTION IN THE FILM! The whole movie, however, is just a crapola (guano, in this case) similar to the TV movie week. It's an AIP that shouts out loud! What did you expect, the Oscar caliber stuff? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that even MST3K can't record? <br /> <br /> How To ... No Letters "Bat People", Full Version OR MST3K Version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there is a sequel to this movie, I buried my TV.
