The big concept went wrong. Poor performance, even worse writing .... After watching the first two episodes, I wondered why it ever did for the season. Characters are forgotten, writing is poor, kits are just OK. Special effects are just sad - so much more has been done over the same period - where is the money going? The first episode starts interesting and goes down quickly - the entire prescription is just silly. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big Sci-Fi fan and geek - but this show just doesn't cut it. As I said at the beginning, I am surprised that he did this for the season - so much better is canceled after only one season (such as Jake 2.0). This exhibition was just bad.
