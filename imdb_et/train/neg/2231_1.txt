All I can say after watching Snitch, please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you have no idea what you are doing in the movies. If you ask for gangster movies, I invite you to do some research. It's comical to watch movies on absurd gangbangers that even sounds more absurd when they talk. <br /> <br /> I laughed when Mr. Cahill goes to school with only 3 students and continues to kick his butts kung fu fashion. This movie was tough than after school. Who had the idea that the hats would be worn, which would say when a particular gangbanger was? I suspect that real gangbangers don't wear a hat that claims to have a gang. It would be foolish given the new laws that prolong prison sentences when a person is bound by force. <br /> <br /> Snitch has ever made a WORST gangbanger movie.
