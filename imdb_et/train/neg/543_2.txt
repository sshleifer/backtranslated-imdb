Well Well One cant b wasting time just cause a big star-cast .. I think all I saw is a bunch of talents wasting my time on the big screen with some pathetic humor that complains I don't know who? some pathetic songs heard by who? some pathetically steep turns justified by who? to fight time? u means waste with time? OK so first you can ruin your child, then teach him a lesson we are so unaware of who said his brilliant new concept is some good other than decent good, let me comment on how people in the movie have a nice message must be given, but it could have been given by a stranger sitting next to you on the bus, if you go to such a wasteful movie to learn that Hindi movies have already proved it a lot and I don't waste my time writing waste anyway!
