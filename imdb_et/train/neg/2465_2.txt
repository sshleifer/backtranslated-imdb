It would be traceable to Hollywood if it had good editing. It is based on a typical American thriller plot - "who's just over." Action is lower than average, but because of the bright look of the best actor and detective, he is mostly responsible for the film's tension. The film was completely suffocated with blank video and audio images, and most of them look like raw film material. All in all, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a pupil's film project, it's a movie to watch. I think this movie is enough for everyone else to really undercut the tension.
