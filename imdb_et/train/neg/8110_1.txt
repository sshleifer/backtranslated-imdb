I think Phillip Kaufman reads the version of the notes of the Kundera novel and then made the film. Okay, of course, it's not a hit with the original. Kundera's novels are great because of the manipulation of the narrative concept, the ability to step in and build. This movie doesn't even try! Tereza, which is an order of dreams that is extremely important for the atmosphere of the book, has been redesigned and makes no sense. Also, and this is probably a smaller point, Daniel Day-Lewis sees a lot like Ben Stiller (I know it's not really a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the otherwise beautiful Hollywood creation.
