Strong comedy entertainment, musical interludes, creates a fast pace that leads to humorous and cooler complications in the labyrinth through a frightening pace. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong unhappy stool. The script includes all the usual mystery film props, sliding panels, secret passages, thunder and lightning, and poisonous darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre attend heavy camps and obvious melodramatics in a gas-lit era. Kay Kyser and his band offered great entertainment to people living in the 1940s who were trying to forget the horrors of World War II.
