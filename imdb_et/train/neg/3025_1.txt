this movie is really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. of all the films he has made, I am only the enemy of the state, besides, he is also the worst of all ages. what surprised me the most was Richard Kelly (Director of Donnie Darko) who did this scenario. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but participating in it gives hope that he has learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now I love Mickey Rourke's new roles, but I can't even treat it in this dreadful story and its appearance. don't get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he's got a couple of times and it's one of them. I don't know what to say about Keira's knight, I think she's a little overpriced. I just don't know him in the movies. <br /> <br /> All this movie is bad. it's ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
