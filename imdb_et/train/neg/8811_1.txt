SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> First reason: boring. Hardly anything happens, women sit and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weeds, read magazines, take care of their sick friend and cut off a dead body. Another reason: there are too many things that have not been explained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who robs random men, limits them to the chair and listens to them. Who are these men? How do they know something about the illegal activity of eaters of sick meat? Why does he kill one and let another go? what we once thought! How frustrating is it? Conclusion: I found that women were annoying, the story was uninteresting, demented annoying and non-existent. The cover is also misleading because it makes you believe that this movie is cool if it is not clear. I rented this movie on the basis of some other reviews made by people on the website, and although I respect some people who could enjoy this flick, now I'm sure I'll read more than two reviews to avoid renting another movie that I regret.
