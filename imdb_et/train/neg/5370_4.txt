Råzone is a terrible movie! It's that simple. They seem to have tried to film to show the life of the reels. Just as Zappa did many years ago. Unfortunately, there are no good young actors in Denmark. Leon is still a small girl "krummernes Jul", and Laura is not just good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie what he plays with the soul and it destroys the movie! <br /> <br /> Although I consider it a movie you should see. I do not agree that young people behave like this, but I think it can show how it can end when you let your child down. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies such as "Film Folket"! <br /> <br /> All I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great movie, but because it's about movies that deal with important topics. I also think it is important to note that there are some violent scenes in it, and in fact, in these scenes, Laura works best. - Like the end where he holds the gun!
