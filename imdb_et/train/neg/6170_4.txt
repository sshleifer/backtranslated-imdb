This movie begins very slowly, but when the action begins, it must be followed a little. I didn't understand why some events were happening, and many events happened before they were clarified, making them confusing. The only thing this really is is that it is a huge amount of blood / gore, although in most cases there are no special effects. Blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. Tearing the skin sounds like someone stepping on a stick. Again, the story is a kind of amateur feeling, as the writer did not take long to improve it. I feel that this could be a much better movie if the effects were better and the script would take more time. I wish honestly that I wouldn't have watched it, not because of gore, but because I feel I wasted 90 minutes of my life. If you like very gory movies, then it's for you, if not, then stay away.
