I recently found that Disney was Madeleine L'Engle's novel to become a TV movie and subscribed to a DVD. The book was my favorite when I was a kid and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Despite some children who are not like the novel, Murry's family is well cast, pleasant (if too beautiful) in the middle of Meg, and Charles Wallace, who is convincing as a childhood without becoming irritating. The first half hour is quite promising, doing a good job between guiding figures and setting the scene. Unfortunately, as soon as non-human characters emerge, adaptation begins and when the children leave, the whole thing breaks down. Alfre Woodward is too young and too regal because the eccentric Mr Whatsit (think instead of Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright) and Kate Nelligan's face are so disgusting and expressive that she must visit the Faye Dunaway plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason, they make a lady who looks like Glinda Oz from the wizard if she had to look like a good-looking west witch. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it will hit the worst of the impact and direction of art. I understand that this is a TV movie, but CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. The Whatsits Centaur Incarnation is a disaster, such as Chewbacca like Aunt Beast to an adult who is a velvety, elegant creature shown in this novel instead of the unpleasant Big Foot. I could go on, almost every artistic choice is a disaster, probably because there was not enough budget for this justice, but also because of the lack of imagination and good judgment in the design work. <br /> <br /> It would have really needed Spielberg to bring her early films. It is a shame that, with the current popularity of adapting the children's literary fantasy series, no one has thought of adjusting the wrinkling of the Time and its order on the big screen, giving it its worth.
