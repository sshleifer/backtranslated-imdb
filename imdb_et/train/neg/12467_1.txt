This film was slower than in Alaska in January. The person who submitted the preview should receive a prize every 30 seconds that he / she participated in the preview. I had to wake up the people I watched several times. After it was over, I felt that I woke them up. <br /> <br /> Most movies are received in the hope that something really happens, but nothing is done. Tracking people's motives was easy and the characters were flat and interactive. At the end of the movie, you hoped everyone would die. Everyone runs around either despicable, small or bad, and usually all three. Worse still, we looked at one minute or two of the extra features, just because you understand the murders and everything we saw were people who were uncomfortable about how they were socially aware. If they had spent the time in the movie they had themselves upside down, they could have seen it. <br /> <br /> I had to wait '24. I got a lecture on social awareness through sandman eyes.
