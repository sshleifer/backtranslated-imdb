Once again, the same familiar story about a man (here's a writer) who sells his soul to the devil to get the desired desire in his life: success. Unfunny script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand "strong" "Christmanish" message (our only endeavor in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and a very long trial scene at the end where agent Hopkins He won the damn (Jennifer Love Hewitt is neither sexy nor evil at all) for all the bad things he did with this improbable character. The bad efforts of the actors (Baldwin also played as director, Cattrall "Sex and the City" again, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Try not so much a popular movie from Greece, called "Alloimono stous neous", the brilliant customization of this myth (the old man gives his soul to the devil to get his youth back)
