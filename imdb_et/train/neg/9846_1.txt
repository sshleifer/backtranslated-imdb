You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears there. That would be a mistake. This is one of the films ever made. I was waiting for something funny, but there is nothing funny about this movie. Even the film industry admitted that it was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it. It's a miracle that it was ever put on video. <br /> <br /> I don't know what kind of contract the sellers had on this film. I don't know why people in charge of this movie were allowed to continue making other bad movies. Surely this film is a waste of money used to create this money and a waste of time for everyone. There are certainly high school students who can write / produce a movie.
