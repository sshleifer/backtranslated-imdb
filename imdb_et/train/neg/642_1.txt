First, if you're a comic fan, you're very disappointed! Low budget movie !!! Largo should be a comic in Serbian, now he's getting Croatian, pfff! chicken producers, it gave the comic spice and gut (by the way, his father speaks Serbian and speaks Croatian ... Lol). Striking N.Y. The winch becomes H.K. A good looking Largo turns into an unshaved man from Tzig / Turkey. Freddy's cool "scarface" pilot gets fat, shape, sad, average man. Simon, a good friend of Largo, doesn't exist at all? He gave some peppers! Largo does not throw knives at all, but only a few snake looks ... The whole story is confused and looks like a fictional TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the ability or the technology to adjust the comic correctly, stay with some of the conquered Parisians. A very bad movie, a good thing I just rented, don't expect me to look at the sequel (if it exists!).
