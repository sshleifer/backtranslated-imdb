Nothing can prepare you for another evil bimbo trip! This time it will ever bring you inevitable Fred I am Ray! As for the use of movies, it doesn't click! Like science fiction, it's common! All we see is an ugly feminine android with bikini to destroy the Earth and show everything that is almost resistance! Give me a break !!! If such entertainment is yours, why not dust them in the attic of the old SI swimsuit to change the attic?! It would have been much better if he did not set the salmon factor very high, but it would still not be great. I would like to draw attention to Jim Wynorsk's second film "ASSAULT" (1996), which is similar to the identity of ALIENATOR. This illustrates why top-quality first-person "femme fatale" films cannot translate well in America. Sorry!
