I give this movie 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this movie was terrible. It worked very badly, the story was poorly written, the action was incredible. I also doubt that the Salvation Army could fight so little when the troops made it. I don't even write any plot spoilers because the film is not enough for the plot spoilers. Writing comments on the plot would be pointless. When I compare this movie, I have to compare it to Reign of Fire, but even though I didn't like Reign of Fire, it was at least that movie better. <br /> <br /> Some people in the theater left to the left before halfway through the movie. The only reason I didn't do that was because I just didn't think so. I was hoping for a CGI party and the fight was masterfully done, but it didn't happen. Martial arts lasted all 30 seconds and it was very disappointing in the practice routine that was done in the setback. Nor did CGI work well. One scene comes to mind. During the battles of one of the previous tanks, the troops will shoot ...... nothing. Someone forgot that the animated films praised this movie, so there were absolutely bad guys on the street. I also think that the bad boy's voice was dubbed on Imotep's voice on The Mummy. Would it be the same disappears that it happens. (Someone owes some of the royalties here?) Since I mentioned the fighting phase, I say what can be considered a spoiler, but only the purists I think. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, don't buy a DVD when it comes out. You have been warned.
