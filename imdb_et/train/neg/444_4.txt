(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> Rosenstraße is a film about heroic women during the German Nazis. But it's too long, it doesn't touch, and sometimes even boring! Too many clichés are not good enough. <br /> <br /> Storyline is bad. Like James Cameron's Titanic, the old woman remembers his life events. Good, now we have a position. If there is another woman who does the same. It is confusing that they both resemble the events of other people's lives! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of basic reading ... How can Riemann know about the fate of a little girl's mother and her questioning, for example? <br /> <br /> Scenes are displayed in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, a scene where Riemann proposes to Fabian. When did it happen? The scene looks like it's set in the twenties ... <br /> <br /> Riemann is of course a talented pianist, well, she's even a baroness! Wow. His brother comes back from the eastern front, he has got the "Ritterkreuz", which he shows in some scenes. So he is a hero of war and still a good man who maintained his conscience. And he learned about the massacres committed by the Germans. He even made some photos! And so the cliché goes after applying the cliché and that's why the movie doesn't work. <br /> <br /> In principle, von Trotta chick flick out of something that could have been a decent film. And finally, it's all very simple. Riemann finds how Goebbels bed and - da da! - Everything is free. What is not a historical fact, but a pure imagination, despite the “true story” requirement at first. Like "Sass", it is gently justified for a real event. <br /> <br /> It's sad, but true, it's a typical German movie today. This is bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
