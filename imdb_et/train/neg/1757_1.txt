Don't do me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was one man who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics, it was Dan. The story of Dan Jansen is truly incredible! Especially when you watch this movie through the eyes of an athlete, it's all wrong how Matt Keeslar and other actors play, their techniques, the dimensions of a speed-shaped oval, it's wrong! Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
