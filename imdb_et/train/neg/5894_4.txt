How many centuries have passed until Japanese / Asian horror films give up the long-haired ghost? Of course, they have managed to cut the "Ring" million times, and often it worked well - it just shows that originality is not so much a requirement in the horror genre (or am I very critical and just pleasant?). But this time I found myself a little uneasy, somewhat boring. It's not a bad film, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should, its absurd 110-minute length. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, the open method of coordination has no atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the end is confusing: it doesn't make sense at all. As for the ringtone: Miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than this forgotten little thing. Even if it was played a dozen times, it doesn't even remember - it was so scary. Speaking of Miike, this is something of a commercial business, so if anyone thinks they can get a "Bijita Q" or "Audition" type of perversion, they waste their time.
