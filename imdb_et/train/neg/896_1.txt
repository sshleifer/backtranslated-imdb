This movie is terrible. Not insulting, but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60s. Father, head of school, is going through an average life crisis. Enter a real teacher from a big city who will start thinking about their pupils' thoughts with some thoughtful things, such as thinking about yourself. The principal disagrees with his teaching, but he is beautiful. Points can be combined. Her teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is full of small town lifestyle and wants to live. He gets some bad advice, hangs on some bad guys and probably wasn't taught family planning at his school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked on television, this film plays as an adult version of a post-school special or very special episode, one of the most prominent sitcoms.
