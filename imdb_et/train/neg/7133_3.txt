I felt like I was looking fast and mad, but with different actors and a little bit different. I say the cars in the movie are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, you will probably find this movie lightly. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from our days of life. He's a really good singer, but it's too bad that he gave him such bad songs in such a movie. I mean car songs; not exactly what you would be on the radio here. Because it is a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a little bit, but in real life I don't think that any average river would be such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin, who can drive a car, car engine, and be a singer. It's just all silly. <br /> <br /> Another side note, anyone wishing to bet 25 million for driving, is walnut. But it was fun when Natasha stopped just before the finish line and screwed Michael over. Priceless. <br /> <br /> END VERDIKT: This movie is for car freaks. So, if you like a fast car, I would recommend it.
