Despite the rich product numbers and wonderful costumes, it's a movie. The plot of a murder mystery is just a means of validating musical numbers, but often it brings the process to an amazing stop, but not very engaging. Although a lot of money has been spent on them, the numbers are poorly staged and poorly photographed. This is probably a pre-code film because girls often wear very little clothes and even have a song that sings marijuana praise! The performances are all in one note, although it is nice to see Carl Brisson's musical music, but if Victor McLaglen, as a police lieutenant, is struggling to hunt for clues, you might want to throw the towel or the fastest move to the next number. Damage patrons who were detained for his release!
