symbols are hanging deeper. You've seen all the other movies I promise. the script tries to be nervous and unpleasant but fails. in some couples it throws a superb comedy, but the jokes are out of the left, completely forced and almost completely lost when they are cracked. hot chick is old and has no personality, she is just some thirty blonde chick with a couple of smart ass that is not underwear and wearing jokes less than love. The exchange of Molly (hot chick) and Kirk (dorky love interest) has hardly been communicated. Attractiveness is not where it is a completely platonic relationship until you get an uncomfortable and predictable belt kiss. it is in their relationship and just incredibly flat. The main focus of this film is not on the relationship, but on the failed attempt to make a surprising super-bad movie with a semi-decorating plot. I could compare it with a ghost, forcibly. I can't get into that. I could go on, but it's just pointless. just don't pay for watching this movie.
