Life did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait until it ended. The plot was pointless. Action was terrible! Especially teens. The story has been played a thousand times! Do we just want to give the participants a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. If for some time a good movie lives, it's not one of them. If we have nothing else to do, I would be inevitable to avoid it at all costs. It was my life for two hours. Can I get them back? I'd rather have taken my face for two hours on a brick wall, then soaked with peroxide. It would have been more fun.
