I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to destroy one of the best TV shows. Did we really need a big screen again? Did they ask the fans? I don't know how all the fans would feel when they made the Rocky Horror Picture Show remake with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, took all the music and made this drama. Do you think they would like it! This film does not have the same feeling as the original. Of course, the original time was somewhat horny, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always in trouble and their main purpose was to help people who passed through the city. None of the people who liked the film may have ever seen the original exhibition. My big question is what are they going to be next next?
