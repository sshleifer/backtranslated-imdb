I have this movie. Not by choice. I was really bored the other day and the box was interesting to me. So I jumped into this old videotape and spent the next hour and a half crying about "why God why?". The story was not as bad as the player I appreciated. I think maybe if you are a super-geeky in romantic scenes, you'll enjoy this movie. "I've always thought of Vulcan whom you know as Dr.Spock ... can't love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, it's really terrible. But if you're really a badly made movie, that's for you !!! But the real story is much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> If I had to put this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
