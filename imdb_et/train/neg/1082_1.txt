I think I've seen all Grisham's movies now and in general they are all very poor except Rainmaker, but it's so bad that it's incredible <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILER <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where a character makes a foolish irrational thing that no one ever does. He is a lawyer for Christ. Why, when his children disappear, he doesn't call the police. Oh yes, it is because all the police hate lawyers so they just ignore him and let him attack. <br /> <br /> When he was arrested for murder, he just let him go free, he would be locked in the cell until he was banned. <br /> <br /> Why would you drag your children halfway across the country if you could easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> Police don't worry about finding a escaped mental patient, they won't bother to interview their daughter. <br /> <br /> What is a ridiculous end? <br /> <br /> All in all foolish, very unrealistic and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10? One of the worst movies.
