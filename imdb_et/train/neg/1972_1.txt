It really doesn't do blues justice. It starts with bad pictures taken from a voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone in the dark) that probably speaks of space (?) And tells us about the life stories of different blues musicians. Corny, as it is, can be the most interesting part of this documentary visually. Later, the only thing to see is the incompetent classical stories filmed with fake 20's black-and-white spaces with Beck and Shemekia Copeland. This is a good device to show us why the old Blues victims were really so big, but it doesn't provide any compelling views. There is hardly anything that could justify turning it into a movie, not a radio game. No one should force them to see badly done renaissations. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese, and especially for Blues. Avoid at all costs.
