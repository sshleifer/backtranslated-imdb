No word can describe my hate for the terrible transfer of the BTK killer. Rate this movie from the ten compliments that this truly catastrophic apology to the film. There was no highlighting from start to finish. The whole thing was terribly put together; script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just naming a name. Several scenes are literally ridiculous because the whole thing is put together cruelly. This review may seem like an unfair and dirty attack on a low budget movie, but that's not the case. Just thinking about the movie I just saw, my blood is going to boil. How ever this movie was granted production rights, I never know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend the CCC, because it is truly challenging, as pathetic and worrying as terrible. I can honestly say it is WORST in all my film years. FILM. EVER. I wasted more than one hour of my life on this useless rubbish and would have happily jumped from the nearest building before I knew what I was. Out of TEN.
