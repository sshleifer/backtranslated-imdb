Dreck about three beautiful women in California who go cover some festival (or something). All hotels have been booked so they have to stay in a cozy old house. They don't know there's a horrible resident who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawn. Bored, pointless, totally stupid "horror" movie. Bach and his two friends are definitely beautiful, but the film itself is boring. Bach and his friends are not actors - their faces are empty. The final "revelation" is ridiculously predictable and there is no blood or gore to keep you on track. There are some awaiting free woman nudity, but that's not enough. Bored, pointless and unknown (good reason). 1 all the way.
