The film talks about Sir Christopher Strong (MEP - Colin Clive) and his relationship with Amelia Earhart in a similar manner to Katherine Hepburn. Until he had met, he had been a very dedicated husband, but when he met strange but exciting Hepburn, he couldn't "help himself" and they fell in love. You can say, because they look at a lot of space and talk about how painful their unfortunate love is. Frankly, this is a very terrible and practically impossible film. The problem is that on pre-code days, movies filming adultery were very common. In addition, even if you agree with this morally suspected subject, the complete fate of the dialogue will make it a novel of the 19th century novel ... and really bad. Sticky and hard-working characters (after all, a nice lady at Clive's husband and didn't hurt anyone) makes it a waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this movie is the costume that Hepburn wears in an early scene, dressed in a moth costume! You must believe it - and it looks like one of the Bugaloos (hidden but appropriate reference).
