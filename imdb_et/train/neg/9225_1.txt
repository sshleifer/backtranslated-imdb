CQ could have been good, fun. But it makes the only unforgivable sin: it is b-o-r-i-n-g! The speed is deadly and the plot is rather confused and so artificial that, wherever it goes, it is impossible. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader, but this video should have been worn on the warning label: "CAUTION: Student film. Suitable for filmmaker relatives only."
