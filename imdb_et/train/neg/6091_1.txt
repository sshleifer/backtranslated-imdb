I bought this movie with an exciting prize, top, fun blood flow. I have none of them. This film is not practically every level, no less frightening or funny, it's just a terrible film making and doesn't give the audience anything worth seeing. It is so bad that it is almost as raw, violent and brutal as it had promised to have little violence at all. Almost no blood and no excitement. Action, direction and dialogue are totally intolerable. Honestly, it's really ridiculous. I was not able to sit all this garbage once; I never want to look at it again. Don't waste your time on such cellulose waste; this is probably the worst film. If I could get this minus, I would.
