I grew up looking at the original Disney Cinderella and I've always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn. <br /> <br /> That's why I was glad Cinderella 2 came on TV and I would have seen it. <br /> <br /> I should have felt better. <br /> <br /> This movie merges with a movie star that should have been left alone. It has absolutely no original super charm! It seems to me quite harsh and almost brutal, exactly from the (no) Sing-a-longs characterization. the soundtrack of this movie was overcrowded and didn't seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a man is a great example: where he walked while eating an apple and added a few smiles here, he would have to dance and sing how big it was! And the dance hall has old dance music. That is how writers would have forgotten where and when this story was placed. Amazing bugs certainly didn't fit. <br /> <br /> Even Cinderella 2's artwork and animation is not scratch-off. The creation of this film seems rather raw and less detailed. And we'll see a part of the Cinderella's hard skirt that's not right. <br /> <br /> The film itself could have been a story, I think it should have been that. I wouldn't say I hate it, but I believe it had many drawbacks. It seems to greatly lower the beloved Cinderella's original.
