Normally, I have no problem with a movie or story that ends up giving you some idea of ​​what really happened if it is practical ... <br /> <br /> But this movie feels like they all got but last In 15 minutes, I realized that they had finished $ 5 ... <br /> <br /> I saw it in TBS ... I suggest you spend that money. When you catch the TV, look at everyone, but not within the last 15 minutes, then walk and finish your mind. <br /> <br /> Really, it would have been better if they had just gone away, and just come back to the Feds countryside just to find that the city and the car graveyard were gone, and never been there at all performances. .. <br /> <br /> "I want to have more thumbs so I can give this movie 4 thumbs!"
