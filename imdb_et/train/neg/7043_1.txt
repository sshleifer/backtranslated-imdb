I was ready to laugh at this movie like the Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. Manufacturers seemed to have many friends of cycling friends and from there he decided to make a film by chance. <br /> <br /> It's often invisible. A lot of material from cyclists running on the ground, playing the same music repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is hardly in the movie. Harmon would probably have revived. Maybe he had other responsibilities on the day he was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, terrorists are cyclists in a small town. Fighting, murders, cowards, silly mechanic, etc. One of the cyclists always wear a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all other laws. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. In one scene, a woman who attacks a woman, screams in the form of a woman, "You're all the same! You're all the same!". We'll come back to the scene in a few minutes, and he says again: "You're all the same!" The writer could not say anything more creative to say? <br /> <br /> Finally, the good guys have killed the bad guys. We also learn that the wedding between the medieval mechanic Joe and the young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college and we suddenly learn that Joe's wedding is still (but a different bride). End.
