I jumped into the opportunity to watch this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering peace and cures. But wherever it seemed to be truly scary, it rose and went elsewhere. Collecting water throughout the house, black rain, prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn under the raw sewage fell before they could scream. <br /> <br /> With disappointment. The face of Chamberlain's almost expression-free face offered little, but confusing, belief that I reflected when the film wore. What could have been a fear The singing of the Aborigines and the instruments in the background were rather cacophony, which seemed to be a beating terror. The ideas that modern people can embody the ancient gods that the Aboriginal peoples believe that red hair is the first priest, and many other options go further than the shopping list as a hint to another dimension (dream time). br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the last scene, it was not clear to me what the director was doing. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? Tsunami? Yes, okay. It is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is this the end of the world? Wave? The Last Wave? It should be a pretty tough wave. Why? Was the world a bad place? It didn't seem so terrible in this movie. In fact, I didn't think the wave came out because the shadow left Burton's face that the wave was cast. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Heck, this happens every day to people who lose it. It wasn't interesting if it was just her. <br /> <br /> The most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential was Charlie's apartment, where Burton is an old man to frighten Burton's wife. Charlie asks him, "Who are you?" and it will become really annoying after some time. Unfortunately, the film never followed suit.
