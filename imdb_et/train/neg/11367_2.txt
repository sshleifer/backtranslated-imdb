Greg Davis and Bryan Daly take somewhat terrible statements from terrorists, some commenting on uber-better reagents, the most extreme positions of the planet's most fundamental Muslims, all who call themselves Muslims, and present it in Islamic theology. Perhaps their next film interview is with Fred Phelps and the Church of the Baptist Church of Westboro, commenting on some atheist scientists and calling their film "What the World Needs Knowledge of Christianity." Finally, this film suffers from poor production values ​​and a lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism: don't waste your time and money, just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a few days for free and get the same level of intellectual analysis of the same message.
