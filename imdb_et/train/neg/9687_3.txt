This is an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women has been demonstrated by the worsening number of men and women who can only be described as a set of couples and discomfort. <br /> <br /> Greenaway recognizes her inspiration for Fellini's movie "8 1/2", but given that Fellini is the world's cinema titanium, Greenaway does not. <br /> <br /> He has no maestro touch and no ability to pass on feelings and emotions with a lack of clarity. <br /> <br /> He is pretentious, the movie is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each, as the viewer has to follow the film, except that the written messages remain on the screen for a few seconds, not long enough for the audience to read and therefore mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> For women, only two can be described as spectators, Palmira, played by Polly Walker, and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest seem normal. Both women and men retreat from the harsh light of reality in dim light of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Greenaway apparently wants to point out that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women themselves are frustrating because they provide their services in exchange for money. Relations between men and women are destroyed as commercial transactions. <br /> <br /> The film has no joy or happiness or a sense of love, indeed there are several scenes that are very unpleasant: <br /> <br /> Suggestion of incest between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental Relationships, John Standing and Matthew Delamere, respectively. The negligent neglect of both men that Giaconda carries his baby, then gets pregnant twice, the first breaks off the fetus and the second time he is sent to a destination that men choose from airfare. Both men have sex with a woman who has no legs (headed by a woman). Beryl, Amanda Plummer, Hortense beast. Father and son share women with them. Women who are sexually beaten. Father who sleeps with his dead woman's body. <br /> <br /> Lovely, none of these scenes are sexually shown, but hints. <br /> <br /> The hated deterioration of women is such that it is no wonder that the film was first launched in Cannes. Particularly extraordinary is that the film's actors have protected it by showing once again that there is no limit to the naivety of women, and that women are fooled by men. <br /> <br /> The style of Greenaway's director is pretentious, it is a style-competent content, an image of a film as an art, accompanied by the rejection of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenaway is trying to achieve a sublimation of surrealism, but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships.
