An empty check is a movie I saw on television one day and like most of the movies they checked on the television, it wasn't so good. First of all, no one I have ever seen has seen a blank check and it involves people who grew up in the 1990s. Also, in the 00's, no blank check just remembers that pixel films overshadow it. I don't call a bad movie for a blank check, but it's not really fun either. (Or at least it's not for anyone over the age of 6) Blank control is not an entertaining film because nothing is original about it. Everything just makes you "what have I never seen before?" Blank Check Rips Out and tries to cash in from just Richie Rich to Home Alone (what strange is Macaulay Culkin in it) Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it is worth blurring.
