OK, the movie is fine, but I give it 1, because the idea that a computer virus becomes an organic virus is a pure fairy tale. This kind of crap simply adds to the paranoid mind of these computerless murders that a computer virus is just like an organic virus. First of all, the code virus and tens 1 and 0 are added to the computer virus. The organic virus is much more complex, although it is so dense. Although it is considered to be one of the simplest forms of the universe, organic virus cells add to their cells and attach themselves to RNA, then change their RNA code. Explain to me how something could be processed from the monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea, which makes your eyes into these viruses? I saw it, but probably the writer didn't think about it.
