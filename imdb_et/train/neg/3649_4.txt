This is a fair little exhibition of paranormal, though it seems that Art Bell and his delusions have been thinking about outlining Carl Kolchak's career. Of course, X-Files would probably not exist if this show hadn't been so well prepared for the audience. Darren McGavin is not exactly a super-heroic type, but he is a credible (enough) man to do heroic acts. See her work on some of their old Alfred Hitchcock presentations. Here's her main attraction, she doesn't seem to be a girl or a woman who is annoying. In fact, there is not much sexual appeal for the exhibition. Something I know is that the stamp is not typically typical. There is a lot of humor in this show. Sometimes it's just a surprise. The exhibition's thread stretches to the current MAD MEN exhibition. Not that David Chase writes about Mad Meni, but the people who worked in his Soprano have certainly emulated and inherited his serial comic.
