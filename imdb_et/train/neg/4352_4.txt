When you've seen friends, writing seems very familiar. In particular, the last 3 or 4 seasons of your friends share the same comedy settings. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is related to a group of people whose relationship is that they share the same class when they were still quite young (about 10 years). I think). They are now in their mid-twenties and are meeting again at the class meeting. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with multiple stories at once. Usually they are not connected in any way. Each story is cut into several parts, which are then shown in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> Drawings are where my problems lie in this series. As in the later seasons of friends, it is often a rather stupid place to hardly believe situations. One of the main characters is doing something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is then greatly exaggerated, as if it was not stupid enough. If you're in such a face with humor, maybe you like this series. For me this is a big shutdown. <br /> <br /> The reason I looked at a friend is due to the first seasons. There is an interesting and particularly reliable story that has some romance that makes you grab characters. There is no such class. The characters are just too forced and the stereotypes are pushed too far. It is therefore not possible to communicate with them and enjoy them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it took several seasons before the end of the steam, and the characteristic features were milking out. But in the class, it seems that it has gone out of steam before it even started.
