Unrealistic "movie", what were these people? Combined French upstairs on the ground floor, mating horses, porn (not recommended, pretty full for the movie) and goodness a bit of Benny Hill's music and pursuing scenes that sound crazy and even more to watch. ** spoiler ** It turns a little bit nice, .... then Lamb makes a runner, encouraging the woman to leave the dress after that, she goes to the forest where she has been detained in a set "penis" associated with a man's bear / rat mind from suit, I think that if its obvious is "penis" responsible and goes too much on screen time, ejaculating most of it, in short, it turns out that he liked a little bear / rat looter and that is, the rest is cushioning. ** At the end of the spoiler ** The film made for the shock and attack that is said to be any publicity is a good public, I think the waste of time is really, but the "main event" needs to be considered credibly, hard to imagine that anyone thought that it was a good idea when they filmed.
