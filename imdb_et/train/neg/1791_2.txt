What are the early twilight videos and randomly throughout the movie? It's like someone who put muddy water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity can be deactivated by some people, but what, with mostly bad deeds, is what makes a good cult film. /> <br /> My favorite line is Tarquin's vampire, "Unfortunately your breed is stupid." Okay, nobody should ever say that the movie line is "unfortunately" if they are not English and live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> Van Helsinki's character and the bad girl's "Rally" are not bad. I also liked Master Little, played by Ron Little. Wicked martial arts! Don't take it too seriously and enjoy it.
