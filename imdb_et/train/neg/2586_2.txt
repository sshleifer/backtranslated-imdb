Cut Chase: This movie is soft pornography that is marketed under the masses under the name of the studio milking for every last penis of the American Pie. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole plot (and it shouldn't mean there's much to go around) is a vehicle that shows the audience more breasts and sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tween boy and you're too crazy to buy real pornography, it's a movie for you. Otherwise, the movie doesn't have much to offer. <br /> <br /> Actress is sub-par, character development is practically non-existent, and the story is absurd nudity, excessive drinking and worship (none of which is particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go for real porn if it is what you want to see, and if not, watch a good movie. Animal House, Kids or even the original American Pie are all great cinematic works that all contain heavy alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not how you use it"
