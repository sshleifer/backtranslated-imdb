This movie is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel completely prepared. One thing people have forgotten is that the reason why the original won such recognition was strictly linked to the fact that it had to make you feel imperfect. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the laundry room. I'm not a negative type, but the man who works on this flick is .... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life, and I am sorry that I have had two hours and a waste of money on this flick. I still love the original and I will do my best to let this film out of my opinion.
