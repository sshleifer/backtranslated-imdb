Okay, it's stupid, they say they don't make another Nightmare movie, that's the "last" one ... And what do they do? They continue one more, not that the next (part7) was BAD, but why they play us. Anyway, this movie doesn't make any sense what ever it was extreme boring, the characters were very one-dimensional, Freddy was another joke that is so stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad and it is even worse than part 2 and 5. I didn't get the movie, its stupid story 3, meaningless! Id say. I hated this movie so much that I still rmember all the parts I didn't like, which was basically the whole movie. It is as different as the predecessors, it is trying and trying, but it tried the hardest and got the face. Let there be deaths, though they were different, they marveled at bigtime. How have they gone so far? Didn't they see they made the biggest mistakes in Parts 2 and 5? But do they do that? /> I CAN GET ELM-STREET-SIX (6) out of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> MOVIE GOOD POINTS: There was a potential for the plot. <br /> <br /> INJURY POINTS: Dreadful / Lack of Deaths / Too Funny to Categorize as Dread / Very Confused.
