I've always been interested in Bigfoot, so when I was browsing for a rent, I was looking for it. It was WORST $ 4.50, what I've ever spent and want my money back! Please don't waste your money on it! It was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so incredibly boring and I found myself rolling in my eyes and I didn't even see it through. I just went into it. The operation was terrible, the effect was terrible, everything was just very bad and tasteless. It all led to a really bad, boring movie and a waste of time and money. I hope that one day they will make Sasquatch a good movie, but so far I have to sit through countless cheap duds like finding a real masterpiece.
