I discovered this movie from IFC and I thought it would be interesting. In the case of "small" love stories, some of these stories really pulled in this movie. The fact that none of these women had names makes you almost suspect that the actors are talking about their actual sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit that I want to see more romantic views of the first sexual encounters like "Strike! (1998)" when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances started asking her for the first time, and Tweety said, "Was it beautiful?" <br /> <br /> Some may think that filming and setbacks will improve this movie. I think it would make things worse. It doesn't have to be hardcore porn to pay attention to, but I waited for more.
