How did you manage to attract such a terrible script? It's ridiculous, predictable, and incredibly incredible, it's well-functioning and slippery, but the material is so bad that it's still one of the slowest thrillers I've seen for years. Amazingly bad and not fun. Avoid at all costs, even if you are cast.
