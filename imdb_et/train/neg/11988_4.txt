I came out of this movie, feeling it could have been so much better. Instead of being a thrilling and tense story of a boy's fight for joy in the desert, it comes out as a National Geographic documentary that matches Columbia's sportswear. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) to prepare for a flight to see his father. Her mother gives her a random selection of hatchet as a gift for leaving (what's wrong with the Rubik's Cube?), Little knowing how badly she would need it soon. In the air, a pilot (Ned Beatty red-and-miss-him came) is carrying a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless when the plane falls into the lake. Particularly happy that virtually failed to walk (or rather swim), Brian must find shelter, food and hope for salvation. <br /> <br /> This is where the main film problem begins. Because of the nature of Brian's loneliness, Jared has very few lines so the film should have compensated for the tension in each scene. Instead, it is shown that he is walking around, sitting and so forth, but with little danger. As a result, too much reliance is placed on parents' worrying marriage as a source of tension. These scenes just get on the road and don't add much to the story. Even worse, sometimes Jared? his face covered with mud - casts a primary scream or two that binds the unhappy parade to the "Predator". Regrettably, we could have done that he would have saved his mullet from seeing, but he probably helped keep him warm at night. <br /> <br /> Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin, which is completely ineffective. He and his father have very little influence in the film. For example, we have never shown how they react to news of Brian's disappearance, how they can organize rescue efforts, and so on. This is just one source of tension that filmmakers would have studied well, rather than spending so much time on events that took place before Brian started his journey.
