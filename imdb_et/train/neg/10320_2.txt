I was really hoping it would be a funny show, considering all the leaps and clever preview clips. And talking about hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the BBC World Today show, which is broadcast all over the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this exhibition is not coming. All the jokes are obvious - what kind of funny when you hear them for the first time, but after that it seems flat - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. All characters are one-dimensional. Action is - mediocre (I'm nice). This is the classic CBC recipe - what always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, I think you should be stupid to believe in some white characters and if you are white, you should probably offend somewhat of the fact that almost all white characters are depicted as either grand, ignorant, or both. Not that white people have problems - most of the better comedies are rooted in it. It's just a problem if it's not funny - like it's at the show. <br /> <br /> Canada is bursting with funny people - so much that we regularly export them to Hollywood. So, how did the producers of this exhibition not find it?
