This mess is like drying the color. I'm so disappointed that I was so eager to see it. <br /> <br /> This film simply has no meaning. If it has never been done, no one will notice or care. It's all resurrected because of its big names, but if no one is, no one will give that movie any love. <br /> <br /> Seriously I was at the point where I was watching Vanessa Redgrave on the side of the movie and thinking, "Hurry up and die already!" It's like "Joy Luck Club" without any joy. It's the mother-daughter movie "Ocean 13" (nothing more than a big name cast) and completely climatic ... oh, until it's finally over. <br /> <br /> I am sure they will all be candidates for Oscar ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince big actors to commit to this junk.
