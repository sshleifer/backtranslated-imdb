Japanese fantasy films have always had incredible ambitions. They have always been ready to destroy cities by large-scale monsters from space and elsewhere. The problem is that they have never had the money to manage convincing special effects. This film, which appeared in France called Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. Its purpose is to show the three giants of the giant octopus to a giant lobster who is trying to get people to the top. It is extremely uncomfortable and ridiculous, but also very enjoyable. After all, we do these creatures and these movies after all, isn't it?
