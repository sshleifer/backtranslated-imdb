[I saw this movie in a late public television channel so I don't know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burles" (sic) shirley temples in the early 1930s . It is hard to believe that everyone would let their daughter be in these small movies, which today could be considered as such a "child porn". <br /> <br /> Stars of Shirley's temple, apparently on average Everybody has diapers and they are in the salon where milk is offered instead of alcohol. "Cash" is in the form of fools. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays a "femme fatale" that talks about the bar and talks to the soldiers who make comments about him (!). But Shirley doesn't really need his lollipop / money because his wallet is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a little black boy in a nearby table will dance (!). br /> <br /> What is a strange film. . . toddlers who use a joyful dialogue playing adult roles in the cabin. Who thought of this stuff somehow?
