In addition to all technical flaws ... <br /> <br /> How would a female airplane be able to kill all 7 of 7 terrorists (including former Navy), of which 2 are without using a weapon. Then he lands on the plane. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a regular, scared but very well-prepared team member. : D How is an attack / rescue leader responsible for having a (unique) sleep plan for a script logic and for flying from a team. Only he decides from the moment to change plans and instead attacks terrorists, the relaxation of weapons, without knowing where the terrorists are, or how much and not to secure an advantage so that his entire team can be easily wiped. Yes, it's an old bath. Only later will it be decided to use sleep. And it appears useless for all intense purposes. <br /> <br /> Bad as this movie was, but I couldn't look at myself and I don't know what's going on? : D I can't imagine all the great writers of the unemployed script who think themselves, it's not fair. lol! : D
