The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially a darker, less child-oriented Gojira (Godzilla) renewal for the sensitivity of the 1960s. Of course, Gamera is a gigantic, flying, flaming tortoise that literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some of Godzilla's versions, but most often resembles. <br /> <br /> This original text version was edited by the notorious Sandy Frank. And like Godzilla ("American King of Monsters" Godzilla), the "Gammera Invincible" gets more than just a spelling wrong. American scenes are not nearly as ridiculous and annoying as those added to the big Gojira, but they don't really add much to the story because they are few. <br /> <br /> The film starts with promising, some of the scenes for developing the scene, and there are enough personalities to create tension outside the main plot. When Gamera appears, the film begins to humiliate quite a launcher echo. <br /> <br /> Operation is good enough - even American add-ons are OK. Leadership is pretty good for this period and genre, and special effects are not bad for all these times (all miniatures). Some kits and backgrounds are really good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here is, of course, that there is little or nothing original about this movie. Gamera, however, develops a more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching when you are a fan of the echo.
