Almost two people play and as such are important dialogues and managerial presentations. Neither of them is particularly good. It could have been stronger, in fact, if it were first designed as a two-man game and then worked on a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a nervous vampire who looks slightly autistic is a stunned stripper (watching too many pornos in his madness at home). He wants him to tell him the daylight. It would have been better to look for someone who has a day job, or someone who stands out with a painting, such as a poet, but then they may not have a hot body. <br /> <br /> After him, do whatever he wants (and he's not terribly good), he's going to feed him at 6 am, when the sun is rising. Much has been done about this deadline, despite the fact that he also says he can go without feeding, it just makes him hungry. In addition, he claims that he can't let slip, because he knows him, but he lets many other people go who learn what he is. There are many contradictions. <br /> <br /> Why this vampire decides to live in a house that has been so poorly seated that street lighting and neighboring buildings are poured as if it were in the daytime, I'm not sure. All the time in the world, you think he would have done a better job or fixed a place a bit. He's probably not a prosperous vampire. <br /> <br /> This is said to be a remake and I'm curious to see its original version. Although it was directed by Katt Shea and other films he directed to Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were pretty bad.
