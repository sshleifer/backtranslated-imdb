When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it wouldn't work. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We were misled by spades. <br /> <br /> I felt Billy's character was extremely one-dimensional and made very little for the film. Of course, he broke a few good jokes, but if he did, he didn't do anything. <br /> <br /> And bad Julia Roberts. In previous examples, he plays well with a strong willpower, a self-evident lady. In this flick he seems to be completely repressed and had a very small fire. This is not Julia Roberts what my wife enjoys. <br /> <br /> OK, if I find one good thing, it should be Christopher Walken. Now it's entertainment. But like Billy Crystal, his character is hardly shown. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night-time that makes no sense to laugh with very little redemptive value, look at it. But if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, it's not your movie. This is not one of the above.
