* May include spoiler * <br /> <br /> I leaned fairly towards this movie. I knew he was celebrating Madonna. I knew it lasted for a whole week in theaters. I knew it got a lot of bad comments. I did not expect a deep and thoughtful study of class, culture and sexuality, as we got in Italian. The benefits of doubt lasted for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, wilted Gorgon, who goes on vacation with her controlled husband and flippant friends (a brunette woman is as bad as Madonna having some really foolish facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first companion of a ship who manages to humiliate and cure Madonna's character like dirt in every scene they have. Why is he a bitch for him? Just because the plot requires it so that later, when two of them are hit by an island on the Mediterranean island, tables are taught and taught to him. It is simply inexplicable how they fall in love, despite having nothing in common and abusing each other for two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> Swept Away is a silly, simplified, superficial film from start to finish. Madonna normally supplies wood. There are a lot of foolish scenes: Madonna sings and dances terribly to Gianni, a fantasy scene with Madonna and lots of scenes where she strikes her and beats her in the back. Guy Ritchie makes his "stylish" editing, which is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard on the big film after several years. The end is cute and incredible. In principle, "Blueboard" corresponds to "Overboard" minus the former nudity and last humor. <br /> <br /> Maybe the ego of Madonna is so big that she will continue to prove himself as a competent actor. Please give it up, Madge, both for us and for you. But this is not his worst film. This distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". He hasn't done anything worse ... yet.
