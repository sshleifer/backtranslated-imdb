Jean Luc Godard's Marxism polemic is so close to a film that is invisible when you see an internationally renowned filmmaker. Political theater pieces, a spiritually dull and infinite thing are disturbed by making a "sympathy for the devil", a studio with Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song development process, Mick Jagger, plays a demo on an acoustic guitar that the vocals supporting the final songs are exciting and worth renting only to see the bits accompanying the rocks. Almost half of the movie is dedicated to it, so thanks to the miracle of the chapter you can skip all the strange political sketches and just see how Stones puts the song together. <br /> <br /> If I had it on a laser disc I tried to look at it all, but I don't see how anyone could get through it. Finally I gave up and just stopped the chapter.
