"Power Play" starts with interesting, but it falls fast on the hill. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell has no "Power Play" redemption value or interest. "Power Play" is after a few days more earthquakes than California is after a year. The mall's earthquake scene is both built and absolutely unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like three third graders. It's terrible, just terrible. The bottom line, when "Power Play" was made in the 60s or 70s, is considered a bad "B" class movie. The fact that Power Play was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there a Class D movie? If so, "Power Play" pours the form.
