This is a film that is seen in the jaw, in a frightening silence and still looks as if you look at the train wreck in slow motion. And yet, at the back of your mind, the thoughts are: "Who in the EARTH green shone this garbage?" <br /> <br /> Some previous user comments say things like: "A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - insulting children everywhere. Because children need some kind of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy, it shows a deep misunderstanding about children around the world. Others have commented on the loyalty of the two star character of Laurel and Hardy, to which I would answer: So WHAT? One might think that the rash of a beloved series-based film BOMBS (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) would have taught Hollywood that there are a few things that can't be restored. Laurel and Hardy movies are easily accessible from the video: why does it bother? <br /> <br /> Like F. Murray Abraham, a stage and screen actress ... well, I can say he must be in trouble with IRS. <br /> <br /> If this trash is on, don't walk away from the TV!
