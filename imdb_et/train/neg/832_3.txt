I give props to this film that it has been well done and worked well. BUt I didn't miss the whole thing from the improbability. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a game built around the concept of "Russian Roulette", which must be filled in an hour. the big problem is that when you make a "live" show, you have the chance that your first competitor is not happy enough to drive a "real" ball. What are you doing then? You have 50 minutes to show up and do nothing. Consequently, it is okay that you get to the end and the first five competitors survive, which means that the sixth has a ball and does not get this payout. He's not going to shoot himself at this point, so it's kind of anti-climate. <br /> <br /> Another problem, almost the same size. Human nature. People are going to bounce, panic, ground their underwear and do things that wouldn't do very well on television. Too much randomness. That is why "real" reality television is actually precisely written and even more closely edited. <br /> <br /> (The only casual thing is a "performer" bead for female victims that were historically rare. Predictable because she went through shooting without being affected.) <br /> <br /> We believe that the ratings of the exhibitions increase as it happened at 1 am in the morning (unlikely) with the sign Asian girl announces an increase in each rating. <br /> <br /> Race and gender. The big surprises films are two minorities (one gay) and two female contestants are those who survive. So we stay with two white men and, of course, it's a little less pleasant for those who buy it. The purpose of such an exhibition would be randomness, but the least pleasing man is the man who dies. Climax is that after two hours of fighting television suicide, the nature of Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and celebrated in this case so that she has no one to blame, but actually) is growing in conscience when someone dies. What did he think would happen? He immediately captures angry by the bystander (the motives have never been explained) and the performance was a big blow. Really? The problem with the media satire is that it has to be some kind of reality or it has to be so upright (like a network). It's not.
