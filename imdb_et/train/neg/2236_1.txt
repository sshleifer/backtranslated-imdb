I don't know where to start. Acting in this movie was really terrible, I don't remember seeing so many "actors" in one movie who couldn't act. Not only was the actor bad, but the characters were incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Then it is. I believe even children know that when someone strikes, blood is involved. But if anyone can shoot Snitch for ten (!!) time, there is no blood at all. Well, I think it's just me. <br /> <br /> To make a short story (because I believe I can feel the feeling about this movie), it is undoubtedly the worst film I ever saw. This movie should be number 100 on the bottom 100, no doubt.
