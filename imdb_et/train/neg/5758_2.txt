One could say that the actors make the film, but this clearly proves this statement wrong. Most of the characters in this movie have nothing to stick with. They play a part of the cardboard that is moved in predictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. It can sum up a few words, but I'll keep it back if someone counts on watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I had to move forward quickly when Jack showed us how to be an unpleasant eater. I have to say that 70% of this movie turned around cooking, eating or cooking. Frankly, I wouldn't take the time to chew Jack's mouth. Personally, I would have been able to make footwear and jokes that are pepper in the first half of the film. There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging. If something happens, the characters' reactions are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It's best not to look at it.
