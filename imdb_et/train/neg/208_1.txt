Terrible movie with Ramone bits. You're worse than the average 80s comedy format of the 1970s for cool kids taking a somewhat special plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys Ramones and a school that is fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget about this movie and see something like Wild Zero, who plays Guitar Wolf if you want a fun B-movie. Terrible action, terrible writing, a terrible plot with a Ramones affirmation, who apparently needed money quickly to say yes to this movie. This is the only logical thing I mean because this film is blowing.
