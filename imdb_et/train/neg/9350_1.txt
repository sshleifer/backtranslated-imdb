This movie was terrible. The first semester is similar ... well, we apologize for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is copied from almost one first clock! Supposedly, it was a tribute, as it showed that the watch posters appeared on the main character's wall, but "ripoff" is a more appropriate word. The film felt like it was interrupted by Kubrick's classic, but only filmed through the eyes of a new director. The blind director. Unfortunately, when it stops the work of Kubrick in the massacre, the film becomes even worse. As the other commentator said, the depth of this film is just in the throat. Arrogant, in itself absorbed and ultimately meaningless. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the characters touch the cartoon characters if the film had a real character. I felt something for this boy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I think if someone could feel something to him, it would be me. Amazing character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the title. For "16-year-old alcohol", alcoholism is not a very important factor in slipping. See the first paragraph - it was a kind of bell-burning orange orange that I can't overcome. A more appropriate title would have been "16 years of violence" or even better "Clockwork banana". <br /> <br /> Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and still refer to it, drink. Trust me.
