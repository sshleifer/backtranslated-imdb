Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the most (most!) More open to the movie ... Movies are my passion and I'm a great local cult movie-rent. ..I also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice on the film when I get there, and I never seem to be able to leave the site without having to discuss or exchange ideas about what's going on in the cult film area. .. I love to rent strange things, and that's why one movie suggested a cinema to recommend this cinema. He told me he had to see it and because the cover said it was a movie about Jodorowsky (one of my favorites), I rented it. <br /> <br /> The vote I gave here is not really fair because I did not think it was terrible, I just didn't know how to evaluate it differently. The question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally put me on the stomach: I felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned? I still didn't want to turn it off, or maybe I just couldn't, because I was fascinated by a strange way ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, 1 as I said. Just not my cup of tea (or wodka for it) ...
