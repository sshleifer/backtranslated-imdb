This movie is AWESOME. I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it's okay, but I think it's RULEZZZ! It's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He made the film completely different from these terrible Hollywood films like Matrix and STop or my mother coming. It could have been better. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like the big story that a funny man wears. I think he is the coolest man from this Domino Pizza claymation. Not only does this film really look cool like those that focus on my father's birthday when I turned to 6 years. in the end. This is the genius of how this network is woven to meet everyone. I wish Ted V. Mikels would follow. But it needs more aliens. And the pirate.
