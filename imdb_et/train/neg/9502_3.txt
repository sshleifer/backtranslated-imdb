This film was odd, totally inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends when he was drinking from a big empty house. I really love opening things when Lisa travels in a beautiful city lost. I want to be a beautiful stranger who lost a place of exotic Europe, though perhaps not terrible with a low budget. Be sure to get to the end with a strangely non-sexual sexual scene that was cut out (in my DVD copy). Don't try to understand it, go ahead and see the strange bits ... which is all. Don't look at it if you really want a plot or testimonial, or something at all. Pretty pretty, though you can just give up and decide how to watch a real horror movie like Dead Alive.
