I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I have to say that it was extremely mediocre (at best). The dialogue does not explain this story very well, and I felt there was a lot of hole in the plot. In this adaptation, there is no pleasant character due to bad actions. I just find that all the characters are too gracious when it comes to someone they love. The love of Cate and Heath also seems very incredible. They look more like brothers and sisters than lovers. I don't understand why Dad would accept something under his roof. It is extremely difficult to enjoy any characters. Katherine Heigli's performance was terrible, which was a complete shock. He was terrible because he was Edward's older sister and for Aimee Osbourne I didn't even have enough lines to even criticize her. Johnny Whitworth did well and had a nice time seeing him in some recent, and although his character was a bit of a cocoon, he was the only person I covered. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they had to be our heroines, but they came out as tiny and superfluous. The Christian punk band, MxPx, appeared briefly, but this little look doesn't convince me to watch the movie again. MTV did a tremendous job of convincing me that it wasn't a movie. I just imagined something so different.
