Absolutely terrible movie. Ameteurish and it's not funny at all. The guitar that plays Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Editing E.T and star wars is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Actress Yilmaz Goksal is the only good idea about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood doesn't find an actor with their own characteristics. In addition to the movie Goksal, this film is a garbage. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this film is his worst written work until then. <br /> <br /> Cem Karaca's music is another plus of this waste of money. There's also an actor, Sumer Tilmac. An actor who plays these three sons is not a talent that is ever so.
