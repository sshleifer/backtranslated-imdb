fulci experiments with sci fi and fail. usually we can't get a big sum in our horror movie, but not here. The amount of very funny scenes like when the prisons are forced to hold the bar for 12 minutes and when they fall, they are poured. the boy falls and he has about two minutes on the floor until his friends who tried to keep anyway lift him off the floor. The city is an obvious model, but not bad. and the final explosion is at best ridiculous. And don't let me start in terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
