When this cartoon came out for the first time, I had the impression that it was at least half-way down, boy was wrong. I have to admit that this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all these years ago. I looked at a couple of episodes and two of them were literally left and right handed by Batman as a penguin who fought like Jet Li and won a mess out of Batman and I looked at another episode where Batman got his butt from Joker. who apparently used Jackie Chan while moving the air like a ninja. When was Joker or Penguin ever for Batman? and worse than Joker and Penguin Kung Fu colleagues Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, frustrating and sad about how Batman's image in this show is depicted. Animation is terrible and the dialogue is terrible. Being a Batman fan because I have a childhood, I can honestly and firmly recommend that you stay away and avoid this display at all costs, because it is not Batman's real image. This comic is more like Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see the classic Batman comic, I strongly recommend Batman's animated series, but this comic is nothing but S-T! Get Batman: Animations and don't waste your time with this comic.
