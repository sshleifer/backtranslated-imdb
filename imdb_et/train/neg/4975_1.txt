After seeing Canada / Iceland / British 2004 "Beowulf & Grendel" production, which I thought was great and stunning, I approached this - the first three newer Beowulf films that came out this year - scared. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the horns helmets, I fell. These were Swedes and Danes, not the Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings did not carry the horns on their helmet (the horns easily turn the helmet off the helmet and then the brain). Then there is the Hollolfgar Palace, which looks like a film from Greece or Rome, not in the 6th century Denmark. Swords and armor look like props from earlier films in different historical periods. I noticed the weapons that crusaders could use in the "kingdom of heaven", and one sign was even the "Beowulf & Grendel" Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction film sword! In addition to the original epic poem, writing was depressing and acting completely woody and persuasive. The biggest yuk was a secret weapon that was full of sight and exploding projectiles that looked like something was bought from Iraqi rebels. The special effects monster and his mother were both steroids that Beowulf could never tear off as he did in the poem. Thank you gods for the Bazooka cross guidelines! I could go ahead, but I don't want to.
