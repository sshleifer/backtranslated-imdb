This movie was terribly terrible: you just don't care. You don't care about what happened at the plot; you don't care about the characters. Everyone had no heart. I went out in about 45 minutes because I just didn't want to think about it anymore. There's too much sex in the movie. Sex can be okay; it may even make a movie (hence Karma Sutra), but the relationship was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Don't look at this movie.
