This is a high quality cheese price for the B-film kung fu flicks. Bruce "wannabe" Lee plays Bruce Li ... I guess. Of course, we'll show you Bruce's short clips and make close-ups of our eyes, and if you're at an angle during a winter solstice at a certain time, it's like Bruce. You laugh honestly about how splicing a movie is not very good, but some cool deleted scenes from Enter Dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed during the throw of a helicopter while hanging. Of course, they think it can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce, although his character should be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still remembers Bruce's gestures and fighting style). Look at Bruce who is alone with a coward. You see that Kay-Bee stopped the props. Bruce also finds something wrong when a dirty man beats. After all, the director decided to "throw it back" for a scene that was only shown 3 minutes ago !! They have to think that only one-cell organisms with disorder of attention deficit can fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
