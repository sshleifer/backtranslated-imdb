Watching it live at night will make you wonder who in the world is this green grass. A newborn couple goes to their honeymoon under attack, bats attack, and the husband starts running his pajamas against different people. And where exactly are they? They are in the desert, then they are skiing, then they are in a small town that looks like it is near the mountains. The castle is led by a sheriff who loves to watch and has a personal brother against a little doctor's boy. The ski hospital is really headed by a nice guy who has a nice thick mustache and looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the end ends with anger. Special effects and makeup market Stan Winston made an impact on this film. I think you have to start somewhere.
