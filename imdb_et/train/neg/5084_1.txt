I saw this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm also a film / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. It is no longer Romania, but I see the events taking place in the same period with the case from 11 September. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just blank pictures. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians don't know, this movie is for French viewers, not for us. They believe that this is the reality of Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I really don't know if we can call it a movie, maybe a horror :) And we don't know why we have such a picture in Europe. It was a reality but no longer. A good friend of the Brithishi Embassy said: "You have no idea what the people of Romania walked from Ceausescu."
