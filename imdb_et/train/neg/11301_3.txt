Nothing destroys the movie as much as a bad script and a bad direction. This is the case with The Mummy's Tomb. <br /> <br /> The script is an idea of ​​older, better universal horrors like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is truncated and hidden. Action is mediocre. Even Chaney Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tyler's "The Mummy Hand", and manufacturers are foolish enough to add footy to Christy Cabanne's far superior prequel and point out the weakness of his film. <br /> <br /> The universal realized how bad this film was, and recovered it from scratch two times later than "The Mummy Ghost", which had a much better script and better director. The result was probably the best film in the four "Mummy" films, though not as good as the original Karl Freund 1932. <br /> <br /> Cabanne's footage raises this film 3. "New" things are at best 2. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably happy when they saw their characters so they wouldn't have appeared in such a dreck anymore!
