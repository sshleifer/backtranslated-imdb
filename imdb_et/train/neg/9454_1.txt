If my child has asked me to leave this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted my eyes to go up. I wanted to get through the screen and hit Mike Myers to sacrifice the last dignity he had. This is one of the few movies in my life that I watched and wanted to let go if it was possible. Other movies are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", both of which are better in the hat. <br /> <br /> I can sleep today, trying to forget that I've ever seen this blasphemy a good Seussi name. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers tells you to stay with Austin or even wake Waynes World. Just because he worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is successful for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
