If you liked the first two movies, I'm sorry you didn't want it. It's really garbage and unnecessary straight to the video, probably a sequel to the TV. Still idiotic, but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, a woman wants to get rid of her shape, Wayne is so stupid that she's reducing her shape and herself to her brother. Then he also shrinks to his wife and sister. Now adults have to find a way to get the kids in the house bigger for them. The other two are repeated with only one or two new things, eg. trolley mountain biking, swimming diving, etc. Pretty bad!
