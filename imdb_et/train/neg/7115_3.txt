Okay, so an introduction that is free to offer a coffin to anyone who dies during the movies is so funny. So the first "skull scene" is so drawn and un-suspenseful it's funny. The real plot of the film is somewhat decent, with at least a bit of real thought in the behavior of the characters, and the twist of the plot is good when the twitches go. Operation is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't coincide with 1/10 of the movie. It isn't awful enough to get the lowest rating or even another. If I just read the scenario, I would say it's a decent film. It's just the terrible direction and production that destroys the film. So it's a bad movie, but there's a lot worse.
