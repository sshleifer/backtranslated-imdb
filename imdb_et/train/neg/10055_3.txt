I grew up on "Superman II" theater version ("S2T") and as a child I loved it more than Part I because not only did it contain Superman and three Superman type villains, it started with a bang? ? Best Clark Kent for Superman Transformation and Rescue. The kids didn't have to wait anymore until Superman appeared on the screen, as in Part I. Now, as an adult, I see how mighty had fallen with S2T (see my review). the story of how they prematurely and unreasonably triggered the original of Richard Donner's Part II. (It must be rare to film two separate movies at the same time, now it's common: "Back to the Future" and "Matrix" 2 & 3.) Unfortunately, after all, Richard Donner Cut (or, S2RD) I can't Gone, it was a great Superman change, rescue all over Paris, as well as a wonderful repetition of Part I in opening S2T. In fact, they all wrote the words: "Previously Superman?" in S2RD. but S2RD, they were mostly ridiculous? like the Lois, which falls from the Daily Planet, I admit that some of the new scenes were working and some of them were welcome departures, such as "honeymoon." Generally, if you grew up in S2T like I did and loved it as a child? not as an adult, because you should see the S2RD completely, because it is almost a new childhood experience with tens of new scenes. (Spoiler warning) Unfortunately, the worst change is the last one: lost was also the strange amnesia kiss from S2T, which was replaced with exactly the same end as "I." It is not only lazy, unigiginal copying, it makes no sense why Clark would return to this canteen if these events did not happen. And will he continue back in time for each confrontation?
