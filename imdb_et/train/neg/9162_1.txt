The only reason this film is rated 1 is that zero is not one of the options. Thinner than a depression cabbage soup, a terrible action and special effects that look like "Thunderbirds" came out of the TV series, it is amazing that Widmark did not kill the director to restart this black mark. Even according to the standards of the 1950s, special effects are cruel, except for a few underwater submarine sequences. I can only assume that it was the best special effect because after 20,000 leagues under the sea and on them! Certainly this year, the Disney competition was not the only competition for them. I wouldn't recommend the movie even for heavy submarine film films because the most realistic scene of the submarine was limited to one shot where seawater could be seen under the risen periscope. There are other, much better movies that you can enjoy from this era, such as the 20,000 leagues mentioned above or Torpedo Run.
