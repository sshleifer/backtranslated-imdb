The direction must be a problem here. I recently heard that John Cleese talks about a skate for Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too thin and not funny. The other branch was too funny. The third was just uncomfortable to be funny. This attention to detail is missing from "Corky Romano". No matter how embarrassing this comic was, it was not fixed or left on the floor of the cutting room. One of the values ​​I find for this film is the study of a very flawed film that somehow escaped the distribution without correcting. <br /> <br /> I've scanned dozens of other comments. The number of their absolute time-wasting praise increases my doubt that some people will get paid for advertising their titles. I can't understand how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can't imagine anyone, even those who make money from it, even appreciating it from the average. <br /> <br /> This will change my 10 worst movie listings all the time. And hey, I really like three stories and I can even endure Ed Wood!
