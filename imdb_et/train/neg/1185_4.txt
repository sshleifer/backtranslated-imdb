Another variation and improvisation for the famous and beloved children, La Bete (1975) or Beast, tries to imagine (very graphically and what may seem offensive and disturbing, but in reality quite silly and comical), what really happened to beauty and the Monster? I have a lot of reviews and comments that look too deep in this movie. I do not go so far as to say that it is a serious and dark study of topics such as sexual disappointment, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticism of Catholic religion. I wouldn't even call it horror erotic film. It is a parody in all genres that it touches or mentions, although all departments have some shocking moments that will definitely remain in your memory. <br /> <br /> Aristocratic young long (too long) scene of a woman and supposedly frightening, but the most ridiculous thing I've seen in the film creature really impressive ... well with anatomy is set for Scarlat's piano music and is hysterical. My husband and I laughed loudly with the exaggerated details of the meeting. The scene's morale is - beauty can and can be beaten by the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic image, it's too verbos; for an art movie - it's got too many jaw-dropping scenes with madness and I'd say a sudden end. IMO, the filmmaker does not mean that it is a serious drama. Art as a house / horror / erotic parody is funny and definitely original. Well laugh and try not to look deep. This story about curious decorations and horrible Beasts is certainly not recommended for viewing with children. The opening scene, which can shock the unprepared viewer much more than disgrace, can be successfully used in the discovery channel for a program such as "The World of Animals - Horse Habits and Rituals".
