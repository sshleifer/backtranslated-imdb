Yes, he is! ... No, not because Pintilie loves to dress her actors and publicly show her privileges. Pintilie IS is a naked "emperor" - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It's a great time when someone says the truth. This impostor is a voyeur who is locked in the old man's body. His abundance of naked scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It is a 100% visual perversion: it gets its punches, making actors fist and watching their hives. And if he does it in front of an audience, he can get the eve! Did you know that in the "Niki Ardelean" kit, he used the stigma of poor Coca Bloss, saying, "Oh, Coca, how I want you ***!" She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became a shameful shame - for her little satisfaction! And as a worrying alarm signal about the vulgaris and lack of education among Romanian audiences, so many people are still so stupid to declare these visual inconveniences "works of art"! Has anyone ever been willing to give the truth about it?
