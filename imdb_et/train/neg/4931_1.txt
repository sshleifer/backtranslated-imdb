This time we get a psycho-toy maker called "Joe Petto" who makes live, evil toys that kill people. She goes after a family with a bad fortune to just live in the same house where she and her mutant robot "Pino" (again get it?) Lived. <br /> <br /> Just the worst (and hopefully [probably] the last one) in this semi-series, this and the previous look like soft core porn movies but without sex and nudity. It's sort of like "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and a bad home movie. They allegedly started to make the seventh chapter in 2000, but it was abandoned and not completed. We can all only hope that it will remain so ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star **** <br /> <br />
