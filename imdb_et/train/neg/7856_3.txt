This movie sucks a lot. I'm in the army and the soldiers in this movie are terrible. If your army and you see this movie laugh and irritate the whole movie because they acted as a team. It was ridiculous. They acted like a bunch of normal people whose army uniforms didn't know what to do. It was a pretty tough film, which I have to say the least. There were a couple of scenes where they were trying to jump you. I would recommend seeing it when you are bored and want to see a violent movie. This is a better movie even if you are not in the military. I have to say that I liked this first better.
