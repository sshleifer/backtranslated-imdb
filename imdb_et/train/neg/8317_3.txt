The movie about the killer is surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens and even if they do, they don't create any real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> Operation Cassetti delivers excellent results from two drivers, providing Succo fortress and stupidity, but the rest will do what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the writing is weak and the direction and the fact that the real story is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> This type of film usually tries to create tension or empathy or annoyance and it does not create anything except the feeling that you lost your time by looking at it.
