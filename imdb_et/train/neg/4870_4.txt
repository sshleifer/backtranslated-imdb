The film is bad. Something special - just a "boy" movie that doesn't have a serious thing in it. However, there is one reason: talking to animals. Some of them are so funny what they say, you just can't laugh. So if you want to listen to the dog's pound, saying, "I'm Keyser Soze" or another animal that says "You're walking a dead cat" or many other funny liners, look at it. Because there's no other good movie to watch. Vote: 4 out of 10.
