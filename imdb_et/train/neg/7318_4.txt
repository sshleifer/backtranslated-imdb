This is a depressively low, naive, and mostly unusual look between the wildly improbable relationship and the editor of the Brooks psychotic film and his coat-of-arms Harold. Both have ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold can't do anything beautiful at this stage of his career. but also because Brooks' character is not interesting or pleasant. At first, there are 15 static, tortuous minutes where Brooks just broke Harold, despises his apartment in depression, stunned. You are so beautiful, "there is not enough material here for the feature film. On the periphery of these relationships, there is almost nothing that would give the appearance that these people exist in the real world. I am sure Brooks was going to shine white hot attention on things and in some sense its but if you want to do this, writing and acting must be much better than here.
