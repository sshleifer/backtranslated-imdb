What this film does not match is how wrong this war is (and most of the US wars have just got oil recently). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian casualties are, how many lives have been lost, and how boldly stupid are criminals. <br /> <br /> So, let me ask you - if an American soldier kills women and children aside from enemies, it is OK, but if the government accidentally kills its forces by killing chemicals, killing many civilians well, isn't it? Your logic fails, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 5 definite results and 1 all else 3 together.
