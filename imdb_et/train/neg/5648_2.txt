Boston has turned its tail around and headed for the shed and its pigs! When this exhibition was first behind the four seasons, it was a humorous blow in the legal system that all participants seem to be proud of. It was funny, diverse and to some extent factual. The characters that were depicted were acceptable and realistic in their depiction. Sexual comment and action was limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is, and was as beautiful as the other series she participated in, but has now been drawn into the lower depths of sex and violence in media programs. Julie is a great actor and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois It is a great actor who has been in the entertainment field since "Benson" day to show its production humor and respectful action. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and she must be admired for continuing this production and acting as a good actor. James Spader, his ability to act is not in doubt, but he should go back to his XXX origin, like "Crash", because he seems to have a lot of talent and tendency in this direction. We ask that this series of trash, as it is, and its real smell !!!
