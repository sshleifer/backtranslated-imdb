Uneven, too predictable, and just a little entertaining sci-fi formula we've all seen a hundred times earlier - just a group of scientists facing an unknown alien and all places (surprise, surprise)) in Antarctica! <br /> <br /> In the movie, James Spader and the almost unnamed cast (except Carl Lewis, who is not really so bad for the actor) - who offer twilight performances that are little to stimulate the script's unimaginable dialogue. In order to make things worse, the movie's pace is slow, the bottom line is almost non-existent, and some action sequences are stereotypical and not so exciting. His little wonder that this thing went straight to the DVD. No wonder why Spader is a great actor who won the Cannes Best Actress Award for "Sex, Lies and Video Stage" and did an excellent job in an innovative sci-fi flick "Stargate" - decided to sign up for this incomplete project. Or maybe not when you look at your career, because it looks like he has given more talents than strokes. many elements from so many big sci-fi movies, and yet this thing is both pointless and natural. "The Thing" (both Howard Hawks original and John Carpenter's excellent 1982 remake) has been widely borrowed, "Contact" and "Outbreak"; some tips for "Alien", CE3K, Andromeda strain, "Kubrick" 2001 (i.e. "alien black box") and "Mission to Mars" (i.e., mystery message); and even a few "sneakers" and "a remarkable mind" dashes (though not sci-fi movies, they share a "cryptology" connection). Hell, there's even cornfield and Antarctica, like the recent X-file movie. And the luminous translucent spacecraft at the end looks exactly like something that was spread out of "Abyss." some light surprises to the end. I can talk a little more about this plot, but there's no need. You already know more than half of this movie without ever seeing it. (5 out of 10)
