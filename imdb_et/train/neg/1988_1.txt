Okay, I went awfully. I went against the fact that Lil Kim burst some cannons and his hands or hands did not move, I went to weave, I got colored contacts. <br /> <br /> This is what was killed for me: in a scene where four roses were sitting at the table. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up and then Lil Kim rises to break any hostility by saying, "Where, Whoa, Whoa, Hold up. CHILL OUT here for HOT SECOND." I am a fan of the Western film genre and I have never heard anyone talk about such a slang in any of Clint Eastwood's films. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks that this film deserves more than one rating, tell me one more movie that's worse than the roses gang. <br /> <br /> I'm over.
