This is the kind of movie I look at enemy content all the time, but it's not bloody true. I only look at it once to make sure it is as bad as I first thought it was. <br /> <br /> Some mobiles hijack the Boeing 747. Boeing hijacks the good part of the Pentagon. <br /> <br /> It has one of these star images, the stars fall or hardly above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We're ourselves!" says Jack Lemon. He's so right. Except George Kennedy. He's in all these catastrophic movies. <br /> <br /> Watch another movie instead. Oh, not the "airport" original. It's not good either. Instead, look at a decent flick on a plane like "Phoenix Flight".
