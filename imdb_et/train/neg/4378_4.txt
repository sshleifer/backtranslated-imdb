Given the title and the extreme box of art, I was ready for almost everything. Maybe my expectations were somewhat high because I was a little dry. <br /> <br /> A soft heart movie movie team reaches out into strangers when they get lost. mist and decide how best to spend the evening have sex. Where hasn't this device been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverted nature of sex. It is forbidden to show all goods (runners were illegal in Japan for a long time, shown to be foggy). The film just tries to show the viewer as much as the unnatural sex can be. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all kinky moves, a mud monster appears (whose origins I cannot understand) and starts killing and raping people ... then murdering them. Some attractions are a bit much, especially for women who have gut pulled out of their vagina or another woman who kicked out ... stuff, but otherwise gore is pretty common. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film's own designs will pull down; it is too sexual to be a mighty horror image and too frightening to work as a sex flick. Resources can work, but balance is needed. <br /> <br /> 4/10
