Alright, friends, serious movie buff is waiting to watch all kinds of movies, bad and good, and this movie put me to the test. I'm not saying words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. Operation was bad. Always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed, I asked myself why I even struggled to see this rotten trashy movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something I suspect would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie buffer and therefore it cannot be avoided what else should be avoided. I'm not wasting your time explaining what this amateur movie is exactly wrong, except by saying that the actor's quality was, polite, submarine. Serious movie buffers can take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home, don't waste your time, read a book, take chores or get a good sandwich.
