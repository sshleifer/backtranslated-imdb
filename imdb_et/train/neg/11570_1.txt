the intentions of leaders for this film are quite honorable, but the history of his productions helped me to know that it may not bring much, as other filmmakers do. bearing in mind his great 30-day TV series, but also "contributing" to his MTV production, which contradicts his seriousness in any document he documented, and also considering his "disappointing" supersize me ". expects a high level. unfortunately this movie is disappointed with me. like "supersize me" after some time i asked myself what exactly it was all about. the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the time is filled with rather useless things and repeats such things that have already been shown in the movie before, so it will wear out and become a very boring end.
