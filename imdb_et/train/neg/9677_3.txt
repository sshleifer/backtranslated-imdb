somewhere I would have read that this film should be comedy. after I saw it, I'd call it something. its a movie point in life for me. dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd, many of them seemed to be descendants, and despite all nudity and indirect sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this movie ... it leaves me wondering what the hell is that thing about! a title might have been fun (as politically wrong) comedy. Instead, cheap, amateur, unfinished visions and misery and wonders are treated in our interests. when i want it, i buy grace jones cd.
