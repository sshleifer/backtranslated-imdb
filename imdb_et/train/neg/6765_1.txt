* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a great media obsession with violence. But this statement ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown the killers of his sera to the innocent, inhuman murderers of innocent people, and in contrast to the poisonous media charm. Instead, it gives them a justification. The film represents almost every victim as someone who has suffered dignity. In dealing with proud stereotypes, Stone presents uncomfortable cartoons to the victims - stubborn invaders, lazy people. One person who is also a murder is a stereotype. Of course, they interact with the old, American-Indian-hallucinogenic - because they're trendy, dude? Let's make him a wonderful character. Fat, Chinese officials and "hicks" are infertile, so let's say it seems worth to die. Counterfeit, hateful, corrupted by their misdemeanors make their rampage happier and more lovable. Mickey and Mallory are sexy and cool and surrealistic visions attract more impressive people. Justice is mocked. Police and prison officers are depicted as brutal, skull, and scam compared to GQ killers. Again, it is not in the media, but in the "reality" movie. The film has no nuances or nuances - just overpowered performances and visuals. The film does not claim new or specific violence. The proof that the film is not in its message is the actual real reactions to it. Some impressive youngsters who saw this movie called it the killers killed. "Message" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction and with terrible real results. The smart message is nowhere to be seen.
