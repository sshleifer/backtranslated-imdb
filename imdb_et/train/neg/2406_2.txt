Harry Alan thinks Towers will come to another film mud. Supposedly, Rider Haggard's work is based on the fact that the only similarity that Haggard actually wrote is that it occurs in Africa (although there are dinosaurs in Africa that our horrible adventures use to draw their canoes)! some characters with the same names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) tried to search for treasures, armed only with a medallion, and ended up exactly where the treasure is, an opportunity. On the way, they meet very dirty monsters with dirty varieties, the French chef is picking up and McCallum has the affair of an affair. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's hoot. That's the only reason I didn't give it.
