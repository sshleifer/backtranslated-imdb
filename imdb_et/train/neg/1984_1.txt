Absolute steaming heap with cow. I think this film has even been made. Hip-Hop and the old westerners don't just look like. Which target groups were the people who thought about planning this train set? <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and drawing fun, but acting is cruel and the fact that some decent actors were even in this horror. the film makes your entire career laughable. A female chick should never be forgiven and removed from any other dignity. After reading the first ten pages, he should have asked what his friends were playing this sick joke. After some research, I actually found some other actors who passed on this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br In simple terms, I'd rather silence a blank TV than watch this movie again.
