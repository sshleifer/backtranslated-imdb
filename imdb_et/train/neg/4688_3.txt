It was a bad idea to watch the class in English. Serious and more educating films can have an impact, but it seems that it did not have any effect on the class - whenever the teacher left, the conversations started quickly - and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Tempest is used at all. easy to understand why. Action is not something special - everyone seems to be bored, just by reading the page without care in the world. Shakespeare always preferred action and death to dialogue, but I just did not understand what someone said. Costumes are not too bad nor special effects - the class has not loved the movie, but they did not take p * ss, but the movie has a hard time joking with no inspiration or joy. At the beginning of the movie the scenes were not too bad - although the rain seemed a bit unrealistic, everything else was fine and where were the broken heads and explosive masts? Where was the death? Where was the inspiration? The character of the arri would have been much more serious than he was he was wearing clothes, but as everyone was in the show, he was another excuse for joking. This film is in no way against any sex. Women and girls do not have any romance or comedy, and there are many naked men and a lack of action or death that puts most men and boys away. The tempo was not done badly, but it seemed that the producers had to do it, not something they wanted to do. And general boredom and lack of inspiration. 3/10
