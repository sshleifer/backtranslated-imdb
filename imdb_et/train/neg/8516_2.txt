Last week I looked at the weekly Nielsen ratings and Veronica Mars was said to be the "best show you didn't look at". Well, they are right that you are not looking at it. It was aired twice and was 147 and 145 out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest rated show on any national broadcasting network ... and worthy. I tried to look at it a couple of times because the whole press was a hypothesis as a "big" show, a "realistic look" in life and all such nonsense. The reality was otherwise. Veronica Mars is a cage. It is as unrealistic as it gets and it deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> Sole Mystery is the reason why CW was forced to show the lowest ranked show after its two-year extension. commercial and artistic failure.
