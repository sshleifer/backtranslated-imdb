I gave this movie 2 and although I consider myself a fan of science literature, I found it very difficult to take this movie seriously. It was late at AMC and I'm glad to see it for free. This movie is probably good for some laugh, but not much more. Of course we know more about Mars than we do today, but we can't resist this movie. The main reason I didn't like this movie was the story. The city on Mars, the creature of the lake, etc. All in all, the film is very similar to the episode of external influences of the 1960s, which has been completed.
