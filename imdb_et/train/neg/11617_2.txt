This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and totally pointless. It makes me loud to think that there are people who would enjoy watching it. Without telling the story, it is a young boy's reaction to a newborn sister and it's just the tip of the iceberg. During this film, viewers are viewed with somewhat more disturbing behavior towards the child. By adding injuries to the insult, there is no real outcome at the end of this film, except for the attainment of pure evil at least in the hands of a child who is a stupid adult all over. There is no redemption, no justice is offered, and the entire adult group is not smart enough to see what is going on around them. Frankly, I didn't enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who could enjoy horror movies, this movie may be too much. Despite the fact that this film worked well, this story is so disturbing that watching it was in the waiting room of a dentist for 90 minutes, waiting for painful dentistry.
