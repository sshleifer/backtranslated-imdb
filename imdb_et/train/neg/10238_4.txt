This film looked like it was good at first, but never to its expectations. The director is talented and has good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but he doesn't know how to create or speak a good story. The story was fragmented, and it seemed that the whole film had fallen in all sorts of directions, never found a definite, explainable and interesting corner. In principle, the film never fits with the explanation of press releases. However, the operation was very good. All the actors gave good results and Jude Law was great because he is always there. It is too bad that he chose such a weak film.
