Big movie - too bad it was a part of the producers and not a script. Basics Summary - A man with a redhead fetish invites such women to his apartment to go to a freaksome coma and continue with them for success. Only at the back of the scenes must I have thought that the film was both advertising and I started to film. Nothing flows, you disappear, at which redhead he is at that time (did he not remove it before?), And mostly it seems the camera man went out and continued filming when he woke up. Not that I could blame him, I went 2-3 times and I have to turn and continue to try to restore what a small plot is. Warning if you see the end DO NOT try to connect it before anything that happens before - you just get an aneurysm. It is not worth the time, effort or God to forbid money. The only reason to get 1 instead of 2 - a thin chance that hacking took place between the release of the movie and the terrible version I watched.
