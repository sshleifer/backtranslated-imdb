This movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> They didn't develop any characters and the storyline was terribly played. It was a sure sleeping place. You expect the scenes on this film to be its strengths, but D-Wars will surprise you even in this department. <br /> <br /> It was also just a step towards a higher budget flick level. And I mean it seriously. <br /> <br /> I was really happy that the end result of this credit was just so bad !!! Please, no matter what you do, don't waste your time and money on a crazy movie like D-Wars.
