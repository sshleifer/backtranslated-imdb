Finally, the day has come for me to acknowledge Asum's fate as an assassin, to fill his character, and the ultimate attempt to pull me deeper into the world, which he was so brutally struck in his first harvest. <br /> <br /> It's as poetic as I can when I'm talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I threw a flying coin house over serious sentimentality and I complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto, a blood-driven assassin, After looking at Azum 2 I began to evaluate the above-mentioned shortcomings more than ever. <br /> <br /> The assignment of every assassin knows not only the weak and uninspirit, but many important elements have also been omitted from the experience. In Azumi 1, we saw that assassins use a variety of stealth tactics (which is their first priority) and logic to make their characters work easily with quick executions and faster escape capabilities. But I don't hold it too much against this film because this story is a little twisted and there are many more obstacles to Azum's way of preventing him from reaching the warlord and showing signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is stupidly put on the shelf for most movies and basically plays the Go Go toned version, which subtracts the cool weapon and the sense of threat. <br /> <br /> This leads me to the final blow that is, just to hide in the title epic "death" side. In the first half of the movie, we see the debut of many promising opponents with flashy and even faster weapons. No one will be surprised that they will meet in one way or another, but the film will be short if each of them dies too quickly and too easily. In Azumi 1, young assassins were mostly able to resist quickly, but with somewhat satisfactory battles, and the final showdown between Azum and Bijomaru compared to the struggles in Azumi 2 was at least worthwhile and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were used, but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the lack of each collision. In no way do I knock the usual samurai film style with these quick and realistic battles, but the characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and animated that the rules could have been interrupted and the action should have been enriched. br /> <br /> Azum's romantic side is to spend time between fighting scenes, and unfortunately it is not the end result and does not provide much needed solution. <br /> <br /> An open mind for many different movies and animations, I wouldn't lie and testify to my neutrality and unimpressiveness over the first Azumi movie, but I'll go right and say that after Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. What's worth, Azumi 2: Death or love could have gone straight to the video, its invisibly richer budget, and the unfortunate potential of adding or even expanding to the desperate path of desperate assassinations, making every effort to restore peace. steadfast courage to die.
