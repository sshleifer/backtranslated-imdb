Somewhere in this movie is a half-hour episode of The Twilight Zone that is trying to get out. When Cube was tight, well done, claustrophobic and peace of mind, I'm afraid Cypher is surprised by annoying, many well-worn topics that just don't add much, especially if you've seen almost no other semi-decent sci-fi movie before. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to drag to his incomplete end in all his relatively short 95 minutes. No characters interfere with each other, and in 2002, the technology is truly a joy. This tireless and unsolicited movie is hard to connect with the Cube Director. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good thing. <br /> <br /> If you look at the grass growing and droughting, and it's boring, let's look at this movie anyway, but other activities will probably be more stimulating.
