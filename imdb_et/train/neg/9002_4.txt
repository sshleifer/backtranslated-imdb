OK .... I have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and CHEESY! The only redeeming feature of this movie is Dean Cain. Besides that - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has some promise in the concept - the underground lab creates a real living fire breathing dragon - basically giving us a "Jurassic Park". "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great opportunities, but they just don't follow ... Special effects are decent - although you know that dragon is CGI, it's not terribly LOOK like CGI .... > <br /> I would not prosecute Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers), I would blame Phillip Roth, the director and writer. It's his job to make this movie .... and unfortunately failed.
