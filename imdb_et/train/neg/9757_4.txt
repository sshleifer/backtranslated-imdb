Not the biggest movie that remembers Paul Naschy. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst sword game I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came when the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is described as adventure and horror. Forget the fear - there is no one. No nudity, blood, monsters; only Robin Hood's adventure with the evil baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be king. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the movie was to see Graciela Nilson, who made only four films in two years and lost our regrettable loss. Where did he go?
