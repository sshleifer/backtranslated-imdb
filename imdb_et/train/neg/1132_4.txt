The stellar story that has been born has greatly expanded the idea of ​​the preparatory phase seems to be extremely successful. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a self-evident young woman, imprisoned by herself, but never convincing as a growing celebrity, who both wins and makes a difference. Even in the long scenes of Esther's lessons, we never see him in the teacher's instructions. After suffering the pain of Esther's (largely self-inflicted) pain in the tormenting detail, we are not given any convincing sense of our triumph. . However, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual treason) have never come together as a whole. A 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit its open ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go to the audience.
