I find it hard to see why this piece was wrapped around the trash. The only saving grace in this whole is Ariauna's body in her sexy uniform. His humor must also be evaluated. He's a sure plus, but unfortunately this magician would take the garbage to save it. But he must be positively recognized for his heroic effort and true professionalism. It cannot be said that he speaks to his star Lilith with his tune in the nervous system. Apparently there was no interest and the impression that his presence in the kit was all necessary. Everything, except Ariauna's performances, is indeed the ultimate trash.
