This is one of those films that should have been better than what turned out to be. I'm afraid to think about what Blockbuster-approved editing had to look like, because the director's cut DVD had an epic proportion. Of course, it is not expected to be a "godfather", but a working class or two could have been convenient. <br /> <br /> Also in this movie were so much cute, but they were badly underestimated. I like to look at your BVDs as much as the next boy, but even I have the right to wait a little more. However, this was not a complete loss; at least we got a glimpse of Drew Fuller's (covered) spam and a really annoying hairstyle. And there is Huntley Ritter, who looks even nicer when he made "Bring It" (and acted as well). There is always a silver lining, kids. You just have to look very hard for that. And sometimes you need to use your pause button.
