Frankly, I do not understand why this film is so good here, and why Bakshi himself thought it was his best film. I'm a big fan of Baksh's earlier work - especially Heavy Traffic and Wizards, but frankly "Wizards" (1977) was the last good movie he did. After that, he turned to the mainstream, starting with the notorious Lord of Rings, and then hanging heavy sword and witchcraft with Frank Frazetta for "Fire and Ice". <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is crazy, the animation is the quality of the television - I insist that it is much worse than its 70s - and whereas "Wizards" had real imagination, ghost, some gorgeous background arts and underground, adult sensitivity , Fire and Ice is just for 14-year-old boys and has an intellectual impact on Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you liked Gor books, you might like it. In my opinion, it was still another slip in quality after the "Wizards", which Bakshi never recovered (although he has recently made quite decent TV shows) <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10
