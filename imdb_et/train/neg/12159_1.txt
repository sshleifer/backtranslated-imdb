I can't believe I actually looked at it, but I think I just wanted to know if this movie would be more fun and fun. and it did. The peak was the worst result of lawyers in the Defense Forces - in real life, that even a fictional story was too weird. somehow no one on this planet can behave like a court. and probably the worst prosecutor in the world. why did he meet anyway? he did nothing or absolutely nothing to prove his guilt. a simple search of his house would have led to the discovery of rings. but not going. he preferred to say "objections" 2 or 3 times throughout the trial - that was it. blonde lunatic got the medicine of truth to prove her innocent but not brett. Lunatic had an almost home Brett altar that could prove his illness. but not again. During the trial, I felt a quiet desire to take the needle out of my hand and shine it several times against his head. even the real strangers don't look that foolish fake "I am innocent" as he did. and what does this film tell us? Never marry a woman who has life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs, she is thrown into jail, guilty or not. evil, evil men.
