This movie is being shown on the cable lately, so .. <br /> <br /> These two attractive women have no excuse to fight Luke Wilson or the same coat of the same movie. Female actors are very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I think "funny" is that Luke's even dirty / dorkier / stupider friend is around, but well, that's what we get. <br /> <br /> Either woman never does EVER talking to any male for more than 5 minutes. What we get are those that rob and cry and fight, and so on, more than 2 guys best described on Friday the 13th. 4. Dead * @ $ #
