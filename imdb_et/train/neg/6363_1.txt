I haven't seen this movie yet and I think it may be the first one. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I didn't really follow the end of it. It was like watching dull soap or really good (all soaps are crap). The participants were poor and the storyline was bad. The person who appreciated it is not sure what he is. The script was terrible. 2 People were in the rain with the dangers in the conversation and you think a good boy says something really good and beats him, but no. He says, "If you do that ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, take a look. Please don't watch this movie because ... It's CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Bad action, bad fight, bad script. <br /> <br /> Don't look! Of course this is my opinion.
