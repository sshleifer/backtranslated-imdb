I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. I think she (woman) protests too much. The whole thing sounded like the author would have tried to convince himself! He places multiple prophetic literature (writings of the same time period but not related to the Bible) many times, but I can think of at least three references that are above my head, giving historical accuracy to Bible events. Anyone can twist the data and prove something they like, but it doesn't do it. Customs changes, word definitions change over time (see English and German, where it is obviously a common root). Nothing will change, always grow and change. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James version is what I've found to be the best when it comes to any research. In the King James version, you notice that certain words are written in italics. These words are added by translators and can be omitted and the average of the entire verse changes. Letters from all the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without dots and without numerical verses. These writings look like one long word and the translators added all the words above. For example, how would you read it: GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is here? The same sequence of stars has two completely different meanings. That's why many biblical scholars use the word "translation" because it gives the word for the original Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew translation, depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when interpreted as a symbolic logic, you can prove that God exists, but you cannot prove that he does not exist! Finally, I love to just listen to people who think they are so smart that they are skilled in almighty. Talk about the ego! Removing Soapbox, God Bless Maegi
