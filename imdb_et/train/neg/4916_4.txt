This film, which hit in 1970, is not well outdated, but frankly, it wasn't so good at the time of release. But it was a tremendously popular success, perhaps because the idea of ​​fatalistic young love must have turned to a audience saturated with constant television in the Vietnam War. The plot is a clean drivel because it concerns the privileged Harvard hockey player Oliver Barrett IV, who meets and falls in love with Jenny Caveller, who is proud of his working class. Her old-school father naturally understands Jiee and a typical rebellion, which means that the young couple marries in one of these hippie ages. He lands his dream job in New York but suddenly becomes ill and dies of his terminal illness. Directed by Arthur Hiller, he has introduced modern film making techniques, but none of them can hide the old-fashioned cliché story at its core. The inevitable end left me really unmoved. <br /> <br /> Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw received the stars of Oliver and Jenny with this film, but inexplicably because they do not seem to be able to communicate the depth or complexity they need to make their characters convincing. At least boyfriend O'Neal is sincere with his weakly shameful approach, but MacGraw behaves like wood and smirk to make it hard to see what Oliver Jenny sees next to his sarcastic façade. John Marley (two years before he found the "The Godfather" in his bed was a lost racer) does it better than Jenny's plainspoken baker father Phil, as well as Ray Milland as seemingly insensitive to Barrett's paterfamilias. Too familiar Frances Lai's music has almost become a parody over the years. The print quality of the DVD is good, although the only premium is the Hiller comment line. The most interesting bit of a trivia is that the author Erich Segal (whose book is based on this film) understood Oliver as two Harvard roommates he knew? Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, who has one part of Oliver's roommates in the film.
