Cities are the most beautiful film I've ever seen, and I saw Blair's witch films (Parts 1 and 2). It seems confused about what he wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not enough to watch. It has scenes from a person who carats karate / bloody karate, so I think this film is a vein of toxic avenger and street rubbish. Then, without warning, he jumps into the drama of a lost girl, a woman with a mental disability, and a trusting mother. Then it will only collide with a good part of the film that seems to have been created like a sitcom without a laugh. The part I am talking about is lonely TOWNIE, who is so lonely that she is concerned about a rotting body. It was ONLY part of the movie that gave me some feeling. The rest was the waist of my life. Then just to show how CRUEL Wayne exists, there is a certain document at the end of the Wayne (director) movie that makes Tobyst (star) fun for the public. It made me sick. Although Killer Nerd and Killer's bride (two other Wayne films) are not the best, they have at least thought enough to have fun until the end. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, he still had some great features I still use. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like pan-European movies and if you want to watch your feet, just for a rest, if they are, you don't like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br />
