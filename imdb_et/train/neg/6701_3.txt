I've been an environmentalist for years and I was really looking forward to this show. I was set to record all the episodes because I thought I could really learn some great new things. I probably could if I could get out of Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I am sure many of them are staged to seem like a reality and turn to this viewer class. It doesn't work for anyone who is really interested in perfecting the planet. <br /> <br /> This example should be called Nagging with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Because Ed is such a big font, maybe another idea that is really serious about the environment is a good idea. Some of us don't have to suppress things. <br /> <br /> I will no longer record episodes or look at an example, but let me know if there may be a real green show.
