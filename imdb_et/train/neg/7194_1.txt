In line with Disney's known stealing method. I mean .. buying the known properties and looting them, this venerable comic classic-action version must be one of the worst years of badly doing it again. I grew up in the original cartoon series. Any episode of the original comic book gives you more laugh than this whole movie. There is no Penny cool computer book. There is also no hand with self-destructive commands that can always detonate the head. The new one is a smooth spoken gadget that is a convertible (the original comic was a cooler vehicle that could become a van or a car) and a typical unrealistic Hollywood romance. Don't make money to pay for Disney managers and even their _ex_executives - don't see this movie. <br /> <br />
