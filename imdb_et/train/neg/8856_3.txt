Lee hosted Ted Newsom's 100 years of horror and talked about filmmakers. He said something that his only lycanthropy brush was The Howling II, then he shouted, "The less you talk about it, the better." Indeed, he was right, because this film may be the worst of all his screen performances. The first Joe Dante clot was a groundbreaking werewolf movie with incredible special effects and combing style and substance. It was a film that needs to be taken seriously. As with other good original films, the filmmakers thought that some strange reason would be needed for the camp queue rather than the first (see CHUD and CHUD II for explanation of this point). This movie is miles and miles away from all front pages. There is absolutely nothing to fear about this. It looks cheap and is black for most major scenes. Lee is the only actor worth mentioning (okay, I'll give Ferdy Mayne). Lee sees embarrassment when he says an angelic dialogue and makes ridiculous things (see that it ends with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what is more understandable than the two who leave America to Romania. The story is not really worth exploring here, and you can bet you have very little to say if you need to start playing a lot of movie and ending with this horrible noise at Stephen Parsons and his band Babel. Sybil Danning is here, and, yes, he chooses once and then we get this scene over and over again - one reviewer said 17 times (I thought ten - but this may be a bit forgotten from that moment). I gave the movie to three stars, but it deserves a zero - the three I gave is for 1 Lee and two for Ds. Danning's contribution. Yuck!
