No wonder it appeared directly on DVD here in Australia, no redeeming feature ever. Dialogue was hokey, actress, terrible and script sucked! Who thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel or follow a far-fetched John Badham movie, the 80's Wargames, and they must have caused something because it was a bad idea! Amanda Walsh was good for this eye candy / love, while Matt Lanter was good than the other main driver - that's it. I wouldn't recommend Wargames: Dead Code to anyone, check out the hacker or the original Wargames movie - both are better than this piece!
