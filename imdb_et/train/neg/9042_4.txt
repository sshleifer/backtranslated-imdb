I wanted to like this movie. But it breaks down in the middle. the whole assumption is good and relates well, but the average runs out of touch. The people I looked at started to bother when it ran and hoping it would end sooner than it was. The second person actually fell asleep in the middle segment! I found myself during the day of the Schtick parts of the dream that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought this for candy in the eye and it did well, but there is no Pixar writing and no soul. I think kids 8 and below can enjoy the ride on the face of the whoop, while there is no plot. Individuals long enough to follow the plot will find it too far to come back quickly and easily. Edit most of the middle section, do it for 50 minutes and be a sure paw. I wish I had better say. But I don't
