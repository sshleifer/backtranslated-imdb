This film seems to have a tremendous response, but no one can critically criticize his methodology, which is extremely flawed. He continues to advocate journalistic style analysis, which means that he misses the viewers' lack of knowledge and prejudices to create emotional weakness and negative diatribe outbreaks. <br /> <br /> Press 101: Tell the viewer nothing but the preference for making predictable conclusions. for example, was the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc. all supposedly unexpected answers to the collapse of government infrastructure after Hussein's death: wouldn't they be all the symptoms of a poor culture? Doctrinal inflaming as a symptomatic symbol of these veins of Islam, not the inability of police forces to limit and insure? are they more likely to declare the US Route Act? I am sure that the documents here would have exploded with the charges of the police state and the fascist force. <br /> <br /> After the movie's analytical idiot, it takes a couple of communication lines and leaves the rest of the statements "so-and-so I refused to interview ..." but the questions they would have asked are undoubtedly already answered by the hundreds of knowledge these individuals have already received. Would you, Vice-President, would like to be the first to interview a writer / producer who was already amped by his words. they couldn't roll the Condi tape to actually show their opinion and answer some questions about logistics, maybe they weren't watching his hearing. <br /> <br /> This is far from being a neutral look at the situation there. this is another biased, asinine-based approach to journalists - which are large, unimaginable herds. <br /> <br /> Anyone wishing to comment on the war should have at least their idea based on things that are slightly more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN's comment. these interpretations break the same vitriol that simply creates a two-way attitude towards those who want to think, and those who want the media to say what to think.
