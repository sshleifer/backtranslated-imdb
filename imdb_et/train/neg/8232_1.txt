Five Whole Eyes Not Worth the Wrist, I have to admit that at one point I was really worried about for about 30 seconds no one made a noise and I thought my speakers had blown or that I was constantly shouting as a deaf and High exposure, Me and speakers are grateful now that you asked wisely enough that it was the best bit of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't waste time telling you a plot, read the other comments for it. <br /> <br /> If you bought this DVD but haven't packed it yet, don't take it back and claim your money back, I've wasted it. > <br /> I was actually yelling at the TV, "they're here in the car, looking for the camera lights and taking the camera first," I've left out the adjectives, but you might think where they're going. <br /> <br /> If someone wants to buy this movie (it's really good), it's ten times for you.
