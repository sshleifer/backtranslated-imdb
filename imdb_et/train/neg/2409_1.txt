It was a painful experience, the whole story actually exists, so I'm not going into it, but the actor was terrible when that part was at first, when the scientist brother goes to work before he leaves home to work, I thought working with bio-safety material meant that you should wear sterilized clothing in a controlled environment and the lab looks like a co-laboratory with this monitor on top of the file cabinet that has nothing to do with all the scene that's just there to be technical and the scientist eats in the laboratory lab dangerous labeled jar and his boss walks him and tells him nothing about ... not to mention bad behavior very bad nothing worse than that my advice doesn't look and i thought something wouldn't be worse than dead house because Uwi Boll's movies look like a classic Shakespeare!
