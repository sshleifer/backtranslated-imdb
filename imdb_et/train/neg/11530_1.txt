Over the past ten years, I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, led many pro wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked with 2 different wrestling TV programs, and made voice transmissions and comments with many wrestling videos. I have never seen how Splatter Rampage Wrestling has found an amateur foolishness, lack of talent and skill, and poor quality of production. Listing it, even if it is any wrestling video, is a direct misuse of that word. Videos taken with low dollar camcorders are essentially kids who play fighting behind the yard. Sound quality is poor, video quality is poor and performance is terrible. "Wrestlers" wear a costume that has hand-drawn tea shirts and a ski mask, and hits each other with different items and semi-imitating wrestling races. Sometimes "matches" are grass. Sometimes there is a trampoline in the backyard. EVERYTHING is badly behaved and done in the absence of any wretched skill. In short, don't worry about this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both for me), you are very disappointed.
