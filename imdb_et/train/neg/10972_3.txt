It wasn't a Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie movie. It was a big wannabee. It wanted to be a nervous, nervous laughter, a film confirming city life, but it was a nervous, confusing camera. It is much easier to emulate something other than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning I didn't care less about the characters or the ones they were related to. They always hit each other, pissing or crying. There was nothing they did. The inter-character dialogue is meant to be in the tree, revealing, instead of being tritiated, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers who really liked this movie so I could be wrong.
