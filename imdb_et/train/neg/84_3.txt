As a child, I thought the gun that the murderer had used was cool, but I was a kid, and so I was a little stupid. Even as a stupid boy, the film was stupid and a bit boring when the killer didn't use his light knife to kill people. I am amazed at the fact that the film is really sure. What script they read when they participated in this movie, because it is the most sure boring and only tool that shows a slight sword color. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is completely chaotic. The whole movie seems to be rotating around aliens and one weapon. The plot has two children and some guys who have a stranger meeting, flash years later and seem to be returning as it was in the mix. Dead animals and those that need to be studied, and for some reason, one guy gets a weapon of aliens and continues to use it to go to a very easy killing spree. Seriously, you just have to think about why this film is made if you have a killer with good death scenes, if you plan to show alien meetings more than weird light, and if you intend to have light sabers and call yourself star wars.
