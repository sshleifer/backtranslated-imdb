I went to see it a few days ago and it's hard to forget about this movie. This movie should be funny, it's not a laugh in the theater (maybe josé garcia and gérard Depardieu) and it's boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it was hard to understand what they said. They just talk quickly and don't open enough to understand us. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I tried to say after the line that was supposed to be funny "what he said," and I'm French. I do not want to say that given the fact that I think good films have been made here, but I apologize for all the foreigners who see the movie (if it is ever shown outside of France). <br /> <br /> We are deeply sorry for this p @ p. 2/10
