This animated inspector Gadget movie is pretty flat. The story is very weak, and there is little action. Most of the characters are given little to nothing to do. the movie is a little fun at best, but really does not go where and is pointless.it's watchable, but only just and is nowhere near the caliber animated TV show from 80's.it is not a movie that bears repeated viewing, at least my mind.it is just about 74 minutes, including credit, so I think it's a good thing. Like a TV show, the characters are not worth it here. He wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who really cares? Anyway, it's just my opinion. The last gadget case is disappointing 3/10
