- The film crew captures a horror film in an old, supposedly cursed house, where seven people have died mysteriously over the years. One team finds an old book and it seems to be ideal for use in a ritual scene in their film. It is justifiable that the book's spells are better written than the script they use. But when the book is read, the tomb will suddenly come to life. Now it is cast and the team is facing a real threat. <br /> <br /> - IMDb lists 90 minutes of driving time. Nothing happens in these 60 minutes. The movie takes too much time in the movie. Should we have a scary movie they're taking? We already know that their movie is not "real". These fears just don't work. <br /> <br /> - There are very few things about the seven-hull house. Operation is cruel. Most of these "participants" would have difficulty playing primary school. The result is terrible. It is very reminiscent of the 70s TV series and does not give the atmosphere. Speaking of the atmosphere, with a few moments at the end of the movie, there is nothing to talk about. The logic of the characters is all but nonexistent. Even in the movie, you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here I don't think I remember one scene where a character didn't choose the most illogical way for them. And finally, these first 60 minutes are already mentioned in the movie. Do you say BORING? <br /> <br /> - I haven't rated a seven-hull house because of lower cases where the film (probably at random) actually works. My two favorites are start and end. Seven previous owners are killed in the order of the title, and this may be a highlight of the movie. And big stairwells as zombie threats, the end scenes of the film crew are somewhat effective (what is an audible signal). All in all, these moments are not good enough to make a movie.
