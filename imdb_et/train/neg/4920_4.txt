The very slick modern (keeping it sensually hip) renews the story of Drakula (although it is a traditional tradition) rather interesting, if not fully grasped, of the prince of darkness. For the first time, when I tried it, I could lose it before I lost interest. Again, this is going to be a good start (especially with thieves and then with Dracula), but then it fell as I hit New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never used its settings (despite the etching of paradise by the devil where Dracula can flourish). Compiled by Wes Carven (and they will throw this name out) but wrote / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically, these moments were little dreamy visuals, but some kinetic edits and cheap jols did not help. Dirty script doesn't get much stupid. Lussier does a polished job that remains quite glassy, ​​adding a lot of blood (makeup fits well) and lots of "virgin" advertising. No, I don't mean a virgin, it's a music company because it gets in many shots and a daughter in Helsinki. Oh, it wasn't obvious planting. The soundtrack is a fun choice for rock stumps. Now the shows are all over the shop, but there are some familiar faces on the spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler, like Dracula, just didn't come out because a large part of the presence wasn't formed. She was just succulent women at night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan Dracula as brides. The similarities of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectful. Christopher Plummer gives out grizzled because Van Helsing and Omar Epps have fun with their role.
