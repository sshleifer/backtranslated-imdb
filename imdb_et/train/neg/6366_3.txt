There was no redemption factor in this movie. My girlfriend and I love both things. Especially fighting scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was fantastic), but this movie was not fun. Twenty minutes of talking and "angry" facial expressions worked for five minutes. The main hero is the restless character who has seen the battle and is therefore forced to look at constipation all the time. In addition to improving its combat methods, the army has interrupted its bowel movement. Music is not good. They fight in the street rap and hip-hop style because these boys are beating. The rest of the soundtrack is the background noise of dramatically lower budget. <br /> <br /> All this movie is a classic B-style. Actors give their lines as if they were reading them from smart cards and the lines would have been lit and burned in some rotten Hollywood streets. The film is called "Honor", but there was no honor for making this film. It was just a waste of money and understanding of spending is, in my opinion, venerable. <br /> <br /> Go see Felon instead. Fighting scenes and situations are more realistic.
