In the Fans series, I have to admit that the hidden boundary is not so bad at all. However, the review of this series cannot be based on whether it is a fan series or not. The initiative is laudable in itself. Creativity as well. I think they are people with ordinary jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But doing this job. Pulling all these resources. Taking all this time and all these shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the action and the lines are terrible. For most. The dialogues belong to the 70's military show, not to Star Trek. The captain (Mr Squinty) looks like he's gonna laugh at any time. And most of the symbols read their lines. Directors should be aware of the fact that "restarting" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also think the series has been made by "Two Takes Frakes" who led many TNG episodes and movies. I also couldn't help but thought most of the participants were typical of Trekkies. This assumption does not go deeper. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern for the whole project is the quality of the releases. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series - why didn't they make it available in decent quality? Using a fast time format is a waste of low, low-resolution talents. Even "higre" episodes are considered to be of poor quality compared to standard quality series. Using the Xvid codec with higher resolution and file size would greatly improve the experience. If a problem band were a problem, creating a torrent tracker would have solved it. <br /> <br /> We hope that the team will decide to brush the series and possibly release it on the DVD, giving it the quality of the project.
