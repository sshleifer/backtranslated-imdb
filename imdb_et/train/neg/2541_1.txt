Never saw the original movie in the series ... I hope it was a much better film than the 1980's, if not how these two terrible sequences were even justified. This film was a very good lead when they advertised it to show it in one of the old independent stations that are now in the past. Anyway, it seemed to be a pretty scary movie. But it was a movie that made some Walt Disney movies dark. Indeed, this film was just a bunch of light fluff, where virtually no dirty creature was present. The only real vision is almost to the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rain, except that there is practically no sign of a creature that was really disappointing as a child. The story is basically old evil hunters have to kill all they see and are after a striking stream of creature and kids are out to help out, or just some casual hairy man in the woods that likes to pull casual boats through the water. Not quite worth a look, but I would like to see the original, to which the maker would have given a bad striking creature in the 80s, but he also made a very good slasher film in the 1970s "The Town the Dreaded Sundown".
