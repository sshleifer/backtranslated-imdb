SPOILERS. Strangely, people with a rich taste have reviewed this movie. Allow me to add balance by emphasizing the following: <br /> <br /> Script: terrible. As Tom and Dan know each other, the films clearly tell that one person is talking, and I suspect that it was the director who carefully considered his words. At one point, Dan asks, "Have you heard of HIV?" and it sounds so natural to ask, "Are you in touch with nine alien competitions?" <br /> <br /> Action: White teeth do not do and twisted face is not a sensitive performer. Speedman did quite well what he gave, but I think Marsden was terrible - atypical, incredible and downright insidious and smelling in all his captivity. His performance is empty (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: Save Me! The moments of half-life were not exciting, but irritating and weak. Recall that Marsden tries to try the keys on the door and then cast them down: "They're not working, man!" Make hee. And be cautious of the semi-black-and-white setbacks that begin with the sound of some CSI and other crime dramas. Most importantly, the most dangerous, evil and offensive homophobia (foreign or internal, you decide) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan could take the condom off or not at all - excuse me, where was Tom during sex? The installation partner is somewhat uneven, which is usually a homosexual man. <br /> <br /> In summary: Beware!
