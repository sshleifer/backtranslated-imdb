"Secretary" is one of those cheesy, cliched, "thrillers" that one has viewed on Sunday afternoon when there is almost nothing else. Although the plot (a demented woman becomes jealous of anyone who succeeds in her office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them), it may be sort of, I felt countless plot twists, probably taken from other TV movies I had the same for a reason. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, I was not cast. Mel Harris is one of those actors who appear in so many TV films as "mothers" or "victims" of some kind of deception or abuse, that one must marvel at what life he is leading. In this, she can enjoy the sacrifice of mother and psychologist Sheila Kelly, who was not a good choice as a villain. Although Sheila Kelly has done some good career tasks (Singles, Breaking In, and I think Law and Order), she is also among the scary TV movie roles and it just adds to it. As for the others, I have no clear memory of them, so I have to say something. <br /> <br /> It plays in a lifetime network (I think it's where I saw it), but don't bother to see it if you're not too boring for words. Not that it would make you more excited ...
