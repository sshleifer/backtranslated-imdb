It's a bad movie. None funny bad. It's bad bad. It was actually a painful look. The direction was terrible, where many green and yellow tones using characters lead characters to the sick. Keira Knightly wasn't at all a sure chick and I can't believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed this cellulose criminal waste. The script was terrible and the action was like a nail plate. If you haven't seen it, don't. You're missing something and destroying only two hours of your life, looking at this generation. I've seen bad movies before and enjoyed them even because of their mistakes. It's just a waste of time.
