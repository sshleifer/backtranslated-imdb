I'm a Christian ... and I feel this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nobody, but the hard core, the Bible's Christians, don't like this movie. The message is just your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you need to be so subtle. You can't slide your bible around your father and wear it in a comprehensive scene. RIDICULOUS! Bad direction. The disclosure of missing people should have been terrible, but it was ridiculous. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood films: "Oh my God! People are gone!" This scene on the plane is just stupid. Think about it: if you find your relative's clothes next to you, you just won't shout "Oh my God. They disappear! They're lost!" and start crying and yelling. You would first be denying ... you just don't jump to that conclusion. See Jodie Foster on FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite image is a dog sitting on a lawn with clothes and boots next to it. I fell off the couch, so I was so laughing. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and disturbed. That's exactly what the composer would have in his own country. "Here's my chance to make a thriller," "here's my chance to act!" STOP TELLING ME HOW TO TAKE JAMES COVELL! A good result supports what is happening on the screen ... this film needed more UNDER score, but instead it was as much of your face as the message. <br /> <br /> Writing was empty. So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was worse: "You don't understand! People are gone!". Brad Johnson was ridiculous. Two challenging performances came from Anti-Christ and the older man (sorry, they don't remember their names) Looking at "making" (to answer my question what they think?), Producers and filmmakers and actors are just mistaken ... saying, "we get broad audience "and" brad johnson is amazing "and" it's like a Hollywood movie ". I came to the conclusion that they just didn't know what they were doing. <br /> <br /> I appreciate your efforts. Sending a message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best way to do it. Watch movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF CHRIST, even O'BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? The bottom line is that the film had to be made by people with talent and vision. Unfortunately, it wasn't.
