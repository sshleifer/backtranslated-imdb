Forest is not only your daily standard butterfly / hemp price, but also an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story is about two pairs of hikers on a camping trip. Takes these cave houses, cannibalistic foresters and ghosts of his dead wife and two children. There is something you can't see. Director Don Jones becomes an "A" effort, although the film itself falls on almost all levels, the actor is just an average, except Jeanette Kelly, who plays the dead man of the foresters (Michael Brody or Gary Kent). /> <br /> The film opens with some beautiful pictures of a couple hiking through the valley and the forest. They understand too late that someone is pursuing them. Both are sent at the usual fare. Our killer uses reliable hunting throughout the film, except during a setback when he applies hand, raincoat and rusty saw blade to send his lover's deceased lover. <br /> <br /> Forest has a good story, but the movie just doesn't work with it. I found it quite boring just by crappy action. 4/10
