I don't often make them out, but if the film that had attracted such attention had ever been, it's "Gas!" It is a self-conscious mess that reaches some M * A * S * H ​​atmosphere and remains completely flat in the experiment. <br /> <br /> I see what Corman was doing - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's dead role in M ​​* A * S * H ​​in his original film version ("Whiffs" - watch it in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / Learn more.) <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould approached the brass finger "Whiffs" when Corman made "Gas!" but didn't get there. Neither of these films even reached the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with gas? What's not? No one really reaches a higher level at the higher school theater level. Production values ​​smell. Someone else mentioned magically regenerating headlamps at the car and there is more lack of attention to detail. Nothing does the way this movie should do it, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually made me sleep. It's not sure about insomnia, but really close. Cinematic Sleep Induction scale "Gas!" falls somewhere between "last year's Marienbad" and George Clooney's "Solaris" relocation (which was remarkable because it was more boring than Mosfilm's original, despite the seemingly unknown idea of ​​keeping the audience focused on reasonable editing). br /> <br /> Interesting editing would have destroyed "Gas!" about twenty minutes. The result would be pointless but no more than the original film. <br /> <br /> Certain movies are so bad that they have compelling qualities that make them look. It's not one of them. Don't waste your time. It's not even badly bad.
