Well! What can you say? First, this adjustment is too long within 4 hours because of the complexity of the plot (or lack of it). The participants are really trying to do something about this movie, but there is too little content for that time. Swayzee is not really the character of Quaterman at all. After Sean Connery's interpretation of a big man in the "Extraordinary Gentlemen's League", Swayzee doesn't really make the ball. This wincher's repeated rifle head is not part of the strength, strength, nuance or humor needed for the part, and it has been amplified by everyone, including the magician who otherwise seems more convincing than the actor as the rest. Some views are nice, but there are foolish mistakes in cinematography. For example. When a happy team reaches the water hole in the middle of the desert, their paths are visible to the oasis, waiting for them to walk. The exit from the mine leads to the exit (in the next picture), like something like the way out, which is seen from the passage through the passage, and others. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any time. Somehow I want him to. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Quatermain Russians is a stigmatized stereotypical character who simply takes everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee is doing pretty well as a sad father, back to London, who can't take care of his son. Swayzee should stick to this. He is not capable of wearing a brave gentleman who has the heart of the stout, the life experience and the feeling of a fair game. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
