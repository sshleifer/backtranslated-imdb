This is probably the most boring, worst and useless film I saw last year. On the plot that had some philosophical aspects, I got a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with lots of clich√©s: lonely wolf dog, good looking, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with his gun ... + nice hard worker and shy but good looking scientist, you add 2 cents plot and you have me, robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands such as FedEx, Audi, chat, etc. This film smells of commercialization and tends to be a bad ad point, which unfortunately does not end in 30 seconds. I do not recommend this to my worse enemy if you have free time, check out good TV shows or read a nice book.
