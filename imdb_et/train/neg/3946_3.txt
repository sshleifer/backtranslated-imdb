I've grown up reading comics and books at Modesty Blaise, and she's really a heroine. Although I was not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I still had the interest to hear a couple of years ago that he was considering making his movie: can he finally give the Modestyle a nice big screen that he deserves? I heard a few months ago of "My name is modest" and I checked the letters here and was not surprised that the score was not too high, because beloved characters often have the heart of melting fans if not done correctly. So I decided not to read the reviews and see the movie instead, and well, I just stopped watching it and I'm stunned and sad and yes, pretty furious. Sad and furious, giving more than an hour to see something awesome when Modesty Blaise becomes a film that has nothing to do with the viewer or fan. <br /> <br /> It seems that almost everything about this movie is sub-par and unprofessional, although I have to admit that some other film participant has seen where they were good, so I can't blame them. But the scenario and management ... my god, why even make this type of mess with output values ​​slightly higher than your average TV movie, but what's much worse? I don't know the background of this movie and I really don't want to know, but I just can't be surprised how Tarantino can say straight on Earth that he loves modesty and then put his name on it? He just lost great respect in my eyes. The director was not the right person for this job and I can honestly tell him that I was destroyed by my night. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars and these stars go to actors and technical quality that might have been worse. The other seven stars are what this film was not good for. Oh, hopefully at some point, there will be serious productivity from The Modesty Blaise Movie, which has some other goals than stealing Modesty fans. Although people like Tarantino are those who make decisions, I don't breathe.
