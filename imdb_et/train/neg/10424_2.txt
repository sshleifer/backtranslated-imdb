I should love this movie. the actress is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the film has always looked very fine to me. film makes working class people small and inexpensive. The fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise is always a little uneasy to me. Barbara Stanwyck as her mother worships her daughter, but her daughter gives up her love of finding happiness with her benevolent father. I don't know how many others who have seen this movie know it. I really don't like the story. just personal preference. thank you
