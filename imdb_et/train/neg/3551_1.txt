This movie is just terrible !!!! Slow acting, slow reaching and wooden characters that just shouldn't have been there. The best part was Iron Maiden singing in a certain theater and that was. the end was worth watching and waiting, but that was it !! The characters in this movie made me almost sleep. Avoid it !!!
