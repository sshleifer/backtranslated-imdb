Jeux d'enfants or how the movie was translated wrong into English Love me, if you dare to be a movie of foolish people and stupid people. I just don't know how to expect such a plot to be worth the film: two stupid unknown children bet that everyone does something (definitely very idiotic) to prove to each other (wtf?) That they are "cool debris". I know I exaggerated some aspects, but that's the whole movie. They get older ... and instead of realizing that they are just a few alien strangers, they continue their madness, thinking they are big people. <br /> <br /> Such a movie could be expected from Hollywood, but France? It is even more offensive to watch a movie from a country that has created Amelie a few years ago and is trying to find a movie, but is far away, very far away. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
