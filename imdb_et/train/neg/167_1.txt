Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series or even a hint about it should shame the series. Borg does not come before Q brings entrepreneurship to the Gamma sector, Klingon never sees Kirk until they come in contact with them, NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship that had the name of the company .... I need to go? Berman and Pilliar have made a look at Gene Roddenberry's work. After the death they saw just $ $ $$ and just went their way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in all the star excursions, up to this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a big actor, just like the whole cast. I like them all, but the story is tragic and ignores all the precedents set in the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people looked at Deep Space 9 (which was canceled prematurely).
