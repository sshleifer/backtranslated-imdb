Who wrote it? Some guy named John Cohen. I think it was the first scenario he ever worked on. Someone should have told him that you should write a dialogue that sounds like someone someone actually says. <br /> <br /> And who led it? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut is far from the tree. Someone may have wanted to let him know that you can actually take a picture of a scene in a cab in New York, and it looks real, and you don't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Perhaps he would have wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he learned the lesson. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... of course she can't act. Hell, he makes Jessica Alba like Audry Hepburn, and she's starring in this movie. Oh wait, it was his father's. Okay, that's why he got a part. This is really the only reason I think. <br /> <br /> So should I be surprised that this is bad? No. Should I be surprised how bad it is? I think many people would see if they saw as much as I did. I think you are waiting for a movie that is Jessica Simpson, but that ... it's not just bad, it's the classic movie quite the opposite. Think of the big film by Woody Allen, this movie is so bad when it's a good movie. This is the anti-Annie hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I didn't see it, I stopped watching ten minutes I couldn't continue. No doubt I'd come out of the theater earlier. Actually, I don't know how many of the 6 who saw the theater in the theater were watching and watching the whole thing. The film starts with a ridiculously bad start and then gets so bad that it becomes torture in China. And when the first action ends, you realize that it only gets worse when you have to leave yourself or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this movie belongs to the category is so bad that it should be used in Guantanamo Bay for watercraft. While some prefer water boarding.
