This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films taken down in Spain after the unexpected phenomenal advances of the Italian "Spaghetti" western countries, which are characteristic of such genres and include an eclectic selection of well-established and evolving international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Saval, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, however, this inconsistent brilliant example of the film is why most American genres died in the 1970s and are now extinct (or officially) extinct. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie not only because the West is one of my favorite films, but also because it had all the good features, including the intriguing assumption that it would be good - not to mention my father had bought A TOWN CALLED BASTARD on paper from its original communication! As it is, the only round of the film (if it can even be called) is its eccentricity alone: ​​for example, Stevens, who plays a widow for revenge who betrayed his revolutionary wife, sleeping inside the coffin. !), driven by his buggy maid (?) Sutton; In Savala, when the bleeding renegade, who initially appears to be the main villain of the film, is sent by his own henchman, Lettier, right at the beginning of the picture; then this work is directed by Landau, a villain, who, in the first scene of the film, sees beating alongside our legendary hero-priest Shaw! The blind peasant playing Fernando Rey is the only one who can identify the rebel Shawi, who has finally been just ahead. As you can see, the plot is very confusing and strange! The production team responsible for this film was also behind other western prices in about the same time as the WASH BREAK (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
