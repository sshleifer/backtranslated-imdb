Steven's friend, you remember when you said it: <br /> <br /> "Try to find the least resistance and use it without harming others. Live fairly and morally, not just with people, but with all beings." <br /> <br /> You haven't done that, you've been wounding your fans and their morals deadly with these "movies", I'm not even worried if I don't know you're so much better than I have seen videos, what you taught, you are so much better than why brother ... <br /> <br /> steam roll products are steaming, i promise bro i dont fear you, i'll tell you the truth about your face so we can fix it . <br /> <br /> Well as I like others sleeping 90%, but I was just tired and I had a great meal just an hour before serving with Sensai, which is what you do. 12 million? really? Do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000. It could have been in theaters and in a stroke if you wanted us to have donated money from a big profit to a homeless shelter or something. These post-production people hang you off in the absence of choreography, we can make a better person, the blink of an eye was from black men, I half it started to appear, or tommy lee Jones to say they were claws not eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal are you a captain of Aikido, why are you doing it for yourself, us? When you came to the scene, you had such a fresh direct style and it was obvious that you were a teacher, causing your moves to be so clear and crisp, watching your first three movies that felt you were teaching me something, now I feel that you are just ripped or something I feel I have to save you friend, this time you're the one who was killed and I'm going to get you revenge, helping you make the best movie ever. bro I know who you really are, I know the truth about the Nico movie. talk. <br /> <br /> contact me when I got fresh ideas, I am a voter, I swear you won't be disappointed with my attention to detail and we'll do it for fans, better for our fans, we hang, but direction will start immediately. I swear I won't let my movie out of the door with one mistake. I'm still trying to find out if it was ever the worst duplication or you have a laryngitis, but I promise I will get your voice as a flat **** who didn't even try. I hope you put him in the nuts as his payment. I can come up with a story and plot that can be matched with the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / house plant niche and promise that we will bring you back, I promise, I also want to go in the direction that makes people think if you allow me to allow , we make a film that people walk around and discuss it, provoke serious thinking, change perception. <br /> <br Steven Seagal This is my official who authorizes IMDb to release my contact information for you to restore one of the best martial arts heroes I've seen since the record is not Italian, it is Irish and Jewish you call it bad acting because I call it horrible action because you've believed in 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) Kinda is changing your perception is not.
