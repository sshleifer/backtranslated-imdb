I really mean how Charles Band, head of the full moon, would let the whole stink ball be like DEMONICUS. I mean, it should never start with a green light. The story is repetitive, the characters are at best weak, Tranus has no real story if he is a bad guy. Then they write to the writer or director the bad end. That's the wrong end, Demonicus rises. The last survivor escapes from the deadly cave, then Chimera lives, cheap, I can add and chase him. Then, when he goes home, the area is FUNHOUSE. The figure destroyed centuries ago reappears without any reason for it to collapse. That means it doesn't make sense. What the hell Charles thought about, making it a bunch, with four different movie companies who were desperate for the movies. They could ask me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. ATTENTION TO TURKEY.
