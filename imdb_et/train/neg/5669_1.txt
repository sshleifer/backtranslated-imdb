The director, equipped with chains and leather, warned the public at SF Frameline on Friday night that we saw an "experiential" movie. Experimental? Leave the camcorder in the back seat of the car, let the tape be seen and edited in all meaningless vision processes. A flattering pastiche road show in Manqu√©, which starts somewhere and leads to the audience. The violence that opened a free movie drove more than one patron from Castro Theater. I would have left too, but my cine friend needed to go home and he has the thing to see even worse to the end of the sea. By the time the lights came, the audience was greatly reduced. Bad applause. Formal project questions that seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
