First of all, I have to say that I've been working on an explosive and I've seen quite a few movies so it's hard for me to find something I've never seen. With this in mind, I want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film, it made me a pine for Gigli, my boss's daughter, and something else. BeLyt must be out of his mind, I found only one person he liked and even they couldn't tell me what the film was. If you can decipher this movie and tell me what it was, you have to be a writer or a fortune teller, because in other ways a person can say it. <br /> <br /> DREAM DAY!
