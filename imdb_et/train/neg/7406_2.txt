Well, how do I think it knew it was "stupid ass advertising" Lordi Motion Picture? I thought I realized it when this "dinosaur" costume appeared and when the singer made her look, I moved to "Hard Rock Hallelujah "for myself ... although I hate this song." The Dark Floors "are meant for a young autistic girl whom she is currently hospitalizing over a defensive father when they and the rest of the people in this particular elevator get trapped for a moment ... The hospital is empty ... Except the various monsters that apparently cause them ... They run through corridors and staircases, all heavy metal band members in their extreme, shock-rock costumes ... Something really memorable here, except sad action, lack of disability / nudity, and a totally shameless advertising sign, reminding me a lot of "KISS Park Phantom." Yes, remember et dud? I wish I did not ... I would advise simply to avoid all those Ghost House movies like a fungus and not to listen to Lord because they are Gwari's ripoff band!
