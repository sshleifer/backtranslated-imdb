The film was written ten years ago, and the other director designed it in the lead with SRK and Amir <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was directed by Vipul Shah and Ajay and Salman together with a tenth of HUM. DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> The film, however, is incomplete due to 90 years of behavior and worst gaps. <br /> <br /> The film tries to pack too many commercial ingredients and we also love the Triangle of Love. <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable and filmy and too cliche <br /> <br /> There are gaps in how Ajay drive away from London airport and take a seat for anyone? even when he starts his band, it is not convincing The other half gets better when Ajay's story destroys Salman, but unfortunately the climax ends and the movie ends with a bad comment <br /> <br /> Leaning Shah is lower than average Music is the worst point , most of the songs are mediocre <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ajay gives his best picture, although he is not convincing as a rock singer. but irritates her punjabi and talks nonsense that she only impresses when she gets the drug and Asin is nothing big just to show a piece of Ranvijay should adhere to MTV Om Puri is okay
