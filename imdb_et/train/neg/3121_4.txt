This movie is trash bin. It has a terrible taste and it is convincing for the pedestrian and the script, although it is based on supposedly real events - which adds nothing but disappointment. The direction is not well done because scenes and dialogue are inappropriate. Not sure what Robin Williams saw this character or story. First of all, Williams is not convincing as a relative in the relationship or the relationship itself is interesting. Worse still, his character is forced by a ugly pedophile story, which is the base and has no place as a plot device. You have an older Rory Culkin, who is nervously spraying "d_ck_smker" - with good fun that is both tedious and then laughed by Williams' character. Finally, you have Sandra Oh, who is the counselor of Williams Guardian and thrown an explanation at the end of the whole fiasco. The character of Toni Collete is simply amazing and again with the poorer directions of his sixth Sense. Very impossible.
