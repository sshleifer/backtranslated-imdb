Wow, I knew this film was bad, but not bad. The following spoilerific comments. Roddy Roddy Piper is a sick sweet retired policeman (cliche!), Helping everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient and dying over his dead son. His accepted son returns to the "special ops" of the armed forces, and since he has "seen things" represented by compression of teeth, when someone mentions something from the past. Time to clean up the streets from another man who once knew Piper and his dead son (who was killed by a bad son) and his son. <br /> <br /> Oh, love interest is a pretty young lady who decides there is no reason she wants to jump into the former army of bones. It takes about 2 minutes from 1 scene. <br /> <br /> Action could have saved this movie, but it is even worse than story and action. It's all done before, it's all done much better (Ong-Bak is the best example). This is the worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the movie is called HONOR (an error for Americans) and the tagline is "Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - see other director David Worths and you'll soon understand why they put these two movies there although they are over 10 years old. Classics like "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - say it all is really. <br /> <br /> I'll give you Â£ 10 if you don't see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - Excuse me for not knowing what the character names are, tells you something.
