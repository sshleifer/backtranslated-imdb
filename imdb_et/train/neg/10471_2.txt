To be honest, the Omega code is the worst movie I've seen for a long time. During the first 30 minutes I sat down on my spot to try to decide if I should claim a refund. But since I hadn't paid to see it first, I thought I could stay. And I didn't think it could get worse. <br /> <br /> He did it. I'm driving fast through lower points (including some spoilers): the terrible confusion of Casper Van Dien with Gillen Lane, two PhD student motivational speakers. The characterization was inconsistent; for example, Lane, despite her credentials, is perfect. Then there is the Biblical conception of fulfilling Bible prophecies; we see a number of sensational news in the soundbites with a ridiculous computer printout of the Bible code translated. There are also terrible "action" sequences: Lane flees from difficult situations without explanation, and once Lane seems to be in danger, it is a dream! It's cute for high school writing, but it's an apologetic plot device on film. Stimulation was bad: after a long opening, the first third of the film turns into scenes every 90 seconds. The pace will improve later, but there are still too many unnecessary leaps. And as someone else mentioned, there is still a year (not even Lane's young daughter). It was annoying. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good things. Film quality (eg lack of sharpness) is high and very attractive. The pictures taken outdoors were well done and the location was realistic. The last part of the film also has a few moments when Lane invites God (eventually) to help him - it turned out to be quite enthusiastic - even to me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked it because it hit me as the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it followed a great misunderstanding. <br /> <br /> Signs, dialogue, direction and action were all badly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do and Michael York was just strange. I think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot had been narrower and more focused and the characterization was more accurate, the film would have been much better. In short, the Omega code destroys. Surely it doesn't cost you to see it. I'll give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
