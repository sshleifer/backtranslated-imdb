I still try to determine if the previous contribution was worse or vice versa. Having been in this movie for almost fifteen years, the fact that I remember so little does not speak so well. Maybe it's just because I looked at it only once or twice, but I doubt it. If something worth remembering about this movie, you can be sure I remember it. <br /> <br /> During the release of this movie, the franchise still entered death, so there was a lot of media attention. he was allocated. It is never a good sign if the maid pop magazines contain the basic evidence of the plot. One such article had to explain that Freddy was too poor to infect the dreams of grown-ups, so he decided to go to the unborn son of Alice. So far it is so good, but it is the role of the writer or director to explain to the audience. It should not be left to some independent publications. <br /> <br /> Using the third part of the trivia about the Freddy concept, the parties could expect scenes that would make this joke out of the "infant miracle" category, but unfortunately it wasn't. This shows the idea of ​​an American rating system that such B'harni-esque garbage could have the same rating as a truly scary piece, like the original. <br /> <br /> By this time, no franchise could attract an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was present to give a shared part of competent action. Or maybe he just sees the competency compared to the rest of the competence. In both cases, given that his last role was something called all new adventures of the omnipotent blade, I doubt he really had something to do for him. Even the poor old Robert Englunds have been better than the last fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Considering that the return of the ticket office was steadily declining, not just for this franchise, one would have thought that the studios realize that sterilizing these films doesn't make them more marketable. In fact, this particular film, like its predecessor, was irrigated to not only attract a new audience, but both succeeded in alienating the main audience who originally supported the franchise. Nonetheless, some credit for the fifth part is due to the lack of a light, luminescent feeling that made the fourth part so offensive to watch. <br /> <br /> I gave Elm Street the fifth nightmare for five to ten. Trying to turn everyone on or MPAA everyone's ideas, he will succeed in letting anyone. Like parts 2 and 4, it could be completely out of consistency and no one notices the difference.
