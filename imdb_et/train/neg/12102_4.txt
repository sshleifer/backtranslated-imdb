This film is ONLY an interpretation of Bill Maher's religion. There are a number of funny moments and some interesting points, but don't be afraid to wait for an equal hand of religion. That's what I consider to be the worst documentary - everything is pre-arranged and edited to give you the director's opinion, not to let you make your decision. <br /> <br /> CHANGE - This is a fine cut, interconnected with pop culture and media clips to strengthen this point. The interviewee hardly has the chance to terminate the sentence before the editing interrupts it. The only person who has a fair opportunity to speak their mind is those who say what Bill Maher wants to say. If someone deviates from the Gospel according to the Gospel, they receive an editorial. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWEES - They are meant to represent the most extreme extreme religions. From the TV evangelical to the final Jewish stereotype, to TRUCK STOP (seriously. TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He has chosen the worst money jumpers, the heavy extremists and those who have no budget to say nothing. And when he gets a good person for a conversation, he changes them from hell. <br /> <br /> STEREOTYPE - All religions are depicted as stereotypes. Muslims are especially hard. During the Muslim segment, he does not give anyone the opportunity to speak before they interrupt themselves, or by delivering a piece with suicide attacks. ALL Muslims are portrayed as editing as extremists of weapons destruction, and none of the interviewed people is changing fairly. <br /> <br /> TERMINATION - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY difficult to hand with and although it is an interesting idea, it is not fairly countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself, while destruction is in the foreground. It literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and it destroys the world. He also says that all persons involved in religion are stupid. <br /> <br /> In the film, they have some good points and humor, though very unfair, is actually funny. But I know this is happening, this is a very one-sided view of Bill Maher's view of religion. He doesn't discover anything. He tells you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some good moments but extremely irresponsible documentary style.
