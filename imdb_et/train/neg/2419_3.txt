I just give it to three because it filled my friends and I hoped it would: entertainment. <br /> <br /> I wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking because it would be a zombie movie with Romero or Fulci-like movies, but what I rented was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie or movie that makes headaches shame, go to it. It is perfect for the younger - "Mystery Science Theater" fans, but the only downside is that it is so bad it makes it fun. Personally, I think it's a shame to associate it with any other Hollywood headline we know, because when the film sucks, it has its own genre.
