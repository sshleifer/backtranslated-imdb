If somebody really wants to do a really bad movie, then the "lost kingdom wizards" really set the yardstick to measure the depth of malice. <br /> <br /> Start with the pseudo-Chewbaccast that is around the main character ... Some poor chicks bagged a white "furry" costume that looks like a seamless floor covering. Work your way slowly, painfully through more non-so-special effects, which thoroughly prohibit the viewer from suspending belief. Add a garden gnome (just for this heck). <br /> <br /> In another sense, leave this movie completely and find another one and a half hours.
