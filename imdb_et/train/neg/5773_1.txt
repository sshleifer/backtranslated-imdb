Another FINE effort made by America's least-valued filmmaker. His knowledge of racism is STAGGERING and IMPRESSES on more than one level. The accusations that Lee is really just a little racist, poisonous dwarf who uses the Hollywood Positive Action System to make inferior quality films, which are just NONSENSE, are just right-wing propaganda. The very idea that Lee would use the current political correctness in the US to abuse climate in order to produce hatred of whites is just FALSE and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some Lee watchers even go a long way in assuming that GOTB praises other Americans while other races are unleashed: obviously, FALSEHOOD distributes people who are in conflict with different races in America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene movie is a long-standing dialogue between the rich black Republican and the bus. Views of this person are just HIGH - everywhere. 100% UNTRUE. He LACKS education, unlike the wonderfully informed boys who quite DESERVEDLY throw him on the bus. <br /> <br /> I would also like to draw attention to the incessant LIES that there were only 80,000 people on March million! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> What message does Lee send? If someone disagrees with your political views, just apply violence and throw it out of the bus. I thought the movie said, "Get on the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Obviously, Mr. Lee is ultimately the end of the segregation of buses, that is, he is no different from the ransomers of the FAQs: the bus is only the blacks that are in line with the democratic party's mindset. So much "to release slaves" ... <br /> <br /> Final credits: "This movie was entirely financed by black people." And it is distributed and marketed by a large Hollywood studio led by Jews and whites, whom Farrakhan despises ...
