There are many pretentious people pretending to be equipped with some beautiful meaning and the unknown stupids like me don't get it. Obviously, this means we should stick to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This book has everything, a-h, artistic clich√© - I think it's good that the director is one of the few chosen. Almost independent parody drowns in its pretense. <br /> <br /> The head of the "Ratcatcher" movie (almost equally embarrassing) returns with a second piece of artistic house; it is hard to understand and probably an alienation study. The best way to describe this film is alienation for its viewers.
