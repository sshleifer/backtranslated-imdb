Unfortunately, there was no 0 for the rating, otherwise I would have chosen it. This film lacks the star power that the original film had in such an abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocent of the newcomer Aileen Quinn and the experienced expert John Huston, the father of actress Angelica Huston, is the one who made this movie so charming. Even with the 1999 recycle of Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth, there was more to offer than this excusing excuse. Before he made this film, Ashley Johnson was known as his little Chrissie Seaver at a first-rate time. He had a few bits in the movie, but I don't know who thought he had enough talent to wear his movie. And adding ridiculous Joan Collins Lady Edwina Hogbottom! They didn't get enough good players to play bigger roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but they sign some British ladies for Joan Collins? It doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. Critics were right that they had not agreed with this film, even if it was only made for television, it was a bad order for a otherwise loved film.
