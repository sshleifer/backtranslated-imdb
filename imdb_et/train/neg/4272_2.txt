Such films, where a psycho of one variety tries to harm a naive person (and eventually lose it at all) to take over their life. Examples of this are the deadly attraction, the Pacific Heights, the hand that caresses the crowd, one white woman, and a thousand movies made for the TV. But while some, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, can offer at least some extremely paranoid, stagnant characters, or some plot twitches, illegal entry is all about the book. And if it wasn't meaningful for its star (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would fall short of mediocrity than Danielle Steele's mini-gadgets. <br /> <br /> Russel constantly plays Michael Carrit's naive man who calls a couple of officials when someone breaks his home and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly opens up his anger that he was both helpless and wrong cop (Ray Liotta) in this situation, typically a psychopathic villain with no limitations on his power. First of all, thinking about Carr (probably just pretending he does it), the cop will meet the couple. But soon, the police will want Carrit out of it, destroying the boys' lives almost anyway (it's pretty easy if you're a cop, and if you're a police officer who has installed a man's security system in his house) to take over and probably get his wife. It seems less straightforward and the policeman just wants to prove his power. A woman is a trophy rather than an end. And the story plays through the book completely, it is likely that you will predict each event before it appears on the screen if you have seen enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment, our main, naive character understands that he is the victim of fraudulent fraud (which has been perverted by the psychopathic villain), he is a non-dead finale.
