Must not be confused with the above-mentioned supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". For me, Sentinel was a big film that didn't give consistent action, a couple of critics promised on his back. It seemed to me that everyone was in favor and only there to make quick money because it seemed very similar to a TV movie. Sentinel is transforming a number of better films, such as "In the Fire of Fire", which has no originality, and looking at how Michael Douglas rides around, I thought it was stupid. The main problem besides its unoriginal origin was to have a bad pace. I was often confused by watching this movie, looking at how much time was left, more than once. Not just a failure with Eva Longoria, who couldn't win a joke. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a dependable actor, here are obviously movements. He doesn't convince a man to be on the run or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is just OK, nothing else. He tries to meet, but he managed to be more sharp than anything else and, frankly, he didn't seem so interesting. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. He did not convince his role and was a pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is pretty terrible as the first lady. He sees tears dull, and his role is to throw, more than anything else. Finally, Martin Donovan is a big part, but not enough to be important to me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel is another political thriller that tears me dull. It's too old, too tired, and most importantly, a lack of effort. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
