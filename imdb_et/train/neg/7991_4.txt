Paint with stories and mediocre action, recorded with authentic colors - and a few moments that are truly wonderful and deeply sensitive. It effectively collects the gentle transition of the girl to adulthood and deals with the cultural conflict, which is the family's main experience, very sensitive and inventive. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the germ of this good movie has imprisoned a nonsensical and extremely complex plot that can add to the sexual life of religious conflicts, conflict road construction projects, secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man living in the woods, racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the complexity of the local church policy and on and on. And all this does not even include the actual average plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams and disappointments of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was really shocked when I realized that the whole thing had to happen during one summer (and so many movies were achieved after 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is melodramatic, every plot is predictable, big happen life-changing events and then forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely unpleasant. The most shocking fact is that one of the characters is involved in a dreadful crime (completely predictable "twist") and then it is completely forgiven and the entire incident is forgotten ever since. Similarly, secondary character is introduced only after a few minutes to die and another "twist". It's all completely mechanical, to the end, which is all the loose ends (not all, just what the film thinks you care about.)
