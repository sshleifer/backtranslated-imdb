I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie based on this title book. Jennifer Jason Lee is an extraordinary actor and Ben Chaplin to play a leading role. Albert Finney has failed and does not carry this role well. I wanted to play Maggie Smith ... or rather her stupid, dirty role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I forgot to watch this movie in a long, drawn and exceptionally boring movie. There is more pause in the dialogue than Pinter Play. In the book, I took great care of Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also didn't like the twist where his aunt's sexual attraction to Morris is. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> Look, if you can't sleep, it's a sure snoozer. Don't look at it when you're depressed. After that, Zoloft is needed. <br /> <br /> Of course, "The Heiress" was exceptional in the role of Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift. The actor who played his father was unnoticeable as a cold, dad ... still dying for a woman and Catherine's hatred. The film was not faithful to the book, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This movie was a flop box. I have no doubt why.
