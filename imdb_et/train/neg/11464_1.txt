Although I am not claiming to be an expert in marine life, I have to say that someone with intelligence cannot get this whale (and not even the mother!) To buy this concept because it had a clue that revenge was a show that his dead companion is forced from abortion to humans! I mean, really! It's basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must be very difficult to accomplish. It is such a movie that is so bad that if you pay 50 cents to see it, you will feel demanding your money back.
