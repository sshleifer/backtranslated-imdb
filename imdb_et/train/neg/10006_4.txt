I do not know who to blame, the writers or the helpless driver. It seemed to be one of those films where so many stars were played (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to make a movie. It could have been very entertaining, but every scene was hungry, even crazy. Since he got any R-class anyway, why was the 70-year-old woman, not Angie Harmon? Why is Sheen dreaming of potentially hot relationships with the two most beautiful and sexiest in the world? If they are just looking for a laugh, why not take Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenutat? It was so predictable that I was surprised that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not only for viewers, but also for actors.
