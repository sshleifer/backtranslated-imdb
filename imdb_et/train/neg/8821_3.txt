Why, oh, why don't they learn? If you have a nice, juicy exploitation trick, use it! Don't be confused by trying to get everything deep and thoughtful; you just stop looking for a fool. was a child. So, of course, Harry is growing obsessed with Christmas and eventually, if his disappointment gets too big, he pulls out, dresses like Santa Claus and wanders around the city, giving toys to good little children and killing everyone he thinks he's lost. <br /> <br /> A simple and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other holiday horror screens use the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be "Santa, Serial Killer Portrait" as "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film will be spent documenting Harry's slow but inevitable breakdown if I were ready to buy space for rolling titles. You know that the movie is in trouble when you find yourself urgently killing it already. <br /> <br /> Maybe Harry's descent into madness could have been in the hands of a competent director, but unfortunately, We have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently this is his only movie and it shows. The action jumps from events to scenes without the participants being able to take pictures or clear views to let us know where we are and what we see. Harry was treated to help with self-illness, insecurity and neurotic behavior. More than frustrating as frightening, Christmas evil is one to avoid.
