This movie was a real disappointment for me. I've been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out that they made her a movie, I had left, got a VHS movie when she came out, and I was sick of what I saw, This movie wasn't about her life it was after his death. I thought it would be a descent from Grams' life and music, but they had to shoot their death. I'm tired of hearing about my deaths in books and movies, I wanted a movie of my life, not his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I want people to look at his life more than his death. The only thing about this movie was its soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment for any Gram Parsons Fan.
