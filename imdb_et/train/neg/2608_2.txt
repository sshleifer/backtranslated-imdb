My 10-year-old daughter Alexandra writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just a repetition of things from '101 Dalmatians'. I couldn't wait until the movie ended. The best part was credit early - they were lovely and well done. The rest of the movie is not worth it. Thank you.
