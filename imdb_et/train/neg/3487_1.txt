There is one big moment * Viable Christmas *, which almost deserves pain: James Gandolfini breaks the scoop over Ben Affleck's fool. <br /> <br /> This movie is another unfortunate example of James Gandolfin, which proves what a great actor he is doing in his career while acting in this film. <br /> <br /> Young and wealthy ads, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck), have believed that no one should ever be alone at Christmas. (And from the outset, this is the problem of stopping our belief in this idiotic film: how many people in Drew's social condition in 2004 care about one way or another whether Christmas is spent alone or with half a family, or fifty dollars for a prostitute?) who buys a family for Christmas, provided they pretend to be their own, ignoring all the contradictions that his money hasn't bought the emotions he was looking for <br /> <br /> $ 250,000 for Tom Hero (James Gandolfini) ) and her disgraceful woman Christine (Catherine O'Hara) that is Drew's ad hoc family against these protests from son Brian (very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter Alicia (a very soft focused Christina Applegate). Then Drew spends the rest of the film, which allegedly reduces his youth or something. The messages in this movie are just as complex and illogical as his dry mouth story. Drew patches showed obvious psychosis, a fake smile on his face and blindly neglecting each denigration that he bought the Valco family to avoid it. <br /> <br /> What raises the question: when Drew pays these people to restore some cheerful family emotion, how psychotic must be to pretend good luck about these barbs and mental torture for his presence? The Valco family does not hide their true feelings and pretends to be happy, while Drew - three out of four members make it clear that they are paralyzing him. Is he so aware that he does not see that his money does not buy him the "family" atmosphere he believed was the truth first? As with all films, one might wonder how the * four * scriptwriter could get into his narcissistic dreams so that they appear in the credit order, that they forget any credibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo * - stopped there. "Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Gandolfin and O'Hara can shine somehow, proving their shame between this mess. Christina Applegate is willow and cutesy and blonde and hot in all the right places, striking a bit of carcass strip for most of the movie , then, about to face and fall in love with him because the script tells him. <br /> <br /> And I wouldn't go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider looks better on his shoulder. The new level desperately seeks talent.
