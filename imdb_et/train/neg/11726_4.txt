During your free time, call a dow cowboy and grow horses with macho names such as beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter Agent Collins, his supervisor. Enter a new task - kill a terrorist who is in UK custody. Of course, the United Kingdom is a great place for an allied state for hidden ops and headlines outside the courtrooms. <br /> <br /> Killing is a great success after the fact that the escape plan blew. So Dial's partner and local contacts are killed while trying to escape the police, while the Dial becomes warm when the London caps try to get him and the CIA out. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Dial the Vacation House is regularly visited by teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves to arrest a cold bloody killer with an arrest warrant and helps them escape from the evil UK law enforcement agencies ... <br /> <br /> script like I need more? On the plus side is Wesley Snipes Wesley Snipes (be it pro or con) and the movie is quite interesting. Editing in me is very inseparable and has an effect on the abdomen.
