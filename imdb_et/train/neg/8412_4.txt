I saw DreamGirls yesterday and I was really underrated. Despite all the Oscar buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone who really impressed this movie has never bothered to see the real music classics of the movie. Except for Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is simply a glorified TV style without style or elegance. Just a bunch of amateurs sing each other! <br /> <br /> Now, the first half hour was good, but I was excited about how Eddie Murphy's terrible rave talk was interrupted and interrupted. These were the best songs and the best performances in the film. And the "upper" part of the movie was the only part of the film that had a consistent perspective or any momentum. The rest of the hour and 45 minutes was a formless, bright mess that was neither real nor interesting. It was also visually boring and contained too many sound-like stories. Condon didn't try to make any stories like big exhibits as I would have expected. Each number on the other side was just one close after the people were singing each other. And the way they made Hudson's great love number was criminal! Condon shot his performance on stage - no drama at all! God it sucks! <br /> <br /> AND note all those involved - "singer speaks dialogue" things can work on stage, but it doesn't work in movies (see embarrassing Evita and Phantom failures). All that "I'm doing something for you Efff-ieeee!" nonsense should have remained on the floor of the editing room. These are not "songs." <br /> <br /> Again, the movie - except Eddie Murphy's amazing performance - was nothing more than a glorious TV movie. Behind the PR work of this movie must be megabucks! I don't know how much money was spent to give the "pre-release" Oscar buzz? All in all, this movie, except Eddie, NOWHERE NEAR Oscar caliber movie! (except Eddie) I'll place it with Grease 2. BIG's disappointment, especially after all (very worn $ am) leap!
