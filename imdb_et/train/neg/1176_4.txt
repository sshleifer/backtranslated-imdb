Revolutions always offer opportunities for dramatic films, because in fact most revolutions are dramatic events in themselves. Unfortunately, this film compensates for the dramatic abundance of boredom. One does not care who wins, loses, dies or lives - stop it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be the superficial use of background technology. The scenes in the rural areas of Paris and France are of cardboard quality. They may be better done in the bare state and thus left. It cannot be assumed that the "Flying Daggers House" or "Golden Compass" has an amazing effect, but in the end it is a digitally learned production in 2002. Symbols appearing to enter the symbol enter the scene so much that the number of characters entering and leaving the scene is lost. In my opinion, this film turns the French revolution into a "papier-mache" revolution in the "papier colle" world in the 1790s.
