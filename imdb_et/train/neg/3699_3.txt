<br /> <br /> It can be assumed that a film with a leading comedian is a funny film. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud throughout the movie and it wasn't even during the final comedy scene (which would be the most fun). It's one you can watch when it comes to television, don't spend any other money on renting it.
