I liked Chiba Street Fighter, and I thought, no matter how stupid this movie is, I have at least seen her take her ass, right? Wrong. It's a dull, harsh confusion about meaningless talking, a semi-written script, and pointless schemes. There are few activities of all kinds, even fewer martial arts scenes and few who have been photographed and edited so badly that you can't even do what's going on in the world. Also dub is terrifying, and perhaps this film, which is this film, is best illustrated by the fact that it has allegedly an Italian mafia. Avoid like a plague - you would see better martial arts by looking through the local pre-school karate class window in five minutes.
