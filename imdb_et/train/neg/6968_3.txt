An older man touches his wife's greenhouse flower, which seems to be moisturizing. He captures it or bites something. She gets sick quickly and the hospital spits a big white opposite. Later he tried to revive bleeding with children. <br /> <br /> Police are in the hospital because his partner was badly hurt in the ulcer. Somehow, the policeman is involved with one female doctor, but also with the entomologist introduced. Several young children migrate around the hospital, which I think we should find divine, but who is a very annoying brat. They happen to drive into the room where the specimen is kept, and it happens that it throws into this growth hormone. The logic of the horror movie would say they deserve to die for it, but they are never in any danger. <br /> <br /> Critic grows and starts to grow. People flee from it and sometimes to it. The hospital is surrounded by an army who is ready to destroy everything as needed. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't really have convincing characters and most of the time it seems people are looking for a monster. It was quite boring. Obviously, it owes something to foreign films, where the monster was born inside a person and has several growths. There's also a character called Bishop and the leading actor is the hair of Sigourney Weaver.
