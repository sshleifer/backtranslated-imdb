Given the danger of same-sex relationships before the late 1980s, the personal best would have been better able to make the same gender relations between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as the experimental stage of Cahill's life. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film lured the relationship between two pretty attractive women to attract viewers. Also consider 90 seconds when you expose several women who jump high behind the jump chair. This random scene was of little importance to the film and it seemed that it was just to keep the audience interested in the movie. I think the producers were trying to dislodge the boring plot and the film even more boringly (the 1980 Oregon track and the competition). <br /> <br /> This review may sound harsh, but it is the truth. The exploitation of the young Muriel Hemingway body and same-sex relationships destroyed any credit that I would have given to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
