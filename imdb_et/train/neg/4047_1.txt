***** WARNING, YOU CAN USE A SPOILER WHAT IS NEEDED UNLOCKED AS THIS PICTURE. **** <br /> <br /> Here are some good suggestions for all people living in the UK If Channel 5 has an old 80-year-old comedy late at night, read the book. I am currently recovering from seizure because of some comments on this movie here. I'm really shocked that someone actually said this movie was realistic! All I can say is thanks to the god that during the Cold War there has never been an increase or otherwise we could have given our boundaries ... I found this movie in extreme pretense, maybe my British understanding of what makes the movie funny , who knows? But in all aspects, this film is not terrifying, teeth scare terribly. <br /> <br /> I am never a fan of Bill Murray and debris that would justify my feelings about him. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster, which was only made three years after this movie. But that's just the sum of Bill Murray up really. I can say for sure that I have not wasted my time so fiercely because I saw the first run of Operation Delta Force here, although the two films have more in common than you would think. For one thing, they have both terrible sequences of action from start to finish and the other. They are both devastating with the Cheesy Clich√© all over. <br /> <br /> One thing is that these guys should be "US Army". At the same time, they are allowed to sit around their camp, Willy Nilly, a woman's military police officer, and then descend upon them in worship quarters. Talk randomly! This movie is daunting for it. Now, get me wrong, I'm not a feminist compassion, but the fact that these two women are surprised by the two-character love, right after they stop, letting them go freely ... Twice, it's just offensive to the female race. The fact that one hairy hairy, fat-laced bush (Winger) and his unfortunate conjuncture in Ramis can just talk sweetly in the underwear of MP, to which they both fall in love, is nothing unpleasant. > <br /> There are also training scenes where you can meet the "Phycho" team who threatens to kill someone who touches him or his stuff, followed by an overweight bloc (played late and big by John Candy) who claims that he joined the army to "avoid $ 400 for anger management classes". Leading to the leading Murray, honoring "Giant Toe" (WTF?) "Drill Seargent", who honestly failed to organize pi $$ in the brewery, not to mention the recruitment of his bands. All this scene is meant to preload the loads in the fight where people say "the way to go ass hole"! all the time etc etc. <br /> <br /> The scenes then show that the fluff is a bunch that makes the perfect course for the attack course, leading to a scene where one of them lets some air. Attacking the birds with an assault rifle that carries the bullet side with bullets. (That's right. Yes, I told you that this movie was casual ... He also flees strangely disciplined ...) Ultimately, the leading parade where an unhappy team turns around in two hours. (Bugger me, Miracle!) Thanks to some of Murray's wise words, to which they massively channel any military dancer in front of the "Geriatric" routine, to the rest of the group. All this is with the enormous joy of the two girlfriends who really had to stick to them ... Everyone laughs at it. However, this bit is not amazing. He then chooses to watch a new Multi-Million Dollar Prototype armored vehicle in Italy (which turns out to be a mobile home sauna that has been loaded with plenty of gadgets) claiming to be the army! righto ... <br /> <br /> Then there is a terrible finale where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this secret prototype military vehicle to get their newly acquired and somewhat hyperactive MP girlfriends in Germany. Nonetheless, Hapless Captain (John Larroquette) discovers a team of fresh recruiters on a vehicle search mission. Nonetheless, they take the "wrong turn" along the route and arrive in the Czechoslovakia-maintained Soviet Union, where they are caught. (As we did not see that coming ...) So Ramis and Murray + birds start in the course of rescue work, where there is a great deal of struggle, strokes from the hips and blows. When they come back as national heroes, the Russians lower them to "pussies", etc. This is correct. No meetings with Martial, nothing. They stole only the prototype Military vehicle, drove this country of the Warsaw Pact and caused an almost international incident that could have caused WW3! <br /> <br /> This movie is more fun to be diagnosed with a terminal illness. I know it's meant for comedy, it got all the right actors, but where the hell is? Does channel 5 cut these bits? The only redemption function in this movie is the repeated use of bare women in taking showers and female Mud wrestling. (as I said, casual) Not that it helps to direct the fact that it is a completely crap film, of course. This movie should actually be aimed at immature 9-year-olds, unfortunately, we have to look at it. 1 star of 10 - Total Tripe. My advice, do something more useful with your time. Like Castrating Yourself ...
