Now I'm watching movies that are bad and saying, "Hmm ... it's not so bad!" I loved the cable and thought my big fat independent film was great. Remember that I didn't really look at it with great hope, but I thought maybe ... maybe ... it would be bad in a way that I could laugh at it. I was wrong. At no time during my "movie" (and I use this term sparingly) did I even have a little entertainment. To get started, Shaq Quentin makes Tarantino Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I could say, the amish priest probably makes a better rapper than he does. The main character is just a tedious and not a sign that is easy to like. Frankly, I'd rather eat Harlequin's fetal bloody ulcers with fatty swelling than I look at it again.
