Watching "Der Hollow Berber Berlin" at the end of the 80s was a deep experience for me - "so films could have been". Together with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World", it still has a special place in the heart and spirit - proof of the Wim Wenders genius. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, later years, the Million Dollar Hotel and Land of Plenty have seen a steady decline in the quality of their work, which hits a terrible lower point. Gone are exciting pictures or music. Does not search or display a large overview. All that is left is the characters and the thinly hidden political statements that do nothing but clich√©s, and frankly, you feel the intelligence of a more mature audience. <br /> <br /> Has the well been dry? Whatever the reason, Mr. Wenders has time to stand or stop.
