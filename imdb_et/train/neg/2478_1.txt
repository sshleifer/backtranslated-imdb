This movie is S-L-O-W. Spent most of the movie waiting for it to start. <br /> <br /> The setting was gloomy, the script was empty, the cinema was empty, the plot was empty, the budget was low (not all), the low budget movies were bad, but it didn't have redemption features). <br /> <br /> The plot was more consumed with revenge, a slightly fallen hunter than the actual Wendigo, who made a very short look. Movie. This in itself was disappointing because this "Wendigo" was just a strange mixture of fruit and stag. All about the movie was uninspiring. <br /> <br /> The little boy's parents seemed to be quite aside, and sometimes they seemed completely rid of their son. Whether it was a malfunctioning or bad script, I'm not sure, but it only increased my frustration and level of boredom. <br /> <br /> There was no food for thought, nothing to be interested in. Without a real intrigue or flour factor, this film was so painful, you just don't care what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> Wendigo's atmosphere reminds me of the film shown at the award ceremony "Mr Bean's Holiday" end - a film that is artistic and meaningless, trying to be too deep and meaningful, but conscientious and boring. <br /> <br /> I would never want to look at it again. I only looked at it with the hopeless hope that something interesting could happen ... but it wasn't.
