I remember the title so well. For me, this was a film by Flora Robson in supporting roles with Olivier and Vivien Leigh. And that was Vincent Massey's voice behind the whiskey. Well Flora Robson was great. His next signature for me would be "55 days in Beijing". Same role but with different gorgeous dresses. And the same voice. As for Armada, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Did everything happen at night in Elizbethan? Sometimes it was talkative and hard to understand. I couldn't tell what was the interest of love. Was it Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I don't think Elizabeth would have been a great strategist to suggest that firefighting ships are sent to Armada. It probably worked for the empire, but not for the script. This may be historically more accurate, but Bette Davis had more inclusive scripts. And I missed the daylight!
