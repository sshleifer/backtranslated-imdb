"This display of" Malcom "in FOX actually kills ... can we make our version?" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know that this is true and that the only thing NBC added to the "Malcom" indicator was sex. And boy, did they add sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets tougher and covers his skateboard. Tucker walks randomly in her aunt's shower and accuses her of watching and beating her. She laughs at her bedroom in the next house with a cute girl and she knows she wants to see her topless, but she smiles at her smiling and closing the window. And it's all in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it from a grown-up man - the boy's pubs are sex-crazy and the testicles have been run, so it's not impossible for a normal audience to do it. The only time someone has ever approached has been in the movies and can be read on the one hand. So it is not surprising that "Tucker" possesses the heat and attractiveness of a bar club bathroom. Did the network think we would like children to be able to grab puberty? Isn't that what people go to jail? If you doubt the exhibition is insecure, 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes; then they made the rest of the episodes of "burning" inciting them in MIDNIGHT, so no one could see them. Ironically, the children were originally the target group. <br /> <br /> Tucker, in addition to the general blur, also has a warp that makes poor writing a flesh. Even in 2000, it was dreadfully dated because its music and super-sarcasm were scales. I didn't like the fact that any character laugh enough to joke and jokes didn't come exactly miles away ... Shame on NBC for its dirty dirty ... they're better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
