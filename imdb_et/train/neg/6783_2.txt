There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews from people who have never written before or after the IMDb review. Considering the very small average rating given to the film by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit it, I thought the concept was cute, and I was happy to see that the actors who played Eve and the harmony with Angel would get a job, but it didn't take long until the movie was terrible. Known: Leaders seemed competent enough, but everyone else? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Plot: Filled with large enough holes to drive the truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: None. <br /> <br /> Humor: Do they really think people laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. in this film there were some very beautiful women. Not only the three main female characters, but everywhere. Just as manufacturers would have hoped that the landscape would keep men's viewers so confused that they didn't notice how terrible things were. If so, they could not fail. <br /> <br /> In the right hand, it could have been a cute but darkly funny classic. It wasn't even close.
