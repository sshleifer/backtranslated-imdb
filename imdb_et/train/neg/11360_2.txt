Okay, so somebody, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies falling behind Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Somewhere somewhere there was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give artists the requisites for doing homework on hardware. As far as I can tell, the missiles and the launching gear seemed to be. Graphics in general was pretty good - rocket launching gave me chills, like always launching a good rocket (my popular mechanics are driving in a car that is still moving heavily) and 3D was quite effective. CG was not of Pixar quality, but it was generally good. Flies were central anthropomorphs, some colors painted at the end of the 60s (hippie flies, african-american flights with giant africans and black tones, etc.) and breeds were mostly seen with human baby heads (although they made a suitable gross ball), script artists have certainly not done their homework based on insulting and outdated clich√©s (60-year-old gender equality policies, including mostly useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, fat flying who only want to eat, grade-dual gross humor). In a film directed at the IMAX, they breathe a great opportunity to educate some of the content of education on physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero in the Lunar module landing? PLEASE.) They couldn't barely read the original radio between Houston and astronauts transcripts that are all in the public domain; Instead, they wrote a dialogue that sounds like a mess. <br /> <br /> But we liked the breeds. <br /> <br /> So they get half and half for missiles and breeds. Yes Yes. 1.5 / 5.
