This movie is not just worth your time. Its dependence on New-Age mysticism is the only semi-interesting mess. The plot is a unique arrangement that has been reprocessed repeatedly. <br /> <br /> I was only asked to spend time commenting when I noted that some have tried to support it. turning. Their motivation and objectivity are doubtful, because they encourage you not to look at the mistakes of the film, but the message of the New Age consciousness with good will. <br /> <br /> So about twenty-thirty evangelical Christians, or Islamic fundamentalists, would make positive judgments about films / television that support their views? Despite the poor features of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historical foundations? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure followers will come right behind me to say that this movie is quite true.
