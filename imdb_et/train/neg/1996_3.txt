This sad little movie is little like the 1971 Broadway revival, which was such a "nostalgic" hit. Remember that when Burt Shevelove led this revival, he wrote the book thoroughly. I feel that this script also changed the original 1925 version. I played Jimmy Smith on the stage in 1974 on the stage with an innocent filmmaker and thought that $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. There is no way. Even the anticipated pleasure of seeing "Topper" Roland Young play "my" part was a great disappointment. The three songs are out of play and done very badly. Even the classic "Tea For Two" duet is a virtual solo. Many of the familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not make themselves proud, and the star, Anna Neagle, simply tortures herself. If I feel like spending dollars, I know the film has to be bad. The second commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called "Tea For Two", and is about making performances (of course the original), so those looking for a real "No No Nanette" can find more recognizable versions there.
