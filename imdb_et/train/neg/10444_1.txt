the only thing big about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not evaluating a book by its cover, the title does not speak about the movie. When I went to the theater, I didn't wait for Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a movie that is a pure popcorn, but instead I got this terrible Roy Liotta movie "Turbulence" Yes, it's so bad SOAP. The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And it's not even the right title for the movie, it wasn't even a glimpse of the "snake" or "plane" in 40 minutes of the movie! What's Wrong Advertising! If it wasn't his title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B-class summer movie. And R rating? It must be the weakest R-category movie of all time! The filmmakers add only a few words to make it R, All violence is kept at pg-13 level. You know what is really an R rating? R Rated Superstar Edge! See him in Summerslam instead of wasting your money on a snake!
