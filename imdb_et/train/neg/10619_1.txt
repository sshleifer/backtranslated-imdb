... but tough film. As Maltin says, it was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. Well, it's serious ... too serious! The plot is silly and slow (something for old people who live in immortal filiation in the bodies of young children) ... the film is all the talk. Speaking speaks of the same things over and over again. I went down a couple of times! The film is sooooo boring! The only exception is cast Cinnamon birds, but Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably the love of both (they often complained that horror films were too violent ... well, it has no violence!). Avoid at all costs ... if you have no sleepiness ... it will make you fall asleep!
