A young basketball player who plays genetics examines the genetic sequence using a human fetus. He hopes to be able to find the treatment for the disease and aging. He has put pressure on his research because he has not published, so the university has difficulty in justifying its funding (I think). <br /> <br /> He is studying a monkey that dies quickly. He then tries himself. He starts communicating with the mother of a very annoying single boy; he was the one who had demanded research. <br /> <br /> Initially, it doesn't seem to affect the injection except for some new strength. He then realizes that he has a memory loss and starts to remember what happened. In addition, it will appear very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> As the movie is called metamorphosis, it finally becomes a different one. You do not believe in your eyes - what he changed, or the absolutely outrageous costume the actor wears to imagine what he has changed. It is unbelievable that there is another change in the store - the end of the movie is really absurd. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has done is that Laura Gemser is in it, but she has a very small part. <br /> <br /> I saw the video box that had a plastic box glued to the box. It may even have been in the electronics at one time, maybe the eyes that light up (the main character's eyes turn green from time to time in the film). The traced copy had a box showing only tear marks when the glue was stuck in the plastic that had been removed. If that were still the case, the new boxcover would have been the only reason I would have liked this movie; I'm sure I got rid of it.
