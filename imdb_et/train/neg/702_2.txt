Daphne Zun is the only light that shines on this sleepwave and the light disappears quickly. If not, what other reason to look at it. Five college kids are ready to demolish the old dorm. Problems arise automatically when a strange homeless man wants and a group of few people. Then the killer is open. I wanted to honestly say I enjoy it. It was fair, or maybe it was just Daphne Zun. The film is too slow and almost as quiet as the library. Most of the actors are below average and the "viewpoint" moments are so old news. Films such as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" have been recognized by composer Christopher Young, who is in a recurring cue line that was better made for the TV show. However, it seems higher than the film deserves. So, except for Young and Zun, it grabs the bottom of the barrel.
