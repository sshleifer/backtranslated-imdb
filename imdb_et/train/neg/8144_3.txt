I just saw it at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. The synopsis in the festival guide was good, so we decided to review it. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Besides being poorly written, it was boring. I'm not taking away from the actors because there is not much to do with this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a clich√© without being ironic. It would have been better if Hunt Hoe went into a horrible horror. Instead, he took himself seriously and resulted in a boring film. I can't recommend this movie. It seemed too long and everything was just weak.
