What can be said about this movie, except the viewer. Christmas Evil should come with a warning sign like cigarettes because it was harmful to my eyes and ears. I rarely have this dissatisfaction with the "b" horror, but this film could not even scare a little for five years. Consistently sensual, who has a thirst for blood in the film, is that he should look almost godly, like nothing can stop his manic rage, but in this film, the resident psychopath himself sticks to the stack of an odd attempt to surprise his next victim and, of course, with all the popular ones. santa clausega, it is to remind the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous. All in all the film waste.
