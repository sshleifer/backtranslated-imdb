The dream of an art house. Overpriced, overcompensated, redundant; the pretentious melange, which not only served the best picture of 1951 on its own initiative but also competed from the beginning. Place in the Sun, Detective, Streetcar Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet Invisible Man; if you call it, when it appeared in '51, it's better than that arthouse crapola. The final ballet is the burst of the intellectual crowd, inappropriate and in the wrong film. Few actors of their time were less capable (acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 worst '51 (I saw 201 movies) and 5 of the worst best photos of the Oscar winner.
