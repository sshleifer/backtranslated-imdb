***** THIS REVIEW MAY BE A SPOILER - but this decision would be so classic and well-known on the stage ***** <br /> <br /> CINDERELLA's story as my favorite fairy tale. There is never enough of such a wonderful story in the world. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their story about their version. It can't work if the story is different or trying to throw some interesting ideas together with some magic photography and delicate product design with a weak direction and editing. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling who never shells or never makes a swan. <br /> <br /> All the production values ​​that money can buy cannot buy good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good action. <br /> <br /> Entrance Cinderella's ball so weakly made that there was no dramatic expectation or discovery. <br /> <br /> Writing also made me very nervous. Prince Charming was the most unwelcome memory. Why would every girl want to marry an outrageous, self-absorbing prince who didn't like women? <br /> <br /> Turner's launch as a stranger was painfully painful, showing that lump liners were more than nuances. <br /> <br /> Even the Cinderella part had little interest or compassion. > <br /> Perhaps this test only describes one sentence: So cheap 'in the 90s, <br /> <br /> What you have to mention and mention in the disgraceful upper part is the brilliant photography, burial work and production design. It was a pleasure to get acquainted with landscapes, kits and settings when the story was kicked out. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella storytelling, go to two gems: <br /> <br /> 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella with Lesley Ann Warren. Even if the TV-60 is clearly staged, it is the best version of the celluloid bar. All the stars choose everything to offer the greatest entertainment. Engaging, directing and memorable writing and music. It's classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Ever since - this Drew Barrymore pearl retains a historical perspective, changes the story, but is not enough to develop the most important points of this classic story. The characters of the accountants and all supporting roles were wisely written and worked well.
