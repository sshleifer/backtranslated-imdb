I had great expectations for this movie (title, translated "How do we get rid of others"). After all, the concept is excellent: in the near future, where the ruling elite has taken on the consequences of general verbal and legislative persecution of the verbal and left wing of the government of the better government, and simply decided to kill anyone who cannot prove that they give something to the company (called "common good", but it really means the interests of the dominant capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Very cool idea! Perfect for satire biting! Only this film completely captures this opportunity. Satire only comes out in some scenarios and absurdity performances, but this satire is not supported; it is not sharp or witty. And with the alleged comedy, the film has almost no funny scenes. I think comedy should be in the absurdity of situations, but situations are mostly uncomfortable and too serious, rather than creating laughter or thinking. <br /> <br /> The script is a bug in the grave. The measure should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be, but instead of taking the time, the young woman who was the one who wrote the new laws for fun and who is trying to rescue everyone is spending time resisting the people flying to Africa. All this is next to the point! Such a movie should not pretend so seriously! It's satire! Political statement. But it will not even deal with the problem of what should be. Maybe he was afraid to go too far? How Coward. It's not art. It's not even a true satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, very serious and now one of Denmark's top high-profile actors, was very good. He wore a great deal of the small entertainment value of the film. Everyone else: something special (well, except Lene Poulsen, who gave convincing results). <br /> <br /> In fact, the problem with most Danish films is that language does not sound naturally. No composition or delivery. Why is it so difficult to sound like that? Why should it be so harsh and artificial? I hope that when people watch these films in fifty years, they do not believe that this is how people were talking in Danish society at all. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
