A few months ago, I participated in a discussion with this IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden). The poster insisted that if I gave "Flushed Away" I would like it. Partly based on this argument, I agreed to watch the film. <br /> <br /> "Glowing away" has good intentions (at least for Aardman), but there is no strength to pull it all together. Its best strength is the sewer / captain, Rita (played by Kate Winsel), who would have been the main character in the IMO instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, harsh and interesting, while Roddy spends a lot of time on her screen. <br /> <br /> One of the things that most distracted me from FA is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to start with. When Roddy strikes the shot, the movie assures him to hit five more times. "My name is shocking," says one of Rita's brothers, who then feeds Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is low at all times. <br /> <br /> I'm not wasting time watching the Katzenberg kleptomania tendencies towards Pixar (one similar movie is coincidence, five is hanging), but I say I'm disappointed at Aardman. They can do (and have done) so much better. Try the hardest guys next time.
