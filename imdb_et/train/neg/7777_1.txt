It can be a lovely movie for kids. My grandson looked at it once. he looked at it a second time when I watched it with him. <br /> <br /> When the little bear disappears on the iceberg and he is in the water he is trying to stay on the ice it says, "Come back to the stupid ass stupid". <br /> <br /> I don't want my 3-year-old granddaughter to look at such words in such words. <br /> <br /> That's why it's rated for kids. Should be child friendly. I would expect this. Warner's brothers and G appreciated that I didn't think it would have such words. Even in most places words are not suitable for the movie, as it will be added later. And the film pulls out in many parts.
