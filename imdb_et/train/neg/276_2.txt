The characters are cliched and predictable, all of which are snow-white or pure. Action is too blunt to be amusing, badly bad. This is a double disappointment if you are a fan of Bette Davis because her character is not usually a fun Bette-Davis-type character; he just starts a lot of effort. <br /> <br /> In general, my husband and the film did not find interesting, moving or enjoyable.
