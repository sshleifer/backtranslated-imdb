"I'm a comic!" "You're an illustration!" what does it mean ?! This plot cannot be worse because the boy who is afraid of everything becomes very brave at the end of the movie because he went to the library. The only purpose of such cellulose waste was to encourage American children to read how a cheaper and more effective way to do it could have been a series of ads! Even Macaulay Culkin's (as a child), Christopher Lloyd's (as predictable as he is a Page Master's librarian) talents could save this meaningless film from the boring plot. Even Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart (even) Leonard Nimoy, or Hollywood's God of Voices, Frank Welker, will never save it. I can only describe it in the 1990s, which is equal to even the adaptation of small children with small water in 1978, because cheerful animation makes the film worse, does not improve the dull plot!
