Terrible !!! I don't want to be too negative, but this movie has a stupid monkey from IQ. What a disaster. I just couldn't believe how bad this film is. Dialogues are just very strange and the subject is concerned, the camera works from time to time just terrible, music sometimes like a soundrack for Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how much worse it might get. Some side-kick "participants" are complete disaster. Opportunity, but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can put my body down, fall to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actress, but she knows she's in a financial crisis to take part in such a fiasco movie. . . . . this film should have been presented to all film school students to teach them a lesson about not filming
