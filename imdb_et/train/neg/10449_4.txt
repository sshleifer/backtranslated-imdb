This is not a film that can really be analyzed separately from its production. The audience became a filmmaker in the history of American film industry unprecedented; we felt so involved that viewing is changing as a friend's job. How can it be objective? It's our movie, isn't it? Or is it? There may not be anything more unpleasant than a filmmaker who promotes himself as a friend of the audience, giving them all the naughty treatments denied by the nanny critics. Just see that the main self-publisher, Eli Roth, who promises gore-hound of all the guts that are not literally a pure mainstream horror film, just shake and technically incompetent work like "Hostel". <br /> <br /> David R. Ellis may not have created a monster that was an Internet response to his film, but he was quite quick to deal with it. He took the carnival-huckster school film-making school to a new level, getting fans to build what they would eventually buy. So many have attracted this interactive and democratic film-making approach that they seem to have forgotten this point - that it is the most cynical form of film marketing. There is nothing to make the filmmakers know that fans are not buying, and all the old suggestions that get the sticks are included. The fact that the pitch became the headline will tell you all you need to know. <br /> <br /> Isn't this just a focus group approach? Individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, everything is sacrificed before massive lure. This is a critical customary place where focus groups and test patterns do not make good movies - why should pre-Internet interventions be different? Because we are movie fans? I thank God for us, otherwise I would not have seen a topless woman biting her nipple with a snake. <br /> <br /> So, yes, I had fun in the movie - midnight, which was a bucket of fresh pubs and ice cream - but that was really a little to do with the film and pretty much the atmosphere. Like Christmas, everyone seemed determined to have fun, no matter what. There was laughter, but I don't know if it was a movie or a movie. Has the film been calculated to be a meaningful difference? The film has really good aspects. Samuel L. Jackson gives a well thought out performance, pure self parody, but with real joy. Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles and have one or two inspired moments - the laptop's fate is a really funny black comedy that the rest of the movie doesn't mimic. <br /> <br /> Stock characters are expected, but there is no temporary absence. What is the point of a film that combines two great phobias, if there is no sliding threat? There are several snake-jumping moments, but they are incredibly poorly staged. The only annoying British man gets a decent death scene - other killings are strange. For example, the death of a honeymoon couple is disgracefully guilty. Most participants fail to impress; it is disgraceful that a charismatic actor like Julianna Margulies should feel so tired (when she tells two children to close her eyes and pretend that the turbulent flight is a roller-skater, she can talk to the audience - the film is far away). <br /> <br /> There are worse movies, but much is much better; another observer on this site compared this film to "Lake Placid" and it is as contrasting as I think. This film worked so well, because the performances were great, the jokes were funny, the temporary sequences were intimidating and were not prepared by the Commission. That the characters were few and the shadow was an unexpected bonus. I don't need a post-pub midnight, which shows that it's a good time for this movie. <br /> <br /> Over time, this movie hides to become a straight line in film history. If this is a precedent, then I am really worried about what could have crossed our screen in a few years. Probably nothing will come of it. Perennial popcorn favorites - "lost ship Raiders", "Alien", "Halloween" and, of course, "Star Wars" - are not just created with group thinking. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I'll tell you what - I haven't loved half of Inger Bergman.
