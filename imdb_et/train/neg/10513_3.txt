This movie was pretty much time and a half times my time. I generally like a cheap horror monster type movie, but this movie was disappointing. The main mistake is not explaining the beings. When they entered the house and found that the man he'd rented explained them. He does not tell them anything but that they killed their parents, and if I didn't do anything, he didn't tell him how he managed to escape ... feeds beings after his own death experience. It would have seemed that he would have been able to leave after a "cross-border incident".
