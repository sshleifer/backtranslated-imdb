drss1942 really took the words out of my mouth. I loved Segal's earlier films and I feel the only one who is still loyal to him. I just saw this movie (ok, tall about 90% out, so I didn't see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I was not going to add myself to this movie and dared not know what was happening at the end. There was something strange about the voice of Segal and others. Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max, where the voice was duplicated, but in the same language (Australian is English, right?) :) Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, they would all be now in this Segal injustice below.
