It is not one of the reviews of bad special effects or technology or timing, questions that only dorkiest people could associate, but rather the story that most of us really care about. <Br>> <br /> The plot is a combination of approximately World War II allied forces and German Navy members and two civilians (a hero and a heroine) pushing together with a German U boat and ending in a wild dinosaur. <br /> <br /> Manipulations are not so bad in film standards, and we know that realism is not great. Which of these films are trustworthy and pleasant characters, as well as some thinking in action. <br /> <br /> This movie is not so. For full-length films, only 6 characters are given and 3 of them are hardly studied. McClure's hero is far from the "routine" and doesn't make any sense at any time. <br /> <br /> The woman seems to have been looking for answers to riddles about the land of their dinosaurs, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less. <br /> <br /> A lot of the failure in the movie that should have been better, even by the time.
