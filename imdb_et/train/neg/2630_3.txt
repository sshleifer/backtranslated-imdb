SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help to save Williams' life, I think it would be nice to know why William was motivated or forced. I think the members of the secret service are people every day and the rumor is a writer. member of the secret service, now his motivations are clear, well-known.But when renting, this film does not match you, causing old, but used twists that act on average - these are the things in this movie just to keep you waiting for the end. Clark Johnson, as SWAT leader, did much better than this time, and I was still wondering how producers (like Michael Douglas) left this movie theater.
