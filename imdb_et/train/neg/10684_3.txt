This movie was craptacular. I was so emotional that no character was involved because the biggest antagonist of the movies was actually me. I played it beautifully all the time; I promise to walk, but only to drink another beer, hoping that it would automatically become magical. Even in this state, I could not point out that Cuba was as thin as imitation paper. His obsessive commitment to his work was as convincing as his one night after his idiot standards failed. Burt came on the screen as General, that's right, General (who wears too much makeup). I fell terribly fast to compete with Cuba except me was real and I slipped my toe. Fee! Compensate for my stubbed toe!
