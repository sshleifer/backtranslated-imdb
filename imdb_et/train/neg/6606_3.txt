Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, watching this movie, I had a lot of fun ,, <br /> <br /> This is a movie with stupid and stupid songs !!! <br /> <br /> Necessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... Full offense to the original Holi .... well ... it was OK! Because of traditions, every movie must have one! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... Very Unneed Stupid Song Jee Le ... Sounded like a Playboy Song Stupid Song ... <br /> <br /> Other than songs. The movie was OK It was adaptation of Ram Gopal's Verma himself ... If you think this movie likes it, this movie depends only on the viewer and his rating, whether he thinks this movie is a complete copy He'd beat his head cinema seat OR if he / she thinks directors look to relax and watch this movie <br /> <br /> Anyway I watched both ways I would congratulate and Abus Ram Gopal for the disaster he did ... <br /> <br /> Well Some things that bothered CAST was incredibly bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan Like Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in the remake of his movie, funny what was the director's mindset) Ajay Devgan Like Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol Could Be Better) Prashant Raj Like Raj / Jai (Abhishek was meant for this role, despite being doing this special Appearance in Mehbooba's song) Sushmita Sen Like Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right taboo was this role) Nisha Kothari Like Ghungroo / Basanti (I think e t Es ha Deol would have been great) Mohanlal Like Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute .... Oops Sorry, he was OK, I couldn't think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The film would be ONLY If the show was OK <br /> <br /> I wasn't even an exciting movie, it was just OK, just to watch <br /> <br /> Overall rating ... 8/10 I got for him some credit Cinematography ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 in the movie, it might have been better, simple ears played with computers and ipods and stuff ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
