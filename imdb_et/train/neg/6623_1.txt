First of all, it is a pity that you even gave this film a rating of 1 (not less than it is available). The film does not have a scenario, direction, characterization or action in every department. <br /> <br /> 1) First of all, the movie's name is really C-Class (although the movie itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries her best to live by nature, but a weak script with a pathetic direction makes her humorous. 3) Sholay has 50,000 Gabbar Singh (which was convincing). In the agony it was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called heroes and had only a few men to ride bikes (all automatic pistols).) 4 About Nisha Kothar, someone has to tell him he doesn't know what to do. Why Does Ram Gopal Verma Get It Again And Again? 5) Mohanlal was good but he has nothing to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are wasted in the movie. 7) The role of Legendry, played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay, is cheaply replaced by some of Gang's mothers. Ramu please grow up and realize that there must be some intellect in the movie. Absolutely stupid signs in his movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Nothing should be said about modern Jai and Veeru ..pathics to the greatest extent. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation from the original classic. Please don't waste money and time on this movie. I think looking at Aap Ka Surror (which I thought it was the worst movie) would be a better idea than seeing this terrible styles, bad songs and unfortunate package. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Saurabh
