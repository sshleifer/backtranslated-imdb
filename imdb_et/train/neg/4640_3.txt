His torso grows bigger by dividing his shirt, and he grows with a giant werewolf mask that has red lights in his eyes. His pants remain intact. The mouth looks convincing, though some robotics (or hidden hands) eyebrows him from time to time. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor werewolf costume, the fair amount of blood and gore is quite well done. The film also has a pretty good flip. But when a person falls from the height, the job is pretty bad for the mannequin. crutches called Andros, who is also such an expert. They try to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Rich kills people who have done wrong.
