I was really looking forward to seeing the monkeys on the planet, but it was a great dissapointment. <br /> <br /> Settings and masks are great, but this is the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not act, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. Other participants are not very good either. <br /> <br /> The worst is the story. That's totally ridiculous! For example: monkeys are unreasonably lying on the ground, but people do not attack them, no, they wait until they rise again! This is just one example of a stupid story, but it would be too long for them to say.
