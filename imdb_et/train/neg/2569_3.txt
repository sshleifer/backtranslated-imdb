Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actresses) in this 1970's turkey is lightly amusing, but the script is so plain and offensive that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after his Oscar victory) can't pull it out of the mud. In the 40s, celebrity sellers sell mostly nths. <br /> <br /> Of the 3 in 10. Nicky Henson plays a young type of learning. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers were well paid because I don't see any other reason for such a break in 1970 (very good year for films - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, VIIS EASY PIECES and many others). You can't win them all!
