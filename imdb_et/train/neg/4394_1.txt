The John Goodman program was quite terrible, but it just stinks. One and only thing in the confusion that made me smile, Patrick Starfish's voice was recognized by Frostyna. The story is hopeless, written by someone who has hidden memories of childhood, but has never received an adult perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia directs the blind world that these characters live. Everything is unpleasant and without reason. The plot is predictable, but the exhibition collapses from one inexplicable, unrelated scene to another so senseless that it's not fun to watch. The worst thing is that no one has seen snow in the production team!
