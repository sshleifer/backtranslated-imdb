It must be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When my friends and we watched this movie (being the target group to which it was directed), we just sat down and looked for the first half hour when our jaws touched the floor, how bad it really was. The rest of the time, all the others in the theater just started talking to each other, usually leaving their popcorn to actually pay the money, so they looked at this weak excuse for the movie. It must be a great idea on paper, but it seems to the film that no one has a clue what's going on. Crap acting, nonsense costumes. I can't overcome this embarrassing look. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
