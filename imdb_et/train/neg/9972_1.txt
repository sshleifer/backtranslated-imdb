PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst films I've seen in the last decade! It's a bad film about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but later he gets into trouble. This Junior can drive with Grandpa's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can make room for fire! This is such a bad film as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The fate is even worse. Rent a CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 ****.
