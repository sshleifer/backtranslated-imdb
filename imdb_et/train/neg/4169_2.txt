I just gave her 2 just because Natassia Malthe (like the vampire Quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is very little logic for this movie, but most of the sci-fi vampires are flicks. The film apparently tried too much to leave traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the story not only unreasonable but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Too much brain and too many rip-off-body scenes that made me feel bad. A good vampire movie should be more reasonable so you don't have to see much blood - we all know how a vampire jumps on what it is going to do, what a vampire does. Some moans or screams are all you need to describe the scene (like what ended when Quintana tries to raise Rosa sexually, all this needs a few moans, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
