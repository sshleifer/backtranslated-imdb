I'm silly that I actually sat down and watched it. I love independent movies, horror movies and the whole zombie thing in general. But if you add, you have crossed a line that should never be overcome. I hope people in this movie had a great time to do it, at least it wasn't a general waste. You never know it. Script? Are you kidding. Acting? I think even the trees were touched. Cinematography? Well, there must be a camera. Period. I don't think there was any real planning for making this movie. Such a complete waste of time, which I do not prolong, commenting further.
