I was eager to see "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a huge David Boreanaz fan. What I got was 1-1 / 2 hours a day. The assumption seemed enjoyable: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, owner of Mr. Fix It, where dumped men use their help to get their girlfriends to take them back. <br /> <br /> Film is editing, scripting and acting. Although I have found that Boreanaz is delightful with his other film roles (except for the "Crow" movie he did), it was disappointing. Sometimes his character was interesting and others were flat. A reminder reminds me of a soap opera day player. I realize that it wasn't a big budget, but some scene cuts and music just didn't seem right. <br /> <br /> My advice: Look at your own risk.
