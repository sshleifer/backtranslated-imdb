This film distinguishes itself from the "miracle of the human body" documentary films, bravely, as convincingly, choosing reluctance for the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes with a gigantic 50-foot zipper when the teen pushes the liquid out of it. On the other hand, the camera is a semi-digested food and stomach acid that is part of the esophageal pasta salad and onions. In the final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer in a harrowing ride through the forest ... teen armpit hairs. Unfortunately, I do nothing about it. Watch this movie if you need to, but: Bring your vomiting pot and don't have a pasta salad in advance.
