If I hadn't read Pat Barker's Union Street before I saw the film, I would have liked it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It's actually my movie, it's well done, and I don't want to say it in any way, but if it does, it won't work out of all corners. <br /> <br /> A thrilling novel about reality living in a classroom in the North of England, my girlfriends grabbed and refused to let go of the week. When I read about Union Street women, I was put on tears, exclusion, shock, anger, compassion and misery. Great. A novel I sometimes felt I couldn't read anymore, but I'm a novel that I just couldn't. Yeah, but it is totally captivating. <br /> <br /> Movie. Heldeke. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality and created the sugar layer of the sweet ice cream at the top. Beautiful movie, inspirational soundtrack, great performances, hope and romance ... yes. Customizing "Union Street" ... no. <br /> <br /> Union Street women and their stories are fused with Fonda's character, their stories are touched, but many of them are left aside. I agree that some of Barker's stories are sensitive issues and they are too horrible for mass viewing, and that the film by some 7 leading protagonists is not practical, but the content is not my main question. The essence of the novel and the actual intestine have disappeared - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and graphically depicted as a stench of poverty, replaced by sunshine, beautiful houses and flashing William. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the movie with your positivity and hope for "reality", I suggest you read the book before you prepare yourself for the "Schindler List", but without a happy ending.
