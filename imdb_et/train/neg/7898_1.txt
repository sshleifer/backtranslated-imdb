When I saw this movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. If these fun creatures, garbage bins with big sharp teeth, really meant frightening? Or where they have developed a good laugh (I sincerely hope). If you look carefully, you can even see the strings that use them (better; dragging them across the screen). The whole was pretty funny as scary and I had time to watch the movie because I was surprised by the general inability to get just one good part. This is one big joke from start to finish and I believe this movie belongs to a new category. So incredible messy laughs from start to finish. (I'm not even trying to act or comment on all the other things)
