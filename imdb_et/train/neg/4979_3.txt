Why can't anyone make a legendary story about a decent film? This is another adaptation of Beowulf that I am disappointed in a year. But I have to say that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerald Butler) was much better than that. It was just a little disappointing. It's a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with me the most? Was it useless plot elements that they didn't add to any particular reason (human sacrifices? Meaningless love?) Or bad CGI, or characters' controversy or intrusive behavior? Even worse was how they saw the beautiful Marina Sirt so terribly! And don't even talk about this ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why did they constantly remind us that Beowulf had 30 men's strength, but he never showed the slightest strength on the film. Both of the monsters he fought were thrown around him, relying on his bacon to save his bacon. Even when he was in a lofty boss in the spice, he didn't make him out. He was too dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is more similar. It wasn't necessarily the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this positive remark, but I really can't do some side by side. All I can say is, if you've ever read "Beowulf", you are extremely disappointed to adapt to this evil and inaccurate pretext!
