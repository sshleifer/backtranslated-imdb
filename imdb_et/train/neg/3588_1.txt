The follow-up of the 1973 Walking Tall continues the real life around the Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, but this part plays like a flat TV movie. Bo Svenson takes over Joe Don Baker's leadership, but it's too easy for that part; he comes out like a guitar with an ambling singer instead of a guitar. Good supporters such as Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui will end very little. I would give a movie one star to my good intentions, but the scenario is a transparent and lazy mass of routine threats, and production is cheap. It was followed in 1977 by the "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by the television film "Real American Hero".
