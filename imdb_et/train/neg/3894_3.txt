An incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of a six million dollar man but with violence and nudity. I know this movie is a bit sharp, but I found it impossible not to. <br /> <br /> Actors and scripts are not the best. But the effect is good for a 30-year-old film with a $ 50 budget - the actual title characters really need to melt, but when it does, it's reasonably impressive; we also have one invented death scene that includes electric shock. Music is also noteworthy - it's crazy - cheese-smelling nonsense. <br /> <br /> Notable Highlights: <br /> <br /> * Admire a slow-moving nurse who jumps through the pan for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised by the day's interrupted head. <br /> <br /> * Avoid the psychotic cannibalistic alloy of the humanoid. Steve is surprised. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero interrupts melted mad hunting to get a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is over 70 years old so I hate it. It's sticky and trashy, but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could do a lot worse.
