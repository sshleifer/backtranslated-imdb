Going to this movie as I did, I was expecting absolutely nothing to entertain except for the killing that was killed ..... which I got even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas Day 1947 saw a boy that his parents would do it as a father in a santa suit. Scared, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your usual daily joe ...... it's for him who is guilty of Santa. After his boss jokes about him, he goes crazy, dresses like Santa and kills non-santa believers and his boss. The troubled neighborhood is trying to hold her and just as they start to burn her, she drives a rock ..... to the truck. It is not the best end I have seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow pace, a boring film that didn't really have the quality of redemption, except when Harry went to church visitors. Barely, and even "sex" scenes were tinted. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
