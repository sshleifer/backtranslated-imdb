I didn't expect much from this movie, but a brother who is smelly. <br /> <br /> Did I find this pearl in a gigantic box of $ 5 DVDs in Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this disc was, I feel it's hanging. The special effects for them were the look of the high school, the work of the camera, which was damaged by the stumbling blocks and the visual illumination, and acting was a great example of a Christian school. It can be imagined that the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" of the production plant, after seeing the rushes, came back - the people who controlled this thing had to be seriously anti-biblical against unknown production companies that wounded this thing. Think of your fear when they saw their $ 914.86 investment in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian films are so bad - perhaps Xian filmmakers have to watch good movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. Reliable stories and characters, less hysterical deterrence and fanaticism, oh, and the story that calls all - not just - not just true believers. E.e. Stop the sermon, save it for the church. Take, for example, the Omen or Prophesy series. Great movies with compelling stories, great cinema and intense music. Not a hysterical arm-shoulder. There is no preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie were to laugh, it would have been much better.
