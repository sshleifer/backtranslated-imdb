SMALL SPOILERS (but this is not important). <br /> <br /> Practice in gobblygooks with catastrophic proportions, which is not even worth the 100 lines I need to put these notes into network cylinders. This is one of the worst episodes of the Masters series so far and the first to qualify for a failed Mystery Science Theater treatment. Even though it meant to me half an hour to realize the planned ironic angle, it was still a very flat mess. Its only value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that besides gore and ugly masks, the genre can only succeed if the classical concepts of photography and light, dialogue and functioning, editing and timing are used. Here they are missing and John Carpenter is not a lord. Period. And there is no simple social comment here. Strangely enough, Carpenter has never been more than a B-director, but at least in movies like "Fog" and "The Thing" was a terrible atmosphere (the latter being one of my cult releases). <br /> <br /> Abominable acting. The corners of the camera are captured in the cement. Tension-free rhythm. But perhaps the episode is one of the most unpleasant elements of the story, which of course JC can't really blame (unless the writers were Cody buddies). Scully-Mulder's duo is the first and last thing that works in the movie. But come on, a girl who is hitting through abandoned forests somewhere, especially for the desperately needed abortion that accidentally throws a couple of “women's rights” with the MD's fenders whose clinic just happens to be along the way. Oh, and I'm not even talking about how a doc whispers an accident car into the car and accelerates from 0 to 60 seconds in six seconds. Is wonders possible for broken ribs or irritations. <br /> <br /> Then things will really break down quickly. Free dialogue "I want to help you just", gateway slowly forward and backward, grandiose fight tactics like phone line cutting (age of mobile phones?), Followed by shooting: born again Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and high school bullpen out a couple beating during Easter . Another pleasant line: "What are we doing then?" a boy who had just sat in an old rifle attack. Er, no, it's not a pheasant season. So who needs these teenage boys. But a good old tried and true method for a single madman who travels through his gate with his eternal SUV? <br /> <br /> With ball-changing scenes, cuts were as rigid as DC comics staccato. All that was missing were balloon headlines Wham, Bam and Whiz. And everything to set up an old track that values ​​the Mannix episode. <br /> <br /> At one point, we find out that Dad isn't really a daddy, but now we're not much taken care of. One of the sources of drama in this story is the conflict between a professional father and his daughter who is only grateful for not having twins. However, there are no scenes, rebounds or where they are actually found together. They remain merely abstractions for one another. <br /> <br /> Except for the goalkeeper, every single character is completely unpleasant. Bland, hysterical, dull, macho. As perfect as a human wallpaper can be. No doctor seems to see them as medical. And there is this bumpy father who rides his pregnant girlfriend as if he were a stressed boy. Fortunately, he got it. There are two great MST-worthy comics: gusher when Angelica's piping goes out and later the newborn lobster with the glued child's head. Angelica ragbipall was also lovely before she finally bounced a little monster to Hell's right life. As for this terrible male abortion scene, they should have retained the Miike episode and forbade it instead. <br /> <br /> In short, the third price of a Rosemary baby will meet with a foreigner M.A.S.H. episode. The stinker alone, which is only noticeable to today's admitted generations under the age of 16, will ensure, as someone else said, that this series will not be updated for the third season. True shame, because there have been a number of great productions, including really decent fears like Dante 'Homecoming' or McKee's delicious delicious Sick Girl. Not to mention Malone's "Fairhaired Child" great design. <br /> <br /> Sorry, John Carpenter, I believe your driving days are over. It's time to lead.
