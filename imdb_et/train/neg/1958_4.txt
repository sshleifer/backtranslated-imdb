Where to start. This movie started with something that seemed like hanging out of "Darkness Falls". An old woman living in an old forest, giving her gifts for her teeth. Sound familiar? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls", the tooth fairy killed you only when you saw him. The root of this movie killed you, no matter what. Why did they need rocker, his hippie girlfriend or Bubbat and their sister? I think the film would have been good without them. It seems that the producers were sitting around and decided that they had to add people to the film so that the dental manager would kill people. Although it is nice to see that a beautiful blonde girl is not a bubble head for change. Okay to rent, but I wouldn't want to buy it.
