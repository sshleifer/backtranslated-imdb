If I have never read a book, I would have said it is a good movie. But I read the book. Who ever wrote the screen destroyed the story. There are so many changes that it wasn't worth the title. Character changes, plot changes, timelines change ... <br /> <br /> Who was Henry and the researcher first? They were not a story. Henry was Mitch's personality, but Mitch was not a cop. No, you did it as Rozi, helped to sink your body and used it to extort Zenia against Roz. The real so-called blackmail was Roz, who thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to escape from her. His son had also been blackmailed because he hid Gay for his mother. His son wasn't even the story actually mentioned. I don't think his lover, Rozi's secretary. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not together at the beginning. He was really Zenia in college. The black painted apartment was their idea, Tony just went. Here, Zenia and Tony meet, becoming a quick friend. Tony hides his love for the West. Then, west of Zenia, money from Tony, West and Tony came together. Finally marrying, at some point West leaves Tony again for a short time to Zenia. Only the heart breaks again. Then go back to Tony. In Zenia's letter to Tony, Tony had written a test paper for Zenia. Now he's a college professor, he didn't want to get out of it. I say that the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. Zenia didn't do her cancer when Augusta was alive. No, he was there when Charis was a lover called billy. Augusta's father was in the Vietnam War. Finally, after Charly takes care of Zenia for several months for what was a drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have a thing under Charis's nose that they both take care of. Then Zenia turns to Billy's government and leaves the ferry with her. Not with August, Charis was pregnant with her. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was his real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia did not die because she was cut into pieces. and landed a fountain. He was almost pure heroin in the blood and it was likely that he didn't know and fell when he OD'd. He also died of cancer at that time. <br /> <br /> It did not show any childhood memories or anything that wrote to the reader. The book was striped with bare bones. Then someone's vision was made. Why couldn't you just write your story by what you did. It was quite different and I'm sure it could have done that.
