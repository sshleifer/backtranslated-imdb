I'm sorry I've bought this series. I was expecting more action, more objective picture and unity. It's just pure propaganda, very dark, without any charm or romance, it's just boredom. I think the actors are also working quite weak. O'Donnell may seem charming, like Robin (with Batman), but this picture lacks any charm. She will probably lose her childhood charm as she grows older, but will not win the increased charm. Not surprisingly, it wasn't shown in many countries and is sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price, and it wasn't even published in the Netherlands.
