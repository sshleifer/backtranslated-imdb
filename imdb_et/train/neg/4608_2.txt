I bought this DVD because it has a flock and mpa ratings; "R rated for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> what's right, the IMO should note; "R rated for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language." I think many people who have been watching this movie agree with me that parts of sexuality and nudity do not exist in ALMOST. My first impression, when I look at mpa rating, was that I was watching something "live". that is why I felt cheated. wisely, it was so that anyone who really cares about this story when it is a great flock. I know I won't. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
