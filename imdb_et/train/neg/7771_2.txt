This is one strange hacked movie, you feel that the bond company had to come into it, I'm not surprised that there is no credit for it to want to associate with this movie. The behavior of all the people involved is terribly harsh and the plot jumps all over, it makes little sense. As I said, it seems that the bond company was supposed to come because there seems to be a lot of video material that was not shot, and all the music was a very bad library music (cheap guess). Very, very odd. I can actually buy it from the DVD if he could put me in, what's going on in hell and what happened to this movie.
