I was at the premiere of this film at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the writer / director and some cast members suggested answering the questions, no one could even ask for a question. Rarely has the film been so badly guided (why were the random shots taken off the scene from some scene?) Acted terribly (David Arquette, paraphrasing Dorothy Parker, did not act emotionally from A to B). brings to the south) and totally meaningless. The characters behave completely without character, except to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the film ends up in a completely random and pointless end that should "think". Unfortunately, this is what you think is, "Well, there's 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."
