The first one was different and funny. This experiment should never have left the studio. This movie doesn't make you laugh. This is a weak attempt to remove humor. The film selects current and old movies. This time, jokes seem useless and redundant. The audience I saw was just Hannibal dinner and was otherwise asleep.
