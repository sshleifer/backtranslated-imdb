This film certainly has one of the most strange topics in history - right where Ed Wood's surprised protective layer is "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> Topic: Playing the bridge. Park Avenue set plays it; bohemians play it. The Russians, who are very questionable about "Russian" and who have the most convincing accents in English, play it in the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about the bridge, one - - despite the big pain, it's not likely that this strange movie would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are good. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer - like Lukas is an unlikely Russian language.) But they're all fetishist script sinking.
