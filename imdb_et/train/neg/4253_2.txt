It considers me one of the worst vampires men have ever received. How can such a mesmerizing theme be transformed into a completely unicycle circle? Probably not that difficult task ... First of all, the conditio sine qua non of any vampire film has a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, it lacks all these things. Too much light - spots! oh my god, why was it about Christ / Judah? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula came, he had eaten light (script to keep him weak, just: weak) Only one scene that made the end of this movie almost spectacular (beautiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, Judas wrestling was original, but it's not just good, in no way. Hopefully, the third is a vampire signature that I really like in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola Drakula, or even an interview with a vampire.
