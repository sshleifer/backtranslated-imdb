I am a big fan of the book and Orwell is definitely my favorite writer of GCSE from animal breeding. I bought honestly curiosity from the DVD, Burton is the actor I hold, so when I heard that he played the role of O'Brien, I had turned. <br /> <br /> I watched a trailer from a DVD First and some fears began to emerge, mainly due to the honestly horrible "Theme song" that heard Eurythmics mechanically calling "1984!" Time and again, electronic racing is as bad as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their role well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth can end, especially in a harrowing space 101. But this is also where the film is left behind. The film spends too much time concentrating on love relationships between Winston and Julia, which, frankly, is not what Orwell wrote. He wrote about a harrowing future, how Ingsoc builds a man's beliefs and crushes them all in his name to love Big Brother. Between the film, what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons, comes to life and the world and through retraining through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> IMDb's comment at the moment says the movie sticks to the book is completely wrong. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit to Goldstone's brotherhood and admit their crimes. There is no obvious reputation for those initial cases where Winston finds articles with Unpersons, but it ends up if you have not read the book, it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario that some excellent actors can't get. Michael Radford seems to have tried to completely abandon Orwell, and the electron sound track is, frankly, terrible.
