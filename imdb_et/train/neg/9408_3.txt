Looking at the playback of about 8 different 1994-1997 video games, the Spider-Man cartoons realized why I wasn't able to land it for the first time. <br /> <br /> I am from an old school where the 1967 Spider-man cartoon was the best and still the best. (I can't get into a psychedelic version that is terrible - give me a traditional crook.) <br /> <br /> The new thing is weak, read a page that has no sense or move. Paul Soles, where are you now? This man was the best voice for Spider-man. No one can get there. Watching secret wars, a great idea for a cartoon series, gave me a boost. Dr Doom sounds like the Bela Lugos comedy version. The Red Skull and Doc Ock scene lack the accent of Red Skull in Germany, while Ock is a hard Russian! The 1966 old Marvel comic series was a much better voice. The Ironman sounded like he was wearing a iron mask, the captain sounded America's authority, like some teenage children. Paul Frees as the 60's was the best thing ever. Old voice artists were pioneers and never get anyone. Did you hear Mel Blanc's son? He can't somehow copy his father. <br /> <br /> Animation is junk. Okay, so they have all the shadows of fancy characters and a nicely painted background. Sometimes it is possible to say more about less movement than more movement seems bad. Sometimes when you let the computer take over, they become a robot. I really don't think any of these animators know what's going on between them. <br /> <br /> The stories are badly written and some of the lines that the heroes give are terrible. Why, for example, when the heroes are hit for the first time, do they fight each other? In Secret Wars, it was a flat apology that disagreed with them. I see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher, but why the thing and the ironman can't keep their temples in one another is ridiculous, then the torch fits. Trends to get heroes to each other in a few seconds, because "everything" wants to see this stuff. Give them better reasons to fight and maybe pull it out, but "Hey, what are you doing here" and "You don't tell me what to do" are the reasons for LAME. Another badly written scene is the Wedding, where Harry Osborne remembers Peter's wedding. This whole scenario was terrible. <br /> <br /> The last, but certainly no less important, is what the other critic calls for juvenile violence - that is, it does not mean strikes at all. In Secret Wars, the lizard carefully created Thing's reward. But Thing strikes bad guys across a copy of the comic. He just has to turn to heavy lifting and a bad guy, grabbing him from cartoons. Of course, these cartoons were made not only for our adults, but for children under 12 years of age. That's why they can't make a hit because Mommy and Dad don't believe in this violence. But you can blow up, these cartoons contain it. As a child, before political correctness came in, I saw cartoons punching each other. What's wrong with chopsticks? Is there really less violence in today's world because these slippery and insidious cartoons took off? I find it the most offensive when I look at new things. They've written a "punch" because we all got injured ourselves. <br /> <br /> Kids, you enjoy the cartoons you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
