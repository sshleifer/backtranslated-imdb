With this title, I find that I'm not sure if the director is trying to make a documentary or a movie. The mix of the two genres just doesn't work and it leaves the whole thing suspended in the middle. All the more so because the director has chosen the most extreme circumstances that should happen in our everyday life, making it a convincing documentary. If it's for thriller / drama, it's too boring and monotonous. In either case, what is the moral or message the director tries to convey to the audience? That there are people around us who mistreat others who are willing to treat badly? Are there many mad people around us? So .......... what then?
