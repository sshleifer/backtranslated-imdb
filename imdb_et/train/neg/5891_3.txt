This Norwegian film is so messy, the participants can't act because they seem to have read the book and the story is so (wannabe) hollywood. The only actor who did the ok work was Haavard Lilleheie..3 / 10 you really want to watch a good Norwegian movie Buddy, great actors and a sensitive story 9/10
