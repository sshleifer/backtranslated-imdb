Maverick cop, having family problems and affection for using his weapon? Check it out! An isolated location with a valuable item that would ask you to steal? Check it out! Tasty looking love interest? Check it out! Mixed with a variety of carton cannon fodder collections, with a brilliant European accent? Check it out! German sounds like a bad boy, played by an English actress who has daily dialogue every time? Check it out! Corny One Lining? Check! <br /> <br /> Dear me, does this film take fun or what? Clich√©s are as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the molded billboards are just around the wrong script! <br /> <br /> Dirty cheap and cheerful straight video clips just from Hard Hard on the hill (with some nicked lines mentioned above) we have all the usual activities to move the cliche is labeled gradually when we go with some old old violence and nudity is thrown to awaken anyone who may be just Jack Wild is a policeman who is completely in John McClane mode here, who even manages the time when your ancient bad guy with a gun has used all his bullets gag at one point. <br /> <br /> In the midst of this confusion, there are some well-known, recognizable faces that I can only expect in cash and / or just by playing a laugh at a pointless opening scene that has nothing to do with the plot. The ultimate unlikely conclusion that includes full dialogue and even ropier effe cts. <br /> <br /> Looking at this three shopping mall shopping offer for IMDb, I am surprised that this dude did not create one but two sequences, I have to find these gems on DVD! It seems the first sequel is Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, well the goodness knows! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the player playing Jack changes with each film and even the name of the character becomes the third part. <br /> <br /> However, blind purchases of cheap DVDs would not be the same if studios did not keep this terrible quality material out!
