Usually I don't think Hollywood productions would fit into a movie, so I call them "movies." But this elephant is not even suitable for naming a movie, so in headlines. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of geriatric pain, it is definitely an excerpt. Stefanie Powers should play someone even less than half of her age, she should play 18 and she is a FORTY who does twice! <br /> <br /> 2. A terrible and silly senseless imagination from Paris and France, where we see signs of clich√©s, such as: a loving gracious shop owner, a female model queen, a model queen god, and so on. This movie is only crossed with this Da Vinci Code (which was rightly defined by the evaluators). <br /> <br /> 3. It is very and completely ridiculous that there is no nudity in the film about the time and place where nudity was so common, especially when all the attention is focused on it. <br /> <br /> 4. Terrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Nana Mouskour's Elevator Music !!! <br /> <br /> I can go ahead, but I think that's enough. And I could make these observations after I saw this mess for just half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to friends about math equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to your list. :): P: D
