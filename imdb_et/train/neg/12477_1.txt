This is one of those movies that you and your bunch of friends are sitting on, drinking and laughing. Unfortunately, I found myself looking at it alone. My friends and I rent a large movie block and never got to see it. It came back and I thought it wasn't looking at it. So I did and I was impressed when this movie is very terrible. <br /> <br /> Now, I love bad movies quite a bit, and I would probably have liked it if the "hero" wasn't so meaningless. The whole movie I was hoping he'd put it on a silly sword and let someone kill him! He does very little heroic things in the film. He's a weird, disgusting, stupid thing. It has less redemptive qualities than villains. And what was it with all the naked chicks? I mean, I love naked chicks as much as the next boy, but this movie went overboard in this department. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and you can be a nasty hero "then I'm sure you like this movie scheme.
