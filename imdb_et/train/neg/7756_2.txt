I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and was caught again recently. The Sci fi channel is worse but not much. Shameless Cranberry Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats with dinosaurs. And they're open, eating as many extras as possible. CGI is pretty bad, and the heads of the prosthetic cats are ridiculous. We get some holes to help a little. Wait until you see how this mad scientist who started this mess gets it. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, is cast unknown. Apparently it was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can get it. Reminds me of all those low-budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
