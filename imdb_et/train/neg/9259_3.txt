The Omen 4: The Wakening is a follow-up to television for the original movie The Omen. Instead of Satan embracing the body of a little boy, he has a little girl's body that has been received by rich parents who have been bullied at school and who are revenge against those who do wrong. The film seems to be struggling with any horror factor, and many of the events that are happening are just foolish, not particularly intimidating, and it is hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events surrounding it. I just didn't find this movie very tense or intimidating, especially when compared to the original.
