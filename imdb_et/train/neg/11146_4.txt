Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I really didn't know my rent, and sometimes it's all you can ask. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the actress is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. Management is satisfactory, but the impact is terrible, especially werewolves, which are a big problem in werewolves. There was a pretty decent nudity that was pretty good for me, but it wasn't that hot. All in all, it's a relatively average for a movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're a boring genre fan, look at it sometime. I even look at it again.
