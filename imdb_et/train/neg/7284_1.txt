Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so terrible that I had to see it, and my gosh, I smell it in St Louis. Where do I start? The National Lamps tried to follow the success of the animal house after 5 years, but they were left unchecked. Going chronologically with these short clips. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Animal Zoo). Apparently he didn't work at that time so the National Lampoons boys called and said, "Hey, we're making a c ** ppy movie, we want to be?" Peter was "well, I don't do a lot of these days, why not?" He was a great side of the animal house, but he couldn't bear this short flop in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is funny enough because Jason Cooper (Riegert) tells his wife to leave her, she has to find her. It's too weird that they are actually happy marriages. So he wants him where he goes, and Cooper is responsible for the children. This, of course, leads him to burn the house, losing several children and sleeping with the New York bimba selection (including always so young Diane Lane). Then the woman returns, wants the children, and the film ends with a coin flip that decides the destiny of the children. The idea was actually somewhat clever, but the director collided. The signs all seem as if they are asleep, they had to be doped. Excuse Boon, your legacy has faded on this flop. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 2 <br /> <br /> More Spoilers <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. Pretty girl, a recently completed college, is not sure what to do with her life. So he gets a slut, starts to sleep about mega rich guys, takes his money when they die, and he doesn't stop until he beds the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean president of the United States). Once again, it might have been funny, and although I was happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) was not afraid to reveal everything, his actions were terrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can't believe I did it that far. Here is the novice policeman Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, thinks he can really help people, even though he gets stuck several thousand times. Nagurski really refused to care. He looks at revenge, attacks, calls it and never intervenes. He thinks the world is lawless and he can complain if he does something. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of a taxi) goes to action, getting the police to call him, commit a crime, but having his lawyer there to protect him. God Blesses America !! <br /> <br /> Once again, it might have been funny, the performances were deliberately campy, but goodness, not energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed of their names on this shock. I think writing was not bad, ideas existed, but the execution was pulled out and the rescue attempt in Iran's hostage crisis. When I was part of this movie, I would like to remove my name, it's terrible. Then again I watched it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr. John made a film score (repeating "going back and forth") and there is no movie. t much longer than one and a half hours. Show it in film classes titled "What You Should Never Do When Making Movies." This script should have been on the shelf because yes, it is so bad.
