What a mess !! Why was this movie made? This and other "caliber" films should be a learning tool for not making a movie. Children may like it, but someone over the age of 10 may or may not approve it. Worse still, such great talents as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were completely wasted in a movie that was not worthy of a message.
