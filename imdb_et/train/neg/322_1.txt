I saw this movie about 5 years ago and its memory still haunts me. I was fully aware of how terrible it should go, so I'm just guilty. But like most, I didn't believe in all the negativity. As a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable that one of his films might be so bad. I thought it was just Sandler's angry. I couldn't have been wrong. <br /> <br /> We have a comedy here that doesn't contain anything funny for even a second. This is actually quite an achievement. You think in 90 minutes of comedy that they would accidentally stumble something even far more amusing. But no, it's just terrible. It's not "so bad it's good" but just bad. You can't laugh, how bad it is, you can just cry. You are patiently waiting for jokes that will at least make you fool, but they will never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the Ring? When people watch video tape and die 7 days later? When this movie was on a videotape, people died immediately, on their own, and their face would smile when they realized that their torment was over, and that would be the first smile as they played. <Br>> <br /> You may have a tendency to look at it to see how bad it is, not being able to limit your curiosity. Don't. Please don't. Trust me, I'll do you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who think that Going Overboard has ever been the worst film and those who haven't seen it yet.
