We all know that the film will never make the book fair, but it is exceptional. Significant characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially the same, most of the main sub-blocks and key elements were removed. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely low, so it seemed much lower than what I felt in the book. In the book, we learn more about his powers and the important influences he had on so many people, which in turn was a key element of family life. In the film he was no more than one special lady. Relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third, by the way, is a son and so come after Segundo-second) and its connections between Esteban and his grandson Pancha Garc√≠a (not the son he did). recognized) has been cut in half and its importance has diminished. <br /> <br /> One of the most important things in the book that the movie is all about, except: it is called the "Spirit House". Where's the house? The story of the 3-4 family generation should be turned around in the "big corner of the house", which has been mentioned so many times in the novel. The house is the essence of the story, but the film unfairly reduces it to the background. <br /> <br /> If I haven't read a book before, I would never have thought that such a cute, low-profile movie could be a rich and fun novel.
