I watched the Malayalam film "Boeing Boeing" (which in turn was inspired by the English name of the same movie) in 1985. The main story of Garam masala is the same - but it is said in a pathetic manner, stylish jokes are replaced with the usual jokes found in films at normal prices (the director probably did it to suit the taste of the Hindi audience) ... <br /> <br /> I didn't see English. But did he really enjoy the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a flattering comedy at that time. Of course, Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who made the role of chefs) were both natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Probably I'm also a Malayalam movie that I can't tolerate even minor mistakes in his Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have crossed. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but not near Sukumar. <br /> <br /> But everything is OK when comparing it to other recent Hindi comedy films.
