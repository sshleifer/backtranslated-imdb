As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can withstand any movie that can worship me, but there is no reason for that. <br /> <br /> The rated "Super Action" Blockbuster Video section and the scared "Limited View Sticker" I assume are the only methods that filmmaker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4, 50 from one unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Robert Napton! It is a shame that you use the poor Mexican actors you probably promised to become big in the American cinema. You are shameful! <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this movie that has the slightest action. Did you use tatt for these people? Oh, look, they have a rave in the field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't this an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always daily? Why did it take a half of the movie to show .. and more importantly, why do we look at the other half? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
