It was supposed to be the LOTR trilogy parody. But it was one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. Bad action, bad scenario, bad things. This is my personal opinion. I have no doubt that there are people who like this "sense of humor", but the films of recognized directors have had better parodies like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I work in cinema and DVD store, and the success of this movie was similar in both areas: it had a nice (but not great) success in two (2) weeks, but when the comments from those who saw it were not too good , the movie dropped very fast. In the case of DVD sales, this short time was good, but no one demanded it anymore. In the last ten years, the two worst films I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which one was worse, but I'm happy to have so many good movies so I don't have to think too much about that.
