One friend asked me to read his scenario, which the film studio chose. To say that this is one of the most intuitive and uncomfortable scripts I've ever read would be a bold underestimation. But I never told him that. Why? Because in a world where films like "though he was out" can be green and attract Oscar winning stars like Kim Basinger, the scenario that lacks character, content and common sense is not a guarantee that it will not sell. br /> <br /> As many other reviewers have pointed out, "Although he was out" was a terribly under-written film that abused the housewife Basinger, who was hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve. Each grip is justified, weakened by dialogue and bad actions, until the logic falls, but Basinger is such an interesting actor and the assumption is not without promise. Here are a couple of things that hit me: <br /> <br /> 1) I don't care how much we think his wife is a jerk, the house is a mess with toys. Since then has child abuse been used to make the children themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare, except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Make sure the movie is stupid. But there are also countless "thrillers" where I have sat where women are depicted as male, sadistic, helpless. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman in the best way with her tormentors. <br /> <br /> 4) I loved the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although the previous reviewer created this phrase, I really think this movie should be "Doom's Red Toolbox".
