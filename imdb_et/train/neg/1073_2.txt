I can't believe that so many talent can be wasted in one movie! Gingerbread Man starts from the right foot and succeeds in creating some great expectations until the end. But at some point, the film becomes one of the worst readings I've ever wasted on my time. It's just as incredible how blessed Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branaghi's character around his nose. The climax of the film is as interesting and flat as the beer that is too long in the sun. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham movie, which is not changed by the fact that talented stars collect a movie. Don't waste your time here!
