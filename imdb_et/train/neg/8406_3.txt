A memorable line from a short-term show. After watching the episode where this line was introduced, the football team of my brotherhood started a line to break our offenses. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter returned to FOOTBALL and the rest of the team answered YOU! A fun way to break that our opponents scratched their heads because very few had watched the show. Adding this line added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had the best time during our college this year and this was a small way due to the fact that we used this line. The exhibition was pretty stinky, but it lives in the memory of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi domestic flag football team at West Virginia Tech.
