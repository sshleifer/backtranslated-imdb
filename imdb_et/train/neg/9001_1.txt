When I watch a movie, I am aware that this is just a movie, but I still want to allow myself to get into these situations as much as possible. I think it makes us cry, yell, laugh or otherwise react emotionally to the audience, although we know it's "just a movie." What I don't want is to remind the film that it's just a movie, so I can't get the engrossment mentioned above, regardless of the quality of the movie. The director of this movie often chose multiple angle camera shots on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I find it terribly annoying and irritating. They can also run a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen, "Attention! It's just a movie. Don't let yourself be too intrigued or intruders. If I want a picture in the picture, I'll activate it on my TV remote control, but never during the movie I want to enjoy.
