This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake of the better version of dangerous Liasons. The plots are identical to most scripts. I loved the book as its basis, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to worry about the third movie. Unnecessary catching between the two main characters prequelis was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I just can't stress how bad the film was. If you don't want to take my word, just look at it and see what I mean. If you've read a review that says "If you like the first one, you'll love the other" because that's the only reason it's just the same movie! Although the plot is not even so good. They took so many lines from the first movie, it's hard to tell what movie you're watching.
