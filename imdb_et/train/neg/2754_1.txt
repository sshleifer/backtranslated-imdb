My initial review of this movie was just the word sh * t, written 2000 times. Although this was a very precise criticism, I felt that my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> Start with a leading actor; his facial expression in this film does not change, he does not show fear, happiness or depression. His body language skills come in quite a lot, so his eyes turn left and right and look like he doesn't know the nest. He is an emotional cream that I think is too much botox. However, his lack of facial expression through the film is an extremely pathetic love relationship with a leading actor who seems to be away from somewhere, and has shaped them on the beach and falls in love within a few hours of meeting each other. The main actor whose hair requires more attention than he did was at best mediocre and never made me feel that he was really in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that surprises is management, storyline and inaccuracies on the plot. I've seen more tampon ads than this movie. There is no development of character, they just seem to say and do things I can never believe that a real person would be. <br /> <br /> This movie would not have been bad if it was trying to be embarrassing, like snakes on an airplane, but it was trying so hard that I couldn't even laugh. I believe I now have a brain tumor who looks at this movie and thought of all the different ways I could have used this budget and the cg team to create something much better. When I bought this DVD I would split the DVD into pieces, then burn it by dissolving it in hydrochloric acid. DON'T SEE THE FILM!
