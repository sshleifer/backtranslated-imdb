What this film works well is to combine fear and comedy between comedy and drama in a unique way that sharpens more emotions than a regular horror movie. Unfortunately, this is not the most frustrating and contradictory scene of the film, depressing holes and contradictory scenes. Let's start with good things: comedy, actors and special effects. Get-go, this movie begins with a fast paced and cheeky. Open scene - the origin of the monster - is fast and fast, respecting the classic "environmental disasters" that have given birth to so many other monsters. Stimulation is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening of other monsters and allows the film to jump straight into action. Within 10 minutes you will get the "why", "where" and "how" beast and you are ready to act. This movie is behind the film. <br /> <br /> After the next short and well-captured sequence, characters will be introduced: lazy son and his early little girl, kind grandfather and talented sister (aunt) and of course a monster. Characters are introduced to each other and their conflicts immediately appear, allowing the audience to feel when the monster suddenly appears to destroy the river in the area where they live and work. The deer itself looks good: the alien is still familiar - like a dog and a fish that the squid pulls out. The influence of the creature is different, and while it seems strange, it is plausible and it is not seen at some point in the film. Even the movement of the monster was terribly familiar, such as the growing and exciting rottweiler on linoleum, which monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on the surface, crushing and eating along that road. If the path of the monster crosses with the family and a tragedy occurs, it is really a painful moment and you may feel the need for revenge, but from there the film appeal will open. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the dynamite, the movie quickly loses focus and consistency. Introducing line lines, then abandoning, characters changing their positions for no apparent reason, and comedy embedded in dramatic scenes that interfere with intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly by chance. As far as comedy is concerned, let me say this: I agree to accept that a lot of humor is probably cultural. I don't know Korean humor, so maybe things have lost their translation. However, as Asia is studying in college and someone who has been living in Japan for the last five years (still here), I would like to think that I have a better understanding of Asian humor than the average white boy. That said, there were many parts of the movie that I had to be funny, but it wasn't for me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the first attack where a young daughter disappears, the family is a funeral; everything is grieving. Introducing a new character - a brother - and the tension is further increased, as it turns out that the two brothers are in conflict with each other. They both intimidate and compete with each other for their loss, which makes it more difficult to saddle. This competition is at the core of this competition: two brothers who do not like each other so much that they even compete at the funeral - this is a sign of family love spread in Asian comedy. This exquisite sliding comedy that had fun in the family and ritual mourning should be funny, but seemed really inappropriate in the context of a little girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then come the holes in the plot. There are so many points in this movie that have never been explained or, worse, explained and intimidated only if they prove impossible and meaningless. Finding an obstacle is not an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you should comment on it. Instead, the audience picks up the climax from the moment the problems simply cease to exist and no one signals that it was a problem at the beginning. So I ask you: why even bring it first? <br /> <br /> It was spread through the film, because the problems created new problems and suddenly the world of the film is full of opposing forces that didn't solve each other. Of course, the introduction of new and bigger problems is a time-consuming tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads to another forced shortening, you at least expect the new arc to be fully explained. Not in this movie. Instead, it was as if you had received several stories, each of which explained only 20% of the way, and eventually the parts would never go together to complete the greeting. <br /> <br /> Again, I agree with this may be "cultural." Perhaps it is in the Korean tradition to put the comedy into a tragedy. Perhaps it is common for stories to be passed on to a child who steals outlines on each page but never ends. Perhaps it is a problem to work out the plot, but remove this problem accidentally without a visible solution or catharsis. Or maybe they are all sloppy work and bad storytelling that curbs the film, which seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
