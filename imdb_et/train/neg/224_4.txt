The worst thing about Crush isn't that it worked pretty halban or that the plot is almost non-existent, and it's not so bad that the camera work could have been better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of this movie is that it has some absolutely brilliant moments that will keep you in the hope that there will be more. <br /> <br /> But in the end there is too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and cheap 40-year-old women crying and hugging and talking about toddlers and marriage - don't forget it always. <br /> <br /> I myself am not excited to see the above things in the movie and as a result I had a rather terrible time. Few absolutely brilliant jokes can't make up for the rest. <br /> <br /> Decision: 4/10. Guilty of wasting your time. <br /> <br />
