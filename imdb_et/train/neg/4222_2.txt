For those of us who lived these weeks around the city and the Valley - we wouldn't forget the tedious days of road closure and movie making. Remember that people living here - Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was a BC fire; Chase Scenes Included Moon Drive Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was closest, Matt Broderick was all over us - even then. As far as the film is concerned, the fun of the script and even the bigger laughter of acting and plot - but who takes care of it. A nice time capsule for those who enjoy our coastal and valley landscape. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe Bar (Jedi Tavern), the original name of the movie was Welcome to Buzzsaw - Old Erba's parking lot was a city square, in the backyard were Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the cap and see some actors in your first days.
