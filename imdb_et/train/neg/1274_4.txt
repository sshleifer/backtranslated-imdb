It should have been a movie about Samis and his wife, the famous Peter Falk and equally famous Olympia Dukak. It would have been a worthy sight of the movie. Instead, it is a Paul Reiser vehicle with a small Falk. This wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you hardly know it. I expect Reiser to have the impression that he is a giant film star who needs a suitable vehicle. He's not. What is even more acute is that Reiser has struggled to hire today's best female actors on the screen and then pushed them all back to their background. Dukakis doesn't appear until the last 15 minutes, but when he does, it glows on the screen. The story really talks about Falk and Dukak, but we've gone through a pointless, silly, reluctant journey where Reiser can show you a very cute, precious and oh-so-deep psychological understanding (wrong!). For example, in a restaurant scene that I imagined Reiser had hoped for "Cassavetes-like" is a ridiculously wrong confrontation between Reiser and Falki, which is so ridiculous, I was embarrassed by Falk.
