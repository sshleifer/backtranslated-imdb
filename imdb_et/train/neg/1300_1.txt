This movie should never have been done. Frankly, I have to admit that before I saw it, I had serious doubts. The director is not a big actor, although he made many films in the Netherlands, and the main young woman involved is a TV personality with a constant smile on his face and not much self-criticism. An actor who played the second main part, I recently saw in Bride Flight, and although this film is better, he didn't convince me as. To start with the story, I haven't read the novel that it is based on, but the script that hides the movie is something that could have been remembered as kids having a birthday party are rainy on Sunday afternoon, and no one else. the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really worrying about dialogue was held in excess dialogues. My perceptions go to the cameraman, at least he tried to do something about it. It is a pity that the film is delivered in bad, if not, some scenes were certainly more reliable.
