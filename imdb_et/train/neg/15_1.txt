That's it. It's one. This is never a movie. Never. It wins all. I've never seen anything worse. Stay on the trophy and give it to those people ..... there's not just a comparison. <br /> <br /> Even after watching it for three days (for some reason I still don't know why) I can't believe how crazy this movie is terrible. It's so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a film, a story or something that should have ever been created and started to exist. <br /> <br /> It put me in doubt as to whether people really are on this land or not. do good. This made me classify myself and our progress in this universe. Such a film damages us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility for the people and art that we live here is that we must prevent these serious distortions from occurring in our reality for our own sake. It's embarrassing. I don't know how any of these actors, writers, or film directors on the earth sleeps at night knowing that they have a role to play in "loaded". I don't know what type of nasty monsters are watching such movies. <br /> <br /> So I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> This, however, goes beyond the "bad" line to a completely new dimension. It's bad bad. It's bad where you know everything that happens, every line, every action, every death, every sequence before they happen; and not just like the second or two, before I like it, after the first 5 minutes of viewing before. <br /> <br /> Every cheese effect "effect" is shamelessly used over and over again. I really don't want to see a "shaky" camera "drug speed" or jump or cut or cut FANCY CUT EVER AGIN EVER. It's carefully boring, repetitive, and just tortures the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be the most specific, most amazing thing about this movie, is that given the given output, a somewhat decent amount of money appears in this stool. I personally take the director's shoulders when I see him and shake him first, demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of Drain-O or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture abroad by our prisoners of war, show them again in a cushioned cell. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd session. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies, they are just the most uncertain of all aspects of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
