This movie was one of the worst I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> This is a combined police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, who are exploring the hip hop club shootout. <br /> <br /> The plot is built up and has too many side questions. Ford pulls the property away (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs in a yoga school, where he entices chicks in his spare time, two is in the field of internal affairs, Ford spins out a former girlfriend (Lena Olin) from a IA investigator and is a psychologist with a radio broadcast, man, who started the killing of the club is a dirty ex-policeman who shot Hartn's father years ago. <br /> <br /> Toss mandatory car rides and some flat tests of humor, and that's the essence of this turkey.
