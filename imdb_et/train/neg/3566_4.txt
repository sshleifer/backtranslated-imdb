Now I have not read the original story to find out what literary points went wrong here, so I am not going to get past this. <br /> <br /> But I've been learning for a while that Stephen King is just filming movies, maybe a few exceptions. It wasn't one of them. It started well enough, and when I didn't show it, even though Fred Gwynne was conventionally wonderful. I also forgive my parents' total lack of skills because they were the necessary story to move on ... <br /> <br /> But it was one consistent point I couldn't help but annoy. And it came close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters were stupid in stupidity. The moments I refer to are: There is a small little zombie in the house. You suspect it's under the bed. Are you as close to the bed as possible before you make the duvet dark, revealing quite a bit of any damage to your body that such a deaf undead can cause to you, or (b) move a little away from the bed so you can get a slightly open tip from a higher safety point of view, or at least see a small amount of joy coming to you, giving you a little response time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go together (a). I feel killed today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Well enough movie ... Just not very scary.
