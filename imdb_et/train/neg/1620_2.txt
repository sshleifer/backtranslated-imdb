This film has little to suggest, although it is a bit enchanting scenery, cinematography and wildlife direction, it is difficult to point out its weak points in such a rave review. It is these things that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched it with my children and none of us was finally impressed. Yes, the pictures were big, big landscapes over the forest and the mountains were great, but what was in the foreground? Quite uncomfortable narration of the uncomfortable girl's stupidity, who is learning too slowly a very simple lesson of the nature-friendly - and goes quite easily on the basis of the experience of such a thing. Certainly, this is not a new story, in fact there is nothing like it is said, and we have all seen it before and have seen Antoine de Saint-Exupéry much nicer. <br /> <br The only thing that really comes from this movie is the idea of ​​working with these wonderful lenses and forest lights; the rest is a waste of time.
