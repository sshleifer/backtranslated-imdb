Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> While on the comedy side there was a good actor - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell - it was just not an interesting movie. Mixes between the comedy section and the tragedy were uncomfortable or sometimes obvious. This viewer was originally confused by the fact that the supporting casting was different in two respects; I was wondering how things were opened in the scene, so that the people around Melinda would be the same people, just reacting differently (more "He said," he said "as a prerequisite). But we have two completely different stories and two completely different women, both played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> Two playwrights in the opening plan - the comedian and the tragedy take the same premise and go there, but these two stories are only weakly connected. The topic of the discussion is little supported, which means that almost everything can be seen as comedy or tragedy. A nice cast, but disappointing film.
