** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is one BAD movie. Seriously. Acting absolutely terribly, the FX dreadfull and the plot are terribly terrible. But hey, it's so bad to have fun! The script is so bad that it's enjoyable! You just have to laugh and laugh at lines like "I think that's what you call CROCTEASING". when women on their crocodile flashing. I mean COME ON, which is funny because it's so bad! It has such terrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while it will just change when the movie changes. I really started to fall asleep. Trust me, however, that the plastic footprint of the leaves and the constant swing of the tail of the plate will keep you long in laughter. Although I have to say that this was one cool part, when the crock folded this guy in half and he just hung there for a while, explaining what to do. Heh heh foolish movie that comes in MST3K line!
