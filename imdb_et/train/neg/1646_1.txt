I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but it was too much. Operation was not great, but it was not a real problem. The problem was that I felt like I fell into my belly well for about 20 minutes. These signs were hollow. They had almost no depth, and how little they were devoted to the cruelty they showed to each other in their friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be exciting, but you need to give personalities to those characters, or they are just out of the board. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
