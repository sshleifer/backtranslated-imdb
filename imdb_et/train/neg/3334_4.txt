It frightened me of hell when I was a teenager. Now I find it more fun than frightening, but with somewhat unpleasant moments and quality that I like. And come to think that the plot is really really nasty ... but handled with some taste. If there are problems with this movie, there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting will happen. Eventually, it goes a long way, making a potentially tense climax after a while, when Barbara Bach screams and screams. "Monster", after being exposed, is unfortunately not harmful. The somewhat dreary look of the film also works against it, making it more than anything intended for theaters as a TV movie. But this is an example of movies that are rarely done today, so I invite horror fans to watch it and feel a little nostalgic ...
