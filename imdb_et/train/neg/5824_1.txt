I thought it would be at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, terrible and boring. I almost slept. There are some decent songs, but in the end it is one song that is just a guy shouting "Yaowwww!" if someone touches a random wooden object. Saying this, there are some pretty songs, but it's not worth watching the movie. Go to iTunes (they have an album), check it out and choose good. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is making a way. Well, it's a slight exaggeration. But you see what I mean when you see it. That said: DO NOT KNOW!
