The National Lamp was never a funny magazine. Did you enjoy the stoner-hippie days of the sixties or the mysterious and dirty coke days of the seventies (when comedy was enriched with plenty of naked children) depends largely on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that in the early eighties the Middle Ages had killed the sparks of anarchic humor that drugs had there were no such films and ever more terrible spin-off records came to the hull. There is nothing outside the nicely illustrated title queue that would suggest this only frustrating stinkbug. If you do this through the clutter-opening segment, "Growing yourself", hoping that things will improve, will be hard for luck - they won't. Who thought that the idea that a woman should be brutally raped was the gold of the comedy she had earned to have her give her a dog out of the mess. If there is a global shortage of guitar languages, the negative sides of this roaring, inconsistent ragout color negative thoughts and terrible performances may be for some purpose.
