How Irish critics about this film are engraving me. The Irish band's usual band crossed every Irish movie. A terrible scenario with constraints (brown sauce). Everything that is bad about Dublin is romantic. "Ah, it's a dump, but you're not sure it's all the same". Lots of tidbits for a purely American audience (supermarket boss and his terribly forced vocabulary). And the coffin was the character of Colm Meaney. A great actor forced to play the part that could have been written five years old. Precious stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's bad when you say it. Well, at least he didn't put his terrible American accent. International audiences should be warned: stay home and see Snatch and Lock Stock. You have a better time. Interval is non-walking
