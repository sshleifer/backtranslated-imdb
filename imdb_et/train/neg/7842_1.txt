It is randomly caught in t.v. showing - and hardly believing if the whole experience is terribly terrible. By comparison, the original "male-called horse" was spellbinding because it kept all its interest. But this nonsense - the words are not capable of me. It was bad enough to have a "story" that had the effect of the whole bread, but this mistake was accompanied by the obvious lack of subtitles when the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For the sake of prosperity, the filmmakers could not find enough North American Indians who were also actors and actors to act as "Indians" instead of the farrago they actually used? I also found it quite embarrassing to see Richard Harry in the whole countryside when the director stood under his clear arm, standing behind the camera, saying he was running and jumping from point A to point B to make a movie and minutes. Absolutely terrible in every sense!
