To summarize this film: Without a real plot, this film consists of an 80-minute lost character that drives or makes bad jokes. The music is just terrible, humor is not funny and all female characters are slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the film is actually written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks drinking is cool, women are meant to please men and everyone who opposes this view. Also, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie films, except for some names and Mr Levenstein, who is in this little character. The only good thing about this movie is the beautiful girls. Don't look at this movie and don't be fooled by 5.4 ratings because it is obviously overrated and deserves nothing.
