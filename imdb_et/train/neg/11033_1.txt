The last Rumor goes around that Vh1 will start calling I Love New York in mid-2008. So does that mean Budah or Tailor made a dump in New York, or does it mean a New York dumped winner? <br /> <br /> I know that the taste of love is coming to the third season, so now with love and love of New York 3 ..... is there ever a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I've also heard some rumors that Chance can bring back I Love New York's 3rd season !!!! I have also heard rumors that New York is especially loved by the taste of love 3. <br /> <br /> Hopefully it wasn't too much for spoiler I Love to finish in New York 2 m just noting the last rumor.
