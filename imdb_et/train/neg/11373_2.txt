Watching this movie is not obvious (so I suggest that viewers study the people who present their case), but this representation of the reality of Islam and its encouragement to violence and intolerance against non-Muslims is not objective and does not fully affect the human condition. One thing is to document that the Quran says a lot of things about how a committed Muslim is bound to communicate with non-Muslims, but every realist understands that not every person who feels like a follower of Islam wants to accept and follow all that faith and system. principles. There are good reasons to ask a lot of reporters so that viewers must present the presentation with healthy skepticism; do not swallow it all, hook, line and sinking without your thinking. <br /> <br /> One particular, for example, is the study of Walid Shoebat; who claims a former Muslim who committed a terrorist act in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe either of these statements. I am not and have never been a Muslim. I have never read the Quran. I'm neither a Christian nor a member of faith. But I'm a smart and attentive person. Although the film is quite disturbing, it presents how some Muslims look at their commitment to Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than fundamentalist views. Just as they are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, the intensity of the Jewish and Muslim beliefs and responsibilities is also different. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you have to shake your hands. One fruit is not enough, you need more. Please use your mind and think for yourself, explore what has been presented, and assess the world situation and how Islam suits it for over 98 minutes. Among those who put together this film, there is a common political affiliation that shows firm bias. Be your brain.
