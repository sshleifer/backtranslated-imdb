Has anyone changed this movie? Or was it just a DVD edition that had thirty gaps between scenes? That's fine, I slept at the first time I looked at it. Then I slept a second time and for the third time. The plot is not really the worst I've seen, but it's close. The actor is not the worst I've seen ... but it's close. Production ... well, I can honestly say it was the worst I've ever seen in my life! Trying to be malicious, but Unhinged could have used more production. <br /> <br /> Please don't think I'm a hate movie movie or even that I didn't enjoy this movie. I just felt like I was laughing at the movie much more than I felt smiling with a laugh. The scary moments were not too bad, but they could have been done better in the shoestring budget. without much exposure. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
