This film is pure guano. Mother always said that you can't say anything nice ... but even mom would say I have to do my part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is the movie Geoffrey Rush would just like to go. I hope Greg Kinnear fired his representative ... from a cannon to give him a script. After that, Ben Stiller is likely to pray that someone will stay "There's something else about Mary." I've always been a fan of Wes Stud, thanks to every saint for wearing a film through the mask so people can't identify with the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts promisingly with Cinematography of Batman movies and then simply loses something ... like a single plot and half a decent effect. <br /> <br /> The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline arrives, and even then they fall off. If you want to see an effective robbery of the comic book, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! DO NOT CANCEL "MYSTERY MEN"!
