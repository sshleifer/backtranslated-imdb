Could this be the same driver who is not looking at it now or badly? Badly <br /> <br /> worked, clique edited. To see how much Roeg has lost its <br /> <br />, you only have to compare different accident scenes with similar ones that are not currently being viewed. <br /> <br /> Even a generally trusted Teresa Russell (I look at them a little, I'm afraid to report) can't save it. The plot is a pure pseudo-religious hockey, the actor is wood, and Roegi's attempts to relocate his mark are pathetic. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague.
