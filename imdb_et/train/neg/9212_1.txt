the only value in this movie is basically laughing how bad it really is. With a plot that changes the look of your average high school writer and that is almost as good, I get my main point. one of the very early films of Tom teeth, where obviously it was not a pleasure to be real picky. The best special effect of the movie is the boy dressed in an incredibly fake monster.
