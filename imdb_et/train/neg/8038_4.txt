** SPOILERS ** A Redicules slasher film that doesn't make any sense when the killer runs around and is dressed in black clothing and a backpack that looks like a Peter Lorre rubber mask. At the beginning of the movie, almost in the first scene, it was said that the young Beth Morgan was hard for drug use due to rehabilitation when his boy was killed in Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> It has also been pointed out that the FBI agent Sacker (Jeff Conaway), who is attached to the killer, was also murdered in Tennyson at the same time. By the time the movie "Do you want to know the secret" is over, it has never been explained what these two killings in Connecticut are all about killing about one and a half college students in Florida in a year? the other thing is that the killer, at least Beth's murderous murderer, wore the same silly Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> On Spring Day in Sunshine State, six students spend their holidays at the beach house and before knowing they start knocking one after the other. Beginning with a computer network from Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, the killing even lost to a city with many people who have nothing to do with a target student, including police chief Gavin, Jack McGee. The masked killer rescues Beth from the last strange ceremony in an abandoned church that looks like the Florida Everglades. Then he finally shows who his nature is and what his intentions are, which makes so much sense if the film is not, none. In an attempt to intimidate this audience, it is all confused and puzzled by a number of not convincing slasher scenes. The most effective victims of Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, lived at least three times in their lives and ended up with the filmmaker Sacker. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a witch-cut mouth from a large glass pane that cut it almost half and complained to her, but later she miraculously restored, after arrest for a murder she didn't do, in fact she was with her twice more with her Not so small that he walked slightly slips! There was also no point in why Oz and Beth went to kill the killer instead of calling the police and the killer with whom Oz was instead? <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend, who loses his head over him, in Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very convincing as well as two girls from a beach house. They, along with Beth Oz, are victims of the killers and then somehow disappear! for a moment you didn't know if they were killed at all or if it was some hallucination in Oz or in the local police department. Until the end of the wall where they jumped in the church. <br /> <br /> We will also get an overview of past relationships with Tina and Hank, drunk and uncomfortable, trying to get it together with Hank when Beth walks without Hank and Tina even without noticing him. It seemed to bother Beth even more when his boy was murdered at the beginning of the movie!
