This series gets worse and worse. Poor written and just not funny! The assumption is great, but the inexperience of the writer is out. In an effort to insult someone so hard, they are all offensive. Now, for the second season, the desperate majority has stopped their weapons and used this patronizing, mysterious, "Oh, foolish" style that is laughing with the script. They roll their eyes and shake their heads to each other if we say we're not eating? Isn't that funny? No, it's not really. Gum disease is less painful. Not surprisingly, Canadians avoid Canadian television, except the corner. Come to the CBC to assume we need to be our leading station to introduce Canada's best talent. Pull the plug into this amateur mess.
