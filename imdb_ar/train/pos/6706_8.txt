I remember this show because it became a regular show on Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a young girl moving with her cousins ​​who are apparently witches. Sabrina must learn how to effectively control and use human resources. She also has to deal with the school's evil competition called Lippi, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkel ... <br /> <br /> The show was fun and enjoyable. She kept an amusing Saturday night for a 10-year-old boy .. and made him laugh out loud ... and flirting with "Libby" ....
