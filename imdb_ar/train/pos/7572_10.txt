I can not believe that these games can get much better, but they do it. Unfortunately, I had to hire Dreamcast to run it, but despite overcoming it, I can not wait to buy it for the PS2. This is the only series of games that I have to have all of them even if I have overcome them several times. I hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series has come to an end. <br /> <br />
