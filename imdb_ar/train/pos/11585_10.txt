This film is full of good stocks of horror movies: crazy chained, murder before meditation, crazy scientist (mysterious lesbian) with a beautiful father wearing a mask because of his terrible disfigurement, poisoning, castles, wolves and females), adultery, dead lovers, The factory for some unnamed experiments, serious theft, mind control, fenced bodies, a car accident on a single road, electrocution, cavalry in armor - a lot, all topped by an incredibly horrendous outcome and some of the worst acts of Foley ever . <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even by the standards of a poorly described Spanish horror film) and some modifications are just curious. In one scene where the evil evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom in one of the bad quarters: "This is my imagination ... I do not understand ... show me again how this is ..." The girl's thigh is emerging from bed for no apparent reason except to cover a clip in a bad world, "Mahaha! All your altars belong to mine!" Speech. Despite the reason they go to the trouble I do not know because there are so many quick jumps around the place - even with the horrible generalization and print scan I've seen. <br /> <br /> The director was, according to one interview with the star, drunk for most of the shoot and the movie looks like it. It is an incoherent mess. He has become more coherent by including raucous shots of the Werewolf from a different film, The Mark of the Wolf Man (produced 4 years ago, featuring the same actor, but playing the role with more aggression, a different shirt and makeup). IS IS is a Spanish word for "Continuity" ?) And more stuffing for another actor in the movie Wolfman enjoy a long game. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly bad and almost randomly varied from the house of the full-fledged orchestra of music, to bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duo ever recorded. (When thinking about it, maybe it was not the duo, maybe it was solo, the piano part was too simple to be picked with one hand while the player was playing handball with the other.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the most The trance of puzzlement caused by the bad movies of the year so far for me. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Elona! This madness and perversion will turn on you!" How true. <br /> <br /> Favorite snapshot: lover, his girlfriend discovered a slaughter, threw the candle in a cartoon-like demonstration. Rank amateur out there.
