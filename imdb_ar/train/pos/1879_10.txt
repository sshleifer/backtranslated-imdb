I was so young that I did not remember when I first saw this film. But I saw him for the second time in about 7 years. My sister told me I had to see her. Now my whole family has saved it. We quote it at least once a day. I absolutely love this film. I still laugh after all this time. Sure, it's about a millionaire really drunk and that's irresponsible. The bottom line is that he still has humanity lost in others that we see in the film. And that he is willing to give up everything for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh. A lot of laughter. It's sweet and easy, and if you have an orange movie, it will really change your idea of ​​"funny." Watch it with a group of your friends or with your family, and promise you will never have anything you ever talk about with some Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for years to come. <br /> <br /> It's really hard, in my family, to find a movie that everyone loves. But this film, I feel, made us closer. I know they will do the same for you!
