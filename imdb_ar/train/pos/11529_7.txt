As a film about the biography, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco converted the notorious society divorce Leslie Carter into an international play star) certainly not in association with that other Warner biography of similar vintage , "Yankee Doodle Dandy" ("What is it?"), But "Lady" is a fun movie itself - and shares some common features with Cagney's classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady with Red Hair" walk around with the flavor of old business. (Among other things, both films are characterized by great internal dramas of the play as well as the inevitable scenes behind the scenes and in the offices of theater directors.) Also, in the film "Lady", as in the biography of Cohan, Familiar and beloved personal actors of that period, all doing first class work to remember him for. <br /> <br /> I need to add this, again like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady with Red Hair" Do not let the truth hinder the story of a good story? But, like "Dandy", Lady managed to manage glorious! - to express the essence of the character of its giant champion in business - greater than life. Everyone knows that Cagney has kept Cohan all the time in his wonderful portrayal of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few filmmakers realize that Claude Raines has provided a similar service to David Belasco in The Lady With Red Hair - Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures that charming character of the man of the show in all its glory. Rains gives a great performance, great, great, and amazingly real, like the man who once calls Broadway "The Wizard". In the film "The Lady With Red Hair", David Bellasco sees himself jumping into life as if he can not wait to shake things on the main station again. <br /> <br />
