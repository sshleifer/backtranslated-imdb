As far as I know the real man who plays the main actor saw his performance and said he was a wonderful photographer, and I agree with him. This is a wonderful movie about a boy / a very talented man with a special part of the body helping him. Oscar and BAFTA won, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day Lewis as Christie Brown for cerebral palsy that spends most of his life on the floor, wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot, but he can write with it, paint it out and carry things with it. Learn to talk later in the film, it's very good for someone like him. He also starred in the Oscar-winning Home Alone 2 and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fraker as Brown and BAFTA as Ray McAnally. She was nominated for Best Director Oscar Sheridan's Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Screenplay, Best Screenplay and Best Screenplay. Daniel Daye Lewis was ranked 85th in the 100 best movie stars and was ranked 20th in the Top 50 British Actor list.
