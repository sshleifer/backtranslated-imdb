I thought it was a wonderful movie for children aged 6-12 years. A little happy, but the story is raised again. It proves that adolescent dreams can really come true. I think it's a wonderful story for any child who feels his or her feelings or feels like trying to reconcile too many things. Very nice movie. Bravo.
