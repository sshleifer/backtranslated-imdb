After seven years of watching this terrible crap called Star Trek Voyager, I was very numb. The next general and the DS9 were good things bloody and destroyed Voyager TV Trek. This probably opened with the best pilot to show a trip. The crew was as good as the representatives were chosen for the portions. Scott Bacola was the first captain in deep space and his intangible way of doing things was a refreshing change to everything he knew before. The rest of the crew were loved in their roles and I think they entered a good season. When the show was prematurely canceled, I was genuinely disappointed. In A Mirror, we showed Darkly what the cast was able to do. Unfortunately, a film or television movie has never been seen. I have left the great story and the founding of the Union to speak it, including the beginning of hostilities with Klingons ..........
