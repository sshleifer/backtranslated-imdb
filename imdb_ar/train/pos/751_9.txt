This is one of the best Jodie Foster movies out there and is largely ignored due to poor public understanding of the general teenagers. She has wonderful performances, especially a fighting scene between Judy and her mother, played by Sally Kellerman disguised. The three girls who play with Judy's friends are fairly amateurish but I think it's worth watching.
