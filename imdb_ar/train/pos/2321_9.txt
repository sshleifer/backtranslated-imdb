Here's the love story I enjoy watching. More importantly, for two reasons. First, it focuses on young, very young people. People who are still teenagers and suffer from love for the first time, or at least believe they are as well. All of us have been there in our lives and "Man in the Moon" is a wonderful reflection of our memories, and perhaps adds some additional details and enhances them more than any of us have ever experienced. The second reason is that the triangle of love. I think that as a teenager, it is the most dramatic. The story is so well developed that you think the characters may be in love, or that they are so new in love that they strongly believe that after a tragedy or something, you will believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The Men in the Moon team is full of great talented names. Starring Sam Waterstone, a truly versatile actor who is capable of playing the role of tough lawyers, as well as strict, caring and wise parents as in this film. Also there are Tess Harper, Jason London, and a small young Reese Witherspoon. She looks at the talented young actress, who is 14 years old and believes that after nearly 10 years she will win an Oscar. All team members make great presentations and with convincing scenario dialogue, they are strengthened to become real people in real situations. As if all of this had already happened. This kind of film I want to see comes out more than once. Love story or not. I like to see films that make everything look real and not false or unreasonable in any way.
