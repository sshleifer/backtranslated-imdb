Being a fan of the giant monster, I think that "Yeti" was a must, especially after hearing a lot about it. Thanks to the good bootleg ol market, I managed to find the copy easily, and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that this click was actually, dare I say, decent. <br /> <br /> Respectable for what it is, in fact, flick the giant cheesy beast. It runs very quickly as the Yeti is found pretty immediately and we recognize the various characters. They consist of some dilapidated girls, some of them good, and a girl who is pretty much considered one of the most beautiful girls frankly in any fantastical science fiction film, by far. <br /> <br /> Yeti seems a long straight-haired man from the original Woodstock concert, which is really not bad for a man, especially after presenting the world with a kind of cage-like stuff. Godzilla is not - despite his rude awakening, he does not irritate (in fact rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but Kinda seems puzzled while trying to discover things. Yeti seems to understand English well (my English version was copied) and he knows who good and bad people are. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti doing what he does, which is pretty much the entire film, and with a low-budget fashion model, it seems to change its size greatly depending on the scene and there are even a bunch of "fake legs" Which stands there. <br /> <br /> Yes, special effects are not the greatest, but there are definitely some good effects here. The scene where the yachts are smashed in a warehouse is very well done. Elsewhere, the windows of the building are used as "steps of ladder" to climb from the top - smashing every window with its foot and bumping passengers into it - in one sequence that seems really much, "Bad". <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never breaks down like "APE" does. In fact, the only time you get so close to the real oddity is when the pretty girl becomes a naughty Ytti nipple and raises his eyebrow in a "baby yes" way. But even this is not so bad, and even Kinda laughs from the viewer. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly it does not get bored - the story is really good, and just watching this absolutely wonderful actress on screen will make any scenes of men happy. <br /> <br /> The word "Yeti" may not be in the upper layer of the giant beast inscriptions, but it is certainly better than the other 'King Kong' 76 cracks, such as "APE" and "Queen Kong" to a large extent.
