David Duchovney creates a role that he had to repeat a bit in California - troubled talent. It's a role that plays well. <br /> <br /> This excitement starts at a good speed and takes you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a wonderful villain and the playgrounds of Angelina Jolie. The story of a disgraceful doctor finds his way into a well-written criminal world. A combination of drug addiction and the desire for a sultry jolly cocktail cocktail. Unfortunately, in the end the story becomes a bit weaker and the relationships between the bad guys and the FBI are muddled and hasty as if it was only created to develop the final scene. But, aside, a movie worth watching.
