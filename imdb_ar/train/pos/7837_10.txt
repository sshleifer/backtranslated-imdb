After listening repeatedly to CD's, I knew I wanted this movie, and I got it for Christmas and was amazed. Mark Bolan had such charisma, and I can not describe it. I heard about him this way, but I did not understand what people were talking about until I was with these shots. It was incredible. Wembley's concerts are interspersed with surrealistic dramas such as nuns who serve themselves in a garden party where Mark Bolan performs some audio versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning song titles). George Clydon, the scant photographer of Magical Mystery Tour, plays a driver who jumps out of a car and eats a side view. Nothing I can say to describe it would spoil it, although I put a disclaimer on the spoilers in this review, so you'll just need to see it for yourselves.
