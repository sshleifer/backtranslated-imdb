Whoopi was the only reason I saw the Oscars that year. It's hilarious. Of course there was a big dangerous side to the show. She was wonderful not only because she was funny, but because she said some things that should be said in a public forum. White people should be reminded that the Hollywood Awards, Recruitment and Representation are not racially balanced. There should be no need for "black" prizes. White bread, millet candidates and judges need to bring their heads to the sun and see that great material is not limited to "white" managers, producers, actors, etc. It was the depth of bad taste that made the friendly promise of air. He had no work there. The fact of the matter is that this is the first Oscars presentation I've seen since The Color Purple appeared for awards. This abortion in the vote bothered me when I saw the offers until 2002. This does not distort the other bidders. Billy Crystal is a riot.
