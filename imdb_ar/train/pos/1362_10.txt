Myself and my 20 anonymous colleagues can not get enough of Parker Posey's fabulous CLASSIC game! I've tried renting this on a DVD, but I can not find it - very bad, because I'm sure the features will be "very special" !! :) We highly recommend the uber-cool comedy to get an appointment, or even just a comfortable home at night alone! It may also be a kind of film you watch with your cat, or even throw a party on it, like a "Party Girl" party, just like the one in the beloved and hospitable Parker Posey film. Oh, and be on the lookout for an amazing and attractive surprise ... Move aside, Sixth Sense, you've overtaken the movie Radder in a different way! Sorry, no crime, just call it as it is! Take it from the old flick stud, comedy just does not get better from "Party Girl" with Parker P! I feel it! Yours, Ronald Marie McDougall (also known as DJ Cyber ​​Rap)
