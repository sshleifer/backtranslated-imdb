* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is only the second installment of the show I gave 10 Perfect, the first is Rumble 1991. It was full of exciting games that were not memorable, but just fun. That is why I love it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and Debias, as well as Ludwig Borga against Marti Ganetti, were the only low points. They were good games, but DiBiase deserved the best in his final salary for each game. These days, such a match will have a larger run and a bigger peak for Razor's first major push. Gannetti, who recently left the Intercontinental title, may have had a better match with Borga. But I do not think anyone really cares. They only needed to push a borga on the TV for each show. <br /> <br /> The IRS and Kidd were great, as were Michaels and Perfect. I wish it was possible for Perfect to win, but Michaels is lying down. Notice how soon afterwards, WWF left not even having to work with the Razor. Bret Hart had two great fortunes with Dunk (note how to be the best match for all against Heat Man) and then Lawler. Their rivalry was classic. That is why the year of that year was a lack of thought. How often do you see two legends winning this year's runner-up in their late career? <br /> <br /> The Steiner-Celestial Match was one of the best games of the year. Who knew that objects could hold themselves against one of the best teams? <br /> <br /> Many say that the giant Andractor-Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I loved him. Remember that what made the WWF old (as in the case of pre WWE) is a wonderful mix of sports and a strange show. Is there a spirit that Akim did not like? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although there is no place close to the state of the year. They put Lex Luger well, but they made a wise decision to keep the Yokozuna belt. It has been the first heel since Superstar Graham holds the belt for more than two months. At present, heel heels heroes all the time. But since the beginning of WWWF during the WWF in the 1990s, if you missed, you missed the title of the heel. <br /> <br /> As an old school wrestler, this one and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
