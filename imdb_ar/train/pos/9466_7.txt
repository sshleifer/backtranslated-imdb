Dan, the father of three widowed girls, has his own advice and is likely to enter a syndicate. After his wife's death, it took him some time to raise his daughters. After not knowing any love story at some time, there is nothing to prepare for a meeting with Mary Sparkling, at a local bookstore in a small town in Rhode Island on the ocean, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his large family. After Mary was impressed at first sight, he had little more to show when the brilliant woman appeared in the family compound. After all, it's the history of Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the start that Dan and Mary have worked for each other, and although we feel what the outcome will be, we go to the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, author and scriptwriter alone, gave us two excellent novels, "What Gilber ate grapes," "Ocean in Iowa," and the delightful Indie, "The Piece of April," which he also produced. It is a coincidence that the films deal with families during the Thanksgiving reunion. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Pinochet, and Mr. Karel, in fact, continues to improve all the time and reminds us in many ways of Jack Lemmon, in his book for comedy and dangerous substances, What one might say about Ms. Pinochet, a smart actress and bright attendant in any film. She is right to do comedy, and Mary convinced us. The only sad observation is the waste of talent in the picture: John Mahoney, Dianne West, Norbert Liu Butts, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt Alison Bell, Amy Ryan, has nothing, it's just casual music, Dane Cook, who looks at my brother Mitch, is better off because he reads more lines than others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a delightful movie that satisfies everyone.
