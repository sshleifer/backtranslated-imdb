At first, this movie looks so bad that I almost fell into a coma the first time I saw it. It was a bad dream. Finally, I became addicted to this film, because it is slow like a dream, and wonderful natural collections, bathed in the light of the extraordinary fall and especially the musical result, which consists of progressive rock music and brilliant songs of absolute beauty For about 70 by actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (The Troubadour). You should notice the song about the hazelnut, the silver trout and the lady disappear in the air ..., which you hear in the middle of the film and near its end. There are some physical scenes at first, which allow us to appreciate the natural charm of Elizabeth Suzuki. If the film was made by some "gourmet" directors such as Bergman, Lars von Trier, or Jean-Luc Goddard, the critics would roll on the ground chanting. It was an astronomical masterpiece. I personally think this film is superior to the one million times of Fellini sh # Â¤ @ t! Certainly not for the buzz.
