This film is really real and random. It's really hard to find films like them in sets of movies now in Hollywood. I really enjoyed watching this movie. I bought a DVD on Tuesday this week and watched it 4 times. I love the Spanglish accent of Paz, it's really cute as it is. Her acting and Morgan are very funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My film may taste different from others but I must say I really love this film, and the best is the best! <br /> <br /> I learned something more about the life of this film (well, or at least the life of the USA) ... life is really random ... sometimes, meet someone, pass your life and be your friend and you Do not spend a lot of time with them, maybe just a little while but you enjoy it "while" with them, and then you will not meet them again, but the time you spend together is not really forgotten. Put these moments in your mind as memories that are grateful and nice ... <br /> <br /> This movie may be cheap at the price of its manufacture but its meaning is not cheap. I rarely learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.
