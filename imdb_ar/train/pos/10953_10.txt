I think this funny presentation screams! Does not suit all tastes, will not raise or underestimate people who do not get it. I'm sure they're great bright people working at different wavelengths. But if you want it, you really want it. Sarah plays a self-deprecating loser called "Sarah Silverman" who often finds herself in a Homerian dilemma (this is "Homerian" as in "Homerian Simpsonian"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her short annoyance on Saturday Night Live in the early 1990s. I loved her immediately and then went out of my way to inspect anything she did. <br /> <br /> This offer is very funny. So I always fast before watching it and wearing adult diapers. check it out!
