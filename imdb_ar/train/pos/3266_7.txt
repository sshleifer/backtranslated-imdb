Downey else must see! If you are a morbid fan like me, you have to see this movie! Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale student, plays the role of life that he left 26 years ago. Alex is the embodiment of Louis Jeffries, a meaningless lawyer happily married to Corinne (Sibel Sheppard). Louis was killed on his first anniversary when he hit a car. He is demanding to return, this time only in the body of Alex Finch. Robert Downey Jr. introduced a lot of confusion and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there is actually something like Incarnation. If so, how many times do you meet the same souls after life. I do not know the answer. But I know you need to watch this movie. It's a riot, and Downey seems very good at an evening. This film makes you believe in love, true love never dies. Just gets recycled.
