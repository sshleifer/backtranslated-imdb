Funny little movie. It's incredible, incredible, impossible. But it is funny that Mazuzi becomes fully engaged and dependent, so he is hypnotized by a girl he barely knows but who is able to get to his imagination. Of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals that you can access online. You should not believe ten percent of what you've been told there and never accept to tie your hands in one way or another to a person or something or an institution you do not know personally. Most of their "business" there in one way or another will fool you and attack you. But here the chapter deserves to be the victim of such gangs because it is not only naive, it is absurd. But then the film becomes funny because it ends up with a victim of his sluggish work upper hand and ends up playing the same game with the victim and winning. One thought is very certain. Security at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I think it's no better anywhere else in the world, and so far they've tightened all the rules and regulations. It's fun to be disciplined and systematically frustrated. Then they have the revenge of losing your baggage, the real plague in modern airports, and do not expect fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or can opener because they may be dangerous. I can see myself as she cuts my way across the side of the plane with a can of cans. Funny, right?
