Although the word megalmania is often used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is very harsh, you have to admit that the man knows how to make a show. At the American in Paris, designed to dance some prominent numbers, some of them disrupt the plot, but it is amazing to look at. (See the movie "Getting Out of the Routine Bed" by Jane Kelly (for beginners) <br /> <br /> Jane Kelly plays the role of GI in Paris, and stays there to paint, and soon became gigolo for a rich woman, but he really loves someone else! Hawari's story is sure, but the musical numbers save the show here! I really liked George Gottari's voice in this work. "Class to Heaven" and "Duo" with Le Gene on "Fabulous" is terrific. Oscar Levent and Lilly Caron can I take it or leave. All in all, a good movie, but not dynamite.
