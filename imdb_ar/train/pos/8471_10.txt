This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos, and I have seen them all. As usual Lori is the same magician as Mr Moton debonair. Lionel Atwell plays the role of curator of a delightful Zany museum, and the usual comical comfort is very funny here, and there are many suspects who notice them. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist does not have exactly the same shape as Thomas Beck, who is the second usual lead in these programmers, but it is appropriate. Stepin Fetchit on the plane, and while speaking in a typical way, his lines are funny, do not degrade his intelligence, which actually saves the day in a short time on the screen.
