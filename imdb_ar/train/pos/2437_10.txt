To say that this film is simply demonization of Catholics, and that the distortion of history is not true. That's not what it's like. <br /> <br /> What this film is commenting on is church abuse (although this can be a substitute for any strong body), the ways that this assault affects people and families and how many people simply choose it Allow and participate in abuse without thinking about themselves. The fact that the Catholic Church is in error is simply because of the nature of the real story underlying the film. It seems that describing this as propaganda against the Catholics is a waste of what the Catholic Church has done sometimes; its history is often not great, something that such films highlight and need to highlight. Yes, we must comment on the violations committed by other organizations, but this is not the subject of this film. <br /> <br /> It's an amazing film that made me cry and worth watching - "If we do not study the past, we have to repeat it"
