I really do not like both films partner. (Since both are "PG" and have words in them, I will never say myself, so I hate them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," which I barely saw for the first time this month Last, she became a fan of animated films, unlike Pixar. *** The spoilers forward *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", the dowry was born in the horse and eventually became the leader of his reputation. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance, and moves towards it. This action eventually leads to his capture, and many things. Throughout the film, we hear a novel. Through the thoughts of the soul, although the horses never speak. This is what makes the movie GO. The filmmakers restored the real horses to the sounds made by the horses; none of these sounds were man-made. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets Rain, the beautiful Persians, and Little Creek, an American native, owns Rain. Little Creek later edited Spirit and Rain, then returned home. <br /> <br /> I have never been a fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy soundtracks for this film in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, and you will not regret it. My points: 10/10
