Shintarô Katsu, famous for Zatôichi films, once again starred in this third and final film in Kenji Misumi (often known as Lone Wolf and Cub), directed by Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami. I was glad that they chose to stop at a trilogy (I'm looking at you, Lucas). ) <br /> <br /> My appreciation: B <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Merely Trailers for all three Hanzo the Razor movies <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima Unleashes Both Tits N, Mako Midori is the only one left
