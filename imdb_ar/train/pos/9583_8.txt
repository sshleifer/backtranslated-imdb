I waited a while to publish a review of this documentary because when I first saw it for more than 10 years, I wanted to think about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> I found from a documentary point of view that this is a good documentary. I did what I chose to do and showed me something I had no idea about and kept me interested in the world I discovered. I did not know anything about the cyclist and I discovered them and the "balls" were fantastic to me. These people were very talented in what they did and how they did it, in order to compete. The greedy people, the complainants (so I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat worn by the queen of clouds was not a coat for the man!), And jealousy, everything there as in every other competition. Like every other competition like that. I felt it was a point. <br /> <br /> You have the oldest drag queen talking about how to "compare" the balls with the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories - and even those who are looking to know that the future of balls will change more when they are ready To walk on the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were staying in the street two minutes before the ball started but they came to compete, and that was important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories from the "home" and "home mom" that made the best and brightest in the competition. It was fun. <br /> <br /> Now 10 years after watching this movie, I lived through the so-called Madonna Madness. I have noticed some of the familiar faces of this documentary that ended up with Madonna during the "Vogue" stage and rightly so. If not for those individuals, Madonna did not have a "vogue" stage, I know now. Credit must be granted when credit is due. It makes me wonder, if anyone else in mainstream America watches this documentary, they will know that they are not "dominant" as they think.
