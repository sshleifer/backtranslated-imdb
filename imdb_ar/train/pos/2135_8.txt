Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something, like dancing, can renew the flow of life in the human spirit. <br /> <br /> Dance is seen as an expression of existence and the birth of individuality. This is definitely the case with Aoki. At work, is a modest office of the inhabitants of his house, but put it on the dance floor and all his packed strength is released. Surprisingly, this version is reprehensible in Japan because of the strict match culture. At the beginning of the film, all characters feel ashamed or afraid of dancing. They will be disdainful, or perceived as perverts, to express their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen to see the awakening of human feelings and emotions. You will leave a smile on your face for several days.
