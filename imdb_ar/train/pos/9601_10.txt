Darius Goes West is a great documentary about Weems with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and his 11 friends taking him on a trip across the country to see if Pimp My Ride will throw his wheelchair. I recently watched this film at the Sun Screen Film Festival. I played twice throughout the festival. This film is an amazing story about the human soul, the spirit of Weem's friends. I do not often say this about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel excited to do something about the issue. In every festival where this film took part, this film won a prize of some kind. It is at the Tribeca Film Festival and will go to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie went to the Oscars. Is a snowball out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie, wherever it's on, go! Take as many people as possible and go! Heading to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, Florida. Darius of Georgia, so I expect Atlanta tickets will be sold quickly, if they are not already. Please, go to see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
