I find it very surprising that even after all these years, we are still talking about this film! It's clear that this was not a bad film, otherwise people will not be able to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film very much, and I still do it! I think this film is not for everyone, but it certainly did not touch the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> For those who think this movie is "overpriced" or "overpriced" ... well, we only have an audience that will move out of the movie to thank it for it! lol * As you can see, the authors of the Critics / Actors are not making a "big" or "HIT" movie with the general public that will move the film. People make the film a great success. With Titanic, everyone was in a state of terror. Let's face it, such a film has never been made before. At least not with the kind of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sink. This film is so subtle that even James Cameron drowned the actual ship in the film with REAL sinking on that fateful day in April 1912. Even silver pots for goodness correspond! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break, guys! Critics thought that this movie would sink a great time! When this movie actually appeared and people started to hear by WORD OF MOUTH (the best form of advertising, keep in mind) that this movie was good / decent / worth watching, then everyone started to flock to the theaters in great numbers to watch this movie ... not Once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I can not really say that this movie has been "exceeded" ... at least I do not like the reloaded MATRIX or that the "structure" is being "bypassed". Ha! Critics did not think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's huge budget for the films requested by this huge film. However, the money of the films took that budget 200 million and much more! <br /> <br /> I personally like this movie. However, this movie may not be for everyone. Do not say that this film absorbs only because of romance! This is the most sexually thing I have ever heard! Hate the movie just because it contains romance! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it ... The real star of the film was not Leo or Kate ... It was that giant ship! I think all the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet have done a good job. It's not the best job for you (I've seen a lot of work from both) but it was not the worst I've ever seen on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
