This film is a real masterpiece, it really is. It is rare to encounter such a hot, joyful, laughing, heartless, with a little drama to keep you on your toes. <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound, a true family movie, tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the Rockies in an attempt to find their owners, following changes and obstacles along the way. One of the truly amazing things about this film is its ability to give animals human characters - good vocal representation. Shadow is a wonderful figure, old, wise and courageous, and watching him as he tries to save Sassy in the river was a very moving moment. Opportunity - Who does not like a dog like Chans? The puppy must be more hurtful and loved on the big screen. The Sassy is very ingenious for a cat - she would put me in the stitches when she was mocking the keeper; "Here Kitty Kitty Kitty ... Not in your life, chubby." <br /> <br /> There was also a lot of good emotional scenes, such as Sassy passing through the waterfall (I was really scared), the shadow falling into the hole (almost crying) and then the wonderful ending, when the three pets returned home ... including the good old shadow! <br /> <br /> It is preferred for all times - anyone who does not like this movie should not love animals. Rent it or buy it now and it will leave you happy memories that last a lifetime.
