Domino is a wonderful movie. The young woman names Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley) who becomes a reward hunter because of boredom with her lifestyle. She joins up with two fellow fishermen (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez) and begins adventures. The script is good. Very on the ground and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I have with this film is that it focuses on the different things they do, rather than the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Even so, Kiera Knightley performs violently. It shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke continues his performance at the Oscars at City City with another strong performance. Edgar Ramirez really does nothing but speak Spanish every time and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives good support performance. Moenick was herself, although she surprised me in one particular scene. Lucy Liu has a wonderful chemistry with Knightley Keira in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> Although the best thing in the film is direction. Tony Scott's fast-paced style brings the film to life. The cinema is some of the best I've ever seen. Take a regular film and put on the acid. All blacks are blacker, eggs are brighter, and have a kind of green glow. Traffic scenes are exhilarating. <br /> <br /> In general: If you like Sin City & Man on Fire, Domino will appeal to you.
