He has written a collection of good books written well on how to control your senses and keep your spirit happy. The message in most of his books and this film, revolves around the fact that your thoughts are actually causing your problems and that the cause of your anger is hardly a reason in your opinion. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but barely do so. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important in life, keep your mind very open and listen to everyone's "hidden messages" (or instructions to beat life) contained in most parts of this movie if you are listening and watching . Watch it with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and benefit from it ... <br /> <br /> So, while watching, please pay attention: <br /> <br /> "Mind-like parachute , Does not work unless it is open!
