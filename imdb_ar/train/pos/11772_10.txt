In one of the most mysterious Bunny Bugs shorts on the hair, the famous leporid * works in a showcase for a multi-section store, when the owner of the Gildersleeve decides to book it. Of course, this proves to be almost impossible, because Bugs know what the store looks like better than Gildersleeve (and knows when clothes are worn). As always, they keep everything at the top speed, so you have to wonder how this caricature appeared when it first appeared! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how Lonnie Tunes looked in the 1940s before escorted by Termite Terrace guards. But do not get me wrong, the fees were good after the arrival of duplicate shapes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is great. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and grains. .
