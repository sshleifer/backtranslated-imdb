Photography Technicolor Pioneer (Oscar Special Achievement Award) is truly enchanting. Add an endless collection of charming costumes and romantic movie dreams like Marilyn Dietrich and Charles Boer, and you'll get a fairly delightful "picture". The blown representation left much to be desired. However, there was no breathtaking Technicolor films before this one (1936), and very few since then, which can lead this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. Cinema lovers who enjoyed the glorious color films of Robin Hood (1938), Jesse James (1939) and Gone With The Wind (1939) will not be disappointed in the wonderful work done here. "Garden God" will always be synonymous with brilliant cinema.
