How really friendly, charming and friendly is this humble old series. I was delighted to see the old Lugosi. It is friendly, disarming and energetic. It's a long lost craft document. (The best television series today can not compete with these pretty good old series.) CHANDU is deeply optimistic and deep. It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid. The stupid ones are those who do not get the terms on which these series work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple fun, friendliness and friendliness. <br /> <br /> Without giving up much? Chandu is a magician from the West who also goes by this Eastern name and loves him too and protects his niece from a range of killers. <br /> <br /> Chando performs his miraculous gifts in a somewhat secret and moderate manner. <br /> <br /> For her successful niece, Naji, she is kidnapped by an abbot: Vindhyan. In fact, the erotic poor girl is kidnapped in the coffin after being sent asleep with a flower; almost abducted from a boat. By a fake policeman. The Temple of Lemuria and its strange and creepy ceremonies resemble the pictures of KING KONG, a barbaric farce of RCC rituals and rites. <br /> <br /> Do you protect a girl bravely as Chandu do? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like a loaded, heartless young man, drunk, and that only contributed to his performance. He is the prototype means uncle drunk, mischievous, cunning and oblique. This may seem like a rather quirky Lugosi tribute? But Burton's biography of the Wood film left me with this impression of Lugosi and his alliance with him in a strong sympathy with the miserable actor. I enjoy the performance of the imaginary Logos. <br /> <br /> This series is unfairly serialized.
