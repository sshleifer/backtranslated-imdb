Champion Chuck Norris, a real hero of modern times, left the television "Walker, Rexas Ranger", looking forward to new steps for his artistic career. The main man is the second film for a future television series, with Norris in starring role, and with young actors such as Jennifer Tong or Judson Mills (one of the young guards of "Walker"). The old master teaches aspiring youth. It is one of the most powerful themes of the "man of the president". In this period of time, "The Line in the Sand" reached a global surprise for its terrorism in the United States, months before the tragic September 11. Eric Norris, the son of Chuck is the director. The movie is fun, good work, lots of battles and tournaments. Chuck Norris has many plans for the future. The bells of innocence, his next image, will be the next. <br /> <br />
