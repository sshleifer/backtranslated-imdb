The Tattooed Stranger was among the rare rare films presented by the BBC 2 during Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also "Live at Night" and "Brighton Strangler". <br /> <br /> In this, a man walking his dog in Central Park encounters a deserted car and discovers a dead woman inside. She was shot and then police tried to identify her using a tattoo only as a key guide. After being identified, the killer is discovered and photographed in a shootout at the end. <br /> <br /> Much of this film has been filmed in and around New York, so we can see some areas of the city that we do not usually see, especially the back streets. <br /> <br /> Most of the unknowns are in the forefront, with John Miles getting the upper bills. Excellent but somewhat ambiguous. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
