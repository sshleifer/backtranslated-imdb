Reed Hadley makes Don Diego much better than Zorro likes and bold, but this is next to the point because this series has the best theme song for any series ever - and the best version of the famous Stakecoach game in Yakima Canutt is a trick. There are a lot of good stunts, lots of work and lots of hair-raising ends, but if there's no other reason, you should watch this movie to see the stunt of the recession and then watch it slow. It's unbelievable, and despite the low budget of the play this season, Yak plays a better role in the game's performance here than he did in the much-celebrated "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart: This is the real deal!
