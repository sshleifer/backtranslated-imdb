The Rising Sun reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991) with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. It depicts Korean religious Christians in a regional Korean city, and the main personal experiences they interact with in the wake of a shocking personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a single mother who moves to Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son. Milyang has chosen because her late husband (who was killed in a car accident) was born there, and she feels she needs a fresh start in life in a new place. It does not interact well with the initiatives of local Christian fanatics, whose members are trying to persuade them to attend their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is basically non-religious and these people are as politely as you can. In fact, she ignores everyone in Milyang to begin with, but some continue to try to conquer her world, and often the consequences are fun. To say more is to give the film away, but it should be noted that the performance of women in leadership role (Jeon Do-yeon) is wonderful. Having read that she won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007, I was expecting her in a decent job. But Ms. Jeun is captivating and it is impossible to close your eyes when she is on the screen. The film is a kind of terrifying work by Evelyn Wook-Escobar, and shows how fate can feel as crazy as the inevitable stranger.
