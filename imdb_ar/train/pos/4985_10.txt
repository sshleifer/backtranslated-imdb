People do not seem to give Lehman enough credit when he deserves it. A few problems that are essential to understanding the Lensman experience have been overlooked. <br /> <br /> Year: Lensman (1984) was released with some of the most amazing effects I have ever seen. As someone who watches a lot of animation in the early 1980s, Lensman is unique in its use of what seems to be computer-generated images at a time when computers are too primitive. Kim's battle against the centuries of engineering pieces in the laser labyrinth can be considered an excellent example. Every time I watch it I have to repeat to myself that it was 1984 when it was produced. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most crazy vocal tracks that I've heard of, and this crazy hysterical win intersects every corner of the movie. Linsmann strongly borrowed two Western blunders and was able to deal fairly with the first mistake - the need to fill every second of silence in a movie with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is well tuned and stimulates scenes such as the motorcycle battle at the Thionette factory in Radilix, the idea of ​​the heroine fails because of the annoying value of Chris. It is interesting to note that fixed music discouraged my attempts to remove noise when I archived the lensman from analogue tape to digital format - because there was no second one of silence available for use as a reference point. <br /> Western influences: Helmut - looks like a "helmet" and has the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairburn - has the same hairstyle as a SW princess and her name seems suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairburn of Transformers. He plays the role of Han Solos by flying the ship and getting some technical expertise. Bozkirk - A clear improvement on Chopaka. The lens - a nice concrete version of the power that comes across the least chance of Christian preaching in the audience from the original SW. While the force relied on the belief more than the focus, the lens is a pure focus tool. Theoretically, anyone can use the lens. The lens is much more limited than force - being purely a defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The boskone alliance has interesting sponge ships. Looks like the storm only with a red outfit instead of white. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was nice if it was only developed. The galaxy's alliance is similar to the explosive stars (or whatever they call it - the 1960s series where they fought zylons). There was not enough ship to ship battles for me - it was much improved in the second Lensman movie. <br /> <br /> Finally note about Worzel. This character design is unique and very enjoyable characters and continues happily in the second film. <br /> <br />
