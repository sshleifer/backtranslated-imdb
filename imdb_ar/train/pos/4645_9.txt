This movie is very interesting I have seen it twice and it seems that Glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to want to achieve. For me, I can deal with the anger that the director clearly expresses against the group of companies that do not think about thinking, which is an attack in every media center we have, and the things we should not think of as culture because of media control in companies. The anger expressed by Glover through the "obscene" elements in the films is evident in her intense aggression and beauty in her poetic power. I'm glad I saw this movie and it is clear that Glover is back to something interesting with the second part which would be trilogy. she's OK! All is well. See also that. People who reject this film as "irrational" or "hummingbird" really miss the boat. These are smart movies. If you can see that with his live presentation that he used to do with his books, this is too much anger. The way you enter into his mind is really something. You will have experience!
