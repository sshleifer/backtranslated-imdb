This is a wonderful film, even if the premise is ridiculous. It was a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to grab roles in this type of film (another example is Joe vs. Volcano). That's what makes it a star, in part. Of course, Walter Matau also had that ability, and he had already put himself into this position, where Einstein made amusing and good faith. I suppose you can say that they are good at portraying beloved characters, although he is loved in different ways (young women beloved versus beloved).
