I remember Parker Bossi about "As the World Turns" before becoming the independent film queen. In this film, Posey shows her potential as a top actress. In this film with supporting actors including Omar Townsend as Mustafa, a Lebanese immigrant working as a falafel vendor on the street, looking to become a teacher. The supporting actors are represented by a wonderful actress who plays only her sister and her family, like Judy, a librarian who is old-fashioned and dedicated and menopause. Bossi Marie learns that she must grow up and mature. The loss of her desk clerk makes her realize how much she missed as a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village in New York City before she becomes a flower lover. This movie is very good for a freelancer and I have come to enjoy Parker Posey and Mary as well as other characters in other films.
