I think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so I just want to write about the impact of this film on me. <br /> <br /> This film was first seen in its 1987 edition. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see it, I think the RE project. We all went of course enthusiastic because we were on a school trip to the cinema! We did not know what we were about to try. To this day I still remember the feelings I aroused in myself and I remembered crying as much as most of my friends. I believe that in an age we had found it shocking and very angry right in our young way. I had a great influence on joining the anti-apartheid movement in the same year. <br /> <br /> I think so served this purpose in my case.
