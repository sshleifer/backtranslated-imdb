Just joking about something weight loss. Well, you may lose weight you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. He has the same sense of youth and innocence found in movies like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake Clozet illustrates the beauty of the simple things in life and the number of times it is overlooked. The film reminds us of the vision of the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror they see. Jake's Closet presents a unique humanitarian story in her sympathy that anyone with a childhood can relate to and love her. Watch it with friends. Watch it with their loved ones. Building fort - wine optional.
