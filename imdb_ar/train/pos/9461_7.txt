Steve Carell plays the role of starring as a person you can relate to (somewhat) in Dan's real-life film, a film I did not expect to like but ended up doing. Not that the film laughs loudly, it's just a big heart. We're all like Steve Karel, that's not what the office fans expect him to see, but you know what I liked about this film. <br /> <br /> Karel plays the role of Dan Burns, a widowed father of his daughters, who does not really love him. One weekend, he and his daughters travel down to see his family. While there, he goes to a bookshop and falls in front of a woman. When he returns to his home, he discovers that his brother Mitch (played by Danny Cook) returns to this woman (played by Juliette Pinochet). <br /> <br /> Dan found in real life, at times, a little incredible. Is the Burns family really a kind of person who is playing together, playing games together and doing a host of other family things? I would very much doubt that. I do not know any such family. Does this prevent me from giving her thumbs? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
