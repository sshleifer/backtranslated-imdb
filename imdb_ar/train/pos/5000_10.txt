Creature Comforts in America must have been released on a different network, or at least given the opportunity to get a whole series of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that the American masses seem to have a great deal of interest when it comes to humor that does not consist of abandoned words that do not see or that are preoccupied with scatological functions, some of these will appear far away. One of the major problems was that, no matter how wonderful, it was prepared for a rare audience that knew what to expect but was seen by an audience and meeting rooms that had no idea what they were watching. It is sad, but not unexpected. I wanted to watch at least three other seasons of this show even if it was produced for a direct DVD version. The materials and interactions between the creatures were rich in the sub-context and there were other conversations waiting to be under the surface. But thanks to "political reform," such talks are only in my mind.
