Since this budget was budgeted low, THE DAY TIME ENDED was able to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects. <br /> <br /> The story includes a family on the verge of transition to solar energy - working in an isolated house in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find him smashed - by motorcycle vandals, they believe. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange human figures, etc. Just recently, the light of a triple star burst caused the appearance of very unusual halos in the desert sky. Thus, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, find a face-to-face with strange alien powers and put them in a dash in time and space. <br /> <br /> Mixing the 2001 elements: The space of Odyssey and close to the third type, the end day, despite its obvious drawbacks and unequal representation, remains interesting because of the extraordinary special effects of David Allen's work. The desert environment is very suitable for the confrontations of this document; although the film can not be compared with Kubrick or Spielberg, the end time is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENUSUNTERS. Credits were given to John Baud Cardos, who made the movie Kingdom of the Kingdom in 1977 an interesting film for ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least to try - and on this basis, gave the time ending on day 7 out of 10.
