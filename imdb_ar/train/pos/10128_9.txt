Here is the first ever episode of Friends, where we learn about Control Frick Monica Gilar (Courtney Cox), newly divorced Ross Gilar (David Shemer), Hippy Vyobe Bovey (Lisa Codro), an unknown actor and a ladies' ("Jennifer Green"). The episode is better than most people give credit to it, like any other series A new comedy, the first episode is not always wonderful, the representation in this episode is not wonderful because the actors can not recognize their new characters and can not believe it right (Apart from Kudrow and Perry - who shine). <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Mann, his behavior was quite frightening because until later, he became more confident, but I think he is trying to be funny but he fails to The most. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer - Why does he say every word - he can not speak normally - but he became one of the funniest characters in the following seasons, but he does not trust me. Good as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the first season, Courtney Cox - looks famous for anorexia in this episode, they are worrying, they look quite different now, ), She is acting a little superficial, but everyone in this pilot 20 minutes! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I do these two together because their comic timing and the quality of their acting were wonderful, Lisa was one of her first roles and she's just as natural as Pheobe and Perry Perry just Matthew Perry playing himself basically! The quality of the episodes improves later, such as the groups, look dark and clumsy in this ring and make them look unfriendly, the representation is fine, and the characters gain confidence with each new scene and I am proud that this is the pilot! I hope to see friends reunited! Because they will always be there for us!
