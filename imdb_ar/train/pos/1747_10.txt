This was one of the best films I've seen this year. I have not seen any veil in the film, but it is still good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humor section, but I think this is a better film. It's actually a point. If you see the full range of T & A, you will be disappointed. Just a good movie If you do not have what you do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you'll find that this is a really good movie. I certainly think that the Everett and Roper review of this film is true. I mean, I do not really like Ebert in most of the movies, but this is the film I'll agree on. The film has a story well enough that it is actually reasonable that these kind of people are there. Certainly there is something to be said about how they treat the virginity in this film. Yes, sure, you will laugh when you discover, but this still indicates that you are waiting. Steve did a great job filming the person he did in this film, however, it is still funny.
