Symbolic use of objects, editing models, position characters in the scene ... All these things were used with this happy abandonment by Hitchcock, so you can really see what a fertile genius he has. The way a wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the battle progresses, and editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... While these may seem somewhat clear by today's standards, in the silent age they spoke volumes about the story without speaking the word . Even the title has at least four meanings I can see; a boxing ring, a wedding ring, a bracelet bought by a lover, and a triangle of love in the heart of the story.
