I have just finished watching this carefully designed, beautifully directed / directed film. I was hesitant about whether I would waste my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of amazing commercials. He convinced me to read the previous comments by giving her a chance. After all that may happen is that I might fall asleep during an advertisement to spray boring and lengthy mistakes. So why did you see him? This is mainly due to the fact that when the IMDB gives an average of 5.8 "average weights" of the WHO, it should be confirmed. <br /> <br /> I was quite happy to take the time to watch this movie, Smallpox Commercial and All. Helen Hunt continues to amaze her for taking on difficult roles to adapt to her basic character to suit every role. <br /> <br /> The beautiful picture I have made in this film has been executed by the tough but beautifully aware police officer. When a scene calls for quick verbal intercourse in a timely manner, it can stand in front of the soles of the feet with any actor. Yet she is adept at providing amounts of emotional response without uttering a word based solely on facial expressions and body language. Without commercials, which by design dictate the continuity of any good film, this would be a real nail. I gave it 9.0
