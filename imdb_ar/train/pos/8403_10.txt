I found it to be very intellectual and artistic in every way! I felt that the text was conveying all the things I felt physically and emotionally when I got home from work and saw it. This is a tribute to the cinema in its highest form and coordination. <br /> <br /> Sacred guacamole! How I wish those days come again. I tried to put a bubble window on the side of my car (Honda Civic 1984), but the vacuum cake trays did not cut it completely. Also in the civil context, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by a seafloor as brilliantly illustrated in the "truck". <br /> <br /> "Truck" is one of the most cross-sectional sections and can even be replaced if I see some scenes in private. <br /> <br /> I strongly expect Sam Grossman to be the author. <br /> <br /> Ratings john: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
