I watched this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Suzanna York's birthday and they were presenting this film as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on television ever since. I was interested in seeing this film because one of the stars is Jim Dale's very funny and talented, like sailors. I think Dell is now writing Harry Potter books on the cassette, but in any case it's very funny. This is a fast paced comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should move to its collection of films, and consider restoring this movie and releasing it to a DVD. Christopher Blamer is hilarious as Lord Fobington, Ian Panin is also quite humorous like Ramble the Seas. This is a noisy comedy, the kind of film that no one sees anymore, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars of ****
