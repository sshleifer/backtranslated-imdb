This was one of those movies that I might never have carried on the shelf, but one day it appeared on the IFC and I said - Eric Stools, William Forsythe ... Why not? If you change the channel, I'd really miss a treasure. <br /> <br /> The topic was frustrating - the young writer was paralyzed during his climb to the rehabilitation of accidents in the lower-class rehabilitation center. It was easy and tempting to make this manipulator with manipulated tears. But this does not happen because he was written by Neil Jimenez, after he himself was paralyzed. No Hollywood happiness here. All patients in the ward come from completely different backgrounds, but they share a sense of helplessness, and that they are at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a "single wolf", forced to rely awkwardly on his girlfriend Helen Hunt; Wesley Snipes is fine as a former ladies' man whose family collapses. But William Forsythe takes the cake as a strong man determined to pay someone for his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
