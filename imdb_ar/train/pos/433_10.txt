This is one of those rare films, it's a wonderful gift, attractive and twisted, and a real gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy or any holiday at all, because it reminds you to open yourself to a wider experience (yes, look for magic). I particularly liked Jose Lawrence, like Lotte Wilkins, but every major actor and supporter is flawless in this film. Moreover, if you are attracted to fashion and fashion, it has been done very well. I wish they had released it on DVD because I'm wearing my own version of the tape! <br /> <br /> Completely worth your time, just make sure the stability is to watch it, without any interruption.
