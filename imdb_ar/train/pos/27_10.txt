"The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) about Emilio Miragello is just the best example of giallo that I have ever seen, mixing all the ingredients required in one wicked soup already. First of all, it is of utmost importance to me, it contains a complex twisted plot making in the end quite logical, and the killer here does not completely come out of the left field in the end. The story that relates to a series of heinous murders (do you know how much title of the film, right?) Occurs in what seems to be an old prophecy about two sisters, a story involving one, the killer, wearing red-figure clothes with the crazy laugh of a woman , Is both scary and memorable. Every great Giallo requires some great young actresses, and here we have a great variety, headed by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bushit as one of the sisters, and in one of her previous roles, Sibyl Daning, as a barber at Barbara's fashion house. Another element necessary for a superior generation is an attractive, hummable degree, and provides Nikolai Bruno one for this film which must stay with you for several days. wounderful seen? Check again. The picture was shot in the city of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany. The picture is a real pleasure for the eye. Well, well, but what about those crimes? After all, is not that what gialli are all about? Well, I am pleased to inform you that most viewers must be completely satisfied with the various knives, shootings, disabilities and other carnage that this film brings out tastefully ... not to mention the craps and the terrible sequence of dreams, mice and bats (and lots of 'em, too!) Drugs, rape scene, mandatory red rattles, and in person Ugo Pagliai, a big naughty man for female viewers. As I said, Giallo is perfect. Best of all, this DVD is from the folks of No Shame, and you know what it means: wonderful printing and lots of plugins, to boot! Thanks guys!
