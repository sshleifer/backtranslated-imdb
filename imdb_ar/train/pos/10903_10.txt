This guy is nothing short of amazing. You really feel as if you are living his life with him during these tragic events, and crying with his family in the end. He was very passionate about his cause, not only for himself, but to ensure that those who survived would not survive this miserable pain. I watch this video every time I encounter a bad or "down" day, which always makes me see the great and brighter aspect of life, as Johnny did, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is that Johnny will not know soon, since I visited England twice during his life, and I was able to say that I met him. It's comfortable knowing that Johnny sits on a cloud, pain-free! Rest in peace, dear Johnny. you deserve it!
