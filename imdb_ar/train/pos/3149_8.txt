Not since the Simpsons made it for the first time, there was a comic that I did not want to stop in two minutes. Of course, it was said that the Simpsons killed the sitcom. This was not one. <br /> <br /> It was the first season as well, as teen characters were not as angry as they later became. So they went to school sometimes. In the following seasons a character went out. Eric, the sarcastic villain, Donna, his flat girlfriend, Kelso, the dim light, Hyde, the conspiracy plot and the anti-establishment villain, Fez, the deranged exchange student and finally Jackie, the spoiled rich spoiler. As for adult characters, my mother was Eric, the suburban mother, "Can you believe she's too hot," Eric's father, the straight arrow who was not, of course, such a hard ass as he seemed, and Dad Donna the idiot and her stupid blonde mom. Everyone is sincere in their personalities, but they welcome Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes Reid Foreman quite sympathetic without making us beat an unexpected attraction. <br /> <br /> Of course, Topher Grace is of course the main reason for this show is very good. She is a difficult figure because she does not allow the actor to indulge in overstatement, such as Ashton Kutcher's character Kelso. I enjoyed seeing the two people interacting because they were different. <br /> <br /> Hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because it's more realistic and we really need to see the orphan story for the thousandth time, although I'll say that the book has come to a great story in the last seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by the family voice artist from the Mela Cones family, is gay and has fingernails on a kind of blackboard voice, which really fits her character. The only sad part is that we did not see more scenes with her and Eric because they were hilarious together. I've wasted a lot of stories about the problems of her relationship, because we've already come to this subject in the form of Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will say that the selection of guest representatives has always been great. Some of the favorite things: corrupt Fes's girlfriend in the seasons, Pasteur Dan, the absolutely wonderful Leo played by Thomas Chung is just as awesome, and one of Fez's other dependable friends and a special appearance by the teenage witch, Sabrina the cocksucker. <br /> <br /> Then go out on Fox Channel, whatever.
