MULHOLLAND DRIVE has made me the final fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius, because he is not just a filmmaker. His stories and style have a mantra that crosses the screen. So the story of Strait was a surprise for me, as it is easy to follow the groups of sunny stories. Lynch still exists, and although this is far from the best, he should not be missed. The late Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
