Albuquerque is a movie that contains all the elements of the Western "A" category, except for one film: the story that really belongs to category "B" or "C". This was acceptable at the time of film making, when people were very happy to see the western in color, but at present it seems just too primitive. However, for people who enjoy the old West, it is fun, and the original color and sound are preserved well on the recently released DVD. Gabay Hayes is a good friend, and Shani's color means as always, Randolph Scott is more cheerful than usual. In a film called Albuquerque, you expect to see something that reminds you of the city, but the city displayed here can be anywhere.
