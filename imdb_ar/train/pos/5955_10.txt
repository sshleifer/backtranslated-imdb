As the maker of this "darkness", I admit that we have neglected 3 very important confessions in our final appropriations. The omissions were more than scenes that could not be corrected once they were committed, and the parties concerned - who saw the film - did not say at the time. On behalf of the excellent film crew and crew, I offer them an apology. It is clear that some of the criticism published here is harsh in light of the fact that credit is inadvertently due. Our production values ​​were very small and our "special effects" were really very special, but the plot was very strong and John McLeod's cinematography was wonderful. We hope that you, the reader, will enjoy "this darkness" and the efforts of those who worked with their heels for free. Thanks, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
