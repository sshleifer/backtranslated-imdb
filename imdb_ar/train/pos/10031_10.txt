Previously, I wrote that I love Titanic, I cried at the end (several times), and I'm a young man in his 60s. She also wondered why this wonderful, award-winning film, praised by many critics, was rated only 7.0 by imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the details of user ratings. While 29.0% of the total voted 10, while 10.7% gave it one rating. These 10.7% of these users irrational imdb, in fact, the overall rating dropped to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this unusual voting pattern (sudden rise in one rating, with a high rating of 10, only gradually decreasing, suddenly reversing the track and jumping at one level) on one thing Just: Hate Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've caught chat rooms enough to see the joking by young people (young, mostly), who hate left and right. They hate the man completely, and they will have no role in giving him any balance in Titanic. (To answer another user: I'm not talking about someone who does not really like the movie very much, and gave it 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has him, he has his / her taste, but no one can convince me that an imdb rating of 7.0 Only for "Titanic", which was pulled to this level with a large number of ridiculous labels 1, is a fair reflection on the overall animation.) <br /> <br /> Let me clarify my point by comparing the voting style of the imdb user "Titanic" to 5 randomly selected box office and "bombs" critical (there are many, but these 5 will prove my point). The Gate of Heaven (1980) was pulled out of the theaters quickly after the box office show was very bad, and the voter ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (Overall rating 6.1). Big Big Pee-wee (1988) received 4.3% 10 of the ratings and 9.9% of 1 ratings (overall rating 4.5). Cat People (1982) received 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 (overall rating 5.8). Blind Date (1987) earned 3.0% 10 of the ratings and 2.8% on 1 of the ratings (overall rating 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 (overall rating 5.2). What do all these movies do in common with "TITANIC"? All percentages for 1 ratings have less! Of "TITANIC", and none of these people have been nominated yet for a single award. Again, "Titanic" got 10.7% of the ratings! Compare this with the other five movies you just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Could there be any non-hateful explanation of Leo factor? <br /> <br />
