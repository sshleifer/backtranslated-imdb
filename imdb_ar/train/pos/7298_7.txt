This revolves around a crazy world that makes a half-pound penny - a man of the creature-type on an unknown island, then calls all his old business friends and academics to come and see his creature (a wicked laugh) but actually wants the sharks to kill them. ! Many of the bad CCI films, plot elements and children are stuck in tight T-shirts. <br /> <br /> All of these monster movies follow a similar formula, but this one is a bit of humor (I bet the people who made this tongue were firmly planted in the cheek), not to mention sexy babe. But let's mention these exciting children - many hot children, in tight shirts, sweating profusely. One in her clothes at first, and another in the end. Thanks, thank you, bad filmmakers! The plot is full of hideous things, a man drives his car in a jeep, hits it directly into a tree, and then shows that everyone flies from the island by helicopter. Yes, well, how do we think about it for a while; we will get back to you. The shark is hilarious - either an awful CGI or an equally comical man in a rubber suit. He gives the crazy world a good performance; he is evil, that is his motive, he does not apologize. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a stupid and fun movie, you have to do it.
