I appreciate photography, textures, colors, often, unlike one comment, lighting. What I lacked was a coherent story. I found that they are often disjointed, badly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Maybe cuts and translations did not help. I salute any movies that get out of the Hollywood mold, but that made me feel disappointed. Miss Jilin was luminous, the presentations were good, I just wanted more dialogue. If anyone wants to see another movie that has some rapprochement with this movie, try "Hideous Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
