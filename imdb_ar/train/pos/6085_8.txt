Critics are stupid. This movie is funny and intelligent. I love this movie very much. Why everyone hates this movie so much. I hope people like this movie more than others. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and do a lot of work to produce this film. I do not see you people making films like them. So people should just watch it and not comment on it. I like this movie. Nothing is wrong with everything. There were parts that were stupid but at least they did. Jerry Steller will love this because this film has a representation just like the show of queens. But that's even better. I can not believe this rating was rated too low.
