I like cinema, so what I'm about to admit is deeply embarrassing. I presented an opacity to "Che, Part 1 and 2" without watching the movie. Horrible I know. But I felt a trap made by ... Who? I do not really know, but there was a negative word from the mouth that spread like wildfire, no matter how smart I thought I was. But fortunately, I ran into an Argene film director, Martin Donovan, a man I loved and admired. When I told him that I would not see him because I knew that the film was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to punch Donovan on my face, a peace advocate! He took me aside and told me how much I loved the film and why. I went to see both parts immediately, and "Chi, Parts I and II" is the best film I saw in 2008. It is a purity to remind you of the work of some of the masters of the past. Respect for the public is something we are not used to anymore. I do not know if we ever. The installation, the movement, without concessions and the Benicio del Toro is just an exceptional thing. We can see his soul, we can see it already. Humanity is overwhelming. So, thank you, Martin Donovan again for my very honest education. Bravo del Toro, Bravo Soderberg and all who participated in this historic film. Do not commit the mistake that you were about to commit. Go see that, now, on the big screen
