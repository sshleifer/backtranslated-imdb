It's a tough film to classify "10 elements or less." Overall, I do not care about identifying species, but there is something about this film that makes you want to put it in a certain category, in order to convey, even with just one word, your feelings about it. I highly recommend anyone to this film, and if you really enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life, you'll want to do the same once you're done watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film and call it a beautiful and delightful name, recognizing that it is not perfect but does not do anything wrong. I do not want to appear to be against myself, but I think the writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what was going on around him when he finished writing this inspiring script. I'm sure he wants to achieve a product that has nothing to do with perfection: a product that will be as simple, attractive and uncompromising as its title. Well, he did. <br /> <br /> Silberling, the director of long, complex and dramatic films such as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", is standing with "10 Items or Less", which closes in just 70 minutes, a passion for his work as well as faith Which he has in it. Putting a Morgan Freeman in front of a woman in a grocery store and moving them to places where normal life would be exactly what Silberling proposes here. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you anymore because the apparent simplicity lies in a thought-provoking background that should not be underestimated. Because everyone here is exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters, who share an endless conversation in a car journey with stops that never end because life is life. Let me express how much praise Silberling has given to the situation by saying that, in less time (not only in the time of the film, but on the only day the film develops its events) and in a smaller place, this kind of relationship between Two characters born Sophia Coppola in the film "Lost In Translation." <br /> <br /> The film, which was appointed in Tokyo, also featured a representative and a woman, and they talked about the moments in which they lived their lives. It is in conversations where we feel the quality of "10 elements or less," and as in the film Coppola, the nature of each position is never lost and the pictures do not appear in all the music and there are no words imposed or included in the image to "buy time." <br /> <br /> On this side, Silberling collaborated with his director of photography Phedon Papamichael. The man who shot the beautiful scenery in the "sideways" and focused on all the feelings in "Patch Adams", we are delighted here with visual passages of real natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the final beauty of "10 Elements or Less" can be found in his team (by Avi Kaufman), in his heroics. They are the people who convey this feeling that I mentioned at the beginning and I can not tell; we feel their relationship and we can say that they enjoy and may be wearing things. Oscar-winning Morgan Freeman, who is also an executive producer of the film, simply confirms his position in the film industry, a place he deserves well: a quiet man, full of wisdom who can make you cry easily and he can make you laugh. And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said it was wonderful in the film "Spanglish")? Here they prove they are the real deal, and Hollywood is not small for her.
