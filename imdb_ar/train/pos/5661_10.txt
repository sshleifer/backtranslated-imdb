I see a lot of people who want to release AG on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From the border, no less!) While it's great to have this great presentation in the form of a boxed DVD, I'm annoyed by the fact that they added very little "add-ons" (suspense director from Sean Cassidy demo show) The order in which it was displayed on the TV. Missing episodes that were never shown before they run on the Sci Fi channel are in the package, but are dealt with on the final DVD. If you purchase a DVD set, get the actual order to watch and you'll be happier. (You'll need to switch the DVD in and out of the disc player to see it in order, but you'll be happy.) <br /> <br /> S
