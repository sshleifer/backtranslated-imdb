This film caught me in a stunning opening sequence that prompted me to fully reflect the perspective, so I was hooked when the title came. The theme of this film is that everyone is acting, trying to reinvent themselves, but not in a difficult way like the usual identity or suspects, but in the way we all try to make all vulgar life find ourselves more impressive. The sights in the chicken depots are spectacular. At one point, JÃ¼rgen (who owns the chicken farm) attended a laughter seminar, where he was the worst student. His annoyance of this allows you to see the depth of his desire to change himself. The film made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most common people I see every day. There is not much plot here. It is very easy to guess the secret of the old man, but the magic lies in trying to guess what all other characters will do when they discover it. This film is the same way I did it, though the characters can not be more different.
