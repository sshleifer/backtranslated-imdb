This is true at the top of my list of the most hysterical funny performances I have ever seen. I laughed hard, and I'm sure I missed half the jokes. This shows Eshard as a talented comedian. What I particularly like is that he never seems to "back off" the material for his audience. Its timing is flawless and routines are linked together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags. Thumb Road.
