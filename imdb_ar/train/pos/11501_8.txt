I hardly remember this show, but I remembered it was fantastic! My older brother reminded me of the show recently and saw an ad for the set of digital videos. Network, again screwed up in this pull out of the air, so they can put what's in place? Must have gone at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I sometimes think that network executives think they are "gods" in the entertainment world. But they make the mistake of guessing and miss a good place in the show from time to time. Let's say so, they have a lot more twists than "visits". This was one of the bad decisions that were made. Anyway, I have this for my group.
