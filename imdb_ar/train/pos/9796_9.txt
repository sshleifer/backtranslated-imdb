In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the successful production team to produce a feature film, originally set for Direct-To-Video, but hit the scene. It will become known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we had three additional feature films released from the boys in WB, Sub-Zero and Return of the Joker. Now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. <br /> <br /> This plot is fundamental and very much like Mask of the Phantasm: a new, self-styled woman who has begun to target the operations run by Gotham team boss Robert Thorne and AKA The Penguin. Now, Batman must try to uncover the mystery of Batwoman before crossing the line. <br /> <br /> Animation is the most elegant and futuristic style used in the Batman: The Animated Series for the fifth seasons (AKA) Batman's New Adventures). , It has been done very well, and is quite stylish like the animated film "Return of the Joker." There are also some uses for CGI, but they are simple compared to excessive abundance in Sub-Zero. The music was okay. Different and strange and similar to the degree of justice in the university, although the points in the result when the emergence of the theme of the old Batman will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the hearts of fans in the form of rodents. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does a wonderful job like Bruce Wayne and Batman. It is also wonderful to bring back old Batman graduates: The Animated Series; including Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock) and Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Battlegirl; hints of her romantic relationship with Bruce in Batman Beyond) , And Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred). <br /> <br /> The villains were also wonderful - especially since Robert Thorne, the old gangster of the original series, is showing for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> In general, although the standard of Mask of the Phantasm has not been reached 10 years ago, the MOTB carries the torch perfectly well for animated Batman movies. If you have a DVD and a fan, you'll love Chase Me for five minutes.
