The film began slowly, then gained momentum towards the center. However, the fact that the film lasted for two nights has broken this momentum at its peak. The second part became really interesting, but then gave way to a pathetic end. Play football in the yard? Really, could it be happier and more brutal? Now I hear plans for a similar film based on the 1970s. I would not make any great effort to listen to it if anything like the "60s".
