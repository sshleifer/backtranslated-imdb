If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it, Tigerland is the right movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The scenes of the perfect film look very real; the documentary resembles something that happened in real life but with drama. Hey boy, I tell you ... The real drama is actually a "killer" in one of the scenes (get the DVD listening to the commentary is not clear). I see this film as a group of desperate young people who are trying to escape the fate of the ill-fated, after watching Save Private Ryan I have my appreciation for the "ill-fated destiny" and they know exactly how men feel in the film. I see this film as a hybrid between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a "highly compressed" position in real life? Some men earn, some men cry, some men through fists, others use drugs, others are sleeping randomly with prostitutes without mercy to eliminate the meaning of love of their lives, while others are trying to drink the pain away, others jump from buildings or bridges, Others feel guilty and others feel a lot of suffering, which makes them too sick to collapse - physically. This film has all those desperate feelings entered into one ball. But no mistake in the film is dreary, and her realistic, and her very interesting, and light up Bose (personal Colin) funny and stunning all, moreover there are about 5 actresses in the film. . Will let you know what's in there for! With dialogue, sequence of war / action, images are ideal scenes along with the appropriate music; this film has everything, as I said, from top to bottom. I do not understand that Tiggerland is suffering from a huge lack of balance. The best thing about owning a movie is that it appears on the cover in the great bold writings "Best Film of the Year", which is no less. Keep the upcoming rare gems Hollywood, 10/10.
