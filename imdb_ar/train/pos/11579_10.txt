This film is a story of a masterpiece for a young woman during the war, and this really happens, not exactly like the film, but it is a wonderful story. I was impressed with this film, the acting and the story in which I loved this film because it is a real story. I feel like I was there. The university played by Marocca Dietmiers because he wants to end life here in this way. I recommend that everyone watch this film, especially the young ones and what they have learned from this film. You can compare this film with the film's orange or any real story that happened in World War II.
