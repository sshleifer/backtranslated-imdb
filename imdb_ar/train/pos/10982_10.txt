I found that Gray Garden is a film that controls, surprisingly intimate look <br /> <br /> Pretty much eccentric who basically have the right idea: Forget the community and live in an underdeveloped home heating and < br /> <br /> Huge hug of cats and raccoon animals, continuing their own interests instead. <br /> <br /> Dirty, all while chatting with the camera. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are the madness you chose Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> to document them. Looks like characters from Fellini <br /> <br />, just weird, if that makes sense. Old Eddie <br /> <br /> Completely bedraggled, a pile of leaves, clothes and dirty dishes <br /> <br /> Grow around. Little Eddie is more interesting. She walks around the house, always wearing a babushka-like headdress around her head, covering her hair perfectly. We do not see her hair throughout the film, nor do we get the hint <br /> <br /> She still has a lot. At the age of 58, she is still beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In Gray Gardens, we feel that both of these women have become much less alive than they were before. A little bit <br /> <br /> Eddie is probably more sad between the two. While her mother, in her former life <br /> <br />, got married, formed a family, lived in luxury, and even <br /> <br /> made some recordings (the scene where, in 77, she sings < Alongside the two-person "Tea for Two" award she made decades ago, Edie has left her promising career as a model to care for her sick mother. In 58, she still longs for <br /> <br /> to find her prince charming. If there is still something Little Eddie is a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of magic and fame, local bliss and romance <br /> <br />, which have yet to be realized. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film include the opening moments, where Little explains Eddie's dress to the camera, the "Tea for Two" series, <br /> <br /> Christmas Party , The climatic argument, the grocery store offer <br /> <br /> landscape, and the scene in the attic. The whole thing is incredible. <br /> <br /> Frank and unassuming. It has become more memorable <br /> <br /> because it is real. <br /> <br /> I suggest seeing Gray Gardens in a row with Kenneth <br /> <br /> Anger is a moment of short Boots. The cost of the DVD is Criterion $ 35.00, but worth every penny.
