I have not seen this 1958 film for too long and I enjoyed Kim Kim in the role of Jill Holyrood, who is an actual witch. He has a aunt named Queenie Holrode, who is also charming and Gillian is also a brother wizard nicknamed Jack Lemmon. When Gillian puts her eyes on Cheep Henderson, (James Stewart) who deals with a girl who marries; Gillian performs some magical mascots with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very carnal and falls in love with Gillian. The story tells that the real witch can not fall in love or cry or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided to do something about this situation. A wonderful movie to be shown over and over again and a wonderful classic movie of 1958.
