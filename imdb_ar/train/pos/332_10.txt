Although I have not seen this mini-series for more than 20 years, I still remember how the balance of personality, plot and adventure story has worked. The use of special effects has been restricted, making the story more poetic rather than literal. The two versions I saw were called (English and French) but the actors seem to speak their own language and not only Italian, so there is a problem with synchronization. Do not spoil the story. Among the cast Irene Papas as Penelope is the most famous of North America. Recommended for all Odysseus followers' ever coming back.
