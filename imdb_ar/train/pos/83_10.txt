A few years ago I added a comment on the IMDB on the television series "The Real McCoys". I said then and repeat now that it was a charming, funny and fun show, with great characteristics. <br /> <br /> Recently I saw on DVD four episodes of the old PLUS program The Reunion 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned here, it is strange that Lydia Reid (Hassi) and Michael Winkleman (Little Luke) have not been consulted, but may be traced via SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The reunion was well presented and gave us many unknown ideas at the show. One of the insider information we did not get was whether Cathy Nolan had regretted or not to give up the offer in an unpleasant dispute over the contract, leaving Luke "a widow" last year, which was not good. Nolan continued to make a comedy bomb called "Broadside", about Pacific nurses in World War II. Get it? Criticism? No, not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike the flimsy, bland, and flamboyant TRASH on TV now that undermines our values, "The Real McCoys" enjoyed decent values ​​and a good man. I thank all concerned, including the creator, Irving Pincus, for bringing me to my family. We have never missed her.
