An independent feature can now be considered as a work of art for the film and a video resume. Enter broken, firmly strengthened, twenty minutes short with elegance and enthusiasm to spare. But is it as good as a film, or is it only working as a trial piece? Ah, there are lies. <br /> <br /> Broken is the story of Bonnie Clayton who was kidnapped after waking up from a recurring nightmare one night by a "sadistic man and his colorful entourage" (quote from video box). While in detention, it becomes clear that her abductors know things about her so she did not know herself. As they interrogate her, a soldier in black clothes throws his way into their hideout in an attempt to save her. This was followed by chaos. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he is doing, or at least he is very good at forging it. Broken is not suffering from any lack of visual taste, which is particularly commendable given its budget and the inexperience of all involved. What it suffers is weak and a type of derivative writing. Think Long Kiss Goodnight with The Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the elements of the story are easily ignored because of the sweetness of the eye candy offered. Is this plot really important in twenty minutes short means showing the technical skills of its creators? No, not really. <br /> <br /> Although it would be unfair to overlook any negative aspects in the light of film budget and length. Broken is not a classic type. The biggest problem was that they would have worked better as a full-length feature. Final "twist" does not get enough time to build to be shocking. If the timer is allowed to slow down the feature burn as needed, the plot elements look less random, and the movie is more complete. Here is the knowledge that he will get the chance. <br /> <br /> The Dolby Digital 5.1 display for broken audio playback is still second to none in the indie world. I have never heard such an aggressive ocean of this small feature. The soundtrack inspired by Matrix is ​​very rich and deep, and shots of perforated shots, and even dialogue occurs in the surrounding influences. Among all that is presented on this disc, it is the sound that speaks of praise for the production of modern independent DVDs. Also includes an impressive Dolby 2.0 surround path, which is the default setting for the menu. <br /> <br /> Extensions are actually working hours to make features that can be found on this disk. There are a lot of additions, in fact, I find it unrealistic to list them all and describe them here, with the continued expectation of my readers. Whatever shortcomings this virtual disability may face, the DVD is unprecedented in its information resources. People who enjoy the film can learn everything you can know about its production, including everything from conceptual art to promotion. Those who have plans to produce an independent film on their own can learn everything they need to know of these features. <br /> <br /> Additional features are broken down into individual lists. These include: pre-production, production, post production, short walk, walk and crew. From a critical point of view, I found that some sections were too short. If it were edited in one option for each list, they would be less frustrating to navigate, since the indicator is default in the top selection with each return to the main section list. This is of course just a bump, but perhaps for future DVD releases, the filmmakers will go to my advice. <br /> <br /> Contains six audio comments and hours of interview footage and talented, despite the corresponding silence. The art of selling, and its true colors shine. <br /> <br /> The desire to share the secrets of making films with anyone who picks up this DVD is very generous. From the additions you've learned, which editing software and effects are most reliable and effective, what is the camera brand that creates the most professional look for the lowest price, even in places where you get cheap soft air weapons. Moreover, I have had many alternative options, if I find myself unable to locate any products used in that particular production. Wannabe filmmakers who do not want to read a book on this subject will succeed in watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> In general, I recorded a short actual number of up to 6 out of 10, but I wish there was an option for the length of the potential feature and effort, because I had recorded that 8 or 9 in these areas. I recommend a DVD disc for its features and a perfect example of what can only be done with US $ 8,000. Those who buy DVD can think of themselves as ghost producers for a bigger project. The more men are interested, the more money the long version gets.
