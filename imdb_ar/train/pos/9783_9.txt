How can you say that Peach, with his complex novel dealing with many issues, is a "small television idea" that is beyond my control. In addition, I can think of many films that have a "small television idea" in their plots. Your obvious hatred of the television industry ("Su Smith has failed to rise above her television background") is confusing. Especially since you are facing a "wonderful time" on TV. If we can all be talented like Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or soon) - AFI's award winning brides, Road from Coorain, etc. All are made for TV. Come to think about it, and what about those other "small television ideas" such as "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "Chapter", "Justice Scales", "Blue Murder" . I think Peaches is a good entertaining movie that made me interested, and most of my friends too, from start to finish. It's far from flawed, but I think it's among the best Australian films I've seen in the past two years. Who knows, with a few views (there's a lot to think about), there might be only with classics such as "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground". I really enjoyed this movie more than "hump" and "three dollars". I think these films had surreal, atmospheric and realistic moments and dealt with important contemporary issues, but for the absolute pleasure of Mr. and Mrs., I was an ordinary person, if not a boring one. When I go to a movie, I always realize the reaction of the audience to a film (through the reactions of the cinema and the conversations you hear in the lobby and the toilet). Some of the peach came shaking their heads, with some negative criticism, but it seems that many of them enjoyed this experience.
