I do not want to bear everyone repeating what has already been said, but this is one of the best serials ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone has a good sense of receiving it and starting the series again. The good news is that it's off on the DVD! I rushed to the store and picked up a copy and was pleased to say it was as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderful dark figure and creepy, and all the actors were very good. It is a shame that the network did not continue. Sean Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys this type and has not seen it should do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to watch when she was on television (20 years old), became very interested and would soon be a fan. You find them "very crooked" and enjoy the rings you saw. I can not wait to watch episodes that have not been streamed. <br /> <br /> This is a rock show !!!!
