This highly derivative film will be amusing to many who have not seen some mysterious anime movies. I enjoyed most of them, especially after the flat opening minutes in the museum (although the sequence of titles is very interesting and includes some of the best parts of the animation). James Garner as Commander and Leonard Nemoy in the role of King make great performances.
