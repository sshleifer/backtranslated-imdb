This film deserves to see the visual beauty and move to work on its own, but there is also an interesting cultural text on alienation. Women and performers (gathered in supporting roles for the opera singer) are judged to be hidden roles in China. This makes the unlikely connection between the elderly street performer and a girl more powerful as a triumph over the original culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered with this film was the tendency of soundtracks to swell. Passion became unnecessary because of the performance of actors. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfactory Summer Movement films.
