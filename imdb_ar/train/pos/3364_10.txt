I was very surprised to see a few people voted on this film, and I did not write anything about it, although my comments are quite similar to the comments already written. <br /> <br /> I loved many things about a movie. The wonderful work between Masterway and Lorraine. The way the film was told: Humanity and love slowly evolve between these two outsiders, and they are at the same time as the continuous and continuous inhuman march of the fascist radio announcer (who is a fellow of the Mastery section) and his followers "coming from the show." For me, this is a very good film about what a human should be. Some of you may argue that the anti-fascist "message" was conveyed very clearly, but for me this film was not destroyed in any way. My rating is 10/10.
