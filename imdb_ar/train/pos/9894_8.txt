"High Slaughter" is a fuss about a completely derisive nerd at Marty High School, who gets some time by some deceitful. The joke is fine, and ends up getting burned savagely. Only 10 of them, of course, are low and if Marty kills them one by one. British actress Caroline Monroe ("Maniac") leads the cast as a heroine (who dies anyway!). Thrill at all. Many of the horrific scenes of death to satisfy extreme freaks: the man's stomach explodes, another victim literally gets an acid bath, and a couple who has sex in the bed is subjected to electrocution, a man smashed by a tractor, one girl sinks, and a doctor gets an excessive needle in the eye. The killer wears a decent clown mask and is fairly creepy and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really cute. However, the final end of the dream is quite pathetic. "High slaughter" is a piece of garbage, but I enjoyed it. Only for very bad lovers.
