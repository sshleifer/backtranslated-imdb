The Anna Brengers cycle of Dana Andrews is one of the noirs films among the (largely) unknown jewelry of this kind. Because of their lack of paranoia, women's hatred or hysteria, they seemed out of place at the time, but clear images, complex play of identity, masculinity and representation, the ravaging of traditional psychology and the austere geometrical style seem remarkably modern today, . The obvious paradoxes of this film are so brutal and ironic that the happy ending is one of the harshest events in Hollywood history. Fantastic on the level of excitement, amusing, tense, and full of double-edged dialogue.
