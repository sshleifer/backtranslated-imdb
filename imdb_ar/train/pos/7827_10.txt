This film, quite simply, is wonderful. Good cinematography, wonderful acting and a very fascinating story. This is the story of Donald Woods, a South African citizen who was believed to be a liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Klein is quite convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on television a few years later, I recognized him from Klein's portrayal. Denzel Washington also plays brilliantly as he has always done. <br /> <br /> I urge you to watch this. It's long, but it deserves your patience because it tells an incredible story. Remember, people, this has already happened.
