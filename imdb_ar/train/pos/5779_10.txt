For starters, I did not even know about this offer a year ago or so because of the Internet. I have never seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this program. It's a pity, because this is easily the most original and most intelligent animation I've seen in years. <br /> <br /> I do not offer 10 points too much, but this one offer is really worth all 10 points. Although the first glance may seem like a typical cartoon, remember that this is not a children's show. When the whole story unfolds, you know that this is a true, profound story, a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on outside the spiritual animals, the ancient Indian thought that has been preserved for many years. This offer gives an original conversion that you can not often find in mobile shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also different. Sometimes, reproduction is somewhat like bold design, and at other times a more cartographic approach. I think David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, has animated part of the show (as he has done in the comic). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an exciting display of mind that shows that it takes different subjects like reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. Once you start watching, you're likely to see it to the end. It may be a simple fact that the show gets less material than comics, but that's not too troublesome. The only question remains, where is DVD ?!
