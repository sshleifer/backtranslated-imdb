I have seen this film on several different occasions. I find that one of the most things you can do is watch the reactions of different types of people who go to see it. <br /> <br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. Many old Japanese men and women go to this film because they think it will be a true Samurai film with good with much medieval Japanese fencing and dialogue. As soon as the two contestants begin to discuss horror films while insults are introduced almost indiscriminately through their sentences, the elderly emerge, usually repressed. <br /> <br /> Type 2: SNOBS movie. These people believe that just because the film is labeled "Independent", it will automatically be a burden of crap that is difficult to follow and may or may not be in English. Yet they see it anyway to just praise it later so people think they are smart and educated. They're really in a surprise when they see this movie. As soon as the blood begins to flow excessively from the sword-inspired battles of the evil animator or sword that mercilessly ties a dog to its arc during a telephone conversation, these people will be very frustrated and will come out. Few will only stay to see "how bad it will get" and then they will care about what the terrible movie was to their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: People expect to actually see a living or Matrix like special effects. Sorry, Martial Arts is very strong in the film, but director Yamasato does not really have a budget for this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Type 4: People without expectations. These are the people who really enjoy the film. Whether they've only heard about Blood of the Samurai, picked it up randomly, or stumbled upon the wrong stage in an olfactory fog, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the film for what it is: entertainment. This film was not made for enlightenment or to provoke deep spiritual thought, it was meant (if you borrowed a line of dialogue from the film) "kick some really backside." That's what he does. <br /> <br /> Based on the type of person you are in, you may or may not enjoy this movie; however, if you appreciate the movie and enjoy an increase in blood and acting, go to Watch this movie and make sure to bring Your friends.
