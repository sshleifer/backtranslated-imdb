This is one of the best to absolutely. It's very simple and sweet - definitely a romantic comedy flick chick. My favorite is when Albert Einstein says to Ed Walters, "Do you think about what I'm thinking?" Ed says, "Now what are the chances of that?" In my opinion, the film is great if you can see it again and again. And get as much fun with it, and with this, you can !! I really enjoyed Walter M's way. In Einstein's photography. I think all the characters are well matched and the story is flowing well. There are many times when I find myself smiling with the film and quote from my favorite lines as I watch them! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a good romantic comedy feeling every now and then!
