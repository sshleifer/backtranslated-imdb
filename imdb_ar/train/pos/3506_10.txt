Peter Sollett created a likable image of real people living in poverty on the Lower East Side of New York, or Louisa, as the locals know. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sollett is in the right place to examine this dysfunctional family, which is a different model from the various "inner cities" of the country. Mr. Solit highlights the positive in his story. These are basically good children, parents' children who left them and took their grandmother under her wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting his characters as losers, Mr. Solit shows a positive side to all of them. These children are not drugs, or they steal because they are poor. If this were a Hollywood story, we would have seen stereotypes instead of children struggling, but deep down, unbeaten. <br /> <br /> Victor Rusk, as Victor Vargas was, was inspired. It's normal. So is the July Mart. Show us her character a senseless girl will not be fooled or pushed to do anything you do not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, as an excellent grandmother. She expresses her frustration at not being able to direct her grandchildren to the things she believes in and which she cares about. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was an excellent picture thanks to Peter Sollett.
