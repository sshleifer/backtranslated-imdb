Wow ... I do not know what to say. I saw only seven pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. The man is very harmonious with the wide range of human feelings. This film was skillfully and beautifully done. Rare to find such a severe humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" as much as both light and dark. Certainly stick with you for a long time and give you a lot to think about. I have a deep love and love for movies like this. It is not usually for the "bad end", but for the truth embraces the feelings and the hard life and more than the abundant mumps everywhere. So I do not mind a bit of pain in the end. It is true in life that there are not always happy ends. Sometimes it is not just a happy ending you think it should be. Many people were able to live a happy life even though love and one life had lost. If you are someone who looks a bit deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
