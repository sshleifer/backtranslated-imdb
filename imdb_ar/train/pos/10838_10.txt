I agree with what he wrote "veinbreaker" regarding the feeling of "Ahhhh" you feel at the end of this film. I loved exactly the sites they chose to photograph, the songs were written and enjoyable well, especially the musical sounding path in which Hans Matheson sings. It's a trippy. Nagee was wonderful in his role, Nial was nailed to it, Pino was the typical drummer, and Ria kept it together. Bruce Robinson was wonderful. Helena was a beautiful friend. But I felt Juliette Aubrey's performance was fantastic. The viewer between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! The music behind the scene was completely played and was spot on! Too bad, many musicians have not checked this movie! I told all my friends the musicians. A wonderful quote for Jamie Neal's character: "It's supposed to be rock and roll, not the phantom of the opera A!"
