I like films that do not provide a typical "happy end", which is why I like this film. Alice Marano (the Danes) and her oldest friend Darlene (Bikensil) were arrested in Thailand on charges of drug trafficking after receiving an anonymous phone call to the Thai authorities. The film does a powerful job of keeping viewers guessing whether (or) the girls are involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as a shrewd lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns into his wonderful performance as his kind and wonderful wife, Yoon, who is also a lawyer. I hope the girls have been further abused in prison, as another commentator suggested, and I have heard that Thai prisons can be very brutal. However, where this movie takes me, its end. Alice herself is subject to a 96-year sentence so that Darlene can be pardoned, and we (viewers) realize that both are innocent. Any film defying my expectation of the end wins extra points with me, and this well-performing drama certainly deserves.
