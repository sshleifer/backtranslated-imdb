Sitting, writing? Nothing is the latest "What if?" Presented by Vincenzio Natali, starring David Hewlett and Andrew Miller as losers. One of them has problems in the relationship, got the canned from his job (because of problems in the relationship), and the police abroad to get him (because of his job and problems of relationship). The other man is a terrorist who refuses to leave his house and is met by an annoying girl's guide who calls her mother to claim she was harassed when he does not buy cookies from him. Oh yeah, the police are chasing him, too, after the mother of the scout girl summoned them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> What if I could make all this disappear? This is the complete premise behind "nothing". The two fools, the police, the scout girl, the cars, the lawn, the road, everything? Disappear. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept I thought. I also looked at the time of this happening, it has been 30 minutes in the film, I still have an hour in the film. Can actors make this work and keep us amusing for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, only 60 minutes takes a long time and there is obviously dead air in the places of the film. But the actors, who are lifelong friends with each other and director, have great ammunition with each other, so it was fun to watch the dialogue and improve the idiot around the two. There are many supernatural elements, but their response to these elements is what makes the film worth watching in the end.
