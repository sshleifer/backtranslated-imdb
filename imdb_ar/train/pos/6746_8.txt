This is a wonderful example of the story of the Noir film that is being treated very well - thanks to the excellent direction by Otto Premering as well as some great acting performances. Dana Andrews plays the role of a warm investigator who often uses his grip instead of his brains. Shortly after the start of the film, Andrews is rebuked for this and warned that if this continues, he will be out of force. Shortly afterwards, during an investigation into a crime attacked by a suspect, Andrews was forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does not use excessive force but the attacker is killed. Andrews feels terrified and assumes they will not believe him, so he tries to cover up death - although instead an innocent man is blamed for the crime. <br /> <br /> - including a plot involving villain Gary (Gary Merrill) and the love interest of Andrews (Jane Turney). All in all, this is one of the best examples of this type - through a wonderful dialog, great lighting and a simple yet very effective story. So Nawar was.
