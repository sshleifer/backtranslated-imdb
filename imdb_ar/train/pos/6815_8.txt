Elisha Cuthbert plays Sue A 14-year-old girl lost her mother and had trouble communicating with her father until one day she found a secret magical elevator in her basement, taking her back to the late 18th century. You meet two other kids who lost their father and face poverty ... <br /> <br /> I was clicking channels and I found that ... I read the summary and suddenly saw Elisha Cuthbert ... I thought okay .... I saw the movie .. I did not realize Elisha has made films before .... 'The Girl Next Door and 24' Elisha offers a satisfactory, slightly cheesy plot but the movie works .. It's amazing how this little girl went to become the hottest babe in Hollywood!
