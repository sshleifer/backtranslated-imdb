In the same tone as Americana Drums along the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a fictional but believable way. Henry Fonda made three consecutive films in this era with Ford and all three films about a specific time and place with a focus on the surrounding environment and cultural environment. In Mohawk, America leads the entire boom with Americans who defend themselves against Indians and other troops. Here, Ford shows us America in the 19th century. At a time when innovation and creativity are beginning to blossom and this nation has become truly great. Among all this, there was a tall young Illinois lawyer named Abby Lincoln, who portrayed his life as a lawyer and foresaw the greatness he would accomplish later. The essence of what is considered Lincoln's personality, though no one knows exactly what it was at that time. The supporting groups and crews also work together well and provide a unique balance in Ford's wonderful American dream and its many forms. This is not a film that is literally filmed, but symbolically, showing that Lincoln was already preparing for events in his life that would have created his legacy. So we get some scenes between him and Todd Todd. It's hard to see how they ended up together but that's not the topic. I think this is just a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His calm and direct demeanor was rare at that time and would be today. In fact, our government definitely needs more men like him.
