This is the best movie ever created, it's a master piece that brought my tears to my eyes. Never forget my experience watching it. I do not understand why people do not think as I do, the dinosaur turns into a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator. This should be released on a Superbit DVD so that I can enjoy it just as it should have enjoyed it when it was produced and photographed. Whoppi Goldberg is actually performing her life, collaborating with a harsh tough cop against her with a hot dinosaur, as her partner, and then ensuing hi-jinx to say the least. By the way I say the opposite of what is true this film is absolute garbage.
