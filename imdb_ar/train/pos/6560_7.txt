I think a large number of viewers have completely missed the fact that it is clearly a parody of Western films. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film - it's a clever tongue in the West's cheek. I do not think this film took itself seriously for a short time. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie more unique is the fact that it is centered around 4 beautiful beautiful women, two of them black, one Asian, and a Mexican / Spanish character. <br /> <br /> These are not Western women who are used - they are cruel - they can draw quickly and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult, so that the waiter shakes when whiskey is poured. <br /> <br /> The plot that drives this West-style story - in the context of "I've shot my brother - so I'm" will get you! "Only in this West, a woman's sister was shot and went out to take revenge on the gang that did it. <br /> <br /> So she goes and brings her old friends closer to the days of her bank robbery. <br /> <br /> Someone , Maria, is not really interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but is driven by the fact that gold and jewelry are hidden in the town they are heading to. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that do not make much sense, do not interfere too much, She wondered why she was there, so the film could use a little emphasis, but overall, it was a good film that failed to find an audience that knew what it was. <br /> <br /> The only hope is the format that the only lesbian in the film Wicked - of "heroines", and it is clear straight, and other sexual orientations are not disclosed at all. <br /> <br /> 7 Stars
