Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unfairly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night she was killed, I went out with a mysterious woman who refused to be named. After being charged with murder, the police visit all the places he was with, but people only remember him. He was sentenced to death and his secretary (Ella Raines) to find the killer herself because she loves him. <br /> <br /> This movie was made as a Universal B movie (see the cast - all characters of the actors) and one star - Franchise Toon - on the decline). The budget was small and the actors were not often known, but what happened was one of the best films of the 1940s. Directed by Curt Seudmak beautifully and with a remarkable text from an excellent book by William Ehrch (a pseudonym for Cornel Wollrich). It moves fast and looks great. There is a notorious congestion session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. Which comes from the screen with amazing sexual power (I'm surprised that censorship has not broken). <br /> <br /> There are only a few flaws that prevent this from perfect. The tone gives a terrible performance. It looks horrible and horrible. Also Curtis is cruel and nice as Henderson. You really wonder why Renz loves him - he's very passionate. But Raines is very good at leading. It's beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene when the killer after it does not ring true. It is hardly a physical threat, and its reactions appear to be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I still give this figure 9. Really wonderful movie - set aside.
