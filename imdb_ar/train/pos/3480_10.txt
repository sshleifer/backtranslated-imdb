This is the best comedy I have ever seen! But not everyone can understand this, you have to be Georgia to understand this amazing film! :) In general one of the best movies I have ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors that play a very good role but representing Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is in my opinion the best representation in supporting the role In the history of the movies :)) in this film which plays many Georgian stars such as ipolite xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, and Dodo Abashidze .... all stars in the Georgian cinema :) The great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course the film director Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommend this movie to everyone but remember that you should know the good Russian language to watch this Movie
