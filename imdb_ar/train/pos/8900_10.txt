This is an awesome classic monster flick of 50! I like the 1950s look in general like cars and music. Anyway, I like the way the point looks. I love when everyone is late at night terrifying horror in the theater and comes blobs and party crashes. Another thing I liked was that it happens in one night, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane are made, they see a meteor falling out of space. Inside the meteorite is the point. The more points a person consumes, the greater the volume. They try to convince the townspeople of the wild beast, but nobody believes them until later. Can anything stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
