... I mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen every movie created at all!), At least, obviously, among them, the lot I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The thumb rule with IMDb is that sometimes movies that are rated very high (for example, a Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap piece called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But the film, which is actually worth watching under the age of six, is rarely rated. This film, which is worth watching, is. Stigma. <br /> <br /> True, I give it 10 protests. The film is not perfect. The real rating must be 8 or 9. It has some affecting flaws (especially Belafonte), sometimes wandering the script. However, what we have here is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, the Czech Jean Kadar, who directs two of the greatest actors of all time, namely the beloved, beloved Zoe Mostel, the oldest Ida Kaminska in acting / poetic / moral tour . Husband Made in Paradise! It is true that this film, which has no minor flaws, is not inclined to the ordinary audience, but interested in watching an excellent film (while, once again, does not exceed criticism) for the incomparable director who gave us "The Shop on the Main Street" You should not miss this just because the ridiculous IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine." <br /> <br /> It is not.
