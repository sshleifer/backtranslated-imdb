It seems that the director does not like this film, but for me I think he is a bit tough on himself. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not perfect, but there are some aerial snapshots, and the story is good enough to keep you interested all the time. <br /> <br /> Filmed in a village that looks quite beautiful and adds to the atmosphere as well. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies filmed in England, give it away. <br /> <br /> I just saw a trailer for the latest director's film, "The Devil's Chair," which sounds so great. <br /> <br /> Movies for me, so any movie deserves attention from us, and this movie is not as bad as you think
