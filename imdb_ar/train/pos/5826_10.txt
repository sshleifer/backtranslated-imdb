I remember when I saw this short, I was laughing so much, as with so many other films I saw, there was no sound! Truly curly in the opera "singing" in this opera, I was surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you notice that this was filmed near the end of Curly's career, you can really tell him that he has changed, because he lost weight and was thinner, his voice deepened, his face lined with wrinkles, although he could still To withdraw, he seemed to be in his fifties. This is because he was suffering from many simple strokes before the big blow that ended his career. Be still able to pull it at the end! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the fact that Curly was really sick at this point, this is actually one of his best short films. I know I did not mind the fact that Kirli was really changing, because I still think he was fantastic! <br /> <br /> 10/10
