1936 was the heaviest year for Esther and Rogers. The second film of RKO that year is the third film in this collection? Mark Sandrich "Follow the Fleet". This time, Esther was not as painfully uncomfortable as Bec Becker, a sailor on vacation just at the waterfront cafe where Sherry Martin (Rogers) roamed in a sweet romantic atmosphere in everyone's ear. Yes, do you think so? It's hot for each other again. Just this time the sister of Chery the spinster, Kony (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole beautiful romance with a falling mate with a powerful Navy Beck, Billg Smith (Randolph Scott); a kind of use 'em up and toss' em out of guy, forcing Chery to reconsider In its opinion in all seafarers in general. Irving Berlin offers a myriad of events with its elegant classics, including "Let yourself go", "Put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's face music and dance." The latter is an inspirational comic play about suicide turns into another immediately known and intimate person for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> Transport on "Follow the Fleet" is the weakest boy. The gray scale is still well balanced, but now has a great look with almost no color variations as in previous titles. Cereals still exist. As well as antiques. Once you settle in a slightly thicker and more focused image quality at times, the overall impression becomes more acceptable than the movie of this old game. The sound is mono but very well balanced. The additions include feature, trailer and short theme play, but oddly? No sound comment. Given the importance of this film in the comprehensive law of Astaire / Rogers, this is an unusual oversight from Warner Home Video.
