This is a great movie. She has a captivating story, a terrible master character, good acting and a murderous representation. This occurs mostly in 2036, but it displays scenes that occur in the past years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very good and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier named Todd who has been trained since his birth to be killed, and like all the other soldiers did not live their normal lives. In the end, the army offers new, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott made me one of them. As a result they have no need for old soldiers like Todd. They test the new soldiers by making them fight some of the old soldiers, in the Battle of Russell infected and presumed dead. The army threw his body along with a few other people on the assumption that they all died, but what they did not realize was that Russell was alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a camp full of civilization on this planet where the army is lying. For a while living there but can not adapt to normal life. Rarely say a word which is sometimes very aggressive towards others. When they feel threatened, they send him to the desert. <br /> <br /> Russell's departure for the planet is also being attacked by the new soldiers. What the army has forgotten is to train the soldiers to be as smart as Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd would easily overtake them. The army began to realize this and would like to kill all their men but one. This one is Jason Scott and I finally see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell clearly appears in the foreground. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best motion movies I've ever seen and seen so much. This contains everything you can order in a movie with some great fonts. The writer also did not forget that Russell was never seen before because he even describes women as "Sir". There are no holes in this film, every minute has a goal and it is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> A one-man army is great for Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and enthusiasts / sci-fi.
