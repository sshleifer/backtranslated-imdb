I do not think such a film will be released today. It takes a long time to present the characters depth and the outline is not full of turns and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But what's this movie about? An interesting film that examines how families deal with grief. How, when we are left with the language of tremendous recovery and loss of mute, we rely on raw emotions instead. Sadness without reason and angry patience, so hated. Unfortunately, the leading figure (a small boy who accidentally shoots his brother and kills him) while filming, is given more than his fair share of it. Eventually he leaves and moves with his grandfather (Wilford Premly) who explains to him that it was an accident. I have the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but he needed to hear these words from his parents, and receive forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I liked about this film: no dialogue. There was a great emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. It allows you to slow down the movie frequency by watching actor feedback. Something we can not do much with movies today. <br /> <br />
