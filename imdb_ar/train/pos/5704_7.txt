To be fair, I was expecting car chases in this film. There was only one film, but apart from that, "Highway" was a great movie I was happy to have on a DVD. The really big names in the cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a psychologist and villain B-Movie with Billy Drago in Revelation-quoting Freeway Killer. But the rest of the cast generally made good performances. I particularly liked how Darlene Fuegel gave her personality, Sunny, a bit of courage. She could have been an impersonal victim, but she was completely rounded while she was searching for Drago with the help of prize hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Rosso, like a wood, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very good except for the background story given by his former officer. The threat tone is superbly maintained throughout the film and Joe's LA highway is the only one at night with the killer cruising his length in his evil gray sedan sedan which is an excellent way to build tension, and the music used to accentuate the film is appropriately formed. I do not know why there are some people who hate this movie. Different blows for different people, I suppose. But I thoroughly enjoyed the Highway and I can highly recommend it.
