This film is not obsessed, nor is it frustrating. Sadly, AIDS in the early 1990s was sad. But her true message is a message of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term love relationship. Their dedication to each other is evident immediately, and as the scourge of AIDS becomes the focal point of their lives, they see the real sadness and strength. <br /> <br /> When I was originally a Silverlake Life, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care and volunteered as a consultant at the HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me as if there was no other film about AIDS in his time, because Mark and Tom were real people living the same experiences I saw every day in real life. I knew from my own direct experience how watching AIDS feed on people who were pulsating and healthy young people in the past; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the movie was like watching my friends in real life deteriorate. She touched me in a way that still affects me, even after all these years.
