Warning: Does it contain spoilers? <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie and plan to do so, just stop reading here and take my words. You have to see this movie. I've seen it four times so far and I still have not thought about exactly what happened in the film. That's all I'm going to say because if you have not seen this movie, stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> If you're still reading, I'll ask you a few questions and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and tell us what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember English teachers for grade 11 well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise after his years and he always had this circular way to teach you things that you might not have been keen on. If we do not like Shakespeare, he turned the story into a modern love story with modern-day language to understand it. The classroom was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book in our spare time. It was his indelible way of describing something in our spongy minds. <br /> <br /> I start this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this wonderful man because he once gave us a mission that was firmly engraved in my mind, like the phone number of my best-lost friend for a long time, and it finally became logical after watching Matrix. Now if I did not know better, I thought that the Wachowski brothers were just a pseudonym for Mr. Cresack's teachers. But to give them the benefit of doubt, we will assume that it was not. But this was the first time that this task was more than inconceivable. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that he was real. Show me how you can say you're real. This makes the chapter emerge from all the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, to feeling touch to the sense of loss to the sense of hunger, was launched on our teacher to prove that we were real. After every scenario we have presented to him, he will return with one answer that will make us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What if it was just someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you dream of someone else? What a messy question. This was a question / scenario we were asked about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid advancement of computers. How could it appear at that time? But if you look at today's technology, ask yourself now, what you're part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful but surreal film this year, Mulholland Drive from David Lynch explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film you can hope for. In short, this one movie would literally (if you allow it) to blow your mind out of all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Running Tom Cruise David Aams, a hot young man, bar, is full of himself as publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father, and although he has the talent and savvy at work, his seven dwarfs rulers think he is a rich Dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he has done nothing worth the peak of success that each of them thinks they should go to. <br /> <br /> Early in the film, we met one of David's great games named Julie Gianni, played by Cameron Diaz ideally but maliciously. David and Julie play a good game, where they both claim to exist only to use each other and not to be less interested in a committed monogamous relationship. This is the kind of relationship that suits the other fits of David that he had in his sexual life in his life. Although both are talking about a good game, we can say that there is only one person who tells the truth. <br /> <br /> After that, we meet with Brian Shelby, who played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good friend Jason Lee. Bryan writes a book that will be published by David, but they are also good friends. This is something David did not have little of his life, and you can feel real care for each other early in the film. Brian has a famous line and one is that he kept telling David over and over again. This is "sweet is not sweet without bitter." He continues to tell him that one day he will find his true love, not just a part-time lover's case he seems to be committing with all the crews who live in his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> At David's huge birthday party (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his history, Sofia Sorano, who of course played with Penelope Cruz with the best performance of the year by actress . This is a bash by just calling and initially David and Sophia seem intrigued with each other. On David's typical way, despite having his best friend there, he begins to flirt with Sophia. To complicate things, Julie appears uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sophia, but they just talk and draw caricatures of each other. There is no upset about the turn. The next day, while David leaves Sophia's apartment, he is greeted by Jolie, who offers him a trip and from there ....... well, I think we all saw commercials. <br /> <br /> This is all I will really say about the plot, because it is from here that the film bothers us about what is reality and what is unclear. We have identified a character played by Kurt Russell and a few shady characters who all play a part in this maze like fog. There is a subtext of death and treatment-like therapies can be able or not able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the interesting possibilities offered by our film, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> Like many movies that thrive today, this movie has a secret. Maybe Sixth Sense has started this madness, but look back and maybe you can thank Angel Heart for starting this madness. No matter how they grew up, Vanilla Sky has one of the hidden intruders. What makes this person so enjoyable is that the film provides you with many clear evidence along the way, but not enough to give you a terrible solution to the truth and lies that you have just presented. I have watched this film four times and each time it was because I want to see if there is anything more I can pick up, something more I can understand. Being able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is rare in the film. All of the ersatz so-called "best picture of the year" was good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. It was a beautiful mind that was intriguing but flat, and the Royal Tenenbaums were fun but uneven. Vanilla Sky is rare because it is a film that makes you yearn for more but ensures your satisfaction because the film and those who made it care about it. I know this movie has mixed reviews but I just think that those who do not like it do not quite understand it. <br /> <br /> This is what filmmaking is supposed to be in. That's what a movie should do for you. It is supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year were just empty spaces. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 best movies per year. I like to see this gets the best picture and I love to see Cruz for Best Actress, Diaz for Best Supporting, and Cruise for Best Actor, and Jason Mewes should be the best supporting actor. Cameron Crow must be there as well. None of this may come, that's a shame. This one movie should not be missed. <br /> <br /> In a final note, I'm sure Mr. Cresack is interested in this film and maybe this is the only film that might answer his question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just weaving from someone's imagination? Were we artificially planted to entertain someone else? This film generates more questions than answers. I'm sure he's fine with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
