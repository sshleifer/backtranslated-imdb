Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league player who made one of the most spectacular returns in the history of sports, ending his retirement for almost 10 years and playing for the first time in the US league in 1999 at age 35. < br /> <br /> The film opens with a brief summary of Morris' childhood, which included a series of sites - his father was a military man. Even when his family settled forever in the football that was going to Texas, Maurice's passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> After that, the childhood sector jumps forward after 23 years on Morris (played by Dennis Quid), now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life the Reagan County High School In Big Lake, Texas) is said to have tried a career as a baseball player but did not succeed. <br /> <br /> Maurice's team is fighting and lecturing them about giving up their dreams. They turned the table over to him and told him that he had to go through an experience with a major league team. Many times when they are focused on practice, they are amazed at the speed with which they are cast. Morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players. If they win the zone, he will try to get out of a major league. <br /> <br /> Big Lake does not win the region and clings to the end of the deal. , Morris attends the experience of Tampa Bay Bay Rays Ray. Ostensibly, throwing 98 miles per hour - faster than throwing him during his high school career in the league and a remarkable speed even for Jawad Al Douri. After another experience with the team, Morris is offered a contract with Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This leaves him with a difficult decision - to stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his dream in the main league by going through the simple league milling to earn little money and spend months away from home. The decision is more painful than it was during his first assignment in the minor league because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Maurice signed with Devil Rays, starting from AA and progressing quickly to AAA, one level below the Major League Baseball. But by the end of the season, his chances of getting "summoned" are slim. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I like this movie. There are lots of great shows and lovely characters and it is easy to find yourself on your way to Morris. Also, the film does a great job of portraying professional baseball at the main and secondary levels of the league. Most importantly, it teaches the timeless message of sticking to your dreams even when they seem far from attainable and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> However, the movie has some drawbacks. While it is generally accurate, it exaggerates and makes some things. See http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. Also, except for one scene where he prays with his players, the film completely ignores the faith of Christian Morris. But given Disney's leftist enthusiasm, this is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Much of the exaggeration / slander is supposed to have been made to make the story more dramatic. However, the 20-minute documentary about Morris, which is included on the DVD, contains some information that makes his story more dramatic but excluded from the film. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth until his family settled in Texas forever when he was 12 years old, Morris reassigned his position 14 times. He finished his high school career after four operations in which he lost half his muscles in his left shoulder (a monument), leaving him 98 miles per hour unexplained. <br /> <br /> In order to appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it is good not to see "The Rookie", but to watch the documentary DVD, check the link above to inaccurate film, and perhaps read the biography of Morris, which carries Also the title "The Rookie". I have not read the book but I hope to be in one of these days. <br /> <br /> In general, the "rookie" is a very good portrayal of a miracle story and a powerful testimony to the power of dreams and the triumph of the average man. 10/08
