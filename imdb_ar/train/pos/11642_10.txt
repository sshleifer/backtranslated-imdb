"Intervention" helped me in my addiction and recovery. I am middle-aged married and father of two children. I am very functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I feel the pain of a past that I use to add to the things I slowly recover from. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me improve my life and my relationship with my family. <br /> <br /> The show, unlike many others, disappears in the past from the addict and reveals events that may be causing their addiction. Many of us suffer because it is very frightening to go back and work, as Alice Miller says, "to discover the truth and accept it in the individual and unique history of our childhood." The offer deserves a lot of credit for starting this process at least. This drilling is painful and difficult, but it's worth it. It seems that covering a lot of addiction - fictional and non-fiction - ignores the core issues. It is often assumed that the addict one day started shooting or whatever for pleasure, pleasure or self-interest, and now they can not stop. Not so: addiction is about killing pain. I can relate to the various events and difficulties in people's lives. There are common themes, and the exceptions are amazing. Many addicts suffered abuse. Some children respond badly to divorce. For those who believe that addiction is an exaggerated reaction to hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some children deal with divorce well, others, such as Christie in the show, "fall apart in a pile on the ground" and change their lives forever because of the event. <br /> <br /> For example, a counselor last night said that beautiful young Andrea seeking validation of men. She diverts money for a 75-year-old neighbor and allows the man to abuse her. It seems familiar to anyone? The series is full of information that we can use to understand our motives and make adjustments to our lives. People with smaller problems often suffer from us. As they say, until the time that stops is correct twice a day, but the slow clock can remain undiscovered for a long time, making your life miserable. <br /> <br /> To producers: Thank you for making an offer, for digging in the past, to continue. The graphics, formatting and music are great. <br /> <br /> Addicts: Thank you for your courage to participate. Whether you've helped yourself or not, you've helped me.
