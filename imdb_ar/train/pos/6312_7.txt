Before George Clooney directed the Rockwell Medal in his first film, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, they starred together. George Clooney also participated in this film as a producer, along with Stephen Soderberg, demonstrating that they truly believed in this project. This is probably a great and enjoyable project, and is in line with film re-productions such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job," but somehow this film has only succeeded in half, or at least as good as it could have been is being. <br /> <br /> All his characters are played by well-known actors, but it's a shame that characters do not really give enough space to develop them. Although they can turn into fun and fun characters, they are now just moderately amusing characters because most of the most unusual sequences are in the film. The fact that it is being played does not change much in this matter, although it prevents its characters from becoming completely boring or perhaps annoying or something like that at all. <br /> <br /> It is of course because of writing that does not use characters to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than the performance of this film. The film relies heavily on his simple story and the way he predicts storytelling. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is still very interesting to watch probably because of the same simplicity. It's a harmless little movie, so you should not worry too much about the story. In this regard, "Welcome to Collinwood" still works well and serves its purpose very simply. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you'll never regret watching, but it's also a movie you can easily do without ever seeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
