Among the most comedies made by Carrie Grant is Mr. Blandings, who builds his dream home. Although judging by its size, this dwelling would be a palace of dreams today. Carrie was still living a good life in advertising even though he had a demon time trying to put up a pork logo with the brand name Wham. <br /> <br /> What made this film so popular was the housing shortage in the post World War II years. Veterans returning from the war were demanding their entitlements under the International Court of Justice's Bill of Rights, which included real estate loans. The problem was there were literally not enough homes to meet demand. Soon, Eric Hodgens' book and the highly popular film were approved, and President Truman signed the Housing Act in Taft-Elinder-Wagner, which put the government for the first time in the construction of houses. <br /> <br /> I had uncle and uncle who were both building their own house, where they moved in the early fifties. Like Carrie Grant and Merna Lowe they had two daughters and were looking forward to leaving the inner city of Rochester. Their place was not as big as an 18-room house in Connecticut, still living there the rest of their lives in the way Carrie and Mirna probably lived. <br /> <br /> Of course the price was prohibitively expensive to keep adding up and up, and threatening to send Carrie to the cleaners. Carey and Mirna have both Milvin and Douglas to advise, usually too late. The truth is that he is said to be kind to Mirna and Carrie knows that. <br /> <br /> Mirna Loy's role is just an extension of Charles' light. If you can imagine Charles moving to the country and William Powell suffering from the headaches of Carrie Grant, the film will still work well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blindings builds his dream house still works well because comedy positions are universal. This review is dedicated to my Aunt Walter and Aunt Kate who have lived in the house of their dreams together for more than 40 years.
