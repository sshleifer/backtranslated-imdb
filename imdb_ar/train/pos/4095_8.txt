Now my friends, movies like "La BÃªte" (also known as "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be performed in the old continent :), in this film, we see everything: dirty sex horses, , Non-sensational dialogues, etc., etc., etc ... In serious terms now, from symbolic, that men can sometimes be better, wild and brutal, and shows us Horan Borovzyk (director) loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It's an amazing cinematic experience, filled with exotic scenes. For all European horrific lovers of exploitation, I recommend this movie. If you like this, recommend it: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "States Alterated States".
