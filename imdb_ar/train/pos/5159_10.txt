This is definitely one of my favorite episodes all the time on Trip Trek. There's a lot going on in this film that makes it great. First, men embark on a strange planet exploding. They meet dude kind librarian (played very well). Kirk can then reconstruct himself into something very much like 16th century soil. Both McCoy and Spock try to follow him, but instead freeze to death on the frozen version of the strange world, 100,000 years ago. Kirk was able to confine himself and accused him of magic while Spock enjoyed a time with a girl cave thrilled by this terrible man frozen by some of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Spock decides to be happy anywhere and gives McCoy a royal confirmation when the document suggests they need to look for a way out. Anyway, they all finally run away, leaving behind the poor girl. It takes a lot of persuasion before Spock finally gives in and leaves. You can literally taste sadness at the end. Leaving a lonely cavegirl in her frozen wasteland seemed harsh and truly touching. Spock must be outside his foul mind to leave behind his greatest hope in love and man. Although, in the neighborhood is not so nice! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you'll get a lot of fuss in return for this episode .... Love story, Salem's charming experiences, Spock as a human being, Desperate from staying in total isolation ... Abandoned, three completely different situations on The alien planet. It's amazing that they managed to jam all of this in a one-fifty-minute film. This is a classic, do not miss it .... I want it on DVD fer shure vulcans !!!!!!
