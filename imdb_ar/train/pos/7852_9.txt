Curiosity Ladislas Starewicz with insects and film mixes in a short film about the triangle of love between Mr. Beetle, a grasshopper technician, and Ms. Beetle. The fairly simple story of a pair of adultery beetles looking for stimulation outside their marriage is like a short CV or CV. Stewewicz's development in the story is the use of stuffed beetles with wires that work on calming the legs in a frame frame. The story was taken while Mr. Beetle was inadvertently spotted on the camera with a dragonfly from a local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic boyfriend, he chases her in anger, but eventually forgives her and goes out to watch a movie. However, Ms. Beetle quickly learns of her husband's betrayal because the film they watch is the jealous grasshopper shots of Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly together. Ms. Beetle shakes Mr. Beetle with her umbrella, and Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen, each ending with a jail sentence after the projector has shot down. Insects are placed in humane places such as a home or nightclub, and human characteristics are given of jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. Insect figures carry bags, boxes of cars, even shoes, but they take off their antennas and open and close the lower jaw as real insects do. The story of the story does not wear itself, even after multiple scenes, but as far as it is prevalent, the film moves slowly. The procedure occurs with complex details, but fast-paced fast-paced imaging is lost in the process. Despite its pace, the film is a great example of an early Starewicz doll and is highly recommended.
