Classic real. Beautiful photographed and acted. Reveals the Paris region full of life and filled with comedy and tragedy. Although the "Hotel du Nord" area and the hotel itself are still there, they are not gay (in the original sense) and as enjoyable as before the film makes one year of the past that was sorely missed.
