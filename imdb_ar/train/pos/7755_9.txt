"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible film, strangely odd, because director Cirque was the only one who could do it. The film is submerged in a bucket filled with Freudian symbols, strange melodramas and colorful contrasts. The relationship between financial success and moral decay is the main theme of the film. The circus appears to indicate that impotence is a side effect of capitalism. However, it is best to see the film as a key example of what Sirk can do using kitchy materials. The color palette is particularly impressive. The acting in the film is very cool. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are extremely charming and give the film a halo of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), who managed to keep the movie at the boiling point. Glorified to the Frank Skiner class, the superb Russell Metty camera (each shot is a masterpiece in itself), and the production design section. Also, the tune of the title is beauty. It is an unforgettable film.
