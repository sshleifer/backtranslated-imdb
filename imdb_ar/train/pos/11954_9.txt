Fantastic movie, enough laughter and movement for any audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person posted on this film took upon himself to summon Woody Allen and incest and not comment on the film, here I am. /> <br /> The film follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, who follow a hint given to them by a recently deceased English reporter. Their search takes them to the killer's house, and in the end to a fairly tragic end. But do not let the plot fool you, the film is really hilarious and the acting is wonderful. <br /> <br /> It seems that with certain older directors getting things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to be doing some of the most creative jobs in their careers. Also, from watching the movie at the Alliance Theater, you can only say that people really love Woody Allen and that they are ready for him to come back. The second walked on the screen audience lit up. There is only something about the guy who really shines at Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's worth a visit.
