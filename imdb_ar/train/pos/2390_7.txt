My two year old baby loves to show Doodlebops, and it seems to keep his attention for a short time. The characters are interesting, vibrant with basic colors and all. There is not much educational content that the target audience can benefit from, but they seem to have a feature each offer and try to teach children about participation, respect and other basics, so I love it for that. It produces well with high production values. But it's really just an average show like most programs on TV these days. We do not buy in goods corner and make our son wearing everything Dooblebop. I do not think we will spend the money to go to a live show, if they come to town. Going to the zoo or science center is a much better experience for everyone involved, and in my opinion money is better spent.
