Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard about his loss from a co-worker who had obvious differences of opinion about entertainment, he loved her. Well, I watched a episode or two in the early seasons and I was bored, so I caught it. A few years later I found her lost; bored with the current science fiction fare. Wow I was surprised. Can you say gravity well, cursed that I absorbed. The speed and text writing are very good, some flash forward / appearing like that with lame characters, but well. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Albert, Sir Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jane and his wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Abby Jack. Jack and Michael are certainly immature, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step over her, Juliet was more elegant than Kate. Mr. Eko is way below level and if Charlie is not the most, very bad they are both dead. The man in black clothes talking to Jacob (back to back) is a real curiosity. As a whole a large group of classes too: Find more. <br /> <br /> Greetings
