On the eighth day God created George. But the same eighth day does not fit into the week, George does not fit the modern world: he suffers from Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by the community, and is converted to a shelter after the death of his mother four years ago. She was the only one I loved. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man no longer loved. His wife left him, for reasons she could not explain. He loses the love of his two daughters too, when he arrives late to the railway station to collect the two children who wanted to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a high-ranking businessman. He knows all the rules that enable us to succeed in modern merit. But he entered a state of crisis, which peaked after the loss of love for his daughters. He wonders about the meaning of his life, without any specific results. <br /> <br /> Harry and George meet. At first, Harry tries to get rid of George, as all the others do. But George can not get rid of it. She gradually looked at Harry, how much George needed, if he wanted to overcome his identity crisis. It is George who opens a new world to him and makes him look at his life with different eyes. Friendship and human warmth replace the account of the pursuit of success. Not surprisingly, Harry can not now avoid failure in his job. <br /> <br /> George Harry helps restore the girls' recognition of him. Even his wife must recognize that the fireworks he organized were worth seeing. However, reintegration into old life is no longer possible. It turns out that the new dream is no more than a dream with a time limit, which will endlessly end. The camera watches Harry and George from the top, for one minute, because they are both lying on the grass, just enjoying the moment. But as time goes on, it is inevitable that the friendship between the two men, which came into existence in a strange way, will not last long. George has been destroyed because of the impossibility of love for the opposite sex and can see no way out except suicide. Harry turns into a vagabond in the city, asking motorists waiting in front of traffic lights for charity. <br /> <br /> The film describes modern merit as a catastrophic mechanism that engulfs positive values ​​such as human heart or friendship. George, the Mongols, seems to be able to show the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately, his call has reached a bad end. However, its failure does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or undesirable to reach the desired goal. The way he shows us is certainly acceptable, although it requires a great deal of willpower and, above all, courage to apply radical non-radicalism.
