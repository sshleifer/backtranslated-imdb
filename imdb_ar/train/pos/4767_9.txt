I do not see how this OC display looks at all. <br /> <br /> First of all, the OC is centered around adolescents and their parents who are trying to get through life. North Shore revolves around a hotel employee who tries to manage the hotel and get a social life at the same time. Second, OC spoke in California. North Shore is held in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> Why does Fox make an offer like one of her other shows on the same network? I think this is a fantastic show with good reps for the most part. She has a good story and plot. I like the events that happen and how people take care of them and get them out. The latest episode was a surprise how the story worked. It was not as predictable as most stories in most presentations. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps her on the air.
