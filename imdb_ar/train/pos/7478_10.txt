I am from Romania and will try to speak English. All I want to say about this film is that it will be and will remain for me all the time. He has seen him at least 30 times and has been around for years now. It contains all the little things I love in a movie, it is very moving makes me cry. Presents a wide range of twisted love things and questions about love and reality, and the real things of interest to different people. It happens to me that this interests me more, love, the spirit of man, is an inner being, and this is what I see in this film. Perhaps for me more than a cinematic picture, it is a sign in my mind that it can actually exist and that you make the most of every moment you live with your soulmate. It's a long way from reality to science fiction, but ... what if. What if all capitalism disappeared and the economy fell? We will all be interested in other issues and my idea is that the most important thing you remember, on your deathbed, is not wealth and not adventure, not the countries you visited and the people who remember you. But true friends and true love and hope that you will die after God, all of them will be God's perfect curse, and people will be in good shape and care more. Watch this movie, and perhaps guide you through your life as you did to me :) Peace be upon you from Romania
