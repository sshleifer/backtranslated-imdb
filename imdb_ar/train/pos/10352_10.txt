Religious fanaticism is pervasive everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. <br /> <br /> A baby was kidnapped and the mother was tried and sent to prison for "killing" her child. I do not mean to spoil the story for you, but you have to know the basics before you delve deeper into why this woman found herself inside the prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent a movie and discover how the deep human hatred of different people continues to thrive around the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very impressive picture with a wonderful group of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Australian accent) and Sam Neil, whose dialect is originally born, are prominent. Supporters are also good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
