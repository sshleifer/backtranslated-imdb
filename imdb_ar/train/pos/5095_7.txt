King Solomon's mines bring us Patrick Swayze (played Alan Quattermin), who spent much time in Africa, but decides it is time to return to England and be a father to his son. He found that his wife's parents had detained his son and that he had little chance of getting custody of him with too much money to file a lawsuit. Ellison Didi, who plays his father in Africa and is being held by an African tribe for a ransom, comes to the map sent to her by Elizabeth's father. Elizabeth searches for Quatermain to bring her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There are a host of supporting characters that are compatible with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map as well. <br /> <br /> The movie draws your attention to the end. Once again, Patrick plays a fair and handsome man who comes to save the girl in distress. Patrick is a great drama actor who can easily portray emotion, loss and despair, silent silent man, anger and power; in the minds of King Solomon his character actually smiles several times. I would really like to see Patrick Sweezy in a loving, loving story to live again, a story in which he does not have to decipher his jaw and be very strong. Maybe a little dance will help. But this is a good movie for the whole family and it is worth the time to watch it.
