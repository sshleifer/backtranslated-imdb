This is a Warner Bros. movie starring young Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck, a prominent professor of cool makiavillian, a technique she mastered eleven years later in Bill Wilder's Double Compensation, is the role of Lily Bowers, the worn-out daughter of a violent-talking landlord in a gorgeous town. She has become cynical and numb for years of her sexual interest to her clients from her father. As soon as her father dies in a distillation explosion, a freight train jumps into New York and literally sleeps on her way to the bank bank ladders. <br /> <br /> This would have happened as if it would have been useless to Stanwyck. Works here. Through deadly stare and immoral temptation, it is easy to see why men are addicted to their aggressive attractiveness. One of the young people to be enticed along the way is John Wayne with the new face, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. Melodrama became tough on the last third of the film with the suicide of a murder, a fake job in Paris to keep a quiet night and the head of the new bank so addicted to Leila that he siphoned off the company's money to keep it in luxury. The amazing finish is fairly disappointing but not before Stanwyck stared at the screen. The film has strange touches such as Laila's interconnected friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Laila about Nietzsche's philosophy about the importance of avoiding emotions.
