This was the second entry in the regular Colombo series, and holds up well today. Since I am able to look closely at the DVD now and know how to build it, I am very impressed by the guidance of Bernard L. Kowalski (who produced MACHO CALLAHAN plus countless television episodes) - see how post-killers' His glasses, see how the crime itself appears in the montage, and saw a shot from the body's point of view. Also, the impressive but impressive musical result of the amazing and amazing Gezil Gill was a great help in creating an atmosphere. The performance of Britt Halsy as a professional golfer was fantastic - such precision and complexity in the role of nine out of every ten times would be a one-dimensional separation. The "formula" was not set after this episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in Colombo's styles. Of course, Falk, Robert Kolb and Ray Milland are the high quality actors, and I'm happy to see them work - all men are familiar with many other roles, but they lose themselves in their personalities here. In general, this entry was introduced into the Colombo series - and many others - well as a very good narrative film.
