Just after some meditation I decided I loved this movie. After reading the comments from all the other posters here, thinking about it more, I decided that I loved it strongly. I love American films - perhaps because they are very novelistic. Usually they have a clear-cut start, middle, and end. "Presque rien", on the other hand, does not make any such attempt. I do not agree with other posters that say they are "very artistic". In all, this film aims to evoke your memories. You often feel throughout the movie that you are there ... you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter cold, the companion, the loneliness, etc. <br /> <br /> In every way, the director takes you to the characters' lives - and that is why so many people feel so strongly that the film disappointed them. After I finished watching it, I felt the same way. But with some reflection, I realized that this is how the film should be: "The story" is not the narrative, it is the emotions that the viewer feels. <br /> <br /> The lighting, landscape, and camera angles indulge in the scenes - they are rich and wonderful and live in fine detail. Although I usually can not get movies without a fully developed plot (after all, it's not supposed to tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
