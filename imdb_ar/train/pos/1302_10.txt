Often a reunion band will meet only to find that it can not bring them together. Not so here. This concert is just a sparkling storyline from start to finish. It is clear that these three musicians met in advance and conspired and planned what was required to ensure that this was not just a craving to please someone. This is clear from the beginning, even before you step on stage. Many of the faces in the crowd were not born when these men performed for the first time. From the first song they took this old magic that was cream, 3 men, 3 machines, no fuss. Clapton said, with his own admission, that he had to extend himself to this concert because there were no keyboards or synthesizers and so on to see him at his best. Ginger Baker explains why many drummers today speak of him as a drummer. Fantastic Jack Bruce has really succeeded in developing a piece of magic that will withstand the test of time for many years to come. This one is 10 for me.
