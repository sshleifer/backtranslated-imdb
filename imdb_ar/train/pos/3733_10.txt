I had a uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he faced after his return. So when I saw part of that movie one night on pay-per-view, I was fascinated. I wanted to know what my uncle and I were going through as he prepared for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and said it was the most heart-warming film I've ever seen. I bought a DVD directly after renting it. The way you are drawn in so many emotionally different directions is something I have not experienced with any other film. As for the Vietnam film, I think it's the best, although Platon is second. Besides, I think it's the best performance for Colin Farrell as an actor. I love him in most of his films but in this film he was incredible. I was given this rating 10 because it is one of my top five favorite movies.
