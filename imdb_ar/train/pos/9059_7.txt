It's a good movie, a good family movie you can watch if you do not have something else to do. If you expect this movie to be a word to a word of the book, you will be very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book several times when I was in primary school. <br /> <br /> It's about a new kid in the town named Billy. He's betting with school bully and betting is not like most bets. Billy has to eat 10 worms in a day or to win a bully. <br /> <br /> Acting is fine, and maybe the worst part of the movie. Child actors to exaggerate many things. They think it is the end of the world if Billy does not eat worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a great job, though. <br /> <br /> The plot line is as good as a film, but absorbed as a book. I managed to watch this movie without looking at the time .... sometimes. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a good family film with some weaknesses. I appreciate this movie 7/10.
