Best of the series Zorro one of my favorite series, period. This is a serial series set immediately after the birth of Mexico. The new nation depends on the gold produced by this town to keep the Republic solvent. But the god of gold, Don Del Oro, stirred up Indians and stole gold for himself. Her Zorro and his band of men to save. Red Hadley is the winner Zorro cuts a broken character as he enters a nice collection of scrap (mostly reused by subsequent Zorro series as well as other series). The story moves and moves clearly. Who is the real bad guy. There's a reason I saw this more than any series I've ever seen, it's simply a great adventure movie. The only thing I can compare to is the Zorro tag with Tyrone Power or one of the other hackers of that period. Its super highly recommended.
