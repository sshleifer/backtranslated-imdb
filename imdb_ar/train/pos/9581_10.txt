This film documents the Harlem football circuit in the mid-1980s. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, despite being quite sick, however, this film is a real jewel in yelling. One can only sympathize with the characters because of their fear. The sole purpose of middle-class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of litter and glamor. Here most of the garbage geniuses are very well documented and glamorous. The tendency of idolatry characters to enchant everything that fascinates the characters themselves is inspired by the viewer, creating a "visible phenomenon" effect that makes the film a piece of art.
