Fantastic movie doji and excellent duffardar Rincon. As well as Otara Pocar which are usually excellent in most of their roles. Along with Kairee, is an example of a highly skilled cinema at its best. There are certain parts in both films that tend to educate - it is likely that the film has been reinforced because it does not contain the few scenes in which the social message emerges. These scenes are likely to arise from the filmmaker's political interests but the film is realistic and moving enough not to need it. But apart from such simple quirks, it is a film worth watching more and highly recommended. Sumitra Bhayev's concern and humanity shine.
