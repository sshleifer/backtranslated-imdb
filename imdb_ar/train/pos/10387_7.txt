After reading some other comments here I was expecting something really terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check Reality: The original series was not good. I think some people remember him more lovingly than he deserved, but apart from the car chases and the legs of Daisy Duke, the texts were weak and weak. Duke's children were very smart and feisty on Hicks Woodwood, and Boss Hogg was so shrunken that he was not evil and Roscoe was overpriced for every screen moment. It's amazing that the series really went on as long as it continued because it ran out of story lines during the first series. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. If you watch this movie on its own, not as a direct comparison to the TV series, it is not bad at all. The real star is of course General Lee. Chases and exciting car are excellent and this is really what D.O.H. It is everything. Johnny Knoxville is the usual eccentric and along with Sean William Scott as Cousin Bo, the couple made this film really funny in a funny way Dumb-And-Dumber never achieved by the television series. The beautiful Jessica Simpson is a mutation like Miss Daisy, and Port Reynolds makes Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey's film Rosco P. Coltrane is very bad, as it should always have been. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the erotic humor of the car, you will not see this movie anyway because you should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want a fun entertainment film with good laughs that do not impose large taxes on the brain, go to this open-minded view.
