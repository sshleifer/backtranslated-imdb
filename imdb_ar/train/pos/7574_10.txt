This is one of the best serials, ranked first with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape). The game has a very good story in which Claire Redfield looks for her brother, Chris Redfield (who you may know from the original Resident Evil) It is as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains more pictures. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** OUT ***** Stars (rating is based on comparison with other video games)
