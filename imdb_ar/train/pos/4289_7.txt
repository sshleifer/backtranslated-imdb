I must be 100% honest with your IMDb users. I wanted to see this film for a very long time only because of the poster. Does not Charlotte Ginsburg look so sexy and charming smiling this way? I'm in love with that woman! I got what I was expecting ... but only half. This film should provide expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedy or stories involving clever humor and light dramatic positions. <br /> <br /> While I do not agree with another IMDb user, it shows that the movie is exaggerated. I must admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the lack of on-screen chemistry among the main characters. There is no one scene of the peak that illustrates the main characters who share the moment of "romance" or even the idea that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was the only scene that everyone involved at a very awkward moment (when both are in the couch) and does not help the public understand the potential interest in love. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> However, the film presents very funny moments and contains powerful dialog boxes that support an innovative hypothesis. I mean brilliantly that it would be very difficult to implement such a farce by a 43-year-old man these days. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is a film and this is why it is accepted as a funny situation. In addition, humor is versatile. There are moments that include S & M, funny lines with the best friend of a young man, some gay references, ridiculous positions that include family women, and more. <br /> <br /> The performance of Charlotte Gonsbourg is first class and is the reason why to watch a movie. It is funny and exciting and looks very high and very good, and it shows that it is a versatile and talented actress that can make a spectacular and brilliant performance brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a good actor and gives a wonderful actress a decent performance. I think the support team is doing its best. <br /> <br /> The result, direction of art and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this type of cinema must be delighted after the credits expire. It's a good example of good cinema.
