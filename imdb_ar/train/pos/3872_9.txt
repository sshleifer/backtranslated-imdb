After seeing this lovable, comedian movie, you will definitely feel better. Cheers to Yves B. Pelletier, who was born at this moment's brilliant little cinema, which I believe will be recognized as a 2004 film in Quebec. Actors Isabel Blaise, Emmanuel Beludo, Sylvie Morrow and Stephan Gagnon perform impressively. I would like to compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you the one that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulain gave me. So, if you like the wonderful Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I would say that you should also love the first film from Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants.
