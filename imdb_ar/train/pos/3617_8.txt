"Girlfight" follows a project that houses a high school girl in New York from a sense of futility in an amateur boxing world where you find self-esteem, purpose, and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing revolves around the film. So much you can smell almost sweat. Technically and technically, shoot well with a sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is neither a flick nor a "rocky". It is, instead, a very human drama so that viewers who do not know boxing can communicate with it.
