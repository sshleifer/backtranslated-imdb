This is the most handsome film. The color photography is beautiful as it shows the glamor of the Metropolitan Opera House in magnificent colors. Other interior scenes in various palaces, etc. are equally fascinating. As for music, most of Lanza's voice was at its "climax", where many Arias sang well-known and beloved worlds. The magnificent Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy where her Soprano voice mixes with the sound of Lanza in a wonderful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their usual liberties with Caruso's life story. There is little precious in the story line that relates to actual events. For example, the facts about his death are completely fabricated and have nothing to do with the truth. There are some very good sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him. These websites can be identified using any good search engine. There are also many books available on the history of his life. But the line of fiction does nothing to spoil this beautiful film. The sounds of Lanza and Kirsten and the members of the choir are the true stars of this film. Enjoy, I know I definitely did.
