Bela Lugosi takes on one of the rare rare roles in a series based on long-range radio (which was also the source of a feature film in which Lugosi played the villain). Lugosi cuts off a stunning broken personality and his grief has not gotten any more roles where he can be a good leader . Here Shando returns from the East to help Princess Naji, who is being chased by Obati worshipers who need her to restore from their priesthood their high priesthood. This is a good-looking series around the world and it's great fun. To make sure that the speed is a little slow, more like the features of school principals (production studios) then an annoying adventure, but it is still enjoyable. This plays better than the two feature films that have been separated because it allows things to happen at their own pace rather than feeling rushed or feeling "missing something". One of three series of good series produced by Lugosi, and the other are SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
