I saw this movie in the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved her back then, and I recently came to VHS. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old children loved this movie, and they repeatedly asked to see it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching it again too. Although I have to admit it is not good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I have no older children so I do not know what to think about. <br /> <br /> The songs are very nice. My daughter keeps on singing again and again. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
