This film sparked my attention when he started at a cafe in Arizona and Richard Greco, Rex, Easy Dead, '04, decides to have something to eat, and gets hot and upset by the intense heat, sexy waitress. As Rex emerges from the coffee shop, a soldier sees a state and asks him, "Are you fast?" Then all hell collapses in more than one way. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill", "80", is a television reporter and is always looking for a news scoop. Maggie ends up in a hot tub, and Rex comes to tell her he wants a Western-style show with a local policeman in town. This is a different film, but Nancy Allen and Richard Greco are the only actors who help this picture together!
