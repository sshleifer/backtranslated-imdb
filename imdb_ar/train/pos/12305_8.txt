You were not sure what to expect with this, outside of the positive reviews I read. It's over, I never imagined this film, because it's very close to "The Bride with White Hair" at work and dealing with wonderful things. This walks on a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just a good old fashion ghost story. There's nothing scary about it, that's not the point, it's mostly a love story that deals with a stumbling man who faces a beautiful ghost, who is in many problems with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy who is trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also happens in ancient China, with wild Kung Fu exhibits, and a trip to hell (more or less). Some ghosts stop working wonderfully, and visual effects are the highest rate along the way. I was able to watch this kind of Chinese film all day, because it's great, fun and great tongue. I am looking forward to watching the first part of this film too. Highly recommended.
