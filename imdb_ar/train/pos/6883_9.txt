In rare cases, a film comes with the ability to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "If" such a film. I got a "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who works in film. I saw her for the second time with me. We were both a charm. As if it were the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magic piece designed to send you back to the moment all the dramas begin. Doing this while being amused is relentless. You can not represent Brett Carr and his speed as a director out of sight from the screen. He makes a personality that takes away its weapons from bugs like a rabbit, stuttering innocence, but it carries with such a sinister sincerity that you forget that you are watching a movie. When the epiphany hit during the glorious peak, I saw my wife cry for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a coach of life, I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film "I have to watch" for life coaches and anyone seeking growth and personal transformation. It is a wonderful and creative masterpiece with the ability to change life!
