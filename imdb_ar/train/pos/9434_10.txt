I remember watching this movie on television a few years ago and I did not pay full attention, maybe even missing the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and over rated. I decided to go back to her last night to see if I had missed anything the first time. I definitely did. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and has had a great impact on movies today and may remain so forever. I can not believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Two young Voight and Burt Reynolds perform in their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a feeling of disgust and dread for a long time after seeing it, it is truly terrifying. Oh, and have you mentioned that the theme of the song is also wonderful? Well, this movie must be watched by movie lovers everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie for the experience. Just do not expect a stroll.
