Unlike the person listed above, I felt that this movie was funny especially in the scenes where there was a lot of mixing. I do not want to give the plot and tell the story to people who have not seen it yet, but I will say that Parish Rawal does not have a broad role like the former Preyashan films, for example, Hira Ferry and Hinghama. Parish Rawal plays a great role in the little role he gave him, and John Abraham works equally well. Akshay Kumar has proved that he is no less in this film than he was from Waqt and almost all of his films after Andaaz. Although the three heroin in this film were debut, they did a very good job in acting particularly Nargis who had a very good and hot look. I would say that if you like Hungama or Hera Pheri, you should watch this movie.
