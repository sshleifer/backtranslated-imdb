First, no one can understand why this film has been rated so badly. This is not only the first truly awesome film for a very long time for me who I feel very nauseated with a long experience of horror starting from driving across dark flights (ghost trains) as a child. Second, the main actress Sherry Christian has a face that gives you hope to be the leading actress in the main images of the future. Thirdly, this woman is so beautiful that I suggest that the directors give up on those Cameron Diaz and Eva Mendez, and the extent of the names of these temporary light bulbs. Christiane is not Nora, but she is the sun. <br /> <br /> However, the "dark remains" also have great metaphysical significance. They believe that photographs show the intermediary creatures that exist between reality and the "imagination" that are not visible to one's eyes. But I have never seen a movie before that the creatures are visible on the pictures only to certain people and at certain times only. This means that the picture is not merely a symbolic picture of reality (which turns reality into a sign), but it becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as the "real" reality can. Being a sign, means changing the image that it affects the objects that were photographed, that is, behavior behaves as an object. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common for things to change marks. If someone grows up in a bird, his image will appear in a beard, not without it, as before. On the contrary, changing things through signs means that the picture with the beard is the first and only then will the beard grow on the man. This is simply expressed, the situation that occurs with the photographs taken by the main character in prison, in this film. This is new, and we must be thankful for all that is new in horror films that usually rearrange and rearrange the effects and features already known, mostly since the time of silence.
