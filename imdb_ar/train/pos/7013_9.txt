"Seven Pounds" has a great performance for Will Smith and a story about your nerves more than the guitarist in the middle alone, preceded by the former director's collaboration with The Pursuit of Happiness, a flick I loved too. Remember the name Gabriele Muccino because some of his films may go unnoticed if the actor attached to the project is not very prominent. <br /> <br /> Too bad I discovered the Will Smith plan early, and I put two with two when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and scene when the character of Rosario Dawson is presented as an insatiable heart - delay. <br /> <br /> However, I still believe that the writer / director made the right choice by placing the backrests (the first and final scenes) in this way, it is the source of urgency and tension in a film, gradually discovering how to direct a man exactly to This absolute sacrifice, it was tragic to see the relationship between the personality of Smith and Dawson thrive and develop, and know the back of the mind has always been in the store for those unfortunate. <br /> <br /> One of my friends with whom I saw the film thought that Smith's personality could have a divine gift, and I understand why: His performance is almost angelic when he is in the presence of his seven elected followers, but at other times it can be cruel and frightening , When he alone got the full weight of his position too much and he completely collapsed. It is a versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget to mention the re-activation of the scene, which was done in a very stunning way in terms of cinematography associated with music. Put this in your list.
