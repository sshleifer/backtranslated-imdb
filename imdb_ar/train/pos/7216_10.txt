No one spoils this piece of work! Wonderful movie! He was expertly written by the likes of Ira Levin and portrayed with the best performance in the life of Christopher Reeve and one of the best in Kane, which is simply excellent. I hope I can take a copy in stages somewhere ... maybe I'll do it someday. I hope that the location of this largely undisclosed film, which has been ignored, will not be very difficult to determine because it is a "must" for Hitchcockian, Agatha-phile, or a lover of the great film. One of the very few films that I could not solve or predict immediately and worth watching the second or third, "Deathtrap" gets 9/10 and earns every atom of it. We need and deserve more movies like this!
