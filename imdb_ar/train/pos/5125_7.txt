I went up to the bar expecting to be a hot beer in one of Texas' bustling days, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering through "Saturday night crap", I did not want to see a reshaping in some South Texas yard .... I did not do that. John Rivolta was as good as the jealous pessimist, and Scott Glenn was as good as former professionals, and Debra Wenger was, as always, a delight. * I love that woman * In addition to the soundtrack was dynamite [This comes from a man who can not bear the voice of rural music]. A fun movie along the way.
