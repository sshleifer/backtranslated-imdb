I enjoyed every moment in this beautiful film and I was fascinated by this female painter I had never heard of before. So she began to explore her life and work afterwards. As expected, I discovered that the film was not historically accurate. I was a little surprised by the very negative comments on the film because of the inaccuracy. Come on guys, film is not and should not be autobiography (nor novel!). A historical film distorts reality, because it must be a work of art in itself. The filmmaker has the right to use elements of reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it brought a lot of people (including some who are now offering negative comments) to explore the life and work of this wonderful artist.
