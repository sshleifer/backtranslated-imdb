There are many Hollywood films that are now being produced that are not only tortured to watch, but also do not affect anyone's life at all. Granted, movies do not always have a deep meaning, but it's good to know that there are still filmmakers who care about "human" stories. I will not abandon the premise of this wonderful film, however, the script is certainly one of the most complex and memorable in my life, and I am a young man in a 32-year-old movie too! Bug ranks top ten on my favorites list: Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard, and Black Narcissus, to name a few. This "Affecting" movie should become one of your favorite movies too, that is, if you have a heart!
