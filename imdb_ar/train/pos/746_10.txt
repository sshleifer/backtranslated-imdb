With my arrival at the "backside" at 35, I find myself annoying my head more and more when teenagers are having sex in the drug world today. It was wonderful to mention that it was crazy for me on the same day as it is for young people today. This film drives this point home. If you're a fan of the late 1970s, you'll love the movie. From KISS stickers to the ceremony of the rock rock angel! <br /> <br /> A young man saw Laura Dern. Why did not they have more songs from the fugitives I would never know? <br /> <br /> She had a problem with the character of Randy Quaid, a 16-year-old girl. While he was away, she and her friends party were destroying the dude's house. The police and everything, but without mentioning all cases of drinking under the legal age and how these children managed to control these things. <br /> <br /> Foxes is there with Over The Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the best times for teenagers. <br /> <br /> I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about everything.
