I can not really say much about the movie scheme that has not been said already. I have not seen the film in about 25 years and I have never lost its memory. I was looking for him everywhere. I've done a net search for it in the past but I came out empty. Last night I was thinking about the film again and trying to remember who was there but I was only 10 or 12 years old when I last saw him and I was not sure if I had the right movie name so I decided to do another search, and finally I found this scene. You're right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, you can now let me on tawnyteel@yahoo.com, I would really appreciate it. Anyone who has not seen this movie and has a chance to do it is worth it.
