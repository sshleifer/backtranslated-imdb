DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit movies - but it's still an interesting film dealing with suicide, its causes and consequences. Those looking for the Gore Festival, or the exploitation of the NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM movie style will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely a "house of art" movie, so those who need linear and clear novels need not apply ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is a "loop" for each day of The days of the week revolve around a strange string message that seems to lead to suicide, interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing body ... <br /> <br /> There are some very interesting scenes to think about, including the guy who talks about "problems" with His wife, and the massacre of the concert (which unfortunately lost some of its "power" to me, because I was too busy laughing at the band SCORPIONS that resemble it on stage ...) But seriously - this is a gm Sometimes (the scene that shows different angles of this huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the importance of the scene, and that the names displayed are for people who actually committed suicide from jumping out of the bridge ...), sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (SHIP SHE WOLF OF THE SS is very entertaining), and sometimes horrific (I found the scene of a man talking to a girl in the garden about his wife particularly effective) a movie that is more of an "experience" then just an entertainment, as many of these films are " " meant to be. However, I did not find that DER TODESKING as powerful as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and I would probably put it relatively equally with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of "enjoyment level" personally. Definitely worth a look at any of Buttgereit's movie fans or "art". If you dig this kind of movies - check SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion, the best horror film / horror movie I've ever seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
