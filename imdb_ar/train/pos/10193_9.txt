This review was dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwist. <br /> <br /> The Original Drum and Bass. <br /> <br /> There seems to be very little early shots taken around these days, if there is more, let's get away from it, and now, in days that tend to be of a completely different kind from Of all, parody, shadow for their years (much) the best. To be fair, no one has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they have gained their respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> These musicals for me are one of their best. To control an audience of more than 400,000 people with strong power, it takes skill, charisma, wit and lots of good bloody music. <br /> <br /> We all know about other businesses in the bill, The Doors (most recently before the weeks before the death of Morrison C), Moody's Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point was that everyone who was there became the majority to see. This show was one year after the great Hippie Festival of the 1960s. Woodstock. The film and the record have appeared as well as The Who's the greatest work yet, Tommy. Hungry crowd ever wanted to taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to "Grove and Love" to know that this concert was their own. To do this, you need the best of what Rock'n Roll had to throw on the hungry crowds of baits. <br /> <br /> At 2 am in late August 1970, Announces, "Ladies and Gentlemen, the small rock and roll band of Shepherds Bush London," OO ". <br /> <br /> The John Entwistle suit of black leather, on the front is the outer lines of a human skeleton from the neck to the soles of the feet, Roger wore his long-tailed long-haired clothes and long hair, Keith in a white shirt and jeans, where he wore my white boiler and Doc Martins, which he preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who who never stopped their attack on High Energy Rock for more Of two hours, and the performance and songs of other artists such as Young Man Blues, Shaking 'All Over, and then as queued, Keith baiting shouted "Shut up, it's a bleed opera" with Tom The rock opera went wild, that's what they came to hear, and who did not disappoint me, directly at the front and never asked for air until the last remark of "Tommy, can you hear me?" Is amazing. <br /> <br /> To pick up an offer The size of the band from this place at its peak in the festival was supposed to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world, it was a wonderful part of the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> DVD DVD comes in English only in an audio recording of English / Linear PCM Stereo, as in the United States, I think, you can get it at least 5.1, "Check the local press for details?" In it, OK. <br /> <br /> DVD's duration is 85 minutes without additions, which is disappointing. Yes, for a rock band and festival history, this DVD will send you on a nostalgic journey down the memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best shots that orchestrate the concerts where you were supposed to be , Live, Raw and in your face! <br /> <br /> I would block this DVD ten if it was not because of the lack of 5.1, and some of the plugins were nice. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
