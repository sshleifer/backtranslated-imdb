Question: How do you steal a scene from the expert loot expert Walter Mathau in an angry situation and a man who is completely brilliant and angry? Answer: Quietly, dead end, with perfect timing as George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about Vodafone, but this movie is still a favorite, the leaders are fun, the text funny, the direction and the speed is very good. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a straight man - try to get into the Burns through the window and so on. Even the small portions are wonderful. <br /> <br /> There are lots of funny scenes, Matao spoils the ad, and Burns repeats him as if he were old ... <br /> <br /> Joy. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
