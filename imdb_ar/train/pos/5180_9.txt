This private campground is located in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has been around since 1959. My grandfather and grandmother were among its founders, and my parents had a site that starts in 1965 and has two brothers who are now there. <br /> <br /> (This has nothing to do with the film; carry with me.) <br /> <br /> I've spent the summer at Blueberry Hill since I was five and even when I was 18 years old , And this is for people like me talking about this film: those who had a collective camp in the forest, as my fiancée told me, "a good and happy place". If you have never experienced the lifestyle, it is likely that the Indian summer is lost on you; do not bother. There is no quick fire to show how clever the scriptwriter is (unlike, but not so fast, the plots are not less polluting, Perhaps, the fatal line of Kimberly Williams about how her fiancé should not "replace his game." That's not the least about this movie, more than The Godfather is a flicker just because it has a lot of screens on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian summer is the opposite of the godfather pole, if you have tried life style, check out this movie For more, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this film 9/10.
