After seeing this film for the third time now, I think it is one of the worst films of Adam PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR, compared to this, I must say in the end when Deeki is thrown by boat, it's very funny (hair is different from his hair. This movie should only be shown if you have a true admirer Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> The characters are bad compared to his funny films such as Waterboy, who has the same people in this movie (Peter Dante) one of the killers trying to kill the Australian bird. <br /> <br /> This film lacks depth and a decent story line and deserves to be at the bottom of 100
