The attractive Marjorie (Farah Fawcett) lives in fear after being charged by a single biker. She was shaken by the fact that her attacker knew her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo) forces his way into Marjorie's house and is subjected to humiliating terrorism. Marjorie, with blood, was able to put her upper hand on her attacker, which brought out the light from the jerk and made him helpless by spraying the wasp in his eyes and his ring. A pig is tied and hits himself, Joe tries to explain himself to his colleagues in Marjorie (Diana Scarwood and Alvary Woodard) when they arrive at the house. There is almost a hint of mercy, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should you continue to punish her? Violence, sexual abuse and coarse language makes for an R rating. Phoset really gets out of the small roles that will smear her career forever. Glory by Robert M. Young.
