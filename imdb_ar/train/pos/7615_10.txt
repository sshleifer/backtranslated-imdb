This show is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows that are shown on television. I mean, great acting, thrill, drama, comedy, has everything, and this simple story: an airplane crashed on an island. The characters are wonderful and evangeline is a hot night !!!!!! Again, Matthew Fox explains to us what a great actor, Josh Holloway is so wonderful, Jorge Garcia is hilarious, I can continue it. And also, twisting unexpected plots, background stories of characters, and music at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms has again proven what a writer and excellent producer. I mean this is better than alias, and I liked the alias. Who does not watch this show, should definitely think about getting DVDs and watching it, because they are missing something great. Maybe this show is the best program in TV history !!
