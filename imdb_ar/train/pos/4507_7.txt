I was really amazed how much of the film, which is over 60 years old can impress me. Almost two hours, and there are no stars at all, there are translations, but it's fun and fun to watch. What impressed me most was the realism of the film. You may feel almost cold, because you see that the storms are real. This is the satisfaction in the CGI world like nowadays. I wondered how much work this should have for Van Dyck. I read somewhere it took 17 months to photograph it. Now who wants to talk about "Titanic" anymore? It's a great movie with a great message and I recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic the films can be if they are oriented only to reality rather than to visual effects.
