True, he does not follow the book closely, but it is still very amusing in the story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. Doody avoided the "silly woman of her depth in the wild" most of us most likely (see Kate Cabshaw in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death"). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's surprisingly better than Richard Chamberlain's terrible pair of Quatermain clicks. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of the West in many ways. The only thing I did not care about was all mysticism, but I think that's an integral part of that kind. Such as "How can you have an African adventure story without charming dogmas and tribal men who roam before?" Hey.
