Not looking for a fully developed plot here .... just sit down with some popcorn and enjoy this one. A series of stars appear to be the villains of classic cartoon characters in this thrilling live comedy, featuring striking makeup and distinctive design, not to mention knockout shows from Betty, Madonna and Pashino. Great fun for kids and adults alike. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
