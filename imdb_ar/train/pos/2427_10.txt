It's really a wonderful film unknown. Ideal dialogue without typical cliches. This film was based on the actor's talent and was withdrawn. It was a little comedy, but it was not exaggerated. Only in life is what is supposed to be drama crime, not the specific quality that affects the garbage that has been put into sex. I particularly liked the interracial aspects of everything. <br /> <br /> Now the actors themselves. Lawrence Fishburne was great at playing a professionally small criminal. It is a shame that he is only allowed to show his talent in his own film. Titus Wilifer was as wonderful as Fishburn's half-brother. Emun Walker added flavor to the already seasoned film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a leader of grease / drugs. I loved his acting since "The King of New York". But the best actor in this film came from Gregory Haines and Michael Paul Chan, who were fully associated with two Calderon followers. <br /> <br /> Surely the goalkeeper is "once in a lifetime". **** 1/2 * of *****.
