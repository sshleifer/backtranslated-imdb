This film is not a hangover, despite the production of Lo Fei and its association with the Truma productions. Myth of darkness for adults. Exploitation is the subject of Sugar Cookies, and one wonders if the Task Force has not fallen prey to the subject. Strange film with tempting images: Shadows and contrast are prominent. Definitely worth a special look of Warhol fans and elegant degeneration. Through all cruelty and evil, can take a moral look, albeit crooked.
