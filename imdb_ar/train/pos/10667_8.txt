I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love Broadway musical and I love the movie. I saw the film as having nothing to do with Broadway. I'm a thirsty reader and I've seen what happens to most books when I convert them to movies, so I developed a very early philosophy. Suppose the movie will depend on the book (or the musician in this case) but while the story line may be similar, it will not be the same, but it will be different so see it for what it is. > <br /> I danced for 12 years before I chose. I was a good dancer (picking up a chorus job in local productions as a child and so on) but I was not very talented. However, I was very talented as a show rider. I was told by the dance coach and my trainer (who spent several months at his ranch outside the state) that I had to determine when I was 14 years old. Days a week and ride 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. One or the other is dedicated. So I love the expensive dance and I love this movie and a lot of ballet and other dance. I just chose to watch this film for what it is, it is a wonderful film about raw emotions and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and sadness when you work hard to get something you want and you do not get it. I love the movie. I love musical Broadway.
