This film rewrote the history of the film in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this film, because it goes beyond cash. Every flaw in the film is easily overcome by many of the wonderful things the film has achieved. It's a very beautiful film, and I doubt that many of us will see anything like him again. I've seen it more times than I count, and I still find myself every time, with a hard to describe feeling. One for ages.
