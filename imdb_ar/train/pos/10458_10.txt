This film deals with one of the most aging diseases that aging today fears. As one of the people who have faced a number of families facing the potential of Alzheimer's disease or who are in the formative stages, I suggest that all healthcare providers recommend this film to any family facing the trauma of the disease. The film is designed primarily to talk to the patient's family and reach the heart of the conflict. Excellent casting and wonderful dramatic photography with a very leading plot line.
