I hired this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I was in a mood for what I thought was a fictional movie in the 1950s and it was the first Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes, I found myself quite busy and very surprised. <br /> <br /> A pilot oil well penetrated about six miles into the ground and the sponsor closes it. Both Lewis and Clark appear to get the lead, but are disappointed that the deepest borehole will ever be in the process. A day later, strange events in the well make a story more suited to Superman than Clark Kent. The radioactive mole appears to have invaded their six-mile home near the heart of the earth. <br /> <br /> Supermen and Mole Men are part of a simple but well-made social realism. It seems that the moral story that was issued in 1951, starring a leading actor in World War II, is that Americans are able to become fascists like anyone else. To drive this point to the house in a classic and supermanlike way, Reeves accuses even the rabid mobs who hunt the moles as "Nazis" at some point. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s, the science on which this film was based did not exist. Six miles of pits across the continental crust have not penetrated even the upper mantle, let alone the "hollow ground center" - which does not exist anyway. Forget it - Keep in mind that this movie is based on a comic book of the Golden Age. <br /> <br /> The movie is going unevenly. Although the mollies are interesting, a little creepy, and well shot, there are many scenes of Corman-esquire that spend a lot of time showing their strange behavior frequently. The scenario is smart and economical. According to today's standards, the costumes will be poor and fair, but at the moment, the special effects of this film and its fashion were very good. Cinematography is also generally good, and the representation is much better than one would expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Currie and Walter Reed.
