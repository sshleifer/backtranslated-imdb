Intensive actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward meet to make this modern film the winner Noir. Of the three, I do not know who was the most interesting because everyone offers good performances and interesting personalities. <br /> <br /> Patrick presents the narration in this game, where he plays the role of former boxer and mental patient. Wow, this alone makes for an interesting man! He seems stupid, but he is not. Ward is the slow, charming, cynical, intelligent and compassionate conspirator of the kidnapping plan that gets worse. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Darren never fails to seduce about any film. <br /> <br /> The movie can be considered somewhat oriented to the ordinary viewer, but I found it wonderful ... I do not usually like depression movies. What I found is a kind of alien crime movies. Take a look and see if you agree. This film is largely unknown and should not have this situation because it is just a good and improved story.
