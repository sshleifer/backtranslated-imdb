I think I usually take comedy movies at film festivals with little expectation that they will always be "quirky," and that any intentional humor will only be based on the simplicity of characters in the face of a complex context. What was exceptional in Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and evolution of his characters in his film while continuing to find humor in the loud scene after the scene. There was a twist, probably partly because of the sharp work done by DP, I seldom saw it in an independent film, and was rarely the most in a comedy. It is worth mentioning here: the role of Bajit Brewster in the role of the mathematics teacher Amy. After seeing this performance, I can not understand why Brewster was not discovered by a larger audience. It brings the necessary mix of anger and sense of role that really helps this image to reach its potential. It's a great job that deserves a bigger audience. I look forward to this more outlet and cast!
