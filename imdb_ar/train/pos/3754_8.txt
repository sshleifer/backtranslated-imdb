I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon in the 1950s or 1960s. It has been well presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope from the transmitters hidden in the rescue operations in one of the most insane executions of imminent liberation. I'm not sure there are boxes with facts. <br /> <br /> The film is still good. Reports of the German high command are troublingly unsettled "Russians are moving down Frederick Strasse" as if everything went according to plan. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that this film was finally made by an American television turned off at the expense of the British historian Trevor Roper titled Similar Days of Hitler. I was surprised to see Trevor Roper any balance. <br /> <br /> I agree that the latest German film on the subject was "DOWNFALL" as well as the classic film. The American start-up was fairly flat. <br /> <br /> A few characters have attracted the same amount of attention from cinema as Adolf. However, I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out speak of the double story of Hitler that was hinted at in the passing of the remarkable historical essay by John Toland. <br /> <br /> Was Gibbs?
