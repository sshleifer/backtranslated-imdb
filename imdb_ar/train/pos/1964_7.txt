I can not accept negative reviews from other reviewers. It is very critical, perhaps because it is stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Instinct 1, maybe a very small person? I left the cinema feeling happy because I was not affected by IMDb reviewers. After 14 hours I'm still trying to find flaws in the plot but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to all is to see it for yourself and hold your own mind. <br /> <br /> This method follows a pattern similar to Basic Instinct 1 but the plot is less confusing. I was left wondering at the end but in a more satisfying way. Sharon Stone is sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years very well; this remains her crucial role. David Morisi was satisfactory although he was not Michael Douglas. Of the supporting actors, I particularly liked David Thewlis as a police detective.
