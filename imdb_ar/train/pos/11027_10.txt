Since I saw this for the first time in the theater, this was my favorite. Since then I have seen it countless times and never tired of it. The setup has a big connection to it (Colorado I know would be jealous), but the story is original and I loved how the inhabitants of a small mountain town used heroes. There was no film I can compare this as well. John Lithgow plays a clever evil, but I love the way he gets out of his element completely - he has to follow Tucker around him and that makes him fun. This is a motion picture at its best. I do not think I'll see another one too amusing. <br /> <br /> You will not need to launch 50,000 rounds to qualify as an action movie. It should keep you cocky and not shocking.
