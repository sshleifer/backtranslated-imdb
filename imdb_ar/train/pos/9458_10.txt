This is a wonderful piece of filmmaking. It flows at the right pace all the time. The accompanying music is quite appropriate and very enjoyable for the ear. The funny parts are funny and more ornate because of the dramatic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> However, despite many comments about the tragedy inherent in the story, there was nothing frustrating for me to see. I enjoyed it in a way I had not experienced in a long time. That is, it is wonderful but without all the common effects of modern films such as sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dan in real life" lacks anything for being without ordinary vices. It contains a fully mature plot that does not require any additional decoration, but will actually destroy it. At the same time, the subject is quite extreme. It's a piece of art that completely envelops you and wants nothing more than it actually offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that feel a little "Walton" but they are really quite logical in the long run because they contrast with more moments of dysfunction. The spoiling path opens the way for a tragedy that then turns into an idealism that turns into a darker color and so on. This emotional scene of emotional photography creates an ideal balance and keeps the viewer in a state of stability similar to lithium. The peaks and gardens are nice but more than adequate in the fun you plant. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie regardless of the type you normally enjoy. Set aside any prejudices because this is a must!
