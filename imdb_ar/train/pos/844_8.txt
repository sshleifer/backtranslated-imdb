A casual encounter between the seller and the successful man changes their lives. It's a strange film that works, an impressive effort for writer and director Shepard. In an unusually unfamiliar role far from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the only man who begins to buckle under his pressure, but is unable to emotionally connect with anyone to help him adjust. Kinnear is equally good as a salesman, a decent fellow with a void in his life. Davis is fine as a flirtatious Kenner wife. The film is essentially a personal study, rewarding because it feels refreshing and unpredictable, a very dark comedy.
