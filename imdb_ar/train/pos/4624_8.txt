Believe it or not, the recent status of Inspector Gadget is what made me comment on the whole gadget thing. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I am 12 years old, so obviously I was not present when I was Inspector Gadget at the top of his career. Sure, I've heard about him, but I did not really know him. <br /> <br /> While reading, I noticed that I had not seen the original series (if it happened!). It's just about the only thing I've ever seen (though I'm obsessed now) and I'll focus on what I like because everyone else is very negative. For all pessimists, I have some drawbacks there as well. = P first, for a childish sense of humor, you can see that this film very funny. I thought it was, so sue me. I also thought that animation and character designs were good, and I'm also happy to have more tools, because it's my favorite character. (I do not like Penny.) Then there was a claw (his voice was awful) and Madcat. I thought it was fairly good too. The gadget gadget's foolishness seemed to be in place, if not a bit exaggerated (like sucking the thumb of his hat hand.) Will you give a good screen shot, though, yes, I'm weird. <br /> <br /> Like all movies, The negatives also. <br /> <br /> Talk about cars - what about it? You can say that this was aimed at young boys.This would not bother me much if there was no fact that the cars were basically saved today. Apparently, the Gadget gadget loved his car more than he called it natural .Some strange, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the president was frankly mean the tool. Yes, he was not always the most cheerful person, but he did not hate the gadget, which I read like an inspector, his personality is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all I can say about this film. Of a piece of land centered on a car and generally decent; more than a live-action film (slaughter, slaughter, vandalism!) At least I might be biased because that's what prompted me to apply the gadget in the first place, I may be a stranger, but I really liked this film, even if I was older than recommended to on about.
