This movie is entertaining, fun and quality. The film intelligently follows the guidelines if the book, trying to adhere to fine lines. The actors are all appropriate, and expect them to be the part. They use some famous actors who have a great influence on the film. The graphics are a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are some mistakes in the film. There is no such thing as yellow spotted orchid, for example. The camp is not as horrible as described in the book, and they tend not to show what is happening in the camp as much as described in the book. His entire collection is mentioned in the book, but not in the film. Overall, a wonderful film for the rainy afternoon
