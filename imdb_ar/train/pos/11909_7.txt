A young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her plans and her dangerous aunt (Sonia Drissdale) and her uncle (Barry Jones) that she is losing her mind and in a very sensitive state that requires her supervision, which seems to be similar to manipulation tried to keep her away from external human contact as much as possible. The only other person you see is the Chargé d'affaires of the estate, a charming figure played by Maxwell Reid, who drew attention to the middle-aged aunt. All this, the aunt and the chargé d'affaires, the blind butterfly expert who had a dangerous side on the other side, and his sensitive niece in the middle, made for a darker and more vicious film. As is the case, sends a frame to kill the murder of Trevor Howard (an agent of a steady government intelligence agency who had taken over the task of indexing the estate) and Simons all over the countryside fleeing the police, and occupying the headlines of the Police Net Closing In. A picture of the front page, bus traffic, and ends up in Liverpool, where they meet some wonderful cast characters, and finally face the greedy aunt and killers.
