Well, I'll admit that acting in the film is really strange - part of this is due to the plot, but I still have some difficulties believing Pierce Brosnan as he plays that progress (although he did a very good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on a true story of an English man who went to live with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed to be mixed Indian blood. He was, in fact, successful and thought well that people came from all over the world to listen to his lectures and pick them up on his land trips - even though he was not an Indian with blood and all his knowledge of books or fakes! The film focuses on this and what happened when the trick was revealed. <br /> <br /> The acting and the settings were wonderful and I really liked the movie (once I suspended Brosnan's disbelief). It has not been widely distributed - perhaps because it was largely brain - not a panda or a romantic film - just a strange film about a wonderful man.
