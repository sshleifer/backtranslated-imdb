FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the most entertaining, creative and entertaining business I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie does not meet the standards of Hollywood, or even a straight film comedy fluff in a video film starring terry "hulk" hogan, in terms of camera work, editing, acting, budget, or anything else . <br /> <br /> What this film does is a very original and interesting story, clearly made by people who love making it, and the enthusiasm of all actors and crew really penetrates its entire budget and act as a landing. <br /> <br /> This movie proves you're not doing it. "You need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need is some original ideas and some passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> I just do not care how you can get, rent, order, steal, or download, just watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I hope they make a copy of the DVD.
