I really enjoyed this movie as a little kid. At that time, I thought that the funny bizarre of baseball was funny and that the film was "wonderful" because it was about sport. Now, after several years, I can look back and see what was a good design film. This film opened my eyes as a young child to the struggles that children and real world issues dealt with. This type of exposure is greatly reduced in children's films these days, which I do not think will benefit our society. Surely the oddity of baseball looks really stupid now, but they have attracted children. A seven-year-old will not ask you to see a movie about adoptive children, but they will ask to watch a baseball movie. Disney realized this fact and used it to teach these children an important lesson about the world. <br /> <br /> The performance of all the other young teenage angels seems less impressive, but I will give credit to the actors who play both the children and Danny Glover who did a great job.
