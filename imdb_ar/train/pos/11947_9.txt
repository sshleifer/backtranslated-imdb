Simply written well, directed and acted ... Woody is better than 2000 if not his best since 80! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his lists. Scarlett Johansson's joke with Woody proves how close the actress is. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to have it in a love story on screen with the leading lady. He plays the glittering magician. <br /> <br /> There have been some revisions that distort this film. Do not let them see the wonderful movie. The people in the crowd that I saw with it were laughing loudly at some of the lines I missed the next line. If you like Woody Allen movies from the 1970s, you'll regret losing this movie. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go see this movie with an open mind, if you do, you may come out smiling.
