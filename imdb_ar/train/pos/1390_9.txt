If you like the science fiction of the 1970s worship the way I do, or if you like films like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", you like these movies. It is a stream of scientific consciousness in the seventies of the last century, including a cache of the 22nd century and Earth a million years from now. This film is 70 pure. Steve Miller wore "fly like an eagle" or "dark side of the moon" Pink Floyd and be ready to leave!
