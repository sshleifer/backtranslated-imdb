Filmed beautifully, acted well, suspense film written tightly. I had the edge of my seat. I liked the lead actress and I thought that the villain was very good. There is not much you can chew here on the way to a subject, but if you just sit down, shut your mind, watch the awesome camera work, and enjoy the plot, you'll enjoy a wonderful time. The plot is poor, and ordinary filmmakers are likely to know more or less what they expect about 10 minutes. But this did not bother me, as I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the old days, they may not have focused too heavily on only two characters, and there were some attractive moments when I was hoping to leave some people some lines. But perhaps these people were right to keep the film very focused. The plot drove me to the throat fairly early, and never left it. It is not good to think a lot during or after the film. Because I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense. Just sit back and enjoy.
