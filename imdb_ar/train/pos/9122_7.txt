Purple Rain is a great movie if you love music from 40 people who joined Prince music in the 1980s. The story is a commonly used formula: Rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find his audience and respect for himself. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially about Purple Rain / I Will Die 4 U, makes it worth sitting in the movie. He is the same and as a strong-looking man on stage, like Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, around the excitement. Apollonia Cotro, the former prince's governor, shows some beautiful chemistry and acting with the prince, but her script does not make her far away. Maurice Day and other supporting actors provide comic elements.
