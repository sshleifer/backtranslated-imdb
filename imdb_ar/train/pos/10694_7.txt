I have a great experience with women in Russia, and this film depicts what looks like a lot of them, unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless, greedy, and also very unfair. From robotic sex, the hustle of gifts, to lies and treason, I suffered everything in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I am talking about. Here are my qualifications: Here are the daily newspapers of my three trips in search of a bride. It includes thousands of photographs of the many Russian girls I have met, the black comedy, the tricks I had, and the story of the robberies and appearances that I made on Russian national television. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad.com/photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like reality TV. You will love it. I spent a lot of time assembling them. So check it out. The Russian woman played by Nicole Kidman is very similar to Julia and Katia in my illustrated magazines. <br /> <br /> The three brides looking for flights in Russia have come across as very exciting and will sell, so why not? Film of the bride looking for adventures in Russia? However, there is one real impossibility in this film, and this is how the man asks his bride from a catalog and arrives at the airport. It does not work this way at all, so I do not understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. There is no single Russian website to offer a bride that works that way, and I challenge anyone to find a site that works. The truth is that you can only ask for the contact information of the Russian lady (e-mail, address, phone number, etc.) from the site. From there, you communicate with her and then visit her, and if you want to bring her to your country, start the immigration process at your immigration office, and wait several months thereafter. This is how it works in real life. You can not just dial in to the airport. American immigration will never allow such a thing to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - Got everything you wanted to go through! You can also! http://www.happierabroad.com
