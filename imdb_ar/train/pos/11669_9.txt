Being the prototype of the classic Errol Flynn adventure film and having a good story as well as two fantastic stars in Maureen O'Hara (What a Wonderful Beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to all those who have even the slightest love of romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is at its best!
