Flavia (Florenda Bolkan of fame "Do not Torture a Duck") is locked in the convent of her physical desires by her father. Tired of all the sadism you see around her (the rape of a young woman in the passion of a sexual pig, the grooming of horses) Flavia decides to escape from the convent with her Jewish friend from abroad, Ibrahim. They are not far away from them before being captured, then returned to torture and returned to repentance. With a group of Muslims called Tarantulas, who invaded the monastery before and led a crusade that turns into a bloody battle behind the walls of the monastery. "Flavia the Heretic" is a well-directed guide and somewhat reprehensible about the Italian film exploitation is a bit appalling and sometimes cumbersome. Wonderful acting and sophisticated characters. In general, "Flavia the Heretic" is a clever and exciting film of motion with a lot of nakedness and vanity. Can not fault with it.8 out of 10.
