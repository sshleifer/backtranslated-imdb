The film was very sweet and serene! I cry every time I watch the movie. I recommend this film to everyone. The film was very inspiring to me. The actors did a great job in acting, and the film was well presented and done. The film was about a little girl who owned a parrot named Poole. She separated from Polly by her parents because they thought it would be better for her. <br /> <br /> After Polly tested a lot of people he ended up in a cage by himself in a cellar. And finally this Russian man who got a job in a concierge place. Pauli was found in the basement and began to talk to him talking to him telling him the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Polly in reunion with Mary (the little girl who raised Polly). Love overcome all obstacles.
