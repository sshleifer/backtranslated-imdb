I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of film, and his film has sometimes been overlooked. But this film is my favorite because it really gives you the time when the movie was shown. <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters present, the way of life, the way they dress, the way they've talked, well, they may be overpriced, but it's good to know that there was an occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with crazy hearts. <br /> <br /> I just felt it was part of history. Many people are angry and appreciative because of this fact. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere on a DVD? I've only seen it on TV. But for anyone who wants to get a piece of life from that period of time, it's the perfect movie.
