In LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film I was 4 years old and was fascinated by the magic of witches in World War II. The scene, which impressed me the most, was the fighting between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was extraordinary to see this army without walking on the body to fight the amazing singing during his career. This film is wonderful, from the trip to Portobello Road (which for me became the most wonderful place in London) to a trip to Nabombo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are a really wonderful couple. She is always wonderful, and seems to be a good aunt to the family and David with his always stunning face is her great co-champion. We will miss him so much.
