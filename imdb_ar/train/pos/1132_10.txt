In Hollywood Daytiem tradition soap opera at its best! It's the pleasure we never see. Great characters and great lines. The hilarious wubby ..... Sally Field is over the top .... Gary Marshall lines are rioting .... that's what I like about good comedy. Do not be afraid of ridicule on its own !!! Terry Hatcher as "Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but it is still wonderful and enjoyable on the screen. I like to know how the idea of ​​this film came up. I have not seen a team of people who enjoy the comedy! Soapdish is a must and I am waiting for DVD!
