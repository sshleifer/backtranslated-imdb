Roman Polanski brilliantly directs this kind of variation on the same subject as dissonance. I can not imagine that there is one honest filmgoer who can not recognize the good director at Le Locataire, yet both parts of my patients may not be quite satisfactory to most people, including me. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the internal torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with some lack of self confidence soon to gradually turn into a psychological discomfort that eventually turns into irreversible physical distress In which. The common plight of characters and the public is different from the fear and tension of horror films because there is no supernatural element here. Although horror films allow for some sort of venting (whether cheap or more elaborate), Polanski tortures us sadly, and if his dark spirit is in the last composition always, we are often on our nerves unlike our seats. <br /> <br /> Thrill and horror, all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations (rather than fooling and realizing), not literally with people's nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a much greater achievement because the great madness of greatness and rationality is in a constant conflict: the story revolves around the couple moving in a strange apartment, while we are forced to identify with one character. What's more, if the fantasy elements are all in the minds of the hero, the situation is very inconvenient because we, the viewers, are forced to judge it, and reject it while we are seductively attractive ("paint") to it.
