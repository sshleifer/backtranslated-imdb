I watched this movie last night after waiting for ages and ages to be released here in Canada (version is still limited). It was worth the wait then some. I'm a starving reader for Margaret Lawrence and I was excited to see that this novel turned into a movie. I ended up in fact liked the best film of the novel. I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a bit less harsh, and there seems to be a love story between Hagar and Bram, which made the viewer at the end of Bram's life more exciting. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was not more popular in the film than in his book, but Ellen Burstein was a genius in this role. Hagar was through and through. Christine Horne was fantastic and she had lots of great things to wait for. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were funny. I can continue operational and total 9 * out of 10. Wonderful and I can not wait until I come out on a DVD and have to own my collection!
