There are one details, which are not very common for Jackie Chan films, but they are here. They have some very harsh and serious atmosphere while the funny elements are also present. Jackie is threatened and mentally here. He is not a hero who is attacked and then resists (in a normally relaxed style), but he is the person who can go and start the unrest. His way of hitting this wicked guy in the glasses is amazing. Every time it goes "crack!". I also enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the bar and smashes the bad guys who encountered his girlfriend. It's one of the best flash attacks on the screen. In addition, the whole scene is filmed with the background of a movement painted on the wall (also looks like a "rabochiy" poster from our Soviet era) and some Russian fonts on the left (I noticed it by mistake). This sounds great (and nostalgia for the Russian people). I also love when windows are smashed in movies. Here are a lot of these things. It is very amazing watching falling characters / jumping / jogging / driving across all kinds of parts. <br /> <br /> All three movies are great. I was preparing myself to see the low quality slide, but I saw a perfect trio with an incredible sensation and action (not just Jackie Chan's character appearing in all three movies - it's also excellent and maintains continuity). <br /> <br /> I would like to describe each film with a few words: no.1 - great (in all respects - it's a story sweeping from start to finish) and funny (many scenes silly). No.3 - Incredible (Jackie is be * beep * off here) and painful (Jackie is tortured); # 3 - Incredible (the woman who fights alongside Jackie Incredible) and bombs (should I mention a lot of weapons and explosions?) . <br /> <br /> The rest - we have mentioned many others. <br /> <br /> It's a trio that can be seen again and again (at least by me). Its place in the top 10 among the jewels of motion / comedy. Finally, it was released in Russia on DVD (the second film has the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtrack and Russian / Russian translations). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your interest.
