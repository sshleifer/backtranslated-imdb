I watched this as a TV movie late last night purely by accident. The worried film shows that the mother will stay with her daughter and go on a romantic journey, where I managed to adjust the carpenter to work in a new winter garden - played by Daniel Craig - the plot was immediately apparent. <br /> <br /> It turns out that interest in the love of the mother carpenter is also a friend of the daughter, so there is a problem in fermentation and there are not many surprises. But I realized the performance of Anne Reid and I was hooked on drugs. The direction gives her a lot of space to stare at the mirrors and adjust the scarves when she is sad. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were fantastic and broken. Should the bodies of older women remain covered? Not here and treated with a delicious awakening in the mother's sexual life. Surprisingly, the drawings she designed (SPOILER!) Once discovered reveal her daughter's doubts about something happening here. <br /> <br /> Katharine Bradshaw because the daughter did not convince me just like the rest of the cast, but this could be me. I kept expecting to see Julia Sahala, whose face could have been better suited to the confrontations better in my mind, with its waves of pre-ruff locks. Bradshaw has a happier round face that does not carry the anger that appears as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If she was goodbye to the mother while leaving in disgrace, she was indifferent, perhaps we can see some close associates of those who wave goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she does, she is a bereaved widow recently leaving for the only home she has shared with her husband for 30 years, and she has found little sympathy. For a movie full of emotion (and warned it looks like opening champagne, you will not get the cover again). The end is a cool contradiction.
