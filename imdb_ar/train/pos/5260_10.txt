Yes, it may be clumsy and may not sound as funny as many high-budget comedies there, but it's really hilarious if you're watching it. Tim Meadows has always struck me as funny on Saturday Night Live. Whenever he does this character on the show, you spend the laugh. So after I saw that this would play on Comedy Central one night I decided to check it out. Overall, I was very touched by this film, because it was not meant to win any Oscars or become a comedy this year, but I enjoyed the Saturday Night Live fans who love the Ladies Man character. This film is full of some quoteable lines that can be read for years to come.
