This is one of those unfortunate films that suffered the most unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this film in a local cinema, in the form of a revival, shortly after its coverage in the main cinemas. It certainly deserves to be dealt with again (or even third). Sandra B takes it to the limit by uttering the words and eating some of the songs known in this article (you can easily take her copy to Hank William's book "I'm the only one I can cry"). One day, the audience will be ready to take this film on A little more seriously (but not without some laughter in good shape too), the film moves at a fast pace (with some great adjustments), so some viewers do not find it old and boring.
