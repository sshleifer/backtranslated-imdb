I love it when they already do a sports story well. Many in the past were so common that it was embarrassing to see him. Not this one. It's just a really wonderful movie, kind of an old story - and is based on a man of real life to do exactly what Dennis Quid did in this film. He plays as a high school coach talking to him in an attempt to experience, late in life from a mathematical point of view, becoming a professional baseball player. In the end, he reaches his goal of reaching the major leagues, even if the task is too short. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are nice people, from the kind he is rooted in, from Quaid to the players in his high school team, and to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, who is now fairly a star on television) > <br /> Sure enough, Quid plays a role in playing Jim Morris because, unlike the actors in the past in sports movies, he knows how to throw baseball. It is like a jug, a man who can be called 90 miles per hour. Much of this film is true, as evidenced by the jug of real life in one of the documentaries on the DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a real animated reality movie inspirational, you can not fault this one.
