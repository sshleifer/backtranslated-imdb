Alexander Korda (1940), the thief of Baghdad, was first discovered in the early 1950s around a reissue that was described as "Wonder of the Century Show!" Two films Korda Technicolor, Thif Baghdad and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on a program that can never be forgotten. Myclus Rosa's music enhanced both films. Technicolor in all was incredibly beautiful! The Baghdad thief remained on my list as the best fiction film ever. Over the years, it has become difficult to enjoy the color of the film in the way it was originally presented. True Technicolor gave way to Eastman Color in the mid-1950s. Keno and Samuel Goldwyn re-released the film on stage and on video. But Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and obscured the original technicolor vitality. The "laser disc" version of this title also contains a pastel appearance - cute, but not as it should be. Now comes the release of M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). The Baghdad thief once again has the wonderful technicolor appearance on the DVD no less than the temptation !!! It was so exciting to see him again after seeing him again, I saw him again. The only "plugins" are the Spanish dubbed version, subtitle in both English and Spanish, and a beautifully executed original theater trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this exceptional DVD version. Now, one can only hope that Ford FOUR FEATHERS from Korda and a restored version of Korda JUNGLE BOOK will soon be on the DVD.
