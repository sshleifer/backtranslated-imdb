BSG is one of my favorite television series of all time. I was lucky enough to start watching it as the series reached its final season. I've had a marathon race from start to finish for me and what an incredible trip! <br /> <br /> Once you notice the pilot on Hulu, you know exactly what you've just been through the title - Caprica! Although some things do not add up when comparing the two strings, it is still beautifully executed. There was no mention of holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds, but perhaps I did not touch on this series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this offer to anyone who loves the universe, technology, and alternative illusions in our world. This offer is very interesting and you will be asked to watch more!
