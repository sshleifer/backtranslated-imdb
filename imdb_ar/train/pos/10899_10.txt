I laughed hard during this film and my face hurt. Ben Affleck was a joy and reminded me of a beautiful boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance. The cast is full of funny, good story and wonderful comic moments. I went to this film and did not expect much, so maybe for that reason I was very surprised to get out of the full satisfaction and exhaustion of the face. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, and can sympathize with the unit during vacations and / or stand with relatives. The best part of this film (for me anyway) is the hidden humor that completely stopped me and made me laugh after a long time the rest of the audience stopped. It is a scene that involves lighting a Christmas tree. Go see him and have a good laugh!
