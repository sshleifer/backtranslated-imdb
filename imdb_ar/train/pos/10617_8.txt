George Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter traveling with her crew (Karen Lam and Louis Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodation has declined and that all the hotels in the city are full. So they travel outside the city to a remote location and take advantage of Ernst Keller's hospitality (which looks great in Sydney Lasik). Ernest and his friendly partner Virginia (Lilia Goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their captors: the pathetic, deformed "Junior" and the baby diapers (Stephen Forrest, with a terrific performance) that terrifies the girls in the end. <br /> <br /> Lassick's tasty predator plays the role of the real monster in the horror horror film. It builds slowly but surely with a hard / climactic confrontation, leading to terror in small doses until the last half hour. The hotel and the front-end cabins - great echoes for "Psycho" here - are fantastic settings. Most of all, the malicious plot involves incest and genocide, allowing the film to really darken quality. However, it also becomes influential because we realize that Junior is not a wicked man, but rather a victim, like a girl. The last shot is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> The "unseen" is a small, solid horror fit worth discovering. <br /> <br /> 8/10
