The film martial arts is very good and Jet Li is the best because Professor Bruce Lee himself is excellent. Like the librarian / policeman who saves all the time and again. He has a credible and credible presence and appearance, like the kung fu king who does not mess with him. Frankie Yip is simply beautiful in this mixed race in a unique original way because of her mixed heritage, she enjoys an attractive innocence at the same time she found it unforgettable. The villain, the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good, but I can not find his name in credits, could someone help me with that? Thanks! Enjoy Hak hap or Black Mask, in any language of good entertainment!
