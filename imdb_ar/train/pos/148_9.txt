Like his previous film "In a Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga has made a thicker, more poetic texture than his previous look. This is one of the most visually and painfully completed photos ever made. The escalating drama, the intensity of violence, and his responsibility for musical or comic melodies threaten, but he never steps. In this way, this work begins with the almost impossible feat: too much, yet painfully restricted, very charged, yet less than worth, and even the ends of explosives are eye-catching feasts. Shameless, gorgeous, and very tense ... This movie is simply wonderful!
