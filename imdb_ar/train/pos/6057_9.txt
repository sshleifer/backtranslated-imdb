Sure, because it's great pictures and a great sound, it's a wonderful home theater show, but it's also a dramatic drama as well as a documentary. The tangled parallel stories during this film will make all viewers interested. Young people, adults, boys and girls alike will find that deep down, we are all car lovers, especially the high-performance Indie machines produced by generations of blood, sweat, tears, creativity and perseverance. The sound track Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder perfectly match the images and content. I do not want to give up the end, but the final driving sequence to "days like this" from Quincy Jones may lead to rupturing your eyes. enjoy it!
