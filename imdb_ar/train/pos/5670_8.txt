Ester Williams takes her first role in MGM and returns to a good start. This movie is a good entertaining thriller <br /> <br /> With a mature theme repeated again a million times <br /> <br /> In the future - an innocent girl chasing a creeping woman hates. Esther looks great <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > A lot of work for marriage. In both cases she is <br /> <br /> pet and attractive, making it fun to see her in a completely different role. <br /> <br /> Outside the "swimming pool". Universal was great at <br /> <br /> making movies with former MGM stars after this studio started <br /> <br /> dropping its biggest names when it started to decline. Stars <br /> <br /> Like Lana Turner and June Allyson and others, they must make high-quality movies first. <br /> <br /> In Universal because they are clearly still attractive in <br /> /> Ticket office. I wish Aster had achieved more, but since she did not, she makes it more private.
