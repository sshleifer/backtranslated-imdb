Well, it certainly does not resemble anything else directed by Lynch. There are no supernatural things, no violence, no blasphemy. However, it is a nice flick. It's a bit slow, but maybe that was meant because it's the story of an old man's trip for six weeks (that's the best I've ever guessed). The characters are people everyday, so they are reasonable. The offerings are good and the last scene was incredibly impressive. Anyone with a brother can call him. Lyle and Alvin do not have to say anything. For a moment they returned in the old days and forgot the fighting.
