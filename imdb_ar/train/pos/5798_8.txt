I saw this for the first time when they showed this around Easter 1993/4 and I did not think much about it, then I bought this on a DVD last summer when I started to get into Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and enjoyed it more now I'm older . It's a good movie, but it will not be a classic movie like Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard Of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson was a good actor as well as the other team members. There were disturbing scenes like the little girl Katie who was slapped by gangster Frankie Liddio played by Joe Bisky. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song in the film was Smooth Criminal and I think it was better than a thriller in my opinion.
