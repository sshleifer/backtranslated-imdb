Why is this not issued? I thought somehow that it should be a little witty because it was not. How wrong can be a girl! This film, in a word, is enchanting. <br /> <br /> You will be captivated. It catches your attention from the start and does not slow down. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie, "The Episode" as it was (I did not give anything away, I saw it in the trailer) is also missing. You will choose a favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go and eat a cup of coffee because you need to know what is going on. Adrenaline rises and you are unable to watch. Regards to the actors, it is very reasonable. It does not stop there, they have a final shock to you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you wonder about reality TV and if you are watching it. And how far are we really far away? Endemol (who makes a big brother) presented a television show in the Netherlands last year showing my kidney a dead woman for patients in need of a transplant. It was finally unveiled as a hoax, ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation, but are we getting closer to resting?
