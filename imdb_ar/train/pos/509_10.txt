"Broken Bow" brings us back to where everything started. Select 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spook and McCoy. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchise is, in my opinion, the first series since "TOS" to restore the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "Going Where Gone Before Before". Scott Bakula is a good actor in the role of Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first Star Ship Enterprise. He and all the actors truly show a true sanctification of the legacy of Star Trek. John Billingsley is as wonderful as Dr. Flux's foreign, and Golan Block is just as charming as Vulcan's astute and logical science officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best key episode in any trip, I think Jane Roddenberry will certainly be proud.
