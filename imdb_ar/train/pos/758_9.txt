I knew this as a program similar to the Jackass program, and I saw a loop or two episodes on Freeview, which is the same, more extreme. Three Welshmen, a crazy British man and one of the likes of ice skating, and a complete pleasure / Masochism were collected to harm themselves, their health and safety. They ate puking, ate pizza-covered pubs, jumped in stinging nettles, bare paint balls, jokes on the younger man during sleep / snoring, and erotic in the workplace, for example the army, cowboys and lots of crazy stunts that cause bruises, bumps Blood and vomiting, perhaps not only for themselves. Starring Matthew Pritchard who does anything very much, Lee Dionton also for almost anything, and Dan Joyce (British) who is hard to do many physical things and laughs at OTT, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, but more Popular for being short, fat and lazy. The number was something on 100 funny moments. very good!
