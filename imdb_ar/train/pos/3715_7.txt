Well, it was a very small number very sensitive but I can not think I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA I saw in Poitiers entitled "Other Days of Ruby Ray" as you had patches of "Welcome to Dollhouse", "Ratcatcher" and Lynn Ramsay's execution. This does not mean that they are not a delicious reference ... just feel that it is very modern and very trendy ... which makes me feel that this is closer to the ad (as an approach in style and story) than the work of original original and original author. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just ... very perfect for me. The coral filter (or charcoal) for the turquoise ... is very heavily framed with a diameter of 12 mm. So the whole impression left me a bit away - beware of the art that advertises itself very easily! It seems that the French (a handful of conservatives) are buying it like the jury did ... but the selection of the short film was poorly maintained compared to its choice of features, although I wonder what happened in the last few years.
