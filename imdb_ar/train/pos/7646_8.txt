This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the options I have made and how my life has changed if my choices are different. It plays a correct role in the theory of the "multi-universe". <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not apply to the truth is how Larry Burroughs (James Pelosi) has a hard time understanding what is happening and that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
