SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just watched the expanded version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I only wish they had left the original on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Portabello Road could have been cut to the original length. It was long pulled the film. Although the dance was wonderful, it was best left on a DVD as a deleted scene. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I love my 5 year old. It is wonderful that the films that I enjoyed as a child are transferred to a new generation. This and Mary Bobbins are added to my group. <br /> <br /> Just as I remember! <br /> <br /> **** **** <br /> <br />
