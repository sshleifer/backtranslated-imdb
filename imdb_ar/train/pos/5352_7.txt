This is Arnold's film. Now that you know this, you've saved a lot of time to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, you will not like this movie. If the case is the case, you probably like it. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> Now, if you still read this, I expect you to like Arnold. A good thing for you! It's very good is not it. Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. He got the usual backlash we knew from the B-Sci Fi in the 1980s, and got a bunch of terrible vocabulary, lots of violence and explosions, a beautiful heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In this case, the villainous opponent is the fully dominanted 1984 government, which uses television as an effective referee in crowd control with gladiator-type games. Of course, Arnold ends up in one of these shows and turns them all down, with the help of a few of his two Confederate powers and the beautiful Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big movie budget, but it's still able to create a very good atmosphere in the future, with some nice non-nice paintings and sets to help him. It's hopeless 80, but I find this magician. Representation changes, Arnold makes snoring and yelling, with the help of one side of the stone. Heroine Amber is, mildly, somewhat stereotypical, known as Damien Kylian is a typical wicked TV man. <br /> <br /> Despite all its drawbacks, the film shows its message very clearly; television is the opium of the masses, a good way to control people. It also contains some of the time in the future digital video editing, allowing the villains to change the faces in the video to deceive their audience. This does not seem to be a future at all today, which is somewhat disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold movies before, you know when to watch this movie. Enjoy.
