Perhaps the most personal work of David Lynch is the most accessible. This time, instead of the vague thematic structures that may or may not involve conspiracy or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective reflection on global issues of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of the Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who was riding a mower in the park to Wisconsin to visit his separated brother, there are still a lot of unique and original visual dreams (some amazing aerial shots in the heart of the earth, filmed by veteran filmmaker Freddie Francis) Lynch's undeniable effort and descriptions are among the most memorable. Farnsworth is excellent in his elegant and elegant way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become part of his life, and Sisi Spacek in some of her finest works in a smaller role, like his daughter, who is committed to mental challenges. The Sensitive Scenario of John Rush and Mary Sweeney) But the rest of the young actors' performances offer an indelible performance, one of which is Barbara Robertson, whose accidental death of the deer is both loud and sad at the same time. But this is an old Lynch with his ability to engage and shake you at his best. For those who do not know Lynch or know only his violent and disturbing reputation, this is a great place to start. For those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire.
