House games are bound to spell. It is nice to see movies that are sometimes ideal. There are a few films that I have seen that can catch you quickly. From the opening scene, this movie only connects you. <br /> <br /> I really try not to give a lot to anyone who has not seen this yet but there will be a few spoilers so do not read more if you do not want to know. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that House of Games is not just a great movie; it's the best film about deceived artists I've never seen. From the moment the movie ended, it was re-released. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse where Margaret Ford is just perfect, from her behaviors to the reflection of her voice, she became in the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this film enjoys an almost uneducated quality and these two people communicate as much as they communicate with their voices. I also liked the way the film was filmed, in this kind of popular surrealistic way, which is quite appropriate and helped make the film as it was. <br /> <br /> There were some movies that I saw and loved that reminded me of that, including The Grifters and the usual suspects but House of Games is completely different from its way. Margaret and Mike are the most captivating figures I have ever seen on the big screen. They do not only have the screen chemistry of the moment they meet, but the accumulation that starts from the moment they watch each other is electrification. You know that something will happen but you have no idea what. And only when you think you guessed the "thing", you realize that you did not scratch the surface until .... <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of those films that may be collected in a particular type of film but is basically A film about human nature. A personal study is not only about the artist's con mind but the victim as well. As the film progresses and we learn more and more about the main characters, we recognize them not only through what they say but how they say it. It is a wonderful study of personality and flawless in the way it goes to its end. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to rank 10 out of 10, I call it (although I'm not my absolute favorite film, very high on the list), it is certainly outstanding and will go so far as to say it ranks as one of The best personal studies contain some of the best "twists" I've seen as well. Although I love all kinds and types of movies, when it comes to the same human films, they really do not get much better. Watch this movie.
