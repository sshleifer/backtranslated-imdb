Shake this video! Eddie is one of the most comic stories I have ever seen. Not only does it have a chapter, it even makes some of the most poignant observations on the history and culture that I have seen in my life. Eddie is the most authentic and intelligent comedian I've seen in a very long time. Tell all those other positions to get out of the podium and let this "official" prevail!
