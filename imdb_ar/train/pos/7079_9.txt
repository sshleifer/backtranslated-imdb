I really enjoyed this - I'm a fan of movies that mess around with your mind and leave you with lots of questions and ideas to discuss, and that was a great example. But after that, Terry Gilliam is always good at this (well, almost always, let's just forget Jabrooki and the Brothers Grimm, are we?) <br /> <br /> I particularly liked how you dealt with the theme of travel over time and avoiding paradoxes - the way in which events in the past and the future are intertwined and nourish each other. <br /> <br /> It was also aesthetically good - the art direction was really wonderful and I wish I could see it on the big screen. Future viewers had a similar feeling to Brazil in many ways, and even the current scenes were often visually impressive. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most interesting thing about it is that it has two representatives I usually do not like very much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, both of whom performed great performances here. Private Pitt - I saw a movie or two movies before that made me realize that it could actually act (contrary to what I originally thought), but this movie really went beyond it. I found myself asking my friends at one point "Are you sure Brad Pitt?" Perhaps this is the most outstanding performance in his career (although it is recognized that this may not say much).
