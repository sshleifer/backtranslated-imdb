Fantastic weird movie with enough twists to bag of pastries. Parker Posey plays the role of Fime Grimm as an exciting and dangerous mother who may or may not be as she seems. The story is a big tongue in the cheek, and the dialogue subtly subtracted. Hints of humor and intrigue, none of which overcame Bossi's characterization. Cast excellent support. the negative side? This film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. Bozi has a more sexual attraction in lifting her eyebrows than most actresses in their entire body. It's worth your time, even if you do not understand the speeches.
