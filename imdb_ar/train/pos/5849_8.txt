Damn straight ..... this show was kick ass again a day and continues to dismantle the cartoons today. I can not wait to track down some DVDs to share with the little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I already made it to Voltron (5 black, not 15 vehicles) and I laughed my head when he said to me someday "Dad ... I've certainly seen some great cartoons when I was a kid !!" How wonderful. <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, empty this water and give a try to do live. Could not be worse than Spiderman 3 ... Man oh man ... 2007 was pretty lame for summer films. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll be embarrassed now
