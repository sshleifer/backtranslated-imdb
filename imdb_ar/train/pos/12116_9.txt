... that Bette Davis's release of this film was better than Kim Novak's. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, although the Novak version contains a more coherent storyline. <br /> <br /> However, it seems to me that Davies Mildred's raw feelings are more likely for a stagnant girl to look like a whore. <br /> <br /> These are the raw feelings that make up a "part" of what the poor doctor is. He has feelings of despair, failure and "the other" - strong feelings he does. Davis Mildred, on the other hand, displays her emotions immediately and without censorship. She has no sense of despair or failure or "the other"; instead, she only lives as a poor Victorian woman. <br /> <br /> Novak Mildred was more vulnerable than Davis, almost through the whole film. Davis Mildred ** was never at risk ** so she had to go to the doctor and seek help. And when he curses her - for her way of keeping the body and the soul together, and the constant use of his love for her - she unleashes the most vehement debate with the most resented zeal on your screen: "I wiped my mouth" I wiped my mouth !! "Novak's weakness was excellent. Davis's realism was enormous. <br /> <br /> IMDb sounds consistent!
