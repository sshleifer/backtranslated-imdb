The film was absolutely cool and cool. The graphics were wonderful and it was amazing, especially, Flake was wonderful and wonderful in the film and it was funny and was sometimes smart. Colorful circus insects are wonderful in the film. The locusts were also wonderful and wonderful in the film. The hump hopper was pure and perfect. So, it was a nice point. When the bird comes to eat insects, this scene was wonderful and good. So the last scene was cool and cool. Even Flake's inventions were good. Artificial bird construction was a good idea to scare locusts. When the ants built an artificial bird, this scene was good and pleasant, and I truly appreciate the creators of the "bug life".
