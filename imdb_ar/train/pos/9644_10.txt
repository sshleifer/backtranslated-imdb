I will give it to you directly ... This film is amazing. Foreign gay films outperform gay films in acting and production. While many polarized gay films are popular, bad voices, amateur actresses, vulgar story lines, and a sudden lack of sexual nudity or promiscuity, foreign high-quality gay films have emerged from France. The cinema is beautiful, well thought out, meaningful. The story is mature and complex (but not difficult for anyone to follow), the representation is intense and professional. Both filaments are wonderful, as are the entire cast. The boys are more than just good looking and there is a lot of nudity in front of me. I was following a full year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. All nuances in the relationship, the details fall into, out of love, there is a beautiful performance. Leave me wanting more. check it out!
