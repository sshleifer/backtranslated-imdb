This set of 11 short stories in one film is a wonderful idea, offering some wonderful passages, but also some disappointing surprises. Based on the tragic event of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America, eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the American tragedy. The result of most of them is not only individual sympathy with the American people, but mainly intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (UK) presents the best slide, about September 11, 1973 in Chile, when dictator Augusto Pinochet destroyed the democratic government of Salvador Allende with the support of the United States. <br /> <br /> Other notable sectors are the Yusuf Chahine (Egypt) part, the show of intolerance in the world, the number of victims caused by the governments of the United States of America in different countries throughout contemporary history; and one of Mira Nair (India) A true story about injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family, her son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States, when he was already a hero. <br /> <br /> Some sectors are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children as they prepare for a non-aggressive shelter against bombs while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world. Claude Loch (France) Romance The life of a couple in New York near the World Trade Center; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the effects of their war in a small site and the only protest of the widows; Sean Penn is very poetical, and shows that life goes on; the story of Shohei Immura is the most impressive, Holy war, but sorrow and shame. <br /> <br /> The section of Idrissa Kedraogo (Burkina Faso) is very naive, but it depicts the terrible bad conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> Amos Gital's band (Israel) is too boring and manipulates a larger look than violence and terror. <br /> <br /> The part of Alejandro Gonz√°lez Iainito is very disappointing, terrible, without any inspiration and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> Seven voices. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("11 September")
