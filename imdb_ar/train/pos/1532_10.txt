This, like Murder She Wrote, is one such program, after a stressful day at school, sitting in front of the TV and watching it. why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's a shame that it's no longer on air anymore. Dick Van Dyck is amazing because Dr. Mark Sloan, the doctor who turned to the detective, who works with his son to solve the murders. He was joined by a largely unknown but highly qualified support team, his real son, Barry van Dyck. Victoria Royle is also good, but I noticed that each string changes her hairstyle. I also loved Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially liked Michael Tuchy Norman, and I was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared. This offer is very enjoyable, with great guest stars, it's a bit obvious at times, like Colombo, but in every episode, there's always something to laugh at. In conclusion, a fantastic series, with thumbs up and 10/10. Bethany Cox
