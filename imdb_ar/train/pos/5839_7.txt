Another (I think) of The Boys' films made by Hal Halach, and this is the last truly funny film they produced, before moving on to the 20th century fox, who misunderstood their talents. Although there are weak moments - work with the "lung test", for example, is a little, ah ... exaggerated (but worth to see, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but on the whole this flick Summary Good for the boys brought to the screen. Richard Kramer (unsupported) appeared in other L & H films, and he happily threatens here as convicted Nick Granger. The scene where children should eat their artificial meal ("looks good, smells good, tastes good.") Is one of my favorite moments at the party. Stan & always will always be an enjoyable companion to the lives of millions of loyal fans.
