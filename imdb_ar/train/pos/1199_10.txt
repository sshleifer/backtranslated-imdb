This is the most convincing and excellent performance ever presented by Robert Taylor. He even surpasses his outstanding performance as "Johnny Eager" 14 years after the film. His appearances are still fascinating to his vision, but he now enjoys maturity that gives him an advantage in this brave and courageous role. Charlie Gelson (Taylor) is another breed, a buffalo hunter who does not kill for money but for fun. His brutal killing is not only buffalo but humans, it is stunning to watch. He is basically a lonely man, he needs people around him, but they hate him because of his social behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stuart Granger), who is fed up with the hunt and is only moving ahead because he has failed in anything else. Along the way Charlie kills a family of Indians and picks up a beautiful Debra Bagnet. Charlie tries to seduce her in vain, but sees Sandy as interested too. Granger grieves a bit of grief, so she is fed up with searching, and longs to get away from the girl and her child. Lloyd Nolan as a gorgeous drunk skinner with wise cracks and accordion toys. Russ Tamplin plays a half-breed in an attempt to fit a white world. The group is a strange mix of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Taylor was horrified by the buffalo, as many fishermen did before him, and avoided Sandy's departure with the girl. When he returned, that night, Sandy left with the woman, and Charlie was shot in a state of murder trying to get Sandy and get the girl for himself. The final showdown comes in a blizzard and the final scene is so horrible that you will never forget it. It's a Taylor movie all the way and it was really a really less representative of the age.
