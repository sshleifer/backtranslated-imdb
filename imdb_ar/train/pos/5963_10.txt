This movie is terrible, but you have to see it because of it. I'm not here to discuss the entire film, just the greatest chasing scene ever. When Eddie fills the milk in Tim, he chases the hallways. Eddie puts obstacles in the way of the players with funny consequences (such as cymbals, buying a DVD and watching it slow). The best obstacle is the mop bucket that one of the jokers knocks but extends to the ground outside the door. But when the speed slips up, so the physics (essentially friction) is united; after what lies behind the door is the upper. The most severe cases in any school at all, which moves this tool to CLEAR in the air. In fact maybe die of a broken neck. It not only defies all the concepts of reality, it also makes the noise extremes that occur in this situation. Go and buy this one. Trust me this scene is worth your $ 6.
