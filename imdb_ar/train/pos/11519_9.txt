The only reason I did not give these ten stars is to list DVD formats - no, plugins, etc. However, if you have ever dreamed of doing something in your life, this movie suits you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most vivid films I have ever seen. And magical. Representation is wonderful, the plot serves the purpose, the opening sequence is wonderful. This is one of those films that used to be "worship" around. I recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love, others can not finish it. When I think, or feel, that there is something impossible I think about Alan Arkin's role in this film. I certainly hope to make more films.
