I have watched this movie because it was the second feature on a CD containing a "blood ritual" that was previously banned. Since the Blood Rites were absolutely terrifying, I did not expect much from this film; in fact, it seems that garbage manager Andy Miligan has outperformed himself this time as "Seeds of Ove" is the bloodiest ritual and remains as tall as a slice Enough of the sixties. This plot is in fact very similar to the ritual of blood, where we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and, of course, there is an inheritance at stake. The film was filmed in black and white, and its shape and appearance reminded me of the classic "The Curious Dr Humpp". There is hardly anything presented, and it seems that the director is keen to focus on sex, where the topics of incest and hatred permeate. Acting is usually tough, but most women appear nude at some point, and despite their bad reputation, director Andy Miligan seems to be watching this kind of thing in fact, because many of the sequences in this film are really wonderful. The paper plot is thin, and most of the film is filler. But music is attractive, and the director also does surprisingly good work with sex scenes because most of them are rather exciting. In general, this is not a great movie; but it is likely to attract worshipers, and you get a much higher recommendation than the "blood ritual" known and of lesser quality.
