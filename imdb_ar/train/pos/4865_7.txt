I could not wait to put my hand on this, when I read about Fred Astaire as a team with George Burns and Jerzy Allen in a film program by P.G. Wodehouse and music by Gershwins. It is certainly worth watching, but lacks the consistent quality of Fred & Ginger films. <br /> <br /> It is best to read the story in Wodehouse, where humor is better. Some behaviors are quite painful to watch (especially the little boy and the girl). <br /> <br /> But ...! Funhouse dancing is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but the boy does it in this film. Have you ever tried to stand on one of those turntables in the fun hall? Imagine dancing on one in high heels! It follows up beautifully with Astaire and adds to the overall quality of the image. <br /> <br /> Many nice songs, especially Nice Work if you can get it and Steve Abe Lipp. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire and Burns & Allen. I had to go back and watch the Venus dance once the credits were over.
