The people who produced this wonderful film have provided a good service to a novel that represents the best imaginative works that focus on human guilt and human responsibility published at all. Nolte takes the role of Howard W. Campbell Jr., makes it his own, and remains true to Vonnegot's portrayal of a man who has lost ALL (to and) for love. <br /> <br /> No weaknesses in this fine adjustment.
