This IMDb lists as a 1972 year for some reason, but the other sources I have seen including excellent program reviews are defined as '68. It does not matter really, but it is interesting to see this abstract collection of films and videos (one of the first works of art to merge the two apparently) in the context of the Star Gate series in 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction is not really something, but I can take it in small doses, colors that are visually saturated, and the narcotic sensation of this series of flowers, rushes, birds, etc. Certainly helped pave the way for many emerging video artists in the 70s, and deserve to be known.
