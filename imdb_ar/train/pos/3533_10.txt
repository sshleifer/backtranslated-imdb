Unfortunately not available on DVD yet, but worth a follow up on TCM or VHS. A secretary thinks her boss is wrongly accused of murder and bravely deals with many dangerous characters in an attempt to prove the truth. A movie with many dark turns and alleys, which I will not mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks to get information about the killer, is one of the most exciting scenes in the history of Hollywood, although its budget is extremely low and manufactured during World War II in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island Island looks fairly mountainous - but this film is of original style and brilliant vision. Ella Raines was a wonderful actress who was discovered by Howard Hooks, who knew a lot about these things. He took a look at the most ferocious women - Joan Drew, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall and Anne Sheridan - in their age. Robert Ciudmak was one of the German, Hungarian, Czech, Cirque, Wilder, Zineman, Lubitch, Cortez, Lange, etc. - who moved to Hollywood and brought with them a new and very innovative vision. Unfortunately Ela Raines did not give such a big part again, and ended up in the West, whose production was poor.
