Before Nicolas Cage was a great star, he was a wonderful actor. This less famous film is where Cage offers one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-cost, almost unknown film, but one of my favorite movies of all time. I found out that he was walking in the video shop corridor, and I wanted to see the appearance of Cage and Huber (who is also a wonderful person in the movie) together. Go and get this, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
