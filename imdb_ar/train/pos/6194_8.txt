Henry Fole surprised me. I did not expect to be entertaining, entertaining, or forcefully, as I did. Faye Grimm continues to surprise her by providing a strong continuation of a story she does not need. As soon as the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the film, it becomes apparent to the blind that this is one of the best sequels of a wonderful independent film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is too small, but I'm glad it's part of this short term. It is convincing and enjoyable as a Fulbright agent. We are also pleased by Liam Aiken who brilliantly portrayed Ned Grimm, Son of Fei and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of fun. I am pleased, for example, to discover that Henry is not the loser he seems to be (by the end of a lie), and to find out more that he is, in fact, a genius ... well, it is really a nice pen blow. <br /> <br /> I hope they do a third ... like the end of a trilogy. It seems to be missing. They must be groomed by Ned Fool Grim, and Liam must be looking for his father, to check the validity of the tremendous change in his mother, and the sense of nearby genius that he feels himself well inside. Assuming, of course, that Faye continues to withhold many of the most important facts about her son, regarding his father. It seems he needs to do. I was buying it. <br /> <br /> Even with further action, this remains unclear. It is more drama and intrigue ... puzzle, of some kind. I'll see it a lot. <br /> <br /> An assessment of 8.3 / 10 of the ... <br /> <br /> Punk :.
