I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use a lot of obscene words for no reason. Maybe this is his idea of ​​"adult" movies, a lot of bad words with the bathroom humor thrown in? I thought about it better and thought less about it in this film. <br /> <br /> Falc's representation and some humor moments as well as some important subjects may have made me highly rated. <br /> <br /> This may be a good film for adult children to watch and laugh about their parents and weaknesses. But the lack of attention to the families of the public seriously hurt what could be a family film but failed. Definitely not worth spending money, although it may be worth watching for free on TV.
