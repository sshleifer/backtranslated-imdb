When will people learn that some films are made for entertainment and not necessarily change the world? If you realize it, expect to get piles of fun while watching "Fake Trip to Pale and Ted". It's a fun movie to watch. Keno and Alex make a fantastic team on the screen, recalling their characters from "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures" in a "more" style, and then in the first film. It's not rocket science, but it's great for laughs, characters have a great deal of admiration, and the storyline is very radical, and you have to laugh. Do not expect "deep meaning" just expect pure pleasure!
