For years, we were watching every horror film come out, ranging from boring Hollywood movies, like Saw 2, to horrendous versions you can not see and forget ... We suffer through all the bad movies hoping to find little jewels like "Dark Remnants". <br /> <br /> We were able to watch a film from this film at Shriekfest 2005. I loved the audience and I think it ended up winning the best film award. <br /> <br /> Although he may not have a budget or star power for studio films, he packs a dangerous punch in the creepy atmosphere and fear category. Acting and cinematography are first class, but the direction that makes this film worth watching. The story and characters evolve at the right pace to provide some wonderful concerns. <br /> <br /> Editing and visualization is also a top priority. Although many horror movies do not succeed in using music for their benefit, the result of "Dark Remains" adds only to its creep. <br /> <br /> I know that the film was shown in a number of festivals, but none of them were near me, so I can not wait to hear when it will finally come out on a DVD. Trust me, even if you're fed up with the current state of horror movies, try this one ... you will not regret it!
