Xizao is a rare small film. It is simple and tolerant, and at the same time rewarding in emotion and joy. The story is simple, and the subject of the old and new clash is beautifully presented in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but it could have fizzled out if it was not for the brilliant characters and the actors that depicted them. <br /> <br /> The elderly patriarch, Mr. Liu, is a remnant of China in pre-expansion days. He runs the bathroom house in an old neighborhood. Every single scene in the bath house is a source of evacuation for us and stressed people, unhappy. Even hard-liners can not find any flaws in this wonderful place. <br /> <br /> Er Ming's mentally handicapped son is the second truly powerful character in the film, along with his contemporary brother. The interactions between these three people, and the various visitors to the bath house, are surprisingly detailed and hearty, with some scenes that express a lot of emotion, they transcend almost everything in the movies. <br /> <br /> With its system - critical message, this film was not only censored, but also provided unreasonably small coverage. It may be a coincidence, but when it is hard to find a movie of this kind, even on the Internet (!), You can not help feeling suspicious. <br /> <br /> So, help in the freedom of expression and film world, buy, rent and copy this wonderful movie, if you own a DVD, if there is one, then share share share!
