An additional person is invited to play the role of general in a film about the Russian Revolution. However, it is not any extra ordinary. He is Sergey Alexander, the former commander-in-chief of the Russian armies, who is now forced to revive the scene, in which he suffered a professional and personal tragedy, to please the once-revolutionary director in Russia who was humiliated by Alexander. It may now be the time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. It is a powerful, precise film by Von Sternberg, and offers the greatest paradox in the character of Alexander in every possible way. Jennings earned the Oscars for this role through a very impressive performance, playing his overall role at his peak and in his deepest instruments. Powell offers evil support as the director of revenge-thinking and Brent is ideal in her role with her face and movements that show a lot of expression like the love of Janings. Everywhere shine. Evaluation, 10.
