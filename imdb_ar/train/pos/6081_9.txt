Do not feel dark or tragic more than the film "Othello", and this film plays fairly well, with the outstanding performance of Laurence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fischborn expresses the scenes of Othello's torment because he falls prey to Iago's lies in a very convincing way, so that he provides a realistic epileptic ring. Jacob is a loving and sincere wife who has become either an instrument of revenge for Iago against Othello, or the subject of his anger (neither of which is clearly offered any motivation for Iago's behavior). Although Kenneth Branagh (sp?) Presents his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. Cassio and Emilia characters also roam inside and outside the scenes even though they, like Iago, seem more important to the plot. I did not review the film against the play to see how many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant characters, very well. <br /> <br /> If I have any lines of criticism for the film the story will unfold very quickly, and the relationships between some characters are not more specific. The director had a great team, and no one performed badly. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and the relationship between Emilia and Desdemona needs further development in the early part of the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the film suggests, although you feel this very late in the film. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their pain is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem as though they have just met. On the other hand, maybe just met --- like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short: good shows, very short. <br /> <br />
