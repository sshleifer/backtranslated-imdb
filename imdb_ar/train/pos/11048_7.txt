I did not feel that this film was as smart as I thought it was enjoyed but I enjoyed it though. <br /> <br /> This film is original, although it reminded me of a few other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for coloring, but also for the quality of complaints close to the characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is in a prison cell but do not let this put you in trouble, and it seems that this movie extends beyond many multi-site movies. <br /> <br /> It's always fun, with the "black arts" standing well in the lead and very good characterization which makes some just very believable! <br /> <br /> This is scary to see with some people.
