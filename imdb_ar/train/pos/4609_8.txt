Probably the best film for Jackie Chan in the 1980s, and the film he put on the map. The size of the self-directed police drama is illustrated by the opening and closing scenes, during which the village of Al-Shumayeen and the shopping center are demolished. It is clear that there are differences between original Chinese versions and dubbed versions, where many jokes have failed to reach the latter. The latter is hampered by stars who do not show anything like their Chinese origins. In fact, the only thing that is aimed at dubbing is the court trial? At that time, Hong Kong colonial trials were conducted in English, while the original contained this scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> However, Chan fights fighting style and art of martial arts folk dance humor wherever possible, so do not miss the non-Cantonese masses a lot. After all, it is not dialogue that makes Chan flick, but the action and the effects are painful. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible investigator in Hong Kong chasing the gang godfather (Zhou Yun) and is charged with protecting a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The work is fantastic from start to finish and there is not much time to breathe between them. You will never understand, but what is an entertaining and well-connected film. To say, this is one of the best martial arts movies out there.
