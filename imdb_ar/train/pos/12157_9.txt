1930s. Adele's stylishness (beautifully played by Deppi Reynolds) and Helenie (Frankie) Helen (Shelly Winters, who is the perfect wacko star with her usual historical pain) are two deadly mothers. They leave their hot past in the Midwest and move to Hollywood to start their own dance school for young children. Adele begins dating millionaire Lincoln Palmer (Dennis Weaver always). On the other hand, Helen religious fanaticism soon plunged into despair and malice. <br /> <br /> The film "Night Tide" and "Ruby" Harrington, works through a brilliant text by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book based on the film "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" and co-scripted the film "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte "), he skillfully creates a self-confounding horror film about the guilt, fear, repression and religious zeal. The earth is corrupt. Michael McMuller is a well-behaved teacher, Agnes Morehead, as a stern radio and fire engineer, Evit Vickers, a vulgar and gentle mother of a wavy childhood star. Detective Snoopy, and Timothy Curry as a creepy bom. A collection of beautifully illustrated tales with Pamilian Perdine (Lucy's voice in "Peanuts"), which serves as a victim and original "Friday 13th", Robbie Morgan performs the villainous "Mei West". Highlight. The terrifying David Raskin, a wonderful scene with Reynolds performing stunning tango dancing in a lavish restaurant, the atmosphere of the delicious Depression, the lucrative Lucian Ballard film, and especially the stunning flavors of the money are all excellent and effective. MGM delivers this exquisite jewel on a stylish double DVD with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?". Both images are presented in clear and wide transitions along with theatrical trailers.
