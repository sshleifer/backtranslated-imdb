The cinematic version of Alice Walker's highly emotional and influential 1983 novel (largely written as messages from the central character Seale to God) was a tremendous Oscar success, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> In the role of the victim, Sally woke up, giving Wobi Goldberg her best screen performance in miles. She was not behind Oprah Winfrey as Sophia, the fireman promoted by fate. The others in the team are waving the characters Walker has given clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, the abusive husband of Seely; Margaret Avery as Shug, The Power of Change for Good; Willard Bog and Ray Don Chung as Harpo and Skwick; Susan Boubyan as Corrine, The wife of the preacher; and Carl Anderson, who was missed by many (known as Judas in the film Jesus Christ the Star in 1973) as Samuel's preacher. <br /> <br /> A beautiful pace, written in an allergy, the "purple color" fairifies the source during the opening of the story to engage the viewers of the long drama.
