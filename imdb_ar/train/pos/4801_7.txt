I saw this with my entire family at the age of nine in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father noting that "this is what can happen - Adam and Eve." I remember the scene clearly when Adam found Eve, her eyes were black. I asked my father why she was blindfolded and told her that she was tired and hungry. After seeing this episode 45 years ago, I still remember it vividly - TV goes back and forth with the original planet, and the bombshells shaking the headquarters, with the last scene of the two going out, Adam carrying his pack and a follower. It may not be a theater work, but it certainly left an impression on me all these years.
