It's a great movie for anyone who loves motion pictures in Hong Kong. Apart from a small plot, weak drama and alien pieces of comedy, the film is action-packed with fighting firearms and martial arts. He kept me from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was fantastic in the film. <br /> <br /> Having a director like Corey Yuen makes Hong Kong strong. This movie is highly recommended modern work!
