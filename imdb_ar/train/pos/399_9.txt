This movie is very cool if you love Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love this. This film is "Asian Lord of the Rings": a high fantasy story, based on the actual Chinese mythology. (I realized that many critics described this film as less graphic, and I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese legends). This film is still very difficult to find in the United States, although it has been purchased for distribution in the United States with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Well worth the search !!! This DVD is also worth owning.
