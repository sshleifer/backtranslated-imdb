The film is designed to influence the audience and this film left me speechless. He was beautifully photographed and worked well with a dialogue that deals with film poetry involving lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. He was weaving an intense network that left me unable to take my eyes out of the screen until the credits were closed. The story is sweeping. The audience takes from the horrors of the Spanish Civil War to the human wreckage that has left it behind. Roger Casamagor and Bruno Bertazzoni are two young actors leading the screen. The supporting players are well supported and provide a genuine sense of originality. Groups, lighting, landscaping and cinematography are fantastic. I love photography.
