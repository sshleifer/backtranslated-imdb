I've been a fan of Judy Foster since we were small years ago Disney. I liked her queer weirdness in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> Foxes was a big break from all this. <br /> <br /> Where other young actresses of that era turned into a childish sex disguised as a comedy ("Darlings Little", anyone?), Judy went to a depressing and tragic story of teenagers dragging them to their demise because of the strong attraction of Seduction and Addiction. <br /> <br /> This was not Disney. This was not Bourke. This was not a "halloweed". This was a dark and powerful story to destroy the lives of young people. Sadly it's a story that is still being shown on a daily basis all over the country, and this movie can be re-played (with current audio tracks) and still quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever created, it's tired in some parts, and not all shows are particularly great. But Judy Foster continued to show her footage as a real actress for adults (this trend began when she was very small in a taxi driver). <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Burke
