This is an excellent example of what can be done in a small budget movie. Excellent acting given the script and the whole atmosphere of the film is very alarming. Gore is well done and used very little (look for the death of excellent barbed wire) and the procedure is difficult to use. True, there are sometimes dodgy lines in the script, but compared to other movies on the same budget (or bigger!), It's hardly noticeable at all. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it seems! 10/08
