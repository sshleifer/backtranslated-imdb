Perhaps the best achievement of Bigas Luna is to strike a delicate balance between the sense of corruption and sexual and surreal excitement. The delicious Mathilda May, who spent most of Life's Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buff, is the subject of Bill Duran's passion for adolescence. He can not get May's breasts out of his mind and wants to breastfeed them and breastfeed his mother too. His quest for May is the film. As in Luna's works such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!" , The director brings a slightly distorted sexual feeling to his beautiful, alien tale. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this disturbing erotic poem of the female breast. Photos of Jose Luis Alcin are wonderful and Nicola Biofani's recordings are sweet and rich. Great cinematic delights with a delightful messy feeling that the Spaniards do it naturally.
