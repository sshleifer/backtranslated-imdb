The narration confirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of brother-brother conflict. The main character, Lynn McAdam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who is led by Steven McNally's Henry Brown, symbolizes the classic theater coach who steals out of Western law and has been chased by his brother to kill his father. The world in which the story takes place is the stunning classic West where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their weapons as soon as they enter the city, and the man responsible for maintaining this law and order is the classic Western. Attorney White Erb. <br /> <br /> There are also flat figures like Westerners, such as the deadly Indian warrior, the captured cavalry cavalry, and the bonnet girl in distress. <br /> <br /> Another important original model in this movie, which gives the name of the movie, is a dedicated gun from Winchester. The weapon can be seen as a symbol of the rewards given to those who do things with honor. Once stolen from their rightful owner, they bring tragedy to everyone in contact with her. In this sense, he resembles other symbols such as the Holy Grail in the Raiders of the lost ship, and the blood-stained character in saving the soldier Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is usually absent from the West, an unknown type of themes and inner symbols. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a revenge film, he shares this element with several other examples of this genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> There is also an implied theme of rape in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Deane, one of the villains in the film that Dan Doria played with great efficiency, kidnaps a woman after her husband was killed. Playing with the mobile couple, the cowboy sends him cartoon drawings of a cat to give birth to an insect before he bites his head. Waco Johnny Dean will eventually get what he will get after his connection to the ill-fated Winchester. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 reminds us of Jason's mythical story and his quest for golden wool, as reported in Apollonius' Argonautica. Both stories deal with the acquisition of something sacred that possesses some kind of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stuart's character moves from one adventure to another in search of a unique prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 is like a mythical story that is a conflict between brothers. Many ancient stories deal with this issue, such as the story of the Hebrew Bible "Cain" and "Abel", and the story "Romulus" and "Remus". <br /> <br /> As for the subject of kidnapping and rape in Anthony Mann, he is present in many legendary works, such as the rape of Europe, as Ovid recounted in his book Transformations. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a great example of the Western genre and serves as an objective interrelator of many Western and ancient American mythological themes.
