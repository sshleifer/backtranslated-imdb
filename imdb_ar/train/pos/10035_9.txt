I think James Cameron may become my favorite director because this is my second assessment of his films. Anyway, everyone remembers the Titanic RMS. It was great, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. Everything on the news was one of the biggest tragedies of all. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie of him, but a star of two fictional characters would be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, in the main review, but let me remind you that this is all a reality, and the only truth that will exist is an event from the film. <br /> <br /> So our main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They're not too annoying, but they've seen this and you'll find out why they can become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I think is bad fortune, fate, the hand of God (not meant blasphemy), or just a skeleton dog (Billy Zein). Combine all of the above and what do you get ?! Yes sure! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are: My favorite character, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber), Loverjoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ioan Stuart), Laitoler (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill) Bates), and many more. We've also got a treasure hunter at the moment, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The work here is wonderful, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end, your eyes can fall rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and working. The treasure hunter searches for the heart of the ocean and finds a fee for a woman wearing the diamond. She calls and tells her tale on Titanic RMS. Two lovers separated by social class, and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works, and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, 86% fabulous
