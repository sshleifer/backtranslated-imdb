This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and best movie of 1994. David Dhawan is doing a great job in directing this film, it makes it funny and adds a family drama. Govinda is excellent like Raja Babu and gives a wonderful performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this film is less disturbing but still annoying in some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro in acting and gives a wonderful performance. Our Iranian Aruna is wonderful as a mother and offers a wonderful performance. Shakti Kapoor is as wonderful as Nand Sidekick. This film features a comedy, action, a complete family drama and romance on the artist.
