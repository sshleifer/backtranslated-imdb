I may be very generous with rating ... but I love this movie! I have seen her several times, but every time I see her, I live her again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing huge or a memorial happening. But I am a great romantic and this film is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is very funny. The scientists made me laugh a lot ... I definitely recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. It's a clean and good movie - and this is very rare now! My 20 year old brother loves this movie too, so it's not just a flick. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you are lonely and need to watch * love story, if you can not participate in one. It's good 'un!
