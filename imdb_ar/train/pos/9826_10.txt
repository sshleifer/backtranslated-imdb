This exciting thrill of low budget and containing some good points, but a lot more bad. The plot revolves around a lawyer trying to evict her lover accused of killing his wife. Being a weak film, she has to go secretly to a sex club and have sex with potential suspects. As conspiracies go for this type of genre, not for bad. The script is okay, and the story is logical enough for someone at 2 am to see this noticing much of the plot holes. But everything else in the film seems cheap. The main actors are not that bad, but all their supporters are incredibly bad (one girl looks like she's drunk and / or high). The film industry is badly lit, as everything seems to be loved and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can not hear what people are saying. The worst thing about this movie is why you see sex. The reason why people watch these things is hot sex scenes that expose hot girls already in the positions of Red Shoe Diary. Sex scenes are not hot, they are flimsy, filmed on this pornographic scene where everything is just a master shot of two people going to it. Women also seem to be shelters from exchanges of fire. I do not try to be rude or concerned here, but they all have breasts and a burning look. Even the title, "Deviant Obsession", looks like a gross click. I do not have anything against pornography - in fact I love it. But I want to have a nucleus and a separate nucleus. What happened to actors like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Warey and Kim Dawson? Women who can act and who will excite you perfectly? And what happened to exciting erotic B such as Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Sure, none of these masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. In addition, they were pushing the envelope, overtaking Hollywood's relatively rude stance on sex, sexual obsession and deviations. Now they are making hardcore movies without hard sex.
