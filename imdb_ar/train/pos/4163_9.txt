I saw this as a child in the late 1980s, and I must say, Galaxy Express is one of those movies that hold your imagination for a long time. If you never understand the anime's attraction, the discovery of this movie may be your golden ticket to Otaku City. <br /> <br /> The story is sensitive and poetic like Ridley Scott Blade Runner. The animation of the cells, though somewhat traditional, is vividly depicted as an explosive form of Leiji Matsumoto's brilliant talent for character design and visual storytelling. The "Wizard of Oz" goes beyond the "family entertainment" mode perfectly and appears as a classic movie on its terms. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie.
