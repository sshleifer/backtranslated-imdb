I rented the movie (I do not think it got a theatrical show here) I expect the worst. The movie previews looked awful. I was actually very surprised, was worth watching; it was loosely written, like a piece of film set almost. There were some very funny moments, although the flaws are effective spelling in the presentation and the people present in the show without being subjected to extreme exposure. It is fundamentally flawed by the horrifying soundtrack of comedies, but in general it appears clearly and generally in the form of an altmanesque or Larry Sanders presentation. The moment that fashion is criticized by Jerry Springer, it is also an easy goal. Springer could have made "Citizen City" and would be declared "the worst film ever". I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. A flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film.
