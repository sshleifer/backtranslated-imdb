Gung Ho is one of those movies that you want to watch over and over again. Michael Keaton was assigned to bring his attention to a Japanese car company to come to his hometown, thus creating jobs for Hadville residents. What happens next is a hilarious moment after another. The two cultures collide and it depends on the ketone to tie things together. Find great deals from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All cast completely. Do not be fooled by low numbering. This is 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of Hadleyville was also used in the High Noon area. Yes, there is real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
