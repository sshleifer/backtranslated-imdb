About thirty years ago, the author Noma Sadol published a lengthy interview with Belgian comic book writer George Remy (known as Herge, creator of Tintin). This film follows Sadul today as he remembers the interview, listening to cassettes (Matt Herge in 1983) and seeing some old pictures and the same man's footage. Some parts of the interview were not published at Herge's request, and we now know that she was dealing with his separation from his wife after having an affair with one of his collaborators (who later became his second wife). The interesting thing that the film does not handle well is the transformation in Tintin's books of right-wing and early imperial books (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in Soviet territory) to some anti-imperialist books after a few years Blue Lotus). On the whole, I came out of this movie to know some other things about Herge and see him a bit more undesirable than the time I came to the theater.
