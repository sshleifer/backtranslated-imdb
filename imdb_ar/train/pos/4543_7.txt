Well no, I'm saying a lie, it's really not the best movie of all time, but it's a really fun movie I never knew before. <br /> <br /> It's a policeman's movie a friend starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with some wrong stories about a missing car model or something, but that does not matter. The reason why this movie is fun is the interaction between the two lists, which initially hate and hate each other but in a sudden twist of fate that ends up becoming friends. Something quite different is being accomplished. It is very interesting to see, it is quite ridiculous, but in a fun and pleasant way. The soundtrack is fantastic, and again in the 1980s, they fit the film, I try to find one of the songs through the ages, but I work from memory what I think few words I could not find. <br /> <br /> There is something else in this movie that is the most magnificent of any film ever, but I will not give it away, oh no! In conclusion, I will be attending this film for more than 48 hours \ most directed by Eddie Murphys, including Beverly Hills cop, whatever your friend's name is Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence. If you're looking for a cop movie friend and you're fed up with "straight white cop meets black cop in the street" give him this chance. You may be pleasantly surprised that this turns the whole formula upside down with "a straight Japanese policeman meets a white policeman in the direction of the street." <br /> <br /> I give this number 7. To be honest I love it more than that. I would rather watch this than many of the things I will give 8. But I think I know deep down that it's a kind of madness that makes me like this movie.
