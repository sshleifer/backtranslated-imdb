I can honestly say that I did not expect this film to be good. I do not like family movies. I am far from my admirers Shahid Kapoor. The last movie by the director (MPKDH) was totally stupid, the music was very boring and nice, but there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Min Hoon Na, and there were also Sima Biswas, Ook Nath and Anupam Khair. We have been brought to the young MPK lovers with the pinch of the HAHK wedding and we have a winner. "The storyline is similar to the story of HAHK, which was initially light to the serious situation in the end, The thing I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were very curious. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with her performance. Well, this is a great improvement, and most importantly it fits the role, and the best is Amrita Rao, in fact, this is her best performance, since her presence on the screen is very exciting, you must love her performance, Sameer Sonny, Amrotha Prakash, Anne Upam Well, Alok Nath and Sima Biswas are superbly represented, there is not one actor who feels misplaced. <br /> <br /> The songs were very disappointing but they would look better after watching them. Ada Adhura Hai is also nice to watch. The songs are not colorful and dance, they are more like stories. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, which should remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what is the drawback in the film? The film becomes very slow, stretching the finish completely. But the film is still going well, making it a perfect family movie.
