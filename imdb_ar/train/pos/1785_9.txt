If you can not enjoy a chick click, stop now. However, if you enjoy movies that show complex characters and provide exceptional representation, read. <br /> <br /> Anne Grant Lourdes dies. Her two daughters arrive beside her bed. Ann begins to talk about people from her past and do not know girls, and they wonder whether this lost knowledge is real or imagined. They realized that these people from their mother's past are really real. <br /> <br /> The story goes mainly between 1953 and about 2000, with some features in Anne's life between those years. In 1953, Anne met her life's love and experienced the greatest tragedy in her life. <br /> <br /> Laila, one of the best friends of her family from college, married Leila. My best friend is Laila's brother, friends. Laila and Bode are the rich family of Newport, while Ann is a singer in a nightclub in Greenwich and wants to be a free spirit but still bound by many of those 1950s conferences. <br /> <br /> Soon after Anne arrived to be the maid of honor at the Layla wedding, she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the three lives - Harris. He is the eldest son of a former family servant who grew up with Laila and Bodhi and went on to become a doctor in the small town of New England. Anne immediately became fascinated by Harris, which adds to the complexity of the fact that Leila has always loved Harris and still remains. Friends, too, were in love with Harris, but in 1953, he redirected this homosexuality to Harris to his close friend, because he could not admit to himself that he had a sexual desire for another man. Bodhi appears to be viscerally frustrated by being the wicked, alcohol-wielding son of the son - which has greatly angered his parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all these things that have been expressed and repression lead emotions to tragedy - after all this flick the chick. <br /> <br /> At this time, Ann's daughters are far from their mother and have a perception and suspicion in their lives. Constance works on emotional exhaustion in an effort to maintain her role as a perfect mother and wife. Nina, having always felt inferior, can not maintain the relationship. <br /> <br /> Move all these relationships to fifty years, and you will get a great look at society and its values ​​and effects on the characters. And the actions of the persons involved. <br /> <br /> All acting in the evening is excellent, but there are some unusual shows and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this film very special, very distinctive. <br /> <br /> Claire Dance plays the role of Anne in the 1950s, doing so in a way that clearly shows a smart woman in those times that contradict what she is supposed to do for what she wants to do. Its performance is not easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays the role of Ann, who has died and her mind has turned from present to past into imaginative journeys. Of course, Redgrave attracts all this in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - the real daughter of Ridgeberg - plays Anne's daughter, Constance, in the film. The scenes between this real mother and her daughter, who plays the role of the mother and her imaginary daughter, are an insight into the spectacle. <br /> <br /> Tony Collett plays the role of Anne's other daughter Nina. Nina spends much of her time feeling depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting down the good man he loves as well as her mother and sister. Collett is perfect for such a part, but I have never seen her make a bad or unbelievable performance regardless of the part she plays. <br /> <br /> Mami Gomer plays Layla in the 1950s and shows us a more conflicted woman than her expected role in life from her good friend Anne. It's very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gumer's mother - is currently playing Lily. What can be said of Meryl Streep as it always offers a decent and rewarding performance. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai said in DVD extras that he sought Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress who could think of running a single scene in the film. He was certainly right, and Claus's performance in that scene paves it in your mind. All other scenes where Close is the right night or night, and you can get another show to value it. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the movie, in addition to the scenes that have been closed above, which make the whole movie worth watching. On the day of Layla's wedding, Anne comes to her room and crawls to bed with her friend to discuss Laila's doubts about her upcoming marriage to a man she does not clearly love. This scene is repeated 50 years later when Leila comes and crawls to bed with her late girlfriend Anne to talk about the life they lived. In this last scene, Streep and Redgrave appear to be delighted. <br /> <br /> Another unforgettable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy announces his love for Ann. Hugh Dansy gives us the role of bodie in a depressing performance of a young man torn apart by his sexual feelings. His performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Chick the flick? Yes really. A very special movie with incredible acting, directing, and landscape? definitely. I can not recommend much evening.
