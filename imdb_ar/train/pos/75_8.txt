Vincent Price's wonderful film has many wonderful horror films, some of which are among the greatest gemstones in history. Brice's greatest achievement was undoubtedly his films in the 1960s, with films such as Robert Bowman's Fantastic Power Cycle (still the greatest horror of all), Michael Reeves (1968) or The Last Man by Obaldo Ragona (1964) on the occasion of the most important features of this wonderful man The films that made the man famous and then made him the icon of eternal horror, dating back to the fifties of the last century, with the emergence of "House of Wax" (1953) in his rise to stardom. Magician "plot of 1954 is very similar to the plot of her successful predecessor.However, this does not mean that this film is not a terrifying and dazzling gem Vincent Bryce is my favorite actor, and although I personally will not allow myself to miss anything the man has, none of my fellow fans of the man might miss this little gem. He is a master magician and inventor of magic devices, where his boss, a shrewd businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor) from him when the president takes one of Gallico's creative inventions and gives it to his rival, The Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico settles, and begins a deadly spree of revenge ... <br /> <br /> No We love Vincent Price When you go out for revenge? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973) were about the absurd and wonderful revenge killings, and this previous film in his horror journey is another proof that no one avenges as Vincent does Price. This film offers a fantastic role for Price, which, as always, offers great performance, and ensures 70 minutes of horrific entertainment and horrifying fun for all Horror fans. Another must see for my fans fans price.
