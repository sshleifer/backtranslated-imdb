This movie may have dubious proportions because it was produced for television, but it is one of the best films I've ever seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It's sweeping, fascinating, and will fully absorb you. The story of a killer chase in Russia will be the iron curtain by people willing to risk their professional lives in an attempt to save the lives of future victims a compelling story if they are fictional - but they are actually a true story. I strongly recommend it.
