When I went to watch The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I heard about, I was impressed by many other Stanley Kubrick's work, but when I started watching it, it was much better than I thought it would be. Sometimes I was ridiculously overly worried and could not take my eyes off the screen and there was still something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people do not like the Kubrick version of The Shining because it does not fully follow the book Stephen King, but in my opinion, both Kubrick, the mini-series and the book are all fantastic. Jack Nicholson offers great performance. They are looking for a good original film that will keep you thinking even after the movies, then watch The Shining.
