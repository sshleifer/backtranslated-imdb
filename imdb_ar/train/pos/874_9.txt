This movie only draws you to the main character. I popped into my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone the reviews) and was intrigued for two solid hours. Two ships from two different worlds collide. Sexual tension that hangs between a secretary and a criminal is almost obvious even without any physical contact barely. In the end, I could not determine which of the things I wanted most: our hero and hero to pull sulfur or simply their passion. RML can do without a strange sub-plot and the traditional 100 minutes was a lot. I'm nitbiking though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local libraries, this movie trumps my faith in the great film industry.
