Began one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history. At the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, the members of the Culture of Love Summer were an old tool for the beads of love and all the night parties and once again evolved into mainstream life, whatever it was. For those who can not grow their youthful abundance and sometimes irrational, the culture of Wonderland has been. The love of drugs and the sense of merit in addition to a hatred of power and values ​​and "institution" is the world that the film captures. <br /> <br /> The 1960s was a time of revolution and a violent change that tore apart the American "House." As soon as the fighting ended, we all had to deal with the aftermath of the massacre. The characters in Wonderland are the good icons of the seventies; the biker part, the hippie part, the crook part, all the outcasts. Not an ideology of expression, just a feeling of dissatisfaction with everything and loyalty is nothing. Ron, Billy, and David fancy as a kind of Robin Hoods with a drug. They talk about love and act violently. They take from the rich and sell to the abuser. They steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and company are the end result of a strange anti-sex collision such as drugs, drugs and rock and roll, when laboratory technicians feel bored and continue to progress. <br /> <br /> The movie is skillfully directed, fast-paced and captures the hectic world of evil drugs in its element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. That story was told in Dance Nights. This is the story of a transitional and forgotten era.
