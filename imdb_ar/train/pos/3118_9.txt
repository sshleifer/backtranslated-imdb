Having not seen the two previous Bourne movies, I was a bit reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience and I did not have to misunderstand what was happening because I did not see the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand, and the Bourne Ultimatum fell in love with it before reaching the break! I do not think I have ever seen a great film and made this film, especially the motion picture. Since I usually refrain from thrills and thrills, this was great news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most interesting movies, it draws your attention from the first second until the last minute before credits start. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was just as wonderful as his Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performance in Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this wonderful actor has one extra to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of his films in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts were elegantly handled - each accomplished brilliantly and shocked by the film's impact. Well done.
