As an evacuation, I saw the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I just saw the musical play this week. This allowed me to judge the film without being contaminated with what was or was not in the play (yet I was deformed when I saw the music) :) <br /> <br /> I think Michael Douglas was doing well in this role, Along with Casey. I think "Let Me Dance For You" is one of the best parts of the film, a worthwhile addition to the music. The dancers excel in singing the film to a great extent, in addition to acting that increases its size at least 10 times (easy to do in the film of course). The trims, lighting, dance, singing are also much better in the film, and this is to be expected and has already been delivered. <br /> <br /> It is better to perform songs that were common with the music in the movie, and the new songs are very good, and the whole movie delivers more of the music in my opinion, especially musical comparison that has a few trims. The only bad point in the film is the obvious differences between the actors who speak and the dubbed singers during singing parts of some characters, but their dancing is flawless, and the final product was more fun than the music
