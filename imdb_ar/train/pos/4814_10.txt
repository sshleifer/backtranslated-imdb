I saw this on the big screen and wrapped it. The younger Queen Victoria is a mystery, and this is an ideal description of how to push a young girl into one of the world's highest roles. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the representation is amazing, the history and attention to detail is outside this world. Emily Blunt is perfect like Victoria. Funny how her mother played by Elizabeth I and William IV played by Prince Albert! (Think of Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This picture shows Victoria that she was once a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would have been shown to Jeremy Kyle Show if she was there: "My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." <br /> <br /> An ideal part of much of the history of Britain and the Commonwealth.
