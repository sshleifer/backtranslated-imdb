I saw this when I was 17 and I have not seen him since. CBS Late Movie is used to show it regularly at one point. I remember how sad and upset he was, making me feel nauseous in my stomach. The effects of permission were not as they are today, however, however, the sense of loneliness in the Amazon was moved, after the parents lost and looking for a very good way out. I remember insects and worms more than others, very realistic they were, eating their flesh. It was a dark film that was controversial at the time, although it was heavily modified for television. I hope to remember more details, and if I have the opportunity to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I think maybe it was introduced on CBS under another title. I have no idea if it was released on the video.
