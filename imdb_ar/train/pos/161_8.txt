This silly film is really fun for young people. Its heroes are two failed investigators led by their positions in some very ridiculous ways. Chase the big murder case, you'll see these investigators go all the way to solve the crime. No nudity, but a lot of sexual effects, absurdity absurdity ... everything teenagers go to. Budget is low, but very entertaining. Sure cult classic potential.
