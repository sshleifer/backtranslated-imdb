This is a good movie, but not recommended if you do not like smart movies. It's about two young people who hope the world will disappear, and that's exactly what they get. The acting was wonderful, the ending was unexpected, and was actually a good story unlike most movies these days. People complain that the film is too simple or too boring. I think they should stick to films like The Toxic Avenger (I really like B movies) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. Note One: If you notice this, this will contain the same representatives of the Cube except for four reps. Make two observations: wait after the credits (trust me in this one). Enjoy the movie.
