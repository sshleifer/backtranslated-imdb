At first glance, it seems who is singing there silly and excellent comedy? With a kind of unusual, quiet and slow movement: What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with singers on a desert landscape, then a bus and a wonderful group of actors, a jewel disguises! <br /> <br /> The folded story, the wrong rhythm prompts you to think, yes it's comedian, but just lets you guess it would be a nice kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny through a hidden, dark moment hidden on others, their evolution surprises you throughout the story? All characters are presented in a smart and intelligent manner, and all characters are important, given by representatives for life. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it is based on deep observation, great workmanship of the camera and has wonderful meanings and in fact everything, the general direction and how the details are also presented, it simply makes you forget it is a movie: like watching a nice human society, you Do not know yet, was filmed by a friend behind the camera. <br /> <br /> You are the person behind him. It's simple, and it's simply exceptional! <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me; this does not mean by any means that the script, image quality, and music score have some kind of amateur, no, no! It's a wonderful art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river? From top to top in the mountain, down to the sea, with all the different earth types and hurricanes that a real river will face on its journey to the sea? From a small thing to a main stream. <br /> <br /> This metaphor is the best I can find to explain all the magic that contains who sings there. For me, again, I take the hammer: simply extraordinary ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the director was the person who had a chat flan / chat Nawar, which I know is famous for quiet ?? But since I have not seen it yet, I had no idea about this respectable man. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote binary comments on this film, and I totally agree! <br /> <br /> Eastern European cinema is not well known because it is rarely translated, but I am lucky to have this ideal model in the original language, with good English translations. All in all: deep, delicious and exceptional ... <br /> <br /> For fast, empty explosive and special effects enthusiasts, avoid it at all costs, it may be accurate and good for you! <br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different types and / or classics, I think you will not regret this type. In case of purchase, you will get a good companion in your personal DVD library, with at least the names Such as Billy Wilder, Loebach, or Sasha Gitri among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** The movie will never be good unless the camera eyes in the head of poet Orson Wells ***
