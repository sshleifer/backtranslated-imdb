This early resume was a lot of fun to watch. The second is on one disk of D.W. The Griffith DVD set for years (highly recommended), featuring three excellent offerings by key customers, is interesting to see Henry B. The idol (the small colon, the birth of a nation) is a concert musician that gives the countess eye (and other things). <br /> <br /> The Countess's husband is amazed at his wife's betrayal and puts her in a small room with her lover. It's incredible that they will not hear the wall mount, but hey, maybe the wine has something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (the father of silent actor Raymond Hackett) is violently roused and this adds to melodrama, but in an unexpected comic way. The best moment comes in the end. As the lady emerges from shock and fear, once she realizes she is doomed, Henry picks up his machines and "admires" them. The way he did it was unexpected and in a rather strange way, and I lost it, and laughed at my head. Expression on the face! Since that moment fascinated by Henry B. An example.
