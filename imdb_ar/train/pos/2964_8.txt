BASEketball is a very funny film that offers a representation that makes the film generally more entertaining, and comics that are more than just crap in your funny clothes, and a very good plot despite the fact that classic dodgers are against the rich villain. The only thing I did not like about BASEketball was that this child was not really necessary in the film, but if the child was not in the film, there would be some funny scenes. If you have read any supportive comments about this movie, exclude them all because all reviewers did not like this movie mainly. Baseketball is a wonderful comedy that gives everyone what they want 8 out of 10.
