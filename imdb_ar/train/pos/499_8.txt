The Enterprise Beta has one thing that has not existed since the original Star Trek: a dose of defective real characters. Next-generation utopia characters were tired, and they were incredibly noble. I also love the subplot that humans commit towards the sage. It is funny to see them as a buzzing snooper. Makes me look forward to seeing when humans become the dominant race between the two, although I do not think it will succeed in the time frame of the show. The only negatives that jumped in my face were the sensation of a "quick cut of the end in two hours" from the end, which is common among many flight shows. The second was the shameless digging of the ratings by two senselessly sensational scenes. It has been misplaced, a good science fiction display must be able to stand on its own without trying to appease the pre-teen audience with some skin. But it is not my duty to make the offer profitable, so OK. <br /> <br /> To see how the next episode works.
