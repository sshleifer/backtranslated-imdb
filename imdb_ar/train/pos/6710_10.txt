Sabrina was one of my best performances in T.V's Life: D I used to watch the episodes again every day when I got home from school. I think so far I have watched each episode at least once and the entire series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the charming girl / girl who has normal teenage problems we can deal with all of them. It's funny, smart, outgoing, intelligent, and much more. Caroline Rhea and the Brouderic House both fit the part well with the Sabrina cousins. Zelda, the smart world, the crazy hilda, the idiot one make a perfect balance in the life of Sabrina. Although I must agree that college years are not as good as high school years, but that does not mean they were not good. I think the finish was wonderful although it was not as I wished, it was logical and loved anyway. :)
