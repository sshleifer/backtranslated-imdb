More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a bigger outlet for their talent. 7:35 De La Manana is an absolute genius. What Nacho can move within 8 minutes requires some hours to output Hollywood movies. I saw this smile, but I felt a little dirty and not sexual. Sitting and wondering how you should feel after watching this 8 minutes. Solid block. I was fun, but I was upset at the same time. Not many people can do it in just 8 minutes. It starts simple enough. A young woman comes for breakfast in her usual place. She sits down and begins to sing. From there, the film takes you through many different emotions at one time is hard to describe. It's black and white, but it helps you feel that the film is giving you. This film makes you want to learn more about the characters, how they reacted before and how the end affected their lives afterwards. I think it's like the old saying, "Let them want more," Nacho Vigalondo is capable of doing so. Watch this when you can. Show them to your friends and wonder how they can be 8 minutes very enjoyable without taking off your clothes.
