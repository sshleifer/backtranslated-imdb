I really enjoyed this movie. (This is what surprised me because it got a low rating from so many users on this site!) I did not say it was a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold Saturday night. It is funny and influential and wonderful tales of ups and downs in female friendships that are going through difficult times and the bad things that girlfriends tend to do with each other! (Ladies, we are all there!) Bill Paterson glows while Rev. Gerald Marsden and Andy McDowell prove that they can be a wonderful actress when the role is correct and keep them in mind. (And really, there's the best "wedding escape" I've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... more courage than anyone I've ever known!) You'll laugh and cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this movie is marketed .... It is a hidden gem that should have done a lot of box office. (Now I must look around to buy a copy!)
