I do not admit he's fond of Oliver! As a small child - it's long, and the story is a bit slow because of all the musical numbers. As a teenager I discovered that the fun of this film is the same experience. Instead of thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a classic story. Adaptation is loose at best, but in fact, if you're watching a track, you're not there for the story. <br /> <br /> Music is the essence of this film, and the overwhelming majority of it is astral and very attractive. Most or all of the actors were involved in the theatrical version of the musical, and this is reflected in their performances - and I consider that an added advantage. All the performances are more "staged" than the old ones, and they are very entertaining. The exception is the child who plays Oliver, whose job seems attractive and avoids the performance of real artists. Oliver Reid is also doing a great job of maintaining a terrifying screen like the Bill Sykes threat. Even a Bulls dog from Sykes offers good performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise them, as well as those who take music seriously. Disrupting the wrong historical details or confusing the exaggerated representation on stage with bad behavior will ruin everyone's pleasure. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that, as a musician, it is loosely organized imagination around the book, not strict adaptation.
