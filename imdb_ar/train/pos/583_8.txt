In a small town in Montana grows two brothers. One of them is Norman (Craig Scheffer) and the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Rev. McLean, and they grow up with his religion-related lessons and fly fishing lessons. In this film, Fly Fishing represents life, a bit. <br /> <br /> The story is good and attracts you, although there are moments when you need a bit of movement. It is possible that the film has these moments because it is not about the events that actually happen, but about the message. Some things happen though. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. Six years later, he returned and got involved with a beautiful girl named Jesse (Emily Lloyd) who is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter". He is famous and seems to have a beautiful life, but he drinks a lot and gambles so much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, has a good result and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing about this film is cinematography. The mountains, forest and river look very beautiful. If the movie is made just for these things, it would be good to see them. Luckily there is more.
