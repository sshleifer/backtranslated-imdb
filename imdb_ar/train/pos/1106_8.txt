If you're a fan of the big Altman band, as seen from major movies like USA, Nashville, Gosford Park, and less-watched movies like A Thousand, you'll undoubtedly enjoy Health. HealtH contains many regular regulars of the last 70s such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, while also featuring top-grossing New Altman stars such as Lauren Bacall, James Garner, and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman films, there are many sub-films in this film, but they are not as overwhelming as films like Nashville or A Wedding, but they have a more center, perhaps like M.A.S.H. Or Gosford Park. The whole thing is a clear satire of the health movement, full of strange and contradictory characters, with guest stars such as Dick Cavett making a brilliant comment on everything. Highlights the pessimism of the Altman process on politics and public appeal, but the most attractive thing in this film is the immense fun that most people seem to enjoy. This will be one of the last Altman movies like this for a while!
