Dark comedy? Hometown humor? How do you make a comedy of murder? The work can be risky because the viewer is obliged to abandon his moral values ​​and laugh at a strange man who kills people. So, the story was rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work. So the response of Pierce Brosnan, the Irish response to 007, is now addicted to smoking, addicted to sex, killing people for a living and facing a life crisis. He meets a struggling businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a difficult start, learns that he needs a friend. But, Greg is happily married to Hobbes and Davis and Brusnan sees in him the basic things he does not have, love, home and life. Add representatives of people, and Philip Baker Hall as manager of the club, and we are racing. Brosnan is very cool and slim as an anti-hero and Kenner is as delightful as his counterpart, a very humanitarian businessman. Hope Davis adds a luster as the very traditional Kinnear wife who fascinated this abandoned man who drifts into his life. The end is exhilarating and with some surprise. The theater must leave feel, at least, partly good - if you are able to hang guilt when you kill people.
