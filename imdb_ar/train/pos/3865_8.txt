Clarke and his fellow railway investigators (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Christine Miller as Jones in the second half) Ranging from mid 1860 to early 1900. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch, and fairly realistic mainly due to the simple charm of Jim Davis in the lead role. He looked like a real Western character. Another observation when Matt Clark arrived in the town after a long journey, actually looked like he was on a long trip to the horse where he was covered with dust. <br /> <br /> West is too early.
