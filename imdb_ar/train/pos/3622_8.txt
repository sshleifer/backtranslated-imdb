I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quid was one of the reasons, but the subject of sticking to your dreams speaks to me. People talk about this as a film for children, but I think it is a film for the babies of children who adapt to aging, the helpless parents, our deaths, and our children grow up and leave us, and all the other things that we did not think will happen to us. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall into the trap of tragedy; it is about what your dreams mean when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quid is too small for the Rami but makes him look good, and Rachel Griffith plays a small role in the role of the wife in a thoughtful and multilayered performance. The camera action is slow and sweet. When they put this film together, they ruled out anything that was not necessary. very nice.
