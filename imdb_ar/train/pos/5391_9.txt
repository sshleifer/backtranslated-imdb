Life begins - and ends - in a typical ward of illness and healing in 1930, where we see 48 hours in the lives of many pregnant women at high risk, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandic (Aunty Em ???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree , And Gloria Chia, waiting to give birth. Although the film shows plot devices seem elusive today when maternity wings are controlled and severely restricted, they give us a backward look at the right time to see how birth was in a typical city hospital in 1932 for our grandmothers and grandchildren. Grandmothers. I found the film to be exceptionally cool and impressive. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young Eric Linden as Good Sutton, Grace's husband (Loretta Young). What a representative! As a father for the first time, Jed is dismayed and uncomfortable with hospital staff who seem to ignore his concerns about his wife because they may scatter crumbs on a cafeteria table. I felt it all very worried. I would like to see more of this actor's work. He had a very passionate voice, which was used for an unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind. In that film, Eric acted as a young soldier who amputated his leg without anesthesia, and cried, "Do not cut! Do not cut!" As Scarlett fled the hospital in a state of terror. Relax! Another fantastic performance is from Allen McMahon, who plays the role of nurse Miss Bowers. Her character is salt of the ground type, a kind of nurse that we all hope to get for our hospital stay, which breaks hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young has done another great job in acting here, a very authentic performance and deeply felt like Grace. She is wonderful in these endeavors, she has really grown to appreciate her more as an actress in the last few months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played her role as an angry unmarried mother just above the top of my head (no one knew again in 1932 that taking a brandy from a bottle of hot water could endanger the health of unborn children?) But her personality eventually recovers. <br /> <br /> Also in the team Gilbert Rowland, a silent film star, was not supported as a sad Italian couple. His screen time was short, but it was remarkable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a necessary introduction, try to catch up with them sometime on traditional Chinese medicine, but remember to bring a little hanky to cry. 9 out of 10.
