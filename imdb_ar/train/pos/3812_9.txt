This is a real eye candy. A world made of floating islands and ancient cities. Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is to throw cathedrals on their opponents ... Who can resist it? An old prophecy, a group of underdogs and a gentle princess looking for her hero ... looks familiar ...? Yes we heard that song before. But you will forget that while looking at the scenic scenery. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch as it continues. But after you leave the cinema, you'll miss a little more story. <br /> <br /> What is behind the 30-year cycle? What drove Fares madness? Who built all these magnificent monuments, castles and cities ... Why collapse? Apart from that a handful of farmers, where are people? Really, this picture looks very interesting, but not the Lord of the Rings.
