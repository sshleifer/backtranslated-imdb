This was exciting for the soul! I am an Iranian and live in the 21st century. I did not know that such great tribes lived in such circumstances in a serious time! <br /> <br /> You see that day, or even in 1925, a woman or baby could have served him or her on one side of the world clean and on demand, but here 80 years ago, People ventured their lives to go somewhere more grass. It is really interesting that these Persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep, but they lose a lot of sheep on their way. <br /> <br /> I commend the Americans who accompanied this tribe, and they were as cruel as the Bakhtiari people.
