David Beckham is a British football star and Victoria Beckham's husband (Spice Girls' Bush Spice). His brand is the goal that bends across the pitch and in the net. The equivalent of a football ball curve is incomparable in baseball. "Bending like Beckham" means making this kind of wonderful footage. Apart from that, a small shrine in his main personal bedroom and a fake veil at the end, the film has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film is full of small football - jokes, like the gift given to her by a parent of characters wearing a T-shirt with 9 on it (King Mia Ham the Great, for those who know), referring to "Posh 'n' Becks "Greeting the video to WUSA is one of the characters playing for a loyal friend (" they have * that * "), lesbian gags, sports gags, etc. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl in England who recognizes Beckham and wants to be a football star. They have a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable ones are the lack of a professional women's association in the UK (hence its fascination with WUSA) and its parents, Indian immigrants hired in very old ways that do not allow girls, among other things, To exercise contact. The girl's family is portrayed as characters of fun, but with great affection - think of my big wedding party in Greece. The girl loves him and respects her enough to penetrate the hell of a sitcom to hide her rising star of football.
