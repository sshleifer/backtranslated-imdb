Keith Moon, the father of Arthur's alcoholic drummer, was named. I found many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this film. Lisa Minelli, who usually outperformed, did a good job at this and was able to flip the cheek at Dudley Moore at every turn. Yes, I agree, Mr John has stolen every scene. It was a very "different" film, allowing the viewer to look at another life. We often try to capture a replay of this movie on satellites. God bless Dudley Moore. This was a fun movie. Lots of spelling and thumb to the rich and wealthy / wealthy. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is beloved.
