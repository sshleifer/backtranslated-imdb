This movie has everything, movement, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music, beautiful girls. This film is an authentic look in Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Lots of oil money, lots of women, lots of gems. Too bad they all disappeared now. The movie is just another boy meets a girl, a boy loses a girl, a boy recovers her, but is recovered by actors and music. There is no movie at all with any better music in this movie, including American Graffiti. It's a movie I've watched over and over and never tired of. Every time I see her, I'm young again, and it's time to get out of the walk. The only reason I gave it only 9 is that you can not categorize a zero movie, do not feel like you should evaluate 10.
