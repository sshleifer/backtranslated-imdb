With regard to my Quarterly Human Sciences Project, I chose to do human trafficking. After doing some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow." It is a convincing story for a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patrick who is trying to save her. The end makes you breathe, and although it is not a happy ending, it is very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really communicate with Holly and Patrick and your heart is separated from her and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what will happen next!
