I've heard some bad things about this movie, and I've probably seen the low score here in IMDb and that's why I was avoiding it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and I had nothing better to do ... As it turned out, I'd have a hard time finding anything better. Vanilla Sky is a scary, sad and touching film, which is actually one of the best films I've seen in a while. I was surprised how impressed I was with him. It's hard to explain, but during the film, your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is happening, it's an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky has really touched me in a very rare way for a movie or any medium for that matter. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone watching this movie. No matter what you heard about him.
