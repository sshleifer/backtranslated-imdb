This picks up about a year after the events in "Basic Instinct". Catherine Trimmel (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a football player while walking in a car traveling at 110 miles per hour (do not ask) starts off the road and ends in the River Thames. She survives - he does not. Police are hiring Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she is mentally competent to appear on trial. It's normal to start playing with his mind instead, tracking lots of murders and sex. <br /> <br /> This film was doomed even before it opened. It took forever to get actors and director, the text problems were fixed and the actors were not happy (Maurice complained of the film often). Still not so bad. Much like the first - there is a fertile musical score, beautiful sites, a lot of sex and nudity (this must be edited against character R), a well wrapped plot and good representation - but there is no effect. It looks like a renovation of the first. People are killed here with a choke handlebar (I think) ... just like the people who were killed in an ice outlet at first. At one moment Cute Stone picks up an ice pick and looks eagerly at it. She also plays mental games with a man and may make him involved in murders. The similarities are very clear. <br /> <br /> This is also very classified - there is a lot of frank sexual talk, male nudity (Morisssey looks nude much better than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks fantastic) and some bloody murders. Good representation in all areas. The stone is gorgeous here Morisi looks miserable but it is fine. Charlotte Rampling and David Thuellis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So - this is not bad at all, but it looks like a new version of the first. I still recommend it. People attacked this only because Stone is not very popular, and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to "Basic ..." after 14 years of making it.
