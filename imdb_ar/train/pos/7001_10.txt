I have never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I have read comments that say this movie stays with you. Yes it is. It has been almost 24 hours and I am still quite impressed. This film left me wondering about myself. How can I compare myself to a character like Ben who is totally selfless. I love this film I love movies that keep me guessing and questioning until the end. I feel two emotions mostly, happiness and sadness. It is a wonderful film and I feel very sad. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end they were forever. If you do not see this movie, get it and see it. Just make sure there are no deviations. You'll want to see every nuance in this picture. One for my library.
