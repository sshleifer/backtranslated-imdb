I was quite surprised to read some comments about this work, honestly. Some people were looking for a conspiracy ??? Well, when this video appeared more than a decade ago, I saw what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It has no plot, no central story. It's a fairly technical selection of mostly long videos, all made in a smart or creative way. Michael Jackson may be obsessed these days, but in any case it was the man who gave us excitement (which many considered the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with Billy Jane and Pete. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him again made music and dance moves to create some lively stuff, including clay, special effects, live performances, and even a self-parody ("Badder"). For those who wonder what Joe Bisky was doing there, this video only appeared before it became a familiar name, and was one of the most unforgettable manifestations of the film. And, IMHO, I think the criminal plot is more than anything Michael Jackson did to this point!
