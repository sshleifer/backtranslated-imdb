My father was the prison guard (retired now) who appeared in this documentary and grew up around prison life, so my views may be quite different from anyone else watching this film. I will say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are great artists and better people. They were brave enough to (a) attend and tell this story, b) enter into the minds and hearts of these inmates, and C) do all this responsibly. Responsible for their art and, most importantly, responsible for the prisoners and staff at the Luther Lucite Correctional Complex. They should be commended without end to this work. It will not take 170 hours, yes an hour, of footage and be able to reduce its size to 93 minutes of installation, which is unusual and very respectful. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie under very few conditions, so they were able to see it. I was checking the guest. I was in the same room with these guys as they watched their hearts flow on the screen. I saw men crying on television shouting at the chair in front of me and let me tell you, it was a very deep experience. These men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases, but they have found ways to try to recover themselves, even if they consider themselves irreparable. How many of us have the courage to do so? How many people can do what they did in such a harsh environment? Their vision of interacting with the film was an experience I am grateful for forever, and I will never forget it. I thank the men who have allowed me this glimpse in their lives, and thank my parents for making all this possible, and thank Philomath for taking the time to pour their blood, sweat, spirit and tears into this project. <br /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about the life of the prison, and the prisoners in it. "Oz" is not real, TV is not real. "Shakespeare behind bars" is.
