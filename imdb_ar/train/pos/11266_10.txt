I have seen this recently, but when I started I had no idea what the concept was, what the subject was ... in short - I had no idea what it was. It was a documentary, it was a routine comedy ..... well, it was both. <br /> <br /> It was a little slow, but I think that's because I have absolutely no idea what kind of program I'm watching. But she soon absorbed me. The episode I saw was Robert Wohl discussing reality and fiction in history. Mainly how we learn (the Americans) the really wrong history - and how we learned what we did. He did it in such a way that the viewer was completely entertained and interested. I've already learned some things and this is a real indicator of the effectiveness of this type of program. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this taken as a series of HBO. I think it can be fun and effective with a variety of subjects - especially if it is "taught" in the same kind of way as this episode.
