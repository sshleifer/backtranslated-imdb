These guys are just the usual suspects! It's a whole bunch of anomalies you want to see and it's going to go unpunished, but it's so miserable that there's very little chance of it. There is no one better than William H. Messi shooting a guy with a big heart but down in his luck, this may be his best performance since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played the perfect boxer to reach perfection, and the rest of the gang was also uniformly good. His role was a veil. The scene of theft was finally a joy. <br /> <br /> The trend was also by the Rosso brothers. There were definitely Queen brothers feeling the movie all the time and it would be interesting to know how they would develop their careers. They have a long way to go with Coin but this is an excellent start and I'm looking forward to the next stroll. ....... "Yo Mutha whore"!
