I could not believe the comments made about the film. <br /> <br /> While reading the awful reviews about the movie, I was really wondering if you had already watched the same movie you saw. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! I think the actresses and the director did a great job in the film. <br /> <br /> It was not a pleasure to see any of the actress in the past and I could not have been more setback by the amazing task they did. Should I say that it is the most faithful film I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna's choice of the drug to try to commit suicide, from the comments that made you look as if she were choosing actresses and her stupid choice. I do not understand, it's a film written by someone else and directed by someone else, so how can it be wrong with actresses I can not see. I think it was a real, believable film that I see again and recommend. Opinions are what they are and so bad that many people closely. I hope to see any of the actors soon, I think they all played wonderful roles. <br /> <br /> Phillips will be busy being the highest paid actress one day and I hope you will laugh in the face of everyone who has criticized her! You go girl!
