For the first film in a suggested series, it achieves the right balance. This is done in a manner and manner that shows the first days of Moody's as a refugee and the beginning of her rise to power in the criminal world. I think it is a true and true portrayal of her character just as writer Peter O'Donnell wanted. Alexandra Staden as one of the amazingly beautiful humility and excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as the difficult survivor with a cold / intelligent / innocent exterior. The full marks on Tarantino to choose an unknown actress for this role - more ratifying to have a new face creates part. I am looking forward to the next film.
