In 1990 Brad Pitt and Joylet Lewis had a very small television of death, both playing the same kind of parts they did in California. I have no doubt that this is what led to their representation in this big screen movie. <br /> <br /> California has found ambitious author David Duchovny and his girlfriend, technical photographer Michelle Forbes, a rocky relationship of some kind because of Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting into the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has got an unusual Odyssey, wants to go across the country and visit the sites of assassins famous serials. But he and Forbes are constantly broken. <br /> <br /> Destiny intervenes in ways more than financial as Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis arrive at a pair of exotic southern species that agree to divide the cost of gas in this cross country. short trip. It turns out that Pitt is a serial killer and decides to do a little research on his own, and digs into the mind of someone intrigued by morality. <br /> <br /> California is not the type of film I usually use, but in reality, Brad Pitt's charisma and charisma makes him work to a great extent. The House is a definition of walking for the gothic refuge of the gatherer. But the best of it is Juliette Lewis who again plays these kinds of low self-esteem which seems to be doing well. She saw her scene with Forbes describing her hair and describing her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialogue and Forbes's reactions must appear in the acting classes throughout the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their slashes, they do not come better than California.
