I recently saw Caprica again and thought I might come and write a review! I saw this first after I saw the final Battlestar Galactica series (being a big fan of drooling for the show left me holding on to everything I could from the show world) so I did not know what I was expecting ... but I came out with a smile although I have to admit ... < /> <br /> The story begins very much on Caprica and we present with a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give much away, but there is a dramatic event dictating the course of the story, but I suggest you see this. <br /> <br /> I must say ... Esai Morales is one of the hell of the actor who snatched the young Joseph Adama. (The father of the Admiral at Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting position and I can believe that he is the father of William Adama of PSG ... <br /> <br /> Eric Stolts also fits his role precisely. ..! Special note it was good to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Do not sit and watch Caprica with the expectation that they will be like Battlestar Galactica because the story line is straight forward and anyone can see it .. without having to see BSG!. <br /> <br /> This demo is a well written drama for those who love there drama with a little science fiction kick!
