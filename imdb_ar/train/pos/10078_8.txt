It's a story that can really happen anywhere, given the right circumstances. The street artist attracts the attention of the famous opera star and the friendship that followed. The old artist finds / buys a male child to pass his art to. From there, we follow them through the harshness of their hard, but free life along the river. Traveling from one city to another, he leads and has a degree of fame. Despite times and influences, the man is gentle and gentle. <br /> <br /> In general, the shows are top notch, especially Xu Zou, which depicts the street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and forcefully honest, and defies well-known prejudices. The invalidity, along with the help of the support of the kind opera singer, Master Liang (Zhao Zhigang Changang impressive impressive), draw a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some mention the similarities of this remote film with BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); however, this film can not easily stand on its own, a distant similarity at best. <br /> <br /> My only country betting on the king of masks is the end. He was weak, clumsy and clumsy, like a heavy hammer. The audience is already closed in the story, what is unnecessary manipulation? what a shame. To make such a wonderful animation, just surrender to a passionate illness (and inclination) like this. Frankly make this movie a good, rather than a classic movie, it should have been so. Aside, the king of masks is still worth your time. I was happy to see Shaw Brothers still producing good films. Highly recommended.
