The latest review of this band was compared to the intersection between Monty Python and Twin Pix, also appropriately. Another review was made showing the differences between the comedy we enjoy in black and non-cash comedy, and it deserves attention. <br /> <br /> See all, the three series. In the end, all the characters are connected and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place as well as the novel by Douglas Adams. Details and complications are amazing. Completely postmodern. Funny, wicked, and dramatically tragic. Not for children. Not for those who suffer from thin skins or who lack objectivity. Thought-provoking. Simultaneously literal, metaphorical, and surreal in disturbing ways. The darkest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> Probably the most wonderful thing I'll ever see.
