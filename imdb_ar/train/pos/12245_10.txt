This is the best Emma in existence in my opinion. After looking at the other version (1996) which is also good, and reading the book, I think I can confidently say that this is the real interpretation and is the most faithful to the masterpiece of Jane Austen. 1996 film with G. Paltrow is very good, it's just a completely different story. It is very light and thin, you do not see the dark edges of the characters, and if you just want to get a nice movie, it will be good but the complexities of some plot points, such as the Churchill / Fairfax intertwined, are almost non-existent. But if you want the characters to be reflected a little, more realistic and multi-dimensional, the TV version of 1996 is the best. Emma is a wonderful person, but she is flawed. Kate Beckinsell is adept at showing small quirks of personality. She seems to be incidentally disgusted in some of Harriet Smith's most simple conversation, yet she does not show any regrets because she destroyed Harriet's proposal so that this action would have the effect of destroying her marital happiness in the end. She sees her narcissism and reflects the image of Frank Churchill in that she will hurt others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​she played the role of Christmas maker and had a new girlfriend after she suffered the loss of her nanny. For Frank Churchill, he believes in the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others badly to keep the secret. In the book, you realize all this in an overwhelming awakening to all the mistakes you have made. Both Kate Beckinsell and Geneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse but are more childish and stagnant while the Bikensil awakening is real and somewhat dangerous and sees the transition from selfish, childlike behavior to a thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good but I prefer this.
