Lost is the best TV series there. First, he has wonderful actors and a wonderful steering. Writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons writing was unusual but after Season 3 writing became very complex. For example, who is Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? What is fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Albert? Many people believe that writers are lost and that they have raised many questions and puzzles that they can not explain. I think these people are wrong. I have confidence in the book. I think that if the puzzles are revealed from now the magic of the series will disappear. However, the loss is undoubtedly the largest television series and will last for a long time.
