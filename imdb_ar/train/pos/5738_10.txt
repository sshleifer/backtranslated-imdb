I just bought and watched the DVD for this movie. The transfer of DVD is from last year, 2001. This 1988 film is really a wonderful little movie. Most people have overlooked it. I saw him in the theater in 1988 and I loved him ever since. I love the opening shot of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). Makes Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! I must say, the Pitts tour on the garbage truck with Nicky is very breathtaking and interesting views! Tom Holsey, as everyone has said, offers a wonderful and wonderful performance. The DVD is a good quote, no extras, but a wide format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
