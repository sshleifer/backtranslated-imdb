Just remember something else about Jim's gentleman. I agree with all the ratings that make this one of the greatest matches of Errol Flynn in his brilliant career. I think that the role played by boxer Jim Corbett looks more like his real character than the hunters he pictured. Flynn looked like a celebratory animal of his memoirs and a man was his real life more exciting than his life on the screen. The additional thing I would like to mention is the observation of great montages, transitions, and still being included in the film. Although the director was Raul Walsh, a frequent collaborator with Flynn, with cinematographer Syed Hickox, the montage was made by an upcoming editor named Don Seagull. I did not know Siegel went so far but he was included in the credits list. He will go to a brilliant career as a director of the same movement.
