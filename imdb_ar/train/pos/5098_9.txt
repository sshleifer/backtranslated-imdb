So that Shirley fans may be surprised by "now and forever". Filmed with Paramount Studios ?? Not with Shirley's parent company Twentieth Century Fox ?? In 1934, before producer Darrell Zanook produced Fox's successful version of Shirley (the nice songs, her cold hearts melt, and her young couples to play Cupid, Happy Ends). Thus "now and forever" fall into the Shirley car category without Shirley's standard story. It's an embarrassing location for any film, but this impressive talented actor makes it a success. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star as beloved and irresponsible artists Jerry and Tony Dye. The only thing that dislikes this faithful couple after a dysfunction is that he seems to hate more than being together. When suddenly landed with custody of small daughter Jerry Penny (Shirley Temple), who is Tony? Not Benny, as many believe? Who convinces Jerry to abandon his criminal career. But Jerry collapses in his office, desperate to prove he can support his new family, and soon returns to theft and dishonesty. In a standard Shirley, Penny tries to melt the heart of the cruel Curmudgeon Felix Evans, a victim of one of Jerry's cons, but her attempt fails, because Evans turns out to be a cheating artist, joking Jerry by helping him steal jewelry. The drama, the gunfights, the death and the sadness that followed make this film an unusual film for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dancing, and there is only one song (The World Owes Me a Living). <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever". Instead, the difference from the usual Shirley story makes it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films. But beware: you should avoid the color version of this movie, and see it in black and white if possible. The color is bright, delightful, and unreal, and in many scenes, the famous curls of Shirley are red instead of blonde. Yikes!
