I saw "hatred" yesterday, Wow ... I was really scared, something good. I love horror movies, and I really liked this movie. There was a lot of "snap" scenes (what is the English word?) That prompted you to jump in your seat. Although the loud screams of the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most frightening scene was ... on the bus, when the face flickered from the window, or when Yoko walked without her chin. Make-up is also very good. Sometimes you can see that it was already there, but it still adds an awful look to the scene. The boy was really very good, very nice without makeup and terribly scary. The next time I hear a loud noise, I may feel very scared ...
