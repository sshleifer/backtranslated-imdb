I did not really know who Robert Wohl was before seeing this. But after seeing him I realized that he was a funny man. This HBO is distinguished by teaching American History to New York University film students and the man was just phenomenal. He ridiculed almost every major historical event, not only in the United States but in other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me wonder if what I accept is because the true and infallible history is truly true. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed how Mr. Wohl managed to mix useful information with a great comedy and learn it much more exciting. I recommend this to anyone interested in history and willing to question their beliefs.
