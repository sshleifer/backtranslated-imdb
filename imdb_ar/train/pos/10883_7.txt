This is a stunning above average slant, it's fun and well done, with some decent consistency! All decent characters, the story is very enjoyable, in addition to Molly Ringwald played a very annoying bitch. I bought this at the pawn shop for $ 1, and it was worth it amazingly, and the special effects were a good damn good for the budget, plus I loved the mask worn by the killer because it was actually creepy to some extent. It was a really wonderful ending, I loved how they beat the killer, and the predictable ending was also very entertaining, and all the characters except Ringwald were amazingly loved! It's made and written in a decent way, and I think it was creative and innovative too sometimes, and some scenes of death were so wonderful. This killer did not fail and loved him, and Slasher fans (like me) should really enjoy this movie, and the opening was very evil, as they filmed the film! This is much higher than the average slant, it's fun and well done, with some nice dresses, and I say it's worth watching! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall does well! You can work here using a solid camera, using a creepy setting and good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. Strong acting! Molly Ringwald played the bitch very well, and I had problems I feel sorry for, after all that was supposed to be a heroine, she turned out better in the end, but not much, I was surprised that she decided to do this movie, yet I did an excellent job ! Frank Roberts is as wonderful as the killer, he is threatened, creepy and has one hell of a mask, and this guy has not spoiled, it was wonderful! Kylie Minogue plays a big role in her small role. Jessica Napier is nice and does the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall worth watching! *** of 5
