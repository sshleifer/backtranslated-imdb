I've known about Bettie Page since. Since the 1950s, the main pornographic images of her have become iconic and still enjoy a strong tie to this day. The appearance of "Bettie Page" is still very popular in the world of sedition and remains as unique as it was at the time. So I watched this film with little familiarity at first. The result was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was very entertaining to see movie recreation for real characters like Irving Claw, John Willie and Bonnie Yeager ?? All consider trailblazers today. Mary Haroun did an excellent job of creating the desired climate of sexual repression and hypocrisy in America in the 1950s, along with sexual life that, according to today's standards, was innocent. I particularly liked using monochrome vs. color as an optical shortcut to the emotional and spiritual climate Bettie found herself in. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol has done an excellent job in bringing Bettie's character in all her innocent sexual life and all are naive. I loved my house to look beautiful, I loved attention, you did not feel embarrassed in nudity, and I enjoyed wearing "silly" clothes for the camera. The latent sexual life and the deep pagan desires that have lost all that they have fully raised. To this day, she still does not understand "what all the hype is" when it comes to her images or S & M content. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that they are uneducated or too simple to realize that they simply "do not understand" about the fetus and will never do so. No harm there. My home page is simply who it is. The film captured this beautifully. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s portrayed by Ms. Harun and her writing with Genevir Turner makes me really happy because I live in the day and age I live in. Hypocrisy and oppression coupled with the enormous ignorance of our sexuality all combined in a frightening world. This film captures well and cheers as Bettie endures all this with her unshakeable and unshakeable faith. <br /> <br /> This film was a bit slow at times but it achieved all the points that Ms. Harron tried to get to them well. I recommend this movie even for those who know little about Betty Beige and what their impact on American culture is. For those who have such interests, this film is a must.
