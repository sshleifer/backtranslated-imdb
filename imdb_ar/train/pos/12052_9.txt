I've seen this on television for so long that I can not remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the most frightening and disturbing movies I have ever seen. There is a hidden dread at the same time but intense caused by the black-colored woman lurking on the rim of the frame, completely invisible, so that you feel (like the law champion), unsure whether her imagination fair or not. It's also one of the few films that made me afraid to keep watching. "Production values" are suspended, and good films revolve around the director's ability to create an atmosphere by using film, actors, sites / groups, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A real jewel.
