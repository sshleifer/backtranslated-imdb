I love this show. interval. I have not seen it for a long time, maybe only six months or so, in fact, it is now my favorite program and may last for a long time. I love all the characters, but I do not really care about you. I'm not quite sure why. I just .. do not find her funny, and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Other than that, I find the cast very good. Both Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played the role of the Erics parents, were very impressed. Topher Grace is also a wonderful actress. Unlike many fans, I did not completely hate the eighth season. I still watch him, which makes me laugh. But if you compare it to the previous seasons, it's not good. Randy is terrible. The finish was decent, nothing spectacular, but good. =] I think it was better to cancel the offer after Ashton and Topier decided to leave, but OK. I have a fourth season on DVD, and someday I wish I could get all eight chapters on DVD. I think some of her most famous episodes are "Dine & Dash", "Grandmas Dead", "Red & Stacey" and "Streaking", but I love every episode I've seen so far, and most of them, I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
