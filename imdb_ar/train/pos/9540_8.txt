Most of the comments I've heard about Meatball Machine have been largely mixed. Even couples say they believe "sucked". Well, for those I say, get some f @ ckin imagination and go to f @ ck yourself. This was a very entertaining surprise. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical error that attacks and turns its hosts in some way into these Guar-like crews called Necroborgs. In the end, I learned that these mechanical errors also attach to you a small parasite, so that you can then control your actions because of the hot wires of the nervous system. Unfortunately for two young people who are looking for love, they hunt roads with mechanical error, before they know that transitions occur and blood is sprayed. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? Why Necroborgs are fighting each other? Are the two desperate people apart from each other and doing badly? Only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> Going to the meat balls machine I was somewhat cautious because of mixed reactions, but turned out to be a big surprise. Some questions that have not been answered, some of them acting at times and a somewhat confusing ending are the only weaknesses I can think of. From the anime to that, until the parasites become small characters themselves and even the sense of a low budget, this film hits the right mark much more than missing. With a constantly evolving story interesting enough to keep asking around mixed questions with cool make-up effects and blood stains, this is one of the flick fans of bizarro fans / horror / Tetsuo / splatter you should check out. 8 and 10
