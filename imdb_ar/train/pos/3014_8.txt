This wonderful whodunit is a prototype of what soon became a kind of very famous films. I was happy to see William Powell deal with the story of the detective with charm and charm and without the ridiculous attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the "High Man" series). Although the story is good on its own, I think what makes this film really fun to watch is the fantastic fantasy direction of Michael Curtiz. From a visual point of view, this film is rich in color, with Kurtz displaying a wonderful scene from the middle. From screen shots divided into exotic camera angles and fantasy memories, Curtis explains that he was one of the best directors in Hollywood. It is highly recommended if you are a fan of this kind of movie.
