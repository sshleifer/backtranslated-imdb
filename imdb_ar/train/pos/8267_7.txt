Brown film of Harvard film tough selection. We expect a lot of our films these days, so it's useful to remember that viewers in their twenties were more innocent. William Heinz is a magician like a rogue who must stumble from pain and humiliation to find success, even glory. All the relationships in the film are very intense except for the homogeneous link between Billy and Jack Beckford, a city nerd. The film contains everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sport ... It's a wonderful teaching of how society changed in the 20th century.
