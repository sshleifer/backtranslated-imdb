I know you've already entered this film festival (or at least I think you have, maybe I do) but I think this should get the "best short animated film" in every film. Bravo. I can not wait for the full movie. Realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the exotic nature of your animation, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. Glory, my friend. Well, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... although I still mean it. And here comes after -SHOE! - I can not stop here yet. This is very annoying, but at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I will probably see all of your films in "Jason Steel Marathon". I have many of these. <br /> <br /> -R
