I was expecting to see another Nunsploitation movie with "Superior Mother" as he assaulted and tortured her. It turned out that Flavia was much more than I expected. <br /> <br /> She already has a feminist story, although I do not think that term was present in the era when the film was set. Definitely not exercised. Women (Jews and the poor) are very persecuted and held in harmful areas of society. Throughout the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolcan) sees tyranny of her time so she can no longer sit there for longer and actually do it about it, albeit disastrously. <br /> <br /> Pre-sequencer has Flavia's teenage near the battlefield. You see an "evil" Muslim soldier wounded (one of the few soldiers still alive) trying to help him. Before she can, her hateful father cuts off the soldier's head and waves his head in her face (the great family dynamics, huh?). After that, her father forces her to join a monastery where there is more injustice. Although the scenes involve violence, rape and nuns, I consider this a historical drama rather than a nonplosion. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many ingredients needed to exploit a piece of garbage, but acting, acting, storywriting and music are so good that they can not be kept at this level. Most of the "nun" films I have seen usually contain the basic premise: that the good girl will end up in one way or another in the convent, where the distinguished mother is the supreme bitch who likes to strike people and / or make their lives alive. <br /> <br /> Flavia spends much of the first part of the film, which wonders negatively about all the atrocities that occur around her. Many of her negativity is forgotten when she becomes aware of strong (but somewhat fleshy - she likes to urinate out like me, but it is much easier for men) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their monastery, Flavia and Agatha do not hesitate in fear like other nuns. The attackers act as liberators (cruelty and sub-slavery). In fact, he is a Christian, not a Muslim Gazan, who hated Sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> Agatha's death sends Flavia in her violent crusade against those who have suppressed her ... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover invokes her at a very inconvenient time. I do not want to give much of the rest of the story, but be prepared for shock, destruction and sadness at the end. It is a wonderful film, so do not be late for its reputation (not worthy) as a garbage trash. In addition, how can a film featuring Florinda Bolcan and Claudio Cassinelli make a mistake? I am not familiar with the other works of Maria Casares, but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character. <br /> <br /> I have read many great reviews for the Synapse version (US), but I like the German X-rated Kult DVD copy. It is not a distorted image / 16: 9, but it actually contains more information about the image on all edges of the Synapse version. <br /> <br /> There are also many wonderful, wise or funny dialogue lines (many of them from Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> "Why did God mention the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? - Flavia <br /> <br /> "These guys are afraid - look at them, sister - afraid that their power will be taken away from them!" -SR. Agatha (Regarding Christians fleeing after the arrival of Muslims) <br /> <br /> "Women, where are you going? Muslims can not do anything to you because the Christians did not do! Ha ha ha!" -SR. Agatha (to a group of fleeing Christian women) <br /> <br /> "God bless these Muslims - to put fear in these innocent Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Do you just need to see a Muslim to make you feel comfortable?" -SR. Agatha <br /> <br /> The final message: "Flavia Gitani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - has been punished as a fugitive nun The idea of ​​the film came from events during Muslim invasions of Italy culminating in what even today is remembered It's "Extermination 800" in "Oranto"
