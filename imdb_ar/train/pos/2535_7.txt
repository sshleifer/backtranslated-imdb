Professor Janus Roch (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force used in atomic energy. Unfortunately, Rukh was exposed to contamination by radium and began to glow in the dark - touching it causing instant death. Dr. Bela Lugosi develops a trick - but Rukh starts madly because of Radium and and the antidate and starts to kill all that he thinks is wrong. <br /> <br /> The silly plot and "effects" that make Karlov glow in the dark are laughable, but this is still cool and fun. It moves quickly, and has some wonderful atmosphere (note the "house" Rukh and the movie begins in a rainy dark night) and offers Karloff and Lugosi (as always) great performances. There is also a good representation by Frank Drake (as Roca's wife) and Violet Campbell Campbell (as his mother). So, it's OK, but at a lower level than all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is just far-fetched for me to swallow. I still did like this. Give it 7.
