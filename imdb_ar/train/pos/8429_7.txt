It seems that the only (although repetitive and somewhat useful) analysis of exploitation and despair is in a situation where there is no way forward or up, as attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and dropping who is Donk seem to be the only option. But even here, in this barren land of lost dreams and not the future, this does not work, and access to something or someone to rest and share with, a simple charity, gives some rewards, even if it is just a potential present to revive memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little actual violence on the screen, it is a harsh and brutal film about the small (political and personal) persecution mentality that does not make entertainment easy. Based on a theatrical presentation, with a small representation, perhaps the broader relationship with the social and political environment allowed the film to reach a wider audience.
