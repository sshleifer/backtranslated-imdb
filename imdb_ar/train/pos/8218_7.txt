With the rise of Harry Callahan years ago, he had to play the role of "the inevitable old man with a slice on his shoulder" in the end. Kalahan, who sometimes seemed fragile and out of place, was still in a steady state. Fortunately, this film took some time to establish a different kind of story, a story that might reinvent Dirty Harry and the whole genre. Although the film failed to do so, it was an excellent addition to the series, even if it was slightly in place during a period of silly fashion trends and new wave music.
