This is 2009 and in this way the jewel has not underestimated something of the strength it enjoyed 31 years ago. It connects a wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing crowded. <br /> <br /> Clothes and music may have changed over time, but in the end this is a story you will never lose --dateness. This particular film performs the task well. Of course, it is cheese sometimes, but it is also impressive. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jodie Fosterer is stunning and shows that she is a natural actress and has already generated her real potential especially in her previous films. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this step.
