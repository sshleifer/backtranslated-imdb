I watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on Starz cable TV. It is without doubt one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! The San Francisco Bay Area artists and creative talents are responsible for some of the best films ever made. In addition to the well-known artists on the list, t also includes slides with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a band about Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD - this is essential for any group about the history of film and filmmaking. If you're interested in movies and people who create them remotely, you will not be disappointed.
