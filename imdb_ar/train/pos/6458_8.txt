A beautiful film, deeply touching the simple divine aspects of mankind. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, seeing anything in this world could be really perfect, that's very good. The only simple thing I personally object to is the speed at some points in the middle of the story. The acting is also very good, and all actors easily excel in feature films. The actual directive seems to have been well thought out, and the script should be great. There are some really amazing moments of alarm, and a very impressive circular composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment of the film, when the main character realizes that the feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending of the really wonderful yarn.
