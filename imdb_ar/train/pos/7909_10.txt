When this first came out, my father brought him home - we were surprised - he was completely different from anything we had seen before. I was looking for a certain movie last night and found "Eye of Mind" again. The box breaks down and I'm surprised that the tape still works! Although they are not high-quality graphics "Finding Nemo", they are still very good. They should sell it again - it's a sign of computer animation. strongly recommended! <br /> <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> "Mind Eye" is an amazing journey through time. Start your journey at the dawn of creativity and move through the rise of man and technology. Travel in an abstract world to the future with vibrant images of computer animation. <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" features more than 300 of the world's most talented animators with original music and sound recording. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible journey to the "eye of reason".
