About 40-year-old Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old man who works in an e-shop and has little social life, is very embarrassed about women. Some of his store colleagues call him out one night and discover Andy, still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day at the store, Andy meets a woman named Trish, who gives her her phone number, and eventually Andy works, with enough courage to go with her on time, and start admiring each other but Andy, still very awkward when it comes to sex , And he will have to say so to Trichet, which is a bit embarrassing if he can really get enough courage to tell her before things get embarrassing. The 40-year-old Virgin is distinguished by good direction, good texts, good comedies for all actors, good cinematography and good film editing. The film starring Steve Karel, who co-authored a very good comedy performance and his writing of the film is very good. I was very pleased with this film. It is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, fun, smart, good and a good time. This movie has the same good quality smashing weddings this year, both of which are the best comedy movies I've ever seen. The 40-year-old Virgin brings a lot of talent and is well used as a comedian and romantic, sweet and fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedy movies of the year.
