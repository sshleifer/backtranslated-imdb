It was not a nice time with this movie. The movie, once the most controversial and best-selling controversy of Jeffrey Convitz, seems to be just a typical version of the typical spookfest festival. The hideous touches aside (especially those crazy, on the final top), this is basically a horror horror film for those people who do not care much about the genre. But there is something to tell me that the producers wanted such a high-cost actor to convince the public that this is not your lowbrow movie, "he said. The average (producers of the 1970s film had a similar idea). I liked to see the familiar faces, but the story is very silly, no matter how high the film pretends, it works on the level of the film you used in the 1970s (not a bad thing, though). Still, it's a fun movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy watching the stars. As usual, the brilliant work of Albert Whitlock is wonderful. Overall, very entertaining.
