Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The letters will be very erratic and annoying, but brilliant writing means it works, and works very well. Most other people will know the touch of some characters, but we hope that someone with the most extreme characters like Tubbs and Edward, or strangers in a local store, or Pauline, who is obsessed with the pen and who treats scum with a lot of contempt, will not know. This is just a few odd population. The TV works consist of 3 series and a special Christmas. There are references to many horror films, such as Wicker Man. From the latest additions to a collection of film works, it is the end-of-the-world league of the gentleman, who will not say much but I highly recommend it. All in all the Gentlemen Guild is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and bonkers characters brilliantly. I would definitely say it's worth watching as you will not regret it!
