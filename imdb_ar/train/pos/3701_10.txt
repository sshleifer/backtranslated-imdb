In my opinion, the dinner may be the biggest film production for adults of all time. It is produced wonderfully and actors portray their roles perfectly. The kitchen scenery starring Yvonne and Julie Ashton is wonderful. Using butter and milk really makes the scene. In addition, the doctor's office scene well. The scene of the fire is full of interesting work, although the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asia Carrera's performance in the junkyard scenery is amazing, but he expected nothing less of it. The closing scene ended somewhat in adult movies, but it was classic. I highly recommend this film to all adult movie lovers and casual viewers. Run out to your video store and pick it up today.
