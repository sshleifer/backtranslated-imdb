The Wooden Horse is a highly intelligent film about a successful and successful escape plan prepared by British POW's during World War II. They are treated wonderfully with an annoying sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid tongues of Liu Jin. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks at Mary Poppins) are both fantastic. The trend is taut and fast-moving all the time. Highly recommended.
