The Dirty Harry series started with a very conditional action, and was almost immediately alleviated by the "Magnum Force". By the time it was about the "port," Dirty Harry was just a little more than a TV show (saved only by Tyne Daly). After an interval of seven years, "Harry Dirty" finally returned to its roots. He may have disappeared for a long time this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes Harry's first good film output since Don Siegel made his first film, which helps tremendously. Harry is a darker figure again, not a pleasant policeman who has become it. He can again say things like "Go ahead, make my day" and that really means. "Sudden Impact" is Harry's real dirty sequel. "Port" should never be. <br /> <br /> 7.2 of 10
