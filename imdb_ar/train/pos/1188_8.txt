I was initially suspicious about this film (just for the subject), but the characters painted with the rich, the wonderful scenes of chasing the buffalo, the dramatic result makes it worth watching. I initially encountered a problem distinguishing between buffalo hunters but as the film progressed, they increasingly identified themselves. I'm still haunted by the last scene.
