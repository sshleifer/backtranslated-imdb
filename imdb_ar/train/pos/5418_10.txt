Carrie Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McClaglin are three soldiers in India in the 19th century who helped a water boy (Sam Jaffe) rid the region of the cult of murderous thugs. Chemistry helps actors make this one of the most entertaining films ever. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as he is a discarded water boy who has been abused by everyone and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Based on Rudyard Kipling's poem. You should see anyone who enjoys this kind of movies.
