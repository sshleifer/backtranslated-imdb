I certainly needed a little work in Season 2. Like the virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White with an ancient ancient cult. But during the second season, the only thing I kept watching was whether Max and Eugene would get rid of the bad virus that infects Max. A very good drama in the second season. But of course like all television shows, if there is something wrong with that, the broadcast company will be disconnected from the air. I seriously hope for the third and final season. The second season leaves you hanging, unless you read Max Alan Collins's book, you'll know what's going on. <br /> <br /> The dark angel must reappear on air for one additional season although it may cost a lot to get all the original actors back. Since the sky carrier Jessica Alba rose after the show. If so, there must be a movie to complete. Just like the Firefly exhibition, of course the FOX was canceled as well.
