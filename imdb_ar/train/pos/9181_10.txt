I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw these series. I had read and seen many classics before, and I think most classics were boring stories, overly phrased and exaggerated with moderate plots at best. Jane Eyre's photographers have completely changed their conceptualization. <br /> <br /> Zilla Clark is a wonderful actress, and she offers a wonderful image of Jane Eyre. Her tone is exhilarating and calm, but her firm nature matches the character of the young nanny perfectly. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the film makes me think he was born to play the role of the cocks in Thoranfeld Hall. I could not sleep all night after watching this series. The plot is both haunting and inspiring. The characters are performed brilliantly, and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre appearing in the film at all. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how close these photographers were to following the writings of Charonite Brunetti. Jane Eyre is now my favorite film and script. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, watch the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre.
