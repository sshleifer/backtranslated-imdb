It is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village, better described by the landscape planets and guided by old Kurosawa, as well as Dostoyevsky's themes on human psychology (O-shin-Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen. Scenario is wonderful, the scenes are colorful and some beautiful scenes remain really imprinted in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each letter of characters has been well developed and interesting - there are also a few actions, so if you do not like all the emotions you may also bear at your costs -. It is not about the mysterious and proud army of Samurai, where they all flock to the bushido, but to life, work and the kinds of people everywhere at any time. A beautiful and wonderful greeting to Kurosawa, definitely worth seeing.
