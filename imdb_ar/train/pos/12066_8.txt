It is not known whether Marilyn Monroe met and talked with Albert Einstein (and since the mysterious disappearance of her memoirs after her mysterious death on an equal footing, we may never know), but in her life the opportunity was there. <br /> <br /> Written by Terry Johnson from his own play, Nicholas Rogge's "Incompetence" conjures up a meeting in a hotel room in New York one night in 1953 between two icons, as well as Joe de Maggio (Bossi), the senator Joseph McCarthy (Curtis) - But the film has only one level. On another level, he raises - or diminishes - from these "characters" (and what a lousy phrase that is) to mere avatars (unintentionally named characters), in a larger and lower case. <br /> <br /> The title of irrelevance is both ironic and ironic. Here, Demagio's net worth was reduced to little more than a picture on the Zahi card. Monroe also turns into her constituent parts of dress, hair, lipstick, twisting and sound. By exposing their insecurity and reversing their roles, the film brings a sharp focus to celebrity ideas, and explodes personal worship. <br /> <br /> And further enhanced, there will be another explosion at the height of the film: Hiroshima in a hotel suite, where the "actress" is burned in a small place in seconds; Goodbye, Norma Jean. The history informs the script, which in turn shakes history upside down. As Rogge said after watching the play for the first time, "These characters were legendary, not invented by anyone, not the audience or the press, and perhaps even by the characters themselves." She also played Theresa Russell, Marilyn (a real-life closet philosopher), Einstein's children ("The Professor," played by Emil) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight, while the professor prepares to show his legs in a parody of her own role in The Seven- Year Itch, The Actress is seen as working at the opening of the film. <br /> <br /> History records that Monroe, the baseball husband at the time, fades away from the baseball star DiMaggio (played by Bossi as a thin psychotic child). She was not happy with her distinctive scene in the film, which led to her disintegration. Once discovered, we discovered "Ballplayer" jealousy in a pub, and you like the fact that "if you want to see her underwear, I walk to the corner like all the other guys." <br /> <br /> Unlike the professor, The Ballplayer believes the universe is round, a dispute shared by Native Americans. But the Big Chief (from Sampson, one of the famous Flux Over The Cuckoo's Nest) who runs the Roosevelt Hotel elevator has been deprived of his culture: "I'm no longer Cherokee - watching TV." Meanwhile, the "Senator" is investigating the professor, who was on the eve of a peaceful speech to the United Nations, but the suspect is a member of the Senate. In fact, while publishing to Monroe, Einstein feels guilty about Hiroshima and what the future of white heat holds. Yet, in this seemingly godless universe, all these fears and ambitions have become unimportant in the light of a higher power. <br /> <br /> Roeg is the truly perfect director to bring the play Johnson to the screen. All the time, the chaotic memories of childhood and ka-boom! Reflect unexpected links between time, space and circumstance, with the repetitive visual idea of ​​the wristwatch used to celebrate the passage of time - but it may also indicate that the whole time is one time. Every moment co-existence. As seen from his back, it is something of a hobby for an enchanted director with the idea of ​​synchronization - see "Do not Look Now" in particular. Here, he bled from 1920 to 1945 and driped in the 1980s, when another "representative" played his biggest role as president. <br /> <br /> If all this seems a bit heavy going (quantum physics is certainly involved), the execution is nothing but, because of Johnson's intelligent, agile scenario, the cheerful Rogge trend, and the opening of a set of basic stages - and the actors themselves, who They are in excellent shape. Tony Curtis leaves special teeth markers in the wood panels as a paranoid senator who is seen trying to hold a conference with a Monroe impersonator (real vs. Russell) before his dwindling member lets him down. <br /> <br /> Of course, Curtis once shared with the real Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot, which he described as embracing Hitler Kissing. As Rogge commented, "Everything seemed suddenly connected ... When the film began to crystallize, the actors themselves seemed part of this endless link." Everything goes to the pot, to be boiled and served in new and wonderful ways.
