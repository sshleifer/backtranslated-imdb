A group of leading San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are threatened and attacked by someone who sends them exotic Valentine's Day cards. Who is the murderer and why the murderer after them? <br /> <br /> My rankings often change on subsequent scenes of a movie - sometimes it rises slightly, sometimes it is a little bit. However, I can not remember another film where my classification changed dramatically as it was with Valentine's Day. The first time I saw it, when it was released theatrical, I thought it was very shocking - I gave it 4 out of 10, the equivalent of the letter "F". Watch it for the second time last night, I can not remember what I did not like about it. I can only assume that maybe you're in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I did not understand it. Anyway, I liked her this time, giving her 9 out of 10, or "A". <br /> <br /> It might seem silly when you say I did not get a movie like this, but there's something to get. Valentine's Day is almost a comedy / horror. Director Jimmy Blanks, who was also responsible for the 1998 Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical form of adolescent horror in the late 1990s following Scream (1996) and pushed most of the elements to a higher level, making Valentine almost foolhardy (Where tampering is the term positive method). In addition, he gives us a film full of humorous comments about romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggerated tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the positions in the film, the mode of action of the villain, comic or not, are related to the theme of Valentine's Day. <br /> <br /> Many viewers are likely to cast points from the film because of its different cliches. Root scenarios but unreasonable and plot developments. However, in view of the above, the film is clich√© deliberately, unreasonable and ridiculous. It seems as if the spaces are trying (and often succeeding) to go beyond the usual typical teen age through ridicule / rigging in genre conventions while at the same time spelling spells. This is the paradoxical attraction of creating a horror film on Valentine's Day. It is a paradox that is cleverly woven all over the film, and it is at the heart of this kind of morgue, making it a staple to seduce Valentine's Day. Scream had a similar goal with his own horror material, but there was an evolution in the film being "self-aware." Valentine's Day is not deliberately self-conscious; the viewer must rely on contextual clues to ridicule. Lennon Sellers said he wanted to do something "more than adults". <br /> <br /> Other viewers may hate the fact that Valentine's Day is very different from its supposed origin, a novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The characters and the preparation and plot are very different from the film. "Although it was a good book, I did not think it was the right story for a film," Sellers said. Instead, the novel, which is more drying and more serious in tone, has been used as a launch pad, an idea for creating different forms of horror story / excitement focused on Valentine's Day. While these facts will not help the fundamentalists familiar with the book like the film, it is useful to understand why the film contains a plot and a differentiated position. It may be better to consider the film as an independent entity with a similar feature. <br /> <br /> The direction of the spaces is flawless. Valentine Day has a full-bodied look, intricate and deep colors, interesting collections, and good welcome. The blanks are wonderful to keep watching the evil and the attack is not too dark, with a clear move. As he directs his representatives with aplomb, stimulating presentations often humorous. David Burinaz, as Adam Carr, takes part in many enjoyable moments. <br /> <br /> Although Valentine's Day is not a masterpiece, it is a very good horror / suspense film and seems to be heavily susceptible to misconceptions. If you watch him expect something more for Sana, you may find yourself appreciating him a lot.
