This movie pleasantly surprised me. He has a slightly moving approach outside the center that never loses your attention. It's a movie I've never heard of, but if you want to "sleep", that's the movie. Great writing, production and acting. I highly recommend it to the masses that want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Cheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are fantastic. Why was not it made more than this film?
