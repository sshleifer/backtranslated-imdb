While the title "Before Satan Knows You're Dead" comes from the Irish proverb, the film presents like Greek tragedy. Everything starts with a failed theft and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers try to escape the mess they have reached. <br /> <br /> The cast was well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke. The notable support includes Albert Finney as their parent and Marissa Tome as wife to one brother and lover of the other. Outside of these principles, representation is not noticeable. <br /> <br /> The story is convincing and tells a certain amount of trick. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different perspectives and frequent time shifts. However, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat muted because it is early early that this story is a tragedy, through and through it. In general, the debut was very touching for screenwriter Kelly Masterson for the first time. <br /> <br /> The direction of Sydney Lumet is well handled, but I am more impressed by the fact that it still draws more than 80 years. I was less impressed by the score recorded by Carter Burwell, but it is not much distraction. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film proved to be an attractive show and while the story and presentation may have a superficial resemblance to other films this one is still a unique experience.
