All I hear about is how bad the animation is. It may not be at the level of what everyone expects, but look at him this way. Do you expect perfection in hell? I think the animation was deliberately dry and bold. It was wonderful to see her character shift in this film, considering it would probably be as close to direct action as we would ever get. I hope the sequel very soon. If we really want to live, I think we may be in better shape with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think the lady of death will be transferred well to the film. But whatever the case, I believe that all those who reject this film are wrong. Intent is not intended.
