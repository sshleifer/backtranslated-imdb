"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before marriage, just last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first film I looked for, after I got married, because we promised to present a copy to our priest. Regardless of imagination. To all who wrote that priests like Don Camilo did not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest. Nuno Westwood, Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> To all the others, I recommend them just to watch this movie, before and after "I do!" Today :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
