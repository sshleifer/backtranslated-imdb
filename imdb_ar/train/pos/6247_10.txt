In this film, the protagonists may display scenes of violence or unusual sexual activity, but these scenes are just rare fragments taken to attract the audience. Of course, they present the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> The people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using the power, they may have elsewhere, to repress others infamously. At the low end of the repression series, most of them are women. <br /> <br /> It's very hard to face a movie that brutally displays such as Hundstage, but having to endure such spirits. <br /> Technically, the film is very much like Short Cuts, but it consists of documentary style episodes that show people like your neighbor playing the way they do. Without any gloss, most disturbing, without any hope. His documentary style makes the film more disturbing because you realize that these people are there, and there are many of them, even though our society is focused on the beautiful exterior. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its work, somewhere where undeclared domestic violence must occur, somewhere where hopes should be shattered. I'm sure I know these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie without any funny scenes (some may think that disabled women who repeat the top 10 supermarkets are funny, but this happens real) and without any melodramatic, go to watch this movie. However, you will lose when you focus on subtitles I'm afraid, because the translation can not move the assertion.
