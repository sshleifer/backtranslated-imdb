Do we actually make "bad videos" again? In a large new 8 mm wide budget edition, this is a great trip. Unfortunately, there is too much of a story, and sometimes this is a journey of exploration, as our heroine searches the dim areas of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am accustomed to some "corrupt" scenes, including everything from hot wax, hard skin, coarse sex to drowning, cutting heads and others. These scenes are pure and it is unfortunate Bruno and his budget can not stretch to make all the distinctive creatures that have been made become more than just caricatures.
