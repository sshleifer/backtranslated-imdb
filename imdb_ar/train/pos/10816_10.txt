No, this is not supposed to be a high budget, but it's great in itself. You have to look at it as it is, a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist who uses a 12-inch love rod and is still on his way. Those who came to give this film a low rating may have been looking for the following "gem" of the following classical rites or "jewel" hidden as they say and did not get there. I like the way everyone points to clear notes, such as "5 cents baby tied to a fish pole" hahaha, well, yes. I do not think a film with such a budget could tolerate actors or "good" effects, so they worked with what they had. The guts and guts were in fact very convincing. The film was a little sporadic from sequence to sequence, but overall, this is one of the best films I've ever seen that does not follow any direction or predictability. Very good for laughter.
