Imagination is a terrible thing to miss ... especially when you have talented actors. The writer / director Jones does not waste any time in tilting the viewer with the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Anyone who shares an apartment with Slob will cry with laughter. Anyone who has arrived while placing a maid ticket meter on your windshield will only cry. We all wanted to tear a hideous wig from a man's head. These are just excerpts from the stuff in the store when watching "Cross Eyed", a faithful film that should be a starting point for Jones and the tremendous humor in front of the camera and behind it.
