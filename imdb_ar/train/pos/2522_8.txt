I must admit, at first I did not expect anything good, at all. I was expecting only a cheese film promoting Gackt's and Hyde, but I'm pleased to say it has a lot to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is not great, but it is not absorbed either, each of the cast is well disciplined and they bring enough power to their characters. The effects lack consistency, but motion scenes are satisfactory enough. <br /> <br /> What really links me is the essence of the story, although it incorporates great elements, but it also presents a reality. The evolution of characters, their doubts and feelings really made me think that this is the key to this film. It makes you think as it moves all the anxiety. <br /> <br /> It meets any expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
