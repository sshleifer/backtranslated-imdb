I watched the French horror film last night and I liked it very much. The entire film is shown in a prison cell with three prisoners who basically find a handwritten magazine in the wall of a serial killer who escaped from prison 20 years ago, somehow without leaving his cell. As they search for notes, they discover they are turning into black arts and orders that may be their way out of the cell and into freedom. What they discover, is something completely different, and scary nothing less. I love low budget horror movies, which offer goods in a fairly good way and tell a good story. This film does exactly that, although taking some time to continue. The result and the horror they give me are very exciting, and I enjoyed the trip. There are not many gaps, but this will not fit the story, although the gap is very good.
