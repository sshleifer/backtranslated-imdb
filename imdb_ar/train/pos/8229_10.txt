It is a very slow-moving film, and builds a story of a former stripper starting a new family life with a very strange person. The viewer slowly feels there is something wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really liked this film although it leaves a slightly bitter taste in the end. He is intelligent, very well-behaved and very well behaved. Both Philip Toretton and Emmanuel Sener are deep in their personalities. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very impressive. <br /> <br /> A sexy movie does not look like one. Very funky film, very special atmosphere throughout the entire film, although you may feel embarrassed several times with a few sights. <br /> <br /> I will give it 8/10 !!
