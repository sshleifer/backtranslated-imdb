Pinjar is one of the few films that leave a real imprint and make you think hard. This film is shown in the India section, the real reality of the division of India. Ormila gets full marks for her beautiful and passionate portrayal of a woman who suffers without any means of going. Her freedom, personal identity and respect for the family were removed overnight because of a tragic conflict on the ground. Manoj Bajpayee is simply as wonderful as her remorse. There are several moments in the film where they are brought to tears. The film in points is very painful. Some of the chilling section scenes are chilling, but the stamina and stay at Urmila are both terrific. From a woman who stole her freedom to a woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. A wonderful movie should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling.
