Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and deserves respect to try it, but he is not in line with Shakespeare's greats like Olivier and Wales; he also suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, steals the show completely. Olivier realized this potential in his production, and Iago delivered a person who knew he could climb. I almost did not realize the possibilities of Iago, the villainous personality of Shakespeare, but Branagh shows us depths. Nice to see Venice views, too.
