This is what the musical genre made. I have a sense of humor, talent, romance and movement. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. There is nothing worth talking about. Marlon Brando, though not a singer, did a great job of winning the hearts of many through his portrayal of Sky Masterson. The fact that he can not sing add to his personality. The ladies in the film were fine, but the men in the film certainly stole the show. <br /> <br /> It is a real classic game that can be estimated in any age. It connects to all the masses and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie you can watch and enjoy!
