What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie that happened to me that I saw last night. The "danger" was fantastic. It was manufactured in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who leads Doug (Barry Sullivan) and his son Lee Ikar to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a holiday. The pair falls off the dock and the only way to save it is if Barbara returns to the garage for some ropes. <br /> <br /> While a psychotic killer is attacking (Ralph Maquier - one of my favorites) and the following is a cat and mouse game where Barbara tries everything she can to make Meeker come back with her to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The movie was very suspicious and such a surprise - I did not expect such a wonderful film. But I think I had to realize - is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does?
