This was a great movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was useless. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events is done. <br /> <br /> But, provided you can relax enough to laugh, it was a very exciting experience combining Keystone Cops and Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The bad guys were hotter than the bad ones. Good men were not good. Black actors played ordinary characters instead of black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Adding a child added a good touch. Sympathy may be a bit difficult. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree about acting. It was very good. I really wanted to hit Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> After all, is not that a really good movie sign, would you like to hit Judge Reynold?
