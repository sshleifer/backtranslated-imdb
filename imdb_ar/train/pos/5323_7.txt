There are a number of incorrect things, although this is not very important because what happened to whom and when is still in dispute. The most obvious freedom with the facts I think is when they start playing in the film "Kaiserkeller" by Bruno Koschmidder, when they played in Indra and later moved on to Kaiserkeller. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was biased in favor of Best House, but if he is the story's advisor, I think he calls the shots. I also agree with Semprinni that Pete Best records play on the final word saying about the subject of his dismissal. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not as proud as the last movie "Backbeat", it is better because it is more accurate and has better text with a deeper characterization. <br /> <br /> There's a lot in the film too big - like Brian Epstein tries to hide the fact that he was "cocky", just to see that the band knew he was gay all the time. Small touches like the band entering the cafe and asking for "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite show, which actually contains some basses, is the test in which Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his guitar but can not play it, so he stands with his back to the empressario and tries to rig it, but is caught. This is rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
