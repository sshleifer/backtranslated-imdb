MacArthur begins with Douglas McCarthy, Gregory Peck, and Alma Mata, the American military academy at West Point on Hudson. We see the weak 82-year-old General MacArthur give his inaugural address to the beginning of the 1962 chapter on honor that serves their country. The film then moves to nearly two hours of flashback about the brilliant life of General MacArthur as well as the controversial skill that begins in the darkest hours of the Second World War on the besieged Corigidor island in the Philippines in early spring 1942. <br /> <br /> He told that leaving the island for Australia before the Japanese army invaded General MacArthur for the first time in his military career almost contradicted a direct order from his superior US President Franklin Roosevelt, Dan O'Herley. Feeling that he would give up his men in the greatest time they needed, MacArthur reluctantly, with his wife and young son, did what he did to disguise him to remind him of the war. That was why his escape from the fire or death by the Japanese prompted General MacArthur to use all his influence to get Franklin Roosevelt two years later to launch a major invasion of the Philippians, instead of Formosa Island, to keep his promise to the Filipino people as well as thousands of prisoners The American war left behind. He will return and return strongly US military and navy to support his pledge! <br /> <br /> Within two years of the invasion of the Philippine General Mac MacKay, Japanese forces in the south of Bafik were hit by a number of battles in the island's glorious hippopotamus that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops in surrender. The general did so with the lowest US military losses and then any other commander allied in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> In 1950/51 in the Korean War, General MacArthur achieved his greatest victory as well as his worst military defeat. After surpassing the superbly developed and fully deployed North Korean army, with US marines invading less than 100 casualties or the back door or invading the left hook of General MacArthur, he sent US / UN troops under his command to the border, along a river Yalu, from Communist Red China. Told his subordinates that he was facing a threat of widespread ground assault by communist Chinese forces, General MacArthur, in any case pressed until the attack achieved the cutting of US and UN forces into tapes. The unstoppable wave after a wave of attack forced the US Red Army troops to retreat in the "big impurities" in 1950 with their lives, leaving all their equipment behind them, across the North Korean border to leave the South Korean capital Seoul! It turned out to be one of the biggest military disasters in US history. US forces lost a record. In the Korean War, there were 1,000 people on the first day of November. 29/30 1950 of the Chinese communist invasion! <br /> <br /> He was shocked by what allowed him, often because of arrogance, to have an attack by MacArthur in an attack not against the Communist Chinese and the Forces nouveau Koreans but his own commander and chief of staff. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, does not have the guts or the courage to do what: to launch a large-scale invasion of communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from invading the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who took enough garbage from General MacArthur to escape from his mouth in public places in how he dealt with the war not to go out, as MacArthur wanted against the Red Chinese, was the last straw! On 11 April 1951 Berri. Truman reinstated General MacArthur from his command as commander-in-chief of the United States / United Nations forces in Korea! wilderness. Truman's courageous but unpopular decision, too, by not confronting McCarthy's comprehensive strategy of war, prevented the outbreak of a third world war with the Soviet Union - communist ally of China - then the United States - the atomic bomb! wilderness. Truman's controversial decision to dismiss General MacArthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with very low poll numbers in the mid-20s - until he withdrew - in March of that year - from the US presidential campaign! <br /> <br /> General MacArthur's misfortune was to exist when the world's political and military climate changed in how to manage future wars. With the horrors of the nuclear war now, in 1950/51, it was really all national suicide, like General MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese with the prospect of being cleared of a nuclear holocaust that would swallow not only the Soviet Union and Red China but the whole world ! That was an important fact in the future war that General MacArthur had not studied, because A and H had not yet been invented, at West Point. <br /> <br /> We can go back to 1962 now. After MacArthur ended his speech at West Point, he became an older and wiser soldier, and since retiring from the US military, a great statesman in his sense of war and absolute infertility. The only thing that General MacArthur taught at an early age, from his father-in-law in the civil war, Douglas Douglas MacArthur, which he held throughout his life is that for a soldier like him, war should be the last resort and not the first in resolving issues among nations. In this is the soldiers who have to fight and die in it. It took a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, that General MacArthur finally realize the health and wisdom of his father, who was the recipient of the Medal of Honor in Congress, just like that!
