After several very good ratings to SUPERB degree, I was very pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, angry, pain, guilt and a very convincing devil. <br /> <br /> I initially expected to see many special effects, like a lover's hug, blew me away with the accuracy and health of it. Brian, I'm blown away again with your technician with a story story and your sponsorship of special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the head of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Ibari, Best Actor, was the first choice. I have made Lopez look like a child compared to Cassadia. :) <br /> <br /> In general, the story of acting and acting was of high quality and wonderful, wonderful effects. I wish it were longer. I am looking forward to The Dreamless with very high expectations.
