This film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 years 2007. I saw it again last night after I have not seen it since high school. While she was full of thirty feelings, and the acting was somewhat stereotyped, it was wonderful. The Story of Pearl S. Buck became lively through the charms of Lewis Reiner and Paul Mooney. The novel that won the Nobel Prize for Literature survives under the bosom of Sydney Franklin and tells along with an excellent scenario the story of farmer Wang Long, whose father got his bride, a girl from the slave of the local owner's kitchen. In the story of Pak, Wang's success lies in his desire to listen to his wife, most of the time, love the earth. In the end, he realizes that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness and eternity. The stories of Buck have always been strong women portrayed in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. German-born Louise Rainer brings the life of a Chinese peasant woman in principle but firmly in her portrayal of Ulan. Similarly, Mony Wang captures the naive and honorable, who eventually falls between two worlds of the rich and the peasantry. Other classic characters include Charlie Graybaughn, Dorothy Giles, Kenzan Uncle Henry of Oz Wizard, Walter Connelly as a seamstress, co-conspirator, and Locke as the number one voice - but this time, not Charlie Chan. <br /> <br /> The classic movie may be defined as a movie you can watch over and over and never tire of. If this is indeed the case, this film is classic, no doubt at all.
