This cartoon was strange, but the story was actually deeper and more animated than other animated films. We have a camp girl with low self-esteem and hardly any other friends except the brother and sister who are just as miserable as they are. They reach the final low point and when the opportunity arises, you literally agree with a Demon-like demon. I found this film very real in life, and when things are not worse, the girl sees what she did and feels remorse and then changes and then helps this mysterious dark creature learn the human quality of love. The twin also improves, by helping small bears and then they become self-worth as well. A very positive message for the children, although some elements of the film were strange, but they were and still are very enjoyable. The music of Stephen Bishop (Tootsie Songs) made the film better
