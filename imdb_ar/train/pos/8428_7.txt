If this had been earlier in the Zatoichi series, it might have been better. It is good enough, as is the case for most of them, but the plot and characters seem very complicated for the series at this stage. The situation is extraordinarily curious: farmers in the province have a hero, a good coach (one time) and a samurai philosopher who starts a kind of Grange; both are opposed to ordinary local gangsters who want crop failure because it increases gambling revenues and their chances of capturing some land; Their boss or strong ally is apparently a hardliner who is dying to drink and gamble but secretly indulges in his harmful appetite. (This is also similar to Dracula, where the villains in subsequent Zatoichi films tend to do them increasingly.) These characters have enough meaning so they deserve to be against Zatoichi as originally painted, but now he has lost a lot of nuances, changes in some characters, Such as the good coach and the angry sister of a man killed by Zatoichi, need more time, so the film should give it, so that the story looks volatile, as if some scenes are missing. Other than that, the film shows the virtues of most others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, creating a dynamic scene, believable, uniquely recognizable (its absence is evident in the occasional episode where the director lacks it only), and technical quality conceals its nature: Which is fantastically diverse for limited groups, so its restrictions do not seem to exist. Of course there is the main actor, whose presence makes him, like his performance, everything works. This must be one of the best sustainable series in film history.
