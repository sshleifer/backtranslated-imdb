Another run from South Park came to an end. It was not as strong a ring as I had hoped, but Night of the Living Homeless was stronger than the producers of Stanley Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary, or Erectile Dysfunction. It is still not possible to hold a candle to Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobs, but some episodes can not. <br /> <br /> Night of the Living Homeless is a zombie parody, done in a way that only South Park thought of. From. Instead of meat eating the zombie, the entities have become homeless that seek change and seem to survive it. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are closing in the center of the community, though this time on the roof, where they can clear the scene. There is a particularly funny moment when a member discovers that his house has been left homeless, leaving Randy with no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys began to solve the problem, with the full story behind the seizure of the homeless trying to deliver a message, but being without serious inspiration. South Park is at best often when it is ridiculous. Matt and Trey played the game safely this week, and did not really criticize the problem of homeless people, but ridiculed them. <br /> <br /> The moment of shock comes when a world depicts itself in an attempt to avoid homelessness. . This is the first time he has committed suicide in South Park, and we watch the poor man miss his mind, and then try to shoot him several times during his painful death. There is another moment inspired by South Park. <br /> <br /> In general, the episode was funny, but it was prevented from being fantastic by blocking any real comment on the homeless and sticking directly to a coma. The ending is rather funny, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait until October for the next batch of episodes. It is a long journey, but we must greet South Park for being. The show seems to be running out last season, but it is now fully back.
