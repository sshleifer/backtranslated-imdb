When Burns came out of Paris, I completely rejected her. I was not in the overall Madonna and vogue phenomenon. I thought it would be artificial and ridiculous. How wrong you were about this movie. I saw him after the film ended for ten years and spent it and bought it. It took me to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt as if I knew all the personalities personally. The 1980s were spectacular and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a wonderful job! I went online and discovered what some of the original cast members were doing, but I could not locate them all. If anyone has any information about any of the cast members, please let us know. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make another documentary. loved it
