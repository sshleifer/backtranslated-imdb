When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in a trance in this film, my expectations were that I would watch the whole movie low. The only reasons I gave her the chance were Julie Walters' brilliant and friend recommendation. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be a great sort of lady farce "Ms. Insightful Comedy." Pasdar is completely credible and empathetic like an ambitious businessman who needs to release the female part of his being by dressing on occasions. He delivers these needs to the public in a completely believable way.Jolie Walters is wonderful, as is her habit, like the owner who teaches unconditional love.
