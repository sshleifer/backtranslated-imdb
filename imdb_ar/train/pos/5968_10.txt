When you encounter a jewel like this, you realize why the decade of the 1980s was the greatest decade to live in. She ruled rock music, as well as did movies ... special horror movies. Filmmakers knew how to enjoy us, and "trick or cure" is obvious to this. When Rocky Sammy Core, who probably wrote after W.A.S.P. Singer Blackie Lawless, die in a hotel fire, admire Eddie # 1, is dazed. Go to a friend & dj Nuke (Jane Simmons) for support. Knock gives him a copy of the last recording done by Sami; this is the only version available. The radio station was given to be operated on Halloween night directly. When Eddie plays, he returns Sami in some way. He helps Eddie with the bullies in school, but then gets out of control. It's definitely a great movie. The bad thing is, this film is out of print. I finally paid $ 25.00 to get it from eBay. You should also ... $$ spend well!
