A sweet funny story for two people crossing paths while preparing for weddings. The former police clerk and the public school teacher are in a new place in New York, although they marry other people. It may be a little trite in that "partners" are type A characters, while our heroes are more relaxed. Nothing heavy, but he made me smile. A pity for men - selling the corner of Natasha Henstridge, the girls - selling them happy romance, everyone wins!
