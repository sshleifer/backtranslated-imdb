Life Begins is a wonderful pre-created movie that includes some of the best of the times. It is located in the maternity ward of the hospital, especially in the women's room, which is expected to face a problem. Including an elderly woman, a strong unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian, and the main character (Loretta Young), who is serving 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) in the hospital every second painful to see that everything will be fine. Ellen McMahon plays the role of a nurse who is wonderful at her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very fun and fun. Not terribly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen. Great acting everywhere. Loretta Young is gorgeous here at prime. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is as honest as possible. Remember his innocence Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is as wonderful as ever, a key element of the code and a good reason.
