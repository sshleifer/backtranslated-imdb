"Winchester" 73 was the first Western film series to feature James Stewart and Anthony Mann. As in most of them, Stewart's hero has a violent advantage that threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the "One in a Thousand" gun that is about to compete in a shootout at Dodge City's Dodge on July 4, 1876. Into the city, Lynn McAdam (Stuart) (Millard Mitchell) who were on the trail of Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) to spend the last shout. They arrive in time to see Marshal White Geer running Lola (Shelley Winters) outside town. It turns out that Henry the Dutchman is also in the city to shoot a gun. Lynn and Dutchman Henry unleash the desired prize by winning Lin, but the Dutchman steals Len from Venice and runs away. <br /> <br /> Lane and Holland's Spiderman Henry traveled across the country where they met Lula with her cowardly lover Steve Miller (Charles Drake) standing in the US cavalry camp waiting for attack by Indians led by Young Paul (Rock Hudson) who He won the prestigious prize by killing prominent runner John McIntyre. He got the gun by deceiving Henry in poker. Kill Young Bull during the attack and pass the gun to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, upon returning to the farm, Lola and Steve met with the notorious gunman Waco and Johnny Dean (Dan Doria) who killed Steve and takes a valuable gun and no lula for himself. When Deane meets Dutch Henry, he is allowed to return his "weapon", which he plans to kill later. In the town of Toscosa, Lynn Deane is killed while Henry's Dutch plans are being held to keep the bank for the worse and flee into the hills with Lynn's chase. In one of the best final exercises ever, the two met in the final standoff. <br /> <br /> I think this film was the only film of Stewart / Mann collaborations filmed in B & W. They are beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the "wide open spaces" and in particular the final confrontation. Stewart plays against writing, and the hero plays a violent retaliatory advantage, a passion he will carry in future films with Man. <br /> <br /> As is the case in most Westerners, this film includes a group of veteran veterans of today's contracted players. In addition to the above, JC Fleippen appears as Cavalry Regiment, Steve Brody, James Milikan, John Dusit and Chuck Roberson as various participants, Ray Till as the police chief who regularly chases Tony Curtis, James Best as rising soldiers, Edmund Cobb, Yowlachie and John War Eagle in different roles In the Dodge City sequence. <br /> <br /> A classic Western in every sense of the word. He was responsible for re-generating Stuart's life as a star of action.
