My Super X-Girlfriend is the hell of a roller coaster ride. The special effects were excellent and the fashion wore Uma Thurman Bubba hubba. Uma Thurman is a comedian actress, but she has proven that everyone is wrong and in turn a crazy friend. It was simply fantastic !!! Locke Wilson was also good as his normal face, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The cast was also great, especially Fares which was very good (much better than in Scary Movie). <br /> <br /> Ivan Ritman managed to direct this film because if it was not right for him and Uma Thurman, it would not have been good. It is clear that this film is 10/10 because it is a representative (Uma Thurman), it is a director, screenplay and from the original drawing line. This movie is highly recommended.
