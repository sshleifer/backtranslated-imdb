<br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites. I saw her during my college studies in the early 1990s, and while I was unable to identify thirty things in the film, I felt that the story, characters and film in general were first class. For people who have spoken negatively about Indian summer, do not hesitate to stick to your films of Armageddon exaggerated type and leave movies with a wonderful and healthy story for those who can appreciate it.
