I have just read the latest comments about this film and I would like to respond. You may not be familiar with the original story of the rap group NW.A. Dating back to the beginning of 1988, in 1989 left the ice cube band to go solo and eventually in 1991, the band crumbled when Dr.dre left. Which led to a lot of beef starting to leave ice cubes and dr.dre in 1991. This story was somewhat based on that. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this movie was more than 90 minutes of laughter, the way they made it clear that the bootie juice song is a political statement that was a joy. Not to mention the tasty "Love Song" was attached. And when his ass is shot from Vanilla Sherbert, just like the CEO of the record company is also hilarious and the directors hit them every time as well. <br /> <br /> It's possible that people who did not enjoy this movie would not have been or were complete idiots, my opinion
