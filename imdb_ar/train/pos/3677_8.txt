Fortunately, I saw this on a recent flight to Singapore (I thought I missed it at the Film Festival). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) for 20 directors presenting love in different pockets of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorites is "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Quarn (The Great Predictions and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was shot in a single shot and featuring Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> "The Queen Brothers" "Tuileries Championship" starring Steve Busemi was a hilarious subway! Juliette Pinochet and Willem Dafoe in "Place des Victoires" were painful. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Jellenhal as an American actress / narrator in the film "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" to imagine the improvement and sadness in such a short period of time was just wonderful. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood was a vampire victim in the film "Cartier de la Madeleine", while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in the film "Pre-Lachaise" by Wes Wiesken. br /> <br /> Nathalie Portman was as beautiful as the usual girlfriend of a French-looking visually impaired boy in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite many photos of acne, the more mature execution by Gina Rowlands in the film "Cartier Latino" was equally stimulating. <br /> <br /> This movie is ideal for those suffering from ADHD because each sequence is carefully operated in thought. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotes. One in particular is the husband of a cheating husband who eventually left his mistress to stay with his wife dying in her last days: "Pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love."
