Yes, real classic! This is what revolves around the British drama and realism and the use of minimal special effects (and over exaggerated budgets). I last saw this drama when it was last shown on British Ground Television in 1994. It must really be seen by anyone who loves a scary plot, there are no big names, but none of the greatest actors. Unknown, this great drama is unlikely to be broadcast any time soon. I recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, and now again, I will be able to enjoy this truly great British drama. You should try to enjoy them too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horopene
