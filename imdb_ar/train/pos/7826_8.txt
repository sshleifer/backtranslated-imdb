Described as the story of Steve Pico - played excellently by Denzel Washington, as you would expect - this was actually the most Donald Woods story, performed by Kevin Klein. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly made of Klein as a serious actor, and was surprisingly good in this role. <br /> <br /> Attenborough gave the kind of direction you would expect, and the audience's scenes were often those of the kind that you could only reach. <br /> <br /> The rest of the crew was well qualified and did a good job, ending up as a sad story about South Africa, which is still far from the distant past.
