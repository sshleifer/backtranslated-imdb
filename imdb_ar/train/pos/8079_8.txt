There are not a lot of reviews, so I think I would add one. <br /> <br /> Do not go along with other reviews! This was a great film. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of very few Indian directors who can put a really good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay have provided another wonderful example of acting, as well as bhoomika as well, which was somewhat unexpected, but wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that there was not much noise about the version. <br /> <br /> Or other films / awards nominations, taking into account the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Better than Khaki I thought and I think Khaki also had a good film. <br /> <br /> It's a fairly long film, but it's definitely worth it and while watching it, it certainly looks like a long time. <br /> <br /> The next RKS movie and the next AB, Akshay, which seem to work well together, can not wait ... For example, Bumika's behavior was also good in the film and should be good if it continues the same way. the future.
