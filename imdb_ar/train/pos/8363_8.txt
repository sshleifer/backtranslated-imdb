This is one of the best Edgar Wallace films of the German series - it has all the basics for the return of Wallace's very interesting crime film of the 1960s: although His Majesty, Mr. Kinski, you still have a young Joachim 'Blacky "Fuchsberger, starring again As a smart American woman, you have a young man Eddi Arendt in his best role (and ideally also) - a great and sophisticated British personal server - and you have (not too small) Lowitz as sad yet "dry" cynicism (and thus: very entertaining) police investigator. Moreover, you will get a strange and very scary "wicked man" behind the frog mask (hence the title of the movie!), West Get on Crazy Crazy Soundtrack, and the classic motion pictures of B movies, partially filmed the most violent views (please be reminded of the time when it grew up!), Screams of screaming queens, and ... ... all these ingredients vibrate well in a wonderful cocktail of "Edgar Wallace" Pure German - highly recommended !!
