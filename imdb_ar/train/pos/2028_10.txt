Burlinson and Thornton both perform well in this film, along with Dennehy. Although he initially thought it was about love only, it was actually deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this film, and puts among one of the best I've ever seen. The horse sights are absolutely fantastic! No horse lover would like this movie! <br /> <br />
