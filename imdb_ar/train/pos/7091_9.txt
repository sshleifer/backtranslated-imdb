The big problem is where to start. This film needs your attention in the next couple of hours. It's better not to waste time getting coke because there's a risk you can not follow. But good there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis has to travel to a time machine to learn some antivirus programs for a virus that made animals rule the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes, he ended up first in 1990, then in World War I and how it all looks. Like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent texts ever made. This former man in Monty Phyton knows exactly how SF stories must be geniuses like his choice of cast was not better, there is the crazy Brad Pitt (his performance in the unforgettable asylum) and Bruce the wonderful Willis who proves to be more than some of the Schwarzenegger wants. It's a movie that you can watch over and over again because the script is very strange and complex (and yet you can follow it) each offer gives you other surprises. One of my favorites is great.
