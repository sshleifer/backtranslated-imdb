Oliver Twist had to provoke controversy and success after Dickens published it in 1837. His image of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new, and making his central characters in the novel included criminals another innovation. /> <br /> One day he was walking in London and passing a young woman was a friend of hers. Hi, but she was harsh with him. He could not understand this. A few days later they met again and asked what he had done to disturb her. "Well, if you have to know, I do not like your latest novel," she said. "Really, everyone is thinking about it." He was puzzled: "What's wrong with that?" She said, "Charles, I'm a Jew, how can you make up a character like Vagin?" He did not expect that: "Well ... you know that the trial of Ikey Solomon, the thief's boss last year, is a model for a fugen and he was a Jew." <br /> <br /> Dickens found that this did not resolve matters. "Yes, he got what he deserved, but Charles did not call him" Solomon the Jew "like you called" Jewish "Vagin, and Solomon did not plan to kill him. Dickens had to admit that he might have carried him away. He left thinking what she said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist has published several editions. Dickens tried to improve the little fag. Then he got an idea. He rephrased the chapter entitled "The Last Night of Vaughn Survives," indicating the man's fears as he faces hanging. He also added some additional details. <br /> <br /> He told his female friend of his intention to change Fagan. After a day or so met her at a friend's house. I looked at him like a fool. "Did not you like the changes?" He asked. "Yes, you kept them in prison, but you did not see how scared he was in the cell of death in prison." The young girl noticed that, but she felt so poor that he "What are the details?" She replied, "When you see him for the first time now, he is cooking himself dinner. "I read it was in the fireplace, but I have to bomb the corridor." Dickens smiled as he looked at it and expected a sign of recognition. "He's eating pork, my dear ... Look - he's not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook her head, and left his friend's house. You did not talk to him for years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never got rid of his personal fanaticism, but the attitude led to a partial attempt to modify his latest completed novel.In our mutual friend (1865) he has a simple character, Mr. Rhea, Before the unscrupulous owner to collect high revenues from poor tenants. The owner believes that Mr. Ria will be blamed for being a Jew. <br /> <br /> But Mr Rhea is a good man. He's a very good man. He is a very good man, very good, very good to an incredible degree. If he saw Mr. Rhea at work, he would chase him away with a stick. <br /> <br /> The anti-Semitic image of Vagin remains to this day. It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a writer overcome by the novel. However, in presenting the story on the film, it still causes problems for scriptwriters and filmmakers: How, after the Holocaust, can one treat a film to a worthy novel without arousing fanaticism? David Lane showed how the appearance of Alec Guinness in one or two scenes shows a human aspect and in the face of the mob in the end with real dignity. Sir Carroll Reid, in his musical version of the novel did so better yet, because of rewriting in the original musical scenario. <br /> <br /> Oliver was converted to a West End musical in the mid-1960s, then took to Broadway where he was once again hit. Thanks to Lionel Bart's impressive results, including "Food Glorious Food," "I I Review the Situation," "Think of Yourself," "Boy for Sale," "Who Will Buy," "As Long as I Need It" deserves this success. Reed has performed well in his roles, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes, Ron Moody as Vagin, Mark Leicester as Oliver, Jack Wilde as Dodger, Shani Wallis as Nancy, and Harry Seacombe as Mr. Pompel. There have been no major musical successes in Hollywood for a decade - the last musical won the best film Oscar was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> The Fagin - How to deal with the eternal cartoon problem? Well in musical Fagin was not arrested, tried and executed for the murder committed. After all, Lian showed that Vaughn tried to control a confederation in his actions. But here he realizes that he is too much to rely on this kind of harsh life. Although he loses his treasures (those stolen things that he kept because he knows their value, and marvels at its beauty), he decides to fix it. He is allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful author, the technical dodger. I do not think Dickens would have appreciated the change (maybe his female friend), but the modern audience certainly accepts it as appropriate.
