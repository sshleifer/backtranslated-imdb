<br /> <br /> I must confess to enjoying bad movies. I love them watching them all. Special horror. Me and my friends all meet after a hard week at school and work, hired some crazy tapes, asked for pizza and blew up. One of those we got in the Hollywood video, was this, Zombie Bloodbath. This box had a big box, so I was expecting less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a housing project built on a nuclear facility that contains layers of land in bulldozers, and the other covering underground layers simply. Residents of this neighborhood find the enclosed facility when some children fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombie. <br /> <br /> From this point, it's a big city. Fundamental influences and actions never end until the end credits expire. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not a great art, but this dialogue, which includes an internal dialogue and a great joke, was one of our favorites for the evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party bars" that I was happy to see. You can say it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the manager looks like Brendan Fraser (he has a hijab) and it's just a land trip.
