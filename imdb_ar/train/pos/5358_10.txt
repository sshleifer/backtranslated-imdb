This is one of the best 80s movies in my group that I think about all the time. <br /> <br /> The Running Man is one of Arnold`s best and most diverse films to this day, and when I saw The Running Man I was very excited to watch such a movie. I adore all battles and this is a really special film. Jesse Ventura, the legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven the First Thursen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yafet Cotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr., who always seem to love death in his films have been killed in films such as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cup 2, Predator 2, and others. All Arnold fans must love this movie from start to finish because its activity is packed and full of stars and one of Arnold's best so far!
