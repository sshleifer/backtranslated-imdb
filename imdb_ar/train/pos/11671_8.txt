"Against All Flags" is a classic swashbuckler thing. It contains all the elements that adventure lovers can hope for and more in this element, the girl in distress is, in fact, not in real distress. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her best sports, running her opponents in defiance of the social norms of that period. Anthony Quinn rounded off the best of three reputed actors as the ruthless Captain Rock Brazilian. For classic adventure lovers, "Against All Flags" is a must. While it may not be in the same university just like some previous Errol Flynn works (Captain Ball and Sea Hawk, for example), they are still very exciting.
