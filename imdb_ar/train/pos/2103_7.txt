I do not know about "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a picture novel? I do not really know), but I have to admit, when I heard about Agent / Hero, I expect something quite different, more than I actually got. <br /> <br /> While it was startling to see it at first, it was good to watch this step along. You can never figure out where to go (some fluctuations are expected, but in general, you can never say that, if it will end in the end). Making more than the wonderful performance of the main actor and representative really good support, this watch is enjoyable. This is not the kind of action some people might hope or expect for such a film, but it's a really good mix.
