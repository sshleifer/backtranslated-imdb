A super comedy series from the 1990s (two series produced overall) suffered in UK rankings due to poor scheduling. When you're against well-known comedies like Minder, the best new comics will struggle to draw attention. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, she captured the series from the first episode and followed him eagerly. I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to be watching something else. Very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot it. <br /> <br /> Then I looked at it on the Internet and found that one of the extremists was trying to get both strings "on his own". <br /> <br /> Well, both strings are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1.
