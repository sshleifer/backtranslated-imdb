What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a small film for the kids and found that I enjoyed it more than my youth. Take wipes, not sad, just "moving" in parts. Finally, it is the flick of the entire family. Note: It takes two hours or more, so consider leaving the smaller house for this house. AP
