There are very few very funny films like this movie. I was lucky enough to watch this movie in a theater "reserved" for movie buffs like me, so it was not too embarrassing sitting there laughing, so my jaw was aching and my shirt sleeves wet from drying my eyes .... Sometimes the story was a little "slow", but maybe this was the best - a little rest between rolling down the hallways (almost fell off the bench ...) was very welcome.
