The real story is a handful of junkies who steal an untrustworthy businessman from drugs, jewelry, guns and money. Some may say this is the tragic story of America in the 1980s, when the Peace and Free Love Summit of the 1960s broke down on drugs and AIDS. Frankly, this is just ordinary people who have no purpose in life sitting high and decide to steal a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they get his things ... they will sit and sit again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this film and no surprises. The fact that Cox is trying to make some kind of popular heroes of these characters, with scenes of parties and montage of their loot, weak and humiliating. The story was in a better position with a more direct approach forward. As it is, this is just a sad story of the killing of drug dealers by young drug dealers. The bigger story, in many ways, is John Holmes. Is the center of this story anyway. This film should have been all about him, his life. He was the only person in Wonderland, where the wonders were about to fade. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes' life. It's not quite realistic, but it's more fun.
