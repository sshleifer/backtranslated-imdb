This is very dated, but this is part of the magic with this 1933 film. You can say the same thing for most Pre-Code movies; it's quite different, usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was the short run time, the great representation of Spencer Tracy, the beautiful face and the sweetness of Loretta Young that kept me enjoying and enjoying this amazing but intriguing film. <br /> <br /> You will be under intense pressure to find a beautiful girl from Trinna, who played her 20-year-old role and was already making her 50th film! (She started to act like a little boy, and the fact that she made the movies quickly in the old days.) The camera, despite its soft focus in most parts of the film, focused on Loretta's face and eyes several times and was fascinated by its beauty. <br /> <br /> Tracy Bell is slowly turning into a gracious man and a gracious man, thanks to Trinia, playing the role of a strange man with a cynical view of life. Spencer made his lines here so natural that you barely knew he was acting. <br /> <br /> Although they have small roles, supporting actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambo, Arthur Hall and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions after watching this 75-minute film history. I was particularly intrigued by Connolly's role as the minister / father figure in the camp. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit distant but - oh - these are the movies. This story revolves around two of the only Great Depression victims who try to stay in a "Hooverville" camp and end up becoming a very moving story.
