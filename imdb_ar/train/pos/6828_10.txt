John Cassavet (director of Rosemary's Peep) creates Broadway and the actor who turned into a director. Starring Gina Rowlands, John Cassavis himself, Ben Jazara, Juan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Flower Lambert and Laura Johnson and there is a veil for Peter Volk. The film's hypothesis: aging and film actress Jenna Rowlands are re-evaluating their lives after a fan dies in a car accident in an attempt to get her signature. The film is slow, dark, moody and frightening. Her cinematic look at the sixties, she reminded me of the child of Polanski Rosemary without the supernatural horror. The fears here are those faced by every successful actress, and will become obsolete and become useless in her career. Moreover, she feels that she has lived a life that lacks true, humane and worthy spirituality. She lived only for her career - no children, no charity, etc. The progressive disintegration of her personality is the flesh of this film. It is collapsing. It's in crisis. Gina Rawlands really entered into the tortured psyche of personality and acted well. She is a wonderful actress and a 1970 film. This is a refreshing contrast with films that are often violent at that time, or disaster movies or adventure thriller films. It's a movie that has a lot of deep feelings but has a cool and sarcastic feeling, as if Cassavetes criticizes mainstream films and actors from the 1970s. Either this or this movie is the product of the seventies which was in itself mocking in many aspects - trick Nixon, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not great, this film is not well known, but it is a very disturbing film with haunting moods. Glory to the late and late Casavit director who died in the late 1980s.
