What a wonderful movie. The idea of ​​countries that send people fighting each other with giant robots is a funny idea. The end is not just an occasion, it's more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm fascinated by the letters. It is unfortunate that we do not see the relationship between Achilles and Athens more sophisticated after just a kiss and Athens fear for the safety of Achilles. Their romantic relationship is very enjoyable. <br /> <br />
