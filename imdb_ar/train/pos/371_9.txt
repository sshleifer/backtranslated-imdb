I remember when this movie was for the Oscars and did not win in any category. For my life, I can not remember what it was, but there's one thing I can say: it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The fact that Steven Spielberg took out the film did not convince me of one thing. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's about the experiences of a black woman and her ordeal as she grows from girl to woman. There are lots of annoying and terrifying hints, but all are required to find out how much this woman has. Along the way, we see other women who have to endure their hardships and walk with them to salvation. Whoopi Goldberg made the most of his best performance of the game. Danny Glover must have also been nominated at least for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film is that it deals with its subjects humanely, not like some strange programs that appear on the screen just like with the latest "lover". I encourage anyone from any race to watch this movie. 9/10
