Luzhin Defense paints a wonderful film and an extraordinary and touching love story, drawing the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and personality. <br /> <br /> He offers John Tortoro what is likely to be his best role so far (thank God they did not give him Ralph Vince, who would have killed her). Similarly, Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her background on stage). To reach the Turturro chess master, her character has to show intelligence as well as love for the woman. Watson does not imagine the sexual life of beauty contests, but brings to her parts an attractive self-consciousness. <br /> <br /> In an opportunity meeting between Natalia (Watson) and Lucien, an offer of his loss of a chess piece that fell through a hole in his clothes - a specially crafted piece, which we later recognize in the film - has become a symbol of his hopes and aspirations. Later on, with the development of their love affair, dancing is akin to dancing (Lozin has learned to dance but with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with "bold and wonderful movements", thus enabling him to relax enough to play later at his best ). <br /> <br /> This is a story about a woman who inspires a man to achieve his greatest achievement, thereby finding a deeper, emotional and intellectual investigation (or so we lead us to believe - certainly, within the time frame, Natalia is something of a liberal woman rather than a person Prepares herself to be a typical wife and mother). <br /> <br /> The Italian collections are amazing. The complexity of characters and the skill of dialogue is a joy to the intelligent cinematographer, yet the film is sufficiently accessible to make it a popular hit, and it is well worth it. The game of chess is merely the optical background to the development of emotional and emotional film, although the game is treated with sufficient respect to convince the chess player of the presence of characters. Despite the tragedy of remarkable heights by a classical author, the final conclusion is surprising.
