I found this movie available to broadcast on Netflix and I thought I would try it. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Fior and David Kubit) who saw each other after their father died. Ryan and Theo first discuss about who did what. But later, Theo discovered that his brother Ryan was not only gay, but died of an incurable disease. Therefore, Ryan and Theo spend their time repairing their differences. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film. I've only seen Colm Feore in season 7 of 24 but it was fantastic in this. David Cobbit, the actor I've never heard of before, also did a great job. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to those who care about gay and lesbian. This is one movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
