This movie is a wonderful entertainment to watch with your wife or girlfriend. There are ample laughs and some very interesting little nudist stories happening here. The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth seeing in their natural beauty. The life of Maslin Beach is full of nudes and diverse personality types. The Australian coast scene, simply, is wonderful to see. What a place to visit, at least, and someday it might become my hideout. I really enjoy this movie and every time I watch it I enjoy it more. I like to see more of these characters and I always wonder what has become of them. Although the plot is fairly smooth, this film, of course, is a great excuse to sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudes and their personal stories.
