"Capitães de Abril" Very Good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. Imagination of the story is not of great importance, but it does not spoil the film. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia is not an exaggeration, and the film is also honored for his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia is still one of the greatest heroes of the April 25 Revolution. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles play wonderfully. Lisbon looks beautiful as it always has. do not miss! I liked this movie very much
