Mo and Larry are newborn couples, and have married Shim's sisters. In his own music studio, Shimb learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone! <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a new version of the movie "Brideless Groom" of 1947, widely regarded by many as one of the best Stooge movies with Shemp. The remake contains most of the footage from this movie. The new scenes, filmed on May 17, 1955, include the story of Mo and Larry getting married to Chimp sisters, as well as their cooking of Turkish turkey jam with turpentine oil! Some of the new scenes are also shown on the end of the movie (Double Dee Green was used; if you blink, you lose the multiplier look.) <br /> <br /> "Beware Husbands" would make a good movie with just a plot line of marriage from Sisters. Budget considerations, along with fewer bookings for a two-way comedy, have influenced the decision to use old footage. <br /> <br /> Although brand-new movies were still made by Stooges, most of its releases by 1955-1956 were made up of old films with a few new scenes. "Beware Husbands", while one of these hybrids, is fun and entertaining. We got to the most "Brideless Groom" again, and the new sights were funny enough to get the viewer through the movie. This film is one of the latest comedy films for Stooge that show new footage of Chimp, released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
