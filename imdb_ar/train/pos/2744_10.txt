A wonderful and disturbing film about the real, brutal and brutal murder of a small town family, besides what happened, the life of the killers, Dick Hickock and Berry Smith. <br /> <br /> No matter how much time passes, or how long this film may seem dated, it still resonates in the blurring of such criminal acts. A family of chaos, a decent farm family in the small town of Holcombe, Kansas; and the lost, brutal and sad life of Hickock and Smith. <br /> <br /> An interesting point in the film is that none of these immature, fearful criminals and criminals were contemplating going on something like this alone. But together they created a dangerous and deadly collective personality. One that nourishes the needs and pathology of all of them. They push each other along the way of "proving" something to each other. They were a man enough to do so; he did not want to be seen as too cowardly to complete his "big points"; unfortunate and dangerous residues of the desolate life they had lived. These two great children live in a criminal world that does not retreat from audacity; who constantly need to prove masculinity and durability. In this case, these needs were carried out until the killing of Clutters. <br /> <br /> The film has a somewhat emotional look on the Clutter family, but the point is important. These were respectable, law-abiding citizens of small towns who did not deserve this terrible fate. The film also gives us a sense of young life in Hickock and Smith. Perry Smith, whose life was full of security and love, but watched in horror when he took his family alcohol in a tragic way. Hickock, poor and largely left his own devices, unable to see his suitability, using his intelligence and charm to deceive anyone who was in touch with him. <br /> <br /> Interesting, perhaps first, look at the death penalty, and what goals we hope to achieve. Is not this more than retaliation for the murder that shook a nation at a time we did not have to face fully so far? There may be such predators among us, or putting these men at the end of a rope really provides a deterrent to the childish and brutal attitudes of such men ? Is it possible to deter men who live the life of deception and work under the radar, believing that they deceive everyone who comes into contact with them? To deter, you must believe that you are likely to be arrested. Is it possible to deter these men who think they are too smart to be arrested? Who committed hundreds of simple crimes and fled from them? This was supposed to be a "belt", "no witnesses". <br /> <br /> When Hickok discovers that he can not charm and deceive agents in the way that store clerks have. Smith, who thinks he deserves such a fate anyway, and who seems to be the only one who has really realized the seriousness of what they did, tells the story willingly when he knows that Hickock has succumbed to it. Hickock flickers first. A silly chicken game between two immature men, with emotional and serious damage. <br /> <br /> A wonderful psychological thriller tells the story of a horrific crime in the history of this nation. Amazing photos of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles have made their careers.
