Extase, which is interspersed with symbolism and full of great cinematic photography, is much more than the dramatic drama we all expect. It is almost a silent film, with the dialogue in German and German very simplified in it. The filmmakers may have planned to reach the film on as wide a European audience as anyone with a small level of education at German school can easily avoid translation. The story is of little importance anyway, where the film succeeds on a film level and not a story. The symbols of fertility and the power of nature dominate the human figures - there are even scenes where the flowers hide the face of the alleged star, Hadi Lamar - and there are moments that will remind the viewers of the works of Dreyer, Virtov and Reinhold. If the film has any message to convey, I think it is a political message: the bourgeois man is timid and helpless; the working-class man is a happy and productive creature. Women are the Creator, who can not be fulfilled until they have a child. This combination of Soviet socialist realism and national socialist ideology does not dominate the film in any way - it is nice to see it from start to finish - but it puts it in a very distinguished artistic age. And, oh, Heidi gets rid of them.
