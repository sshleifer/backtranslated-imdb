"Serious Offender" is the story of a girl who looks hostile to society and how she got that way. It's based on a true story, and although I'm angry at the one-stop-it-and-out-of-the-box characterization and dedication of her unbelievable lawyer, I have to accept life as art, and there are people like that. <br /> <br /> The film has worked for me, because although there is little mitigation of the personality of the title until almost the end, the person is gradually moved to empathy with it, as the film shows how it reached its current state - They destroy themselves more than being anti-social. <br /> <br /> Truly a moving film, will make a mass in your throat, when you think about it - which will often be. <br /> <br /> Despite its many drawbacks, (including being difficult to see, sometimes because of physical functions and suicide attempts), this is another production I am proud of for Canadian communication.
