I second suggestion to turn this into a movie, it would be great !! I was also amazed by the story and character building in this game. I've played it over and over again (over 20 times) just to try something different and become more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eat your heart !! This must be done in a movie !!!!! If someone wants some help to start a petition to make this movie, please contact me. I would like to help with this project any day. The graphics are great for the PS1 and make you forget it PS1 most of the time. Make many different side tasks every time you play them.
