This film is really good plot, acting like a puzzle forcing the viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes the viewer really look forward to solving the puzzle. Very good fighting scenes. There are a lot of different fighting styles (although one of the styles was a little unrealistic for me, but my only opinion) is watching it and it's a fantastic show. The only thing that might be annoying is the actors look. A little too bisexual (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at Kung Fu movies, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, so "Five Venoms" is a great choice.
