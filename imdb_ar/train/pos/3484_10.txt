This is the best movie at all times! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw him in the early 1970s, once he appeared on Bulgarian television, and I immediately loved him (I was 14 years old). After 25 years, I bought it on video, and a few months ago finally appeared on DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this film 35 years ago, as well as all my friends and family. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time and he immediately loved it too (and this is the generation that grew up watching Hollywood movies in practice only and not talking or understanding Russian at all!). What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so distinctive? It's hard to say, because it's hard to describe what beauty is ... but the truth is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same fun as it did the first time. I can not remember any other film, no matter how many millions it cost or how wonderful it is ... Shabu, Daniele Maestro! Bulgaria loves you!
