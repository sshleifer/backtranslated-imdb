This bet starts between Edgar Allan Bo and a journalist ... Bo bet that the guy can not spend a whole night in a creeping castle. Well, of course he can, but does he come out safe? It's hard to say with all those strange people who are not supposed to be there wandering around, including Barbara Steele Glacier. This film is somewhat strange in that the presentation is in French and English, and turns back and forth several times. Maybe this is because of the loss of dialogue parts? It is also dark and suffocating to some extent, because one can not see beyond a small circle of light generated by candles and the like, in addition to the sense of panic and impending imminent at all times. This version (on the clamp) is also uncensored, and I wondered what could be censored in a 1964 film so I saw the naked scene, and I think it might be. In general, this is very good and bleak black and white. Barbara Steel certainly makes the film too. 8 of 10.
