This was the best documentary I've ever seen in my life !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to learn more about Stacy Peralta, and was surprised and happy to know that one of his movies was also. Great post stacy! I was back at work last week, I've been bored oh * & ^% less, this movie came. Growing up in Orange County in the 1980s, I was walking up and down the local beaches as well as my father did when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me at the end of each week, my body shook, I took the skateboard and then moved out. This film is my only family. It was the way before my time, but it was wonderful to see what these guys were going through. Real pioneers! This film is a collectors item.
