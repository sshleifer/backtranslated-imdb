Dark Angel is the intersection between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy Love in the Ruins - the portrayal of the not-too-distant future as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once you swallow the hypothesis that all modern technology can stop by the "pulse", it provides an entertainment perspective to explore the personalities and relationships of the two main characters - Max (Dark Angel / Bike Messenger) and Logan (the rich rebel). It seems uneven, perhaps as a result of a variety of authors, but meets both the lively, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, which looks both strong and durable but sensitive. I think Fox has done it again.
