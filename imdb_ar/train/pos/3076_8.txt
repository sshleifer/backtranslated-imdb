Why did not panic ever get a good theater show easily: It is very intelligent, and perhaps it could be difficult for viewers to compare with the beauty of the US in his search for the crisis of middle age, and Sopranos and Analyze This in his study. Of the illegal events between family life. Although the panic may seem to be derived from a non-original material, Promel's vibrant characters, along with the grand dialogue and observation direction, make the film a realistic look at the decline of a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. , A professional killer working for his father (Sutherland) to kill the contracts. He lives a double life, with his wife (Ullmann) and his son unaware of his real trade. In the middle of his life, he is increasingly disgusted by what he has done throughout his life. Under his calm, the assembled facade evokes pent-up resentment to understand his father's control of his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels preoccupied and decides that it is time to give up the family company. <br /> <br /> The fact that the writer / director Henry Bromel decided to make the profession his main character trying to get away from killing the contract is available. His characters are sophisticated and very reliable, the viewer is treated smoothly and realistically and the dialogue is written so deeply and naturally that the focus is on Messi's conflicting personality instead of his job as a killer. Promel's text sounds like a Shakespearean tragedy, with the specific theme of continuing fate. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Messi creates a tragic figure who is easily sympathetic and turns into a new performance in the brood, as always. Donald Sutherland is also expected to be as effective and abusive as his arrogant father. Ulman's dramatic role as Messi's wife is a good change for the comedian. Think of a scene in a bicycle shop, where her mood and accuracy are silenced in a scene of emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromell's first feature, Panic, is a film that was crafted with sincerity. With first class representation, reasonable text, brief conversation, and a gentle direction, we hope this personal study is just a taste for ProMile to create real-looking characters. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
