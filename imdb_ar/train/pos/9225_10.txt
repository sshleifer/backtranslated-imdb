The beauty of Bo Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Bo, more than ever, looks like a widow with visits from her "dead husband" (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Pu has to buy the body of a young man so that her ghost of a pair of turns from ghost to physical life. Can they find a suitable candidate? How will she do it so Tony can do something? <br /> <br /> With Bo's features, John's unique direction, the presence of Quinn, and thanks to John, a very strange look at the entire film, this movie is fun.
