I must start by saying that it has been a long time since I saw him, but I have seen him 5 times or more; a wonderful little magnificence clearly inspired by the musical / comedic association of new stars or fading with prominent musical groups. Kai Kaiser's secrets will be a good example. <br /> <br /> Launching Spike Jones is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and form part of the work, and do a good job of supporting. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, and Bodhi Hackett, a part rumor that offered to Le Costello, therefore, Abbott and Costello replaced potential customers. I do not know if this is true. <br /> <br /> All of them, a wonderful movie, but it is important to have a lot of Spike Jones and his band in the film's history. I hope it will be released, as I have not seen or heard it for two decades now. Hope not to be lost
