I enjoyed this movie. I have not seen Andy Griffiths throughout the ages and felt that he fits this role perfectly. I've linked it to comedy but I'm glad to see it as versatile. <br /> <br /> I was not disturbed because Duti's "anxiety disorder" was probably not literally a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of any kind of phobia and nervousness, and these can take a wide range of quantitative and qualitative forms. They are clearly sensitive with insensitive forces as understood by local Indians but not by any Anglos. It is not surprising that this personality is fragile and strange name. <br /> <br /> Although this is a light family film, it is actually more complex than it seems. Also, Hiram's development was finally a pleasant surprise for me and linking all previous actions together in a pack. It is interesting to think about the possibility of this spiritual guidance.
