Now this show looks like most other shows of its kind from the mid-1990s, but the only thing in this program is that it's different, they use a lot of comedy and motion in this show and maybe very little drama. Personally I think it was a good show, and I can not understand why they will cancel it. The good thing is that the fan base in this show has been in place since 1997 so far. <br /> <br /> I hope that WB will replay the show or even make a movie, and I know it will become impossible to do, but it's painless to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend if you do not see it to find a DVD for all 13 episodes, because the characters are fantastic, the story lines are good, the comedy is good, the whole presentation is fantastic.
