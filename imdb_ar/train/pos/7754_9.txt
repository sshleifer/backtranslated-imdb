Movie Any Way The Wind Blows Tom Barmans (also known as the first man in the movie "dEUS") to form the rock. The film begins entirely in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on a sunny morning and skips somewhat superficially between events that are filled with days of dozens of main characters. When the movie ends, you have a lot of things to think about, because most of the different story lines are left wide open. <br /> <br /> The movie contains an audio track (purely basic) that will shake you socks off. In most scenes, music really enhances the overall atmosphere and general feeling, making the film hallucinatory to watch at certain times of time. The main scene in the film, concert, was filmed well. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use video techniques, as his characters were dancing in one of the best tracks I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> A script is great stuff. The camera angles and colors are selected well. "Fashion" is very hot and "seventies" very very. I loved acting (most). <br /> <br /> The thing I like most in the film is the pleasant touches of silly, surreal, extremely dry or even sarcastic humor that intersects. <br /> <br /> Without claiming to be a comedy (this is certainly not a comedy but an alternative art piece), it still manages to make its audience laugh and even laugh at times. > This is the first appearance of the directors who do not have to be the end. I hope to see more Tom Berman films in the future because I have had fun. Cheers.
