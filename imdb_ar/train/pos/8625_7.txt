Jörg Buttigreet moves a little from his films and subjects at times, even to my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are made technically, with often also a deeper meaning to their subjects. This film is a perfect example of his works. <br /> <br /> This movie is also difficult to classify. In fact, it is not a film with a story, in the sense that it has a beginning, an intermediate and an end. He also has no main character but instead focuses on seven different suicides and murders, in seven different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories are listed with many students, although some of them are of course more "interesting" and realistic than others. They are not necessarily connected but together they are still telling a story. The film does not feel detachable at all. All the different stories have a different feeling towards them, while Buttgereit narrates the story without using almost any words (as usual in his style), but instead allows the images and emotions of the characters to tell the whole story. Helps make this movie an effective film to watch. <br /> <br /> Again, not all production values ​​are too high and this may scare some people. However, this particular film helps to adjust the tone and ambience of the entire film and its dark, disturbing and depressing manifestations. <br /> <br /> The film Buttgereit I enjoyed. <br /> 7/10
