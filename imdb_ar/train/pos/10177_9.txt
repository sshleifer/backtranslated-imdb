"De Grot" is a wonderful Dutch film, based on the book written by Tim Krabi. Among his other books, "Het Gouden Ei", made in the great Dutch thriller Spoorloos ("The Vanishing") in 1988. This book is not as good as that thriller (although it is much better than the American version Which is also called "vanishing") but there are times when it approaches. <br /> <br /> Especially since the opening moments are wonderful. We see a man, later known as Fedja van HuÃªt, coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags, he obviously runs somewhere across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted upon. The kind of thrill you will not normally have in the opening scene is created like this. Later, we see how Aigon makes a deal in Thailand with a woman, both of whom say they have never done anything like that. <br /> <br /> From this point, the film always retrieves the flash back and glows. We see how Aigon, still a child (played here by Eric van der Horst), endorses a man named Axel (as a child played by Benga Bruening). We learn how they grew up as friends and sort of how Axel became (as an adult played by Marcel Hensma) a criminal. At the same time Aigon goes to college and settles with a woman. In this period he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything with him. <br /> <br /> The film is historical. Egon and Axel appear as children, more than as students and young people in the mid-1930s. But from time to time, as I said, the film returns to what it was as a child and leaps forward again. Every time we see children, it shows something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Little spoilers are here. <br /> <br /> The title means "cave," which is a cave that gives the film its happy ending, although in fact it is not happy. Like the start, the finish is great. The middle part of the film is fun in a way that distracts us from the first scenes, just to get back at that stage in the end. It's the editing that gives the film a happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is somehow happy.
