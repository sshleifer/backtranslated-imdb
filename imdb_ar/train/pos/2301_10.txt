Really ... and the film is stunning, although it is not very common ... very moving and almost changing life ... it was for me at least. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching and buying ..... has been added to the list of favorite movies .... it is number one now .... <br /> <br /> It is a very influential film all People see it .. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon ..... we will be just incredible. It is now my favorite film and I just saw it today and recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 so long as you are fairly mature ...... If you do not try to feel the feelings of the characters you will never get the true meaning and true value of this film .... but In fact it is incredible .... just watched it because it will change the way some people look to life .... worth watching 5/5
