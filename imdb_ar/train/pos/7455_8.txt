Goldeneye will always go as one of the most legendary games in VG history. There is no doubt about that. But this game, though quite different, could be a modern Bond hero, in its time. <br /> <br /> This was not a commodity-based bond game from another way. This was quite new; a script game. Who even had his own theme song! (You will not be a bond without it, haha!) The game was excellent, and if you're a lover of bond games or movies alike, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most of the games, members of the acting team photographed their characters themselves, rather than imaginative creations of the game. Which gives her a more cinematic feeling. Through the story of "Able to Bond", you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie. <br /> <br /> Fun in all aspects, from start to finish. Even after overcoming the game, there is still much to be done. With the rating system and unlockables to be achieved, in addition to its multi-player functions, this game is distinct. Despite being very old now, in the years video game. It is still a good game you can pick up and play when you feel the need to get more bonds in your life. So far just thinking about it, I've hung a theme song in my head. Such a wonderful and well written story. <br /> <br /> The story appears on the screen, as if the actors were in front of them, all of them amusing like the game itself. He worked wonderfully, in a real bond fashion. It can only be called "gorgeous" and "absolutely fabulous". <br /> <br /> I will now go to throw this game. If you do not play it yet, you're missing!
