The way to pronounce Thomas Neumann can be summed up. It's annoying and beautiful, but you realize that this music is like the other Newman works, listening to a woman-like soundtrack, meeting Joe Chan Black Reebach and reminding you of other films like a story unfolding on the screen. While Sullivanz is leading a tour of America in an attempt to escape a psychotic man she thinks of in the Getaway game, the Irish guerrillas are Miller Crosing, while the full text of guilt and salvation can be summed up by the Copolah and Lion Gangs. Although I have seen all of this before, I feel that this should not be considered as a critical criticism of Sam Mendez's film which I repeat painfully and beautifully. The only drawbacks against it are a very slow start for twenty minutes and I was puzzled by the events that caused the betrayal of Michael Sullivan . But if you stop thinking about the amount of emotional chaos that Spielberg may have caused with the story about a twelve-year-old father and son who are running for their lives, you can not help thinking about what a wonderful director Mendez is. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION is a film in which the actors make perfect presentations. I have never been keen on Tom Hanks, but he is very good here as he was in any championship role, maybe better. Paul Newman plays an Irish accent, but I did not think I was watching an American screen legend based on a false tone. Newman's performance is because of hidden body language. His character is torn apart by guilt but Newman has never milked or gone over the top. Although never before in Newman's best performance in the film, Britain's supporting actors are Craig & Lau, who also do not forget that they are American neurotics. While Lao will still have a long career as a leading actor, one wonders how Daniel Craig A personal representative is offered if he does not decide to become James Bond, a role that promises the end of the actor's career
