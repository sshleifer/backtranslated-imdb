The use of Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. Perhaps he was the most talented comedian of the silent era. This gives him an opportunity to showcase those talents in a short travel story. I have dealt with a man who lives in modern times, and we find it better to leave us in our own times. I have heard his voice before. I think he did some Beach Party movies, where he played some empty characters just to earn a few dollars. Sirling seems to have respected him and portrayed him that way. It's not a bad story. It shows how one interacts when we wish for something we do not own and get.
