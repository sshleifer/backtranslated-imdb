"Romanian Troy Moroni" is my comment on the film. What is there to say? <br /> <br /> This character really shows Moroni's moron. A tough gangster with the inability to pronounce obscene words, well, it seems frustrating to be tough and yet will not be able to express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Romani Moroni will appear in the history of the film as one of the greatest moral. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. As well as Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from the label "R" because he could not pronounce the obscene words.
