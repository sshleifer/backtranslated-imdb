One of the best movies out there. Yes, maybe cinema was not the greatest, but it was an excellent conspiracy and concept. Great for time and brilliant ideas and creative. Something different from the usual movies and great fun. One of my favorites would recommend anyone who loves creative and imaginative movies. After World War 3 and fighting in giant robots, the actors performed wonderfully and made it worth all the time. The collections are not spectacular, but simple and worked for the overall appearance of the film. This movie is hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check that is why I've loved it since I came out. Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It is a great view and very enjoyable.
