A fictional story about Mars's attempt to colonize the earth. (Things must be very bad again on Mars.) Two state soldiers investigate the reported UFO scene. All that is removed is buried under the ice in Tracy's Pond but there are steps on the snow that lead to the near diner. <br /> <br /> Dinner had no customers since 11 o'clock that morning. Now there are a bunch of bus passengers sitting waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that there are now seven people waiting to resume the trip. One of them is an alien, but which one? They are all suspects. There is the crazy old man (Jack Ilam), of course, who seems to be playing a smart game. There is a lively businessman who must get to Boston (John Hewitt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Outstanding performance by husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for couples, no one else noticed. Even couples are skeptical about each other. The bride to the newly injured husband: "It was possible to swear that you have lost your mind." The story continues in an insightful but somewhat frightening way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights turn on and the lights turn off, and the box runs itself - and none of them should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It is a very enjoyable and well-deserved band game. There is no marked "depth" for it. It is not a moral message about people who masquerade as ordinary citizens. It is not a warning of any kind, it is just a fairy tale turning and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy it when it's on. It is particularly interesting to see John Hewitt as an angry and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 the Roman senator who orchestrated the assassination of Julius Caesar was in the MGM version of the Shakespeare play. And here it is - with three arms. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
