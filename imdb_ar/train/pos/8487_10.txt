I remember seeing Gung Ho, a girl with my mother, and wondered why she had always cried in the last few minutes. Of course, the entire film found joy, especially the characters' behavior. It was only when I was older and saw it again, I realized how deep this show really was. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Jed Watanabe shine in their roles as hesitant mediators. Keaton is amazed at his realistic style of delivering lines, and adds Watanabe humor and pantos to the mix. I also thought that Batty Yasutaki (Omiki) was simply wonderful in her role as a comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the most disdainful films of the 1980s. We can all learn a lesson from integrating American and Japanese workers into this film ... Sometimes, you can really * get "the best of both worlds". Now I understand why my mother felt the way I felt at those closing moments. Best owning one of these cars too.
