I read Shenyboom's book (the same title as this film) when it was first published and deeply influenced by its ability to see through many of the "other" ways (his country and the Amazon people he lived with and loved) as a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not strong, but they showed his continuous pursuit. He described his sexual relations with tribal men well ahead of the early 1960s, but his sincerity and openness were welcome. This film beautifully conveys both the evils and generosity of men, but it also provides an overview of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not, in this case, an ethically positive term) when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies. However, the Schneebaum himself has moved to a kind of supreme patent that suggests the possibility of saving mankind from its destruction.
