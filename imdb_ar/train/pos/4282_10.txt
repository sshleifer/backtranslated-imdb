The characters have been wonderfully placed in many ridiculous, soulful and ridiculous Serbian attitudes. The film is a wonderful, fun, interesting and unpredictable comedy. The best point in the film: characters, then humor itself, story and dialog boxes. Humor has an "internal development", rare in Serbian films. Therefore, it is the result of characterization, motivation is well, spontaneous and convincing. It is also sharp, smart and clear. Most of the films, unfortunately, have built humor (inventing a joke and putting it in the mouth of characters) or a comedy of the normal, comical situation that has incorporated some "artistic immortality" into this film. A small masterpiece, barely accessible.
