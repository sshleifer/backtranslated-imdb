I found it very interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my American culture and the culture of creators, that is, the Chinese. Become a story about values, and lead to the re-evaluation of the observer for his choices in life, and loyalties towards institutions. Amazingly enough, I managed to do it in a nice, mildly humorous way, which only in the past was seen as threats to the status quo. I enjoyed the movie and will see it again if you can.
