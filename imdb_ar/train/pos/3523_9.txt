A strange and wonderful mix of talent-director, Robert Ciudmak and Ela Renez as secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracing a mysterious "fake" woman, and Frunchout Tun as a crazy and deadly sculptor. There are also some of the smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Junior as a dope drum, as well as other characters who form parts of the plot. If you are used to seeing Raines in more useful parts, she is allowed to go here, especially in view of Cook. Franchot Tone also plays a completely different person, and although he is not a convincing part, he is acting enormously. While the plot is very fabricated, the film enjoys a real and very enjoyable atmosphere.
