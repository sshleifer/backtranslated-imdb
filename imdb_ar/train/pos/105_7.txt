You must start with Ed Furlong on this one. You have to. God bless you this child. $ 5 says that the character he plays in this film is what he really looks like in real life. He has one or two lines that made me almost a wrong hit because of the hidden humor in the script. You know all the experiences that this person has experienced in recent years and it does not seem that Furlong behaves. Maybe that's why he was doing well. The same with Madsen. You're still thinking, "I bet this guy is really like that in real life." Should Madsen behave? Normal only. It is clear that Vosloo has moved from the mummy man of the distinctive species. I think the biggest surprise for this film was the performance of Jordana Spiro. Her reactions are spot in this film. I clashed whether it was hot or not, but I realized I just wanted to see more of it. <br /> <br /> Fans are not very fond of filming hostage films. But what I like is movies that contain a lot of twists and turns to try to keep you guessing. It's not just your ordinary thieves taking a bank, they kill the hostages, and the good men win the final type of film. The turns continue to appear ... and coming. <br /> <br /> Cafe scenes work best with handheld cameras to show their current shape. Do not shine a little more. Think of Bourne Ultimatum in some scenes in the cafe. <br /> <br /> For those fanatics of Bo Bice there - Actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Carl's role) will make you take a double tour. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I watched, she wondered why some representatives had foreign accents and what they were doing in this small town. It makes sense, in the end, that these people smuggled things to other countries / countries so they have these dialects. But more has been revealed in the bonus features of how some producers want to produce this film for international audiences with some of their stars who may not have heard of them. And some of them smoke hot. Dean of Moncea? I need to say more.
