John Van Drotten's Broadway song was shown on screen with the maximum power of the stars in this romantic fantasy about the modern-day witch that abandoned a successful publisher in Manhattan. James Stewart may get the best bills, but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most attractive magicians ever to throw a mascot on the screen. In fact, the main pairing is one of the few weaknesses in the film: Stuart Gray is too old for this role. Although it's easy to see why Novak is difficult, it's a little hard to understand what it is. He finds attraction about him, because it seems mismatched in mood and expectations. (It is one of the entertaining storyplays depicted on witches and magicians as rich from the village of Greenwich and Bohimin.) Strangely-generated Novart generated more heat in the film "Vertigo", released the same year with this film, but then was "Vertigo" carries a powerful suspense story, and has benefited from the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> The comedic moments of the film are often presented by the star support team, including young Jack Lemmon (like Kim's charming brother), Elsa Lancaster (their vulgar aunt) and Ernie Kovax (!) as a confused writer. Hermione Jungold even appears in the veil of Farhan as a kind of grand witch. There's so much you like in this movie - the smart, romantic and wonderful actors - that is, if you can close your eyes to the charming Miss Novak. I've seen the film half a dozen times, and I can not.
