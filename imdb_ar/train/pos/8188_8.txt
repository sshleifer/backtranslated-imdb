I completely enjoyed the first part of these two chapters, The Impossible Planet, and I was a little worried that the second part would not hold up as well as it did in the past in the two parts of the previous 2 series. But luckily, I had no reason to find myself enjoying this episode just like the previous episode. Anyway, we start with the surviving crew members of the oud, who have become a devil's pawn. There is also little philosophy by the doctor in the episode that I completely enjoyed. Needless to say it was a good solid doctor story. He may be a very big boy for young viewers. <br /> <br /> My estimate: B +
