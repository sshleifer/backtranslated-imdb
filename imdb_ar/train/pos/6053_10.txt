Jewel comedy. A lot of laughter from the loud moments, the shop scenes and the bar forced me to laugh motionless. Personality can be recognized and dialogue is well observed - I know people like that! The humor is surprisingly nice and the film (this may sound strange) puts me in the mind of Ealing comedy. It's a weird little movie with lots of details. It certainly takes a number of views. I've seen it several times (I've shown all my friends!) And I notice something new every time - a little dialogue, something visual that I have not picked up before. I can be really picky and I find some shortcomings in the film, but I will not do it because this is a wonderful movie, very enjoyable and really worth watching and should be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of humor. It's a movie he will find friends and I hope there are a lot of them. Oh ... and he has fantastic soundtrack.
