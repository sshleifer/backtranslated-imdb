Emile Janing won the Oscar for his role as the general he ridiculed in a fraction of a silent picture as a Russian general. The film dates back to its days in Russia, which preceded the fall of the country against the rebels. William Powell appeared in his big screen as a Hollywood director who portrays Janings in his film. The film represents an interesting look at the fall of Russia and the imitation of Tinseltown behind the scenes in the early days. Von Sternberg presents another classic story full of wonderful elements of romance, tragedy and tragedy.
