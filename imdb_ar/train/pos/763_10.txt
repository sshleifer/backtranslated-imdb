I have this film is all for me ... I heard about the hip-hop and hip-hop, but I have never seen it has been done professionally (hey, I was a child of 11 years old from the Netherlands!) When I saw this movie, changed all this. We are actively engaged in the hip-hop movement in our city, and began to dance and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I still think this is a favorite film. Sure, the importance of cinematography and filmmaking may not be so important. But who cares if the snapshot was filmed widescreen badly or you can see a microphone hanging over someone? This is what you do personally ...
