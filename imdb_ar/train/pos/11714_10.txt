Then you should see this film, to understand reality. After reading the book, Ms. Duke now became an advocate for those suffering from bipolar disorder; he was previously classified as bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that in this day and age, people still criticize others who suffer from emotional problems, or those who seek psychological help. Retrospective and discriminatory thinking remains, and this is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> In this film, the audience sees the pain and suffering that Ms. Duke experienced, especially when she was a child. Many of us may remember it from the "Patty Duke Shou" teen. It was a common name in America at the age of 15 years. <br /> <br /> Learn about Ross's exploits (which Howard Hessman played well). During its inception in the 1950s, the stigma was complete. However, we see that she is advancing in her career, but the disease is getting worse. She is undergoing drug abuse and abortions; he will marry his divorce next week; she has several conflicts and fits of anger with her children and her elderly mother. All of these problems occurred before they received adequate treatment and medication. <br /> <br /> A recent survey by NAMI shows that the majority of adults in the United States fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. He also announced that one out of five respondents believed people could control their disease without medication if they wanted to. (BP Magazine, Winter 2006) If you watch this movie, you will learn the true story of a talented woman who can not "lift herself up with her shoe shoes" and "get better" until she learns about her disorder and gets the treatment or treatment. Thank you, Ms. Duke, for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudices.
