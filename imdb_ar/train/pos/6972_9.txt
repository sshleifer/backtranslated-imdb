The Caprica loop (S01E01) was made well as a pilot. Truly, this episode is the same as the exact demo version of the DVD. Having said that, Episode 01 presents a very objective background for the very famous Battlestar Galactica series (both original and 2007 new). Is highly applicable to the 2007 series. As common sci-fi plots, this series explores the life or "virtual" environment. In addition, much information is given about the Adama family series as well as its relationship with the creator of the Cylons (in the Battlestar Galactica series). In large part, this first episode revolves around a popular theme, "Virtual Life" and (as expected) the early life of colonies, and the birth of Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this episode. Although this article was not new to me or to anyone who has already seen a DVD version of the Caprica pilot, the series looks very promising. As with many pilots, Episode 01 leaves a shelf link to ensure follow-up by the audience (the science fiction community). I will definitely continue to look for determination as well as development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
