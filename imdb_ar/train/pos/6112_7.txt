It's first of all a flick, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This special film contains some beautiful fighting scenes, I do not think any wires were used or if they were not quite clear. It is not a terribly complex film, so it is easy on the brain, and there is no need to analyze anything to get a deeper, very simple meaning, good chemistry between the expected clients, and the fun time. I want to, if they show the full potential of the girls look only once because they can be surprisingly attractive, but throughout the film they keep it pretty beautiful. I was watching him again ... with a girl.
