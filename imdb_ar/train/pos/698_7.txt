I have seen this film for some time, after I asked my friend, a great admirer of Dominique Monaghan. The film itself was interesting, although it had positive points, and for me it was Donnie Darko's type "wtf?" Factor after the film ends. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the positive also come negative points. For me, the little girl in the film was incredibly good, and Dominique Monaghan did a good job too. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. It may be just me, and I do not pretend to be a serious critic, in the way I do not find myself sufficiently skilled, but he does not seem convincing as an actor. But perhaps it is even more surprising, because even though I am not a critic, this brings me to attention. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think it's a movie worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you should have seen it only.
