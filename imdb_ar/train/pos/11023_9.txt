The choice of Sylvester Stallone for the performance of the novel by Rene Harlin is commendable because Stallone is the kind of strong and volatile person who has earlier presented the diverse aura required brilliantly for the characters of Rocky Balboa and Rambo. But comparing Die Hard with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched idea. <br /> <br /> The well-crafted opening scene offers the audience the excitement, thrill and intrigue that will overwhelm them with blood and danger. Meet with outlaws. Stealing and transferring hard money at high altitudes in cases of lawsuit from one aircraft to another is not photographed before. <br /> <br /> The harsh cold of the snow-capped Alps and the cheating and deception unfolding between the opposing forces make one jerk with fear. The forces of massive adventure and brutal murder begin the drama to the end. <br /> <br /> Good films are not produced every year and people do not get a feast for the eye to see from time to time. Apart from the dirty language / language that gives the audacity of a certain scene, the film can be considered a film that will not fade with its attractive appeal even after watching it many years later.
