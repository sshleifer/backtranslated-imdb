Well, I'll be honest, when I saw the video clip for the program for the first time, I thought it was an advertisement for some solar screen products. With all the people roaming the beach. Despite that, I decided to watch it, and I think it will be some new shows that I can laugh at. But I was very surprised. <br /> <br /> Since the first ten seconds of the program I was hooked, why he was lying on the trees, why the plane crashed and so on. <br /> <br /> Not every day comes a show that combines intelligence, humor, movement and thrill. But the "lost" manages all this. With a wonderful crew, wonderful crew, beautiful sites and special effects, "Lost" will catch anyone preparing, which is a must for anyone who is tired of the play sitcom with cheese and television. <br /> <br /> Tuesday at 10 am on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42 = O
