Yes correct. Sammo Hung played a key role in "Zu Warrios of the Magic Mountain" in 1983. Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu Warriors." But this time, he does it in the end correctly. Rarely seen in Wushia, often in the classic Eastern or classical slap. But this role does not fit him simply! The old Chinese myth about zu mountain is not represented in movies (as far as I know about films translated to the West). Although the legend contains a wide range of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: You have not seen a story both yet in a modern movie! This makes them so big! F: All the colors in addition to the awesome deep story that revolves around your heart will make you fall into this movie in an instant. The first time I saw it, I had to see it again immediately and I did it. Well, I did not understand all that the first time. But this makes them better! You know, you did not understand all that, because it has so much spice! So, it's a pleasure to see him again and again. And yes, it gets deeper in your heart, and you often see it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story you love, characters you cry with, and a movie really: a movie you'll never forget! - Editor's Note: Well, I think I should see it again now: D
