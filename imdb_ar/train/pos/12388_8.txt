I have read the book and I must say that this film is still true. I think this is the beginning of psychological excitement in the same kind of Psycho. Cristina Raines makes excellent progress, while Burgess Meredith offers an excellent supportive player as a neighbor. I have seen this film at least twice and I think I will buy both the book and the film for my collection. The suspense continues only to climb to the climatic end, a development you will never see. If you like movies like Sign and The Village, Sentinel will be a classic introduction. Also, what is interesting is the actors in the film, you will not recognize them if you do not read credits. The late Jerry Auerbach is great as a commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is as excellent as the photographer. Also there is the dangelio beverly, which is understated but great.
