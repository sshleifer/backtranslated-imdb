Soylent Green I found it an excellent film. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's running, you'll be impressed. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is old, there are no special effects, some of which can best be described as "cheesy" but the story is excellent. <br /> <br /> The story of how the world and its impact on society can be very impressive. <br /> <br /> In the end, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story unfolded in ease and with appropriate speed. <br /> <br /> It is the closest in modern times to the "dark angel" in terms of how the United States can be a Third World country.
