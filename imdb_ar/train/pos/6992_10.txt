I will not say that this is a bad film; in fact, it is typical of the kind of movie that the "poverty row" studios were launching at the time. Bela Lugosi was portrayed for Monogram, and is very effective in his role as a doctor - somewhat stuck, masquerading as a respected member of society. In this film, Bella and his followers used the bad habit of stealing young brides, and after their death, Bella's wife was injected with a serum taken from their bodies to keep her young. Lugosi is more than a task to make this movie fun, however, the film suffers from the super-representation of the co-stars Loa Walters and Tristram Kaufen. The coffin (a beautiful name for someone in a panic attack) is very bad in this case. I have seen him in many films and television shows and he is always the same; cruel, wooden and totally unconvincing. Miss Walters is a little better, but she also lacks the acting talent to make her role reasonable. However, the viewer can enjoy watching the wonderful Lugosi with another stupid scheme eventually thwarted! Despite the bad representation by some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a fun film to see it all.
