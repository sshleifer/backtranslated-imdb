SPOILERS <br /> <br /> One of my friends said NEXT MOVIE was the best flick of Cheech & Chong and got out of his way to BLUES. "MOVIE MOVIE" does not contain any plot, it has no speed and has nothing to distinguish the film ... but it is funny. And why it's worth it, Cheech and Chong show some sadness. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little paragraph I put in the plot, but since four-fifths of the movie, nothing will happen that usually starts a story. I'll just say that Cheech's cousin appears. <br /> <br /> Was there no other fun moment when I made Chong Cheech drink twice? What about the cock? Was it the debut of Pee-Wee Herman? You'll have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE contains balls strong enough to make them great, but the movie has a heart and a fun, my friend allowed me to borrow it until he got 7.
