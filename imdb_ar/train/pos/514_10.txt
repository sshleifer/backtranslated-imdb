Definitely one of the best British films ever produced, if not one of the best films ever produced. Scenario, cinematography, direction and behavior in a row alone. This movie works on many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Did not appear on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly screened at the National Film Theater in London on crowded houses?
