Forget the Neo and Bourn and all those half-baked make up modern heroes. They look only at the age of 12 to satisfy a wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can not be Rambo, McLean or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has allowed a set of fake products that have no beard, but the wishes of teenagers would like to see something very similar to the flick. <br /> <br /> "Working groups" are very painful to watch and any girl may challenge her girlhood without a question. This explains the restoration of old themes on our silver screens over the last few years. For the better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McLean, get ready for yourselves .... they did not have a beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say it's time for a new hero stepped up and put their reign to Its end. This film "Largo Winch" is far from perfect, and may be very predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley has given promising performance as a movement hero. The only time he weakened was when Milani Thierry shaved his beard! I'm relieved. <br /> <br /> I did not know that when I entered the theater room, but this may be the movie I was waiting for ten years. For the first time in France since Belmondo, the film can be well made and rooted in Type B without being ashamed of its performance. In the meantime, everything we had chewed was either a giant pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience ... in other words it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I love Doberman, mind you) ... I think That "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be a popular and high quality film industry. <br /> <br /> I left the theater room very happy, I am more hungry.
