ATTENTION SPOILERS SMALL !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... very good movie. I'm surprised to say to myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the voice of director Diran Sarafian usually means bad news. Most of his films are less than regular motion pictures like Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and probably should have continued to produce horror films rather than action. This film really fascinated me. Good achievement, do not see any famous representatives or large budget. It's really the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula legend will be satisfied. Serpian shines another aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains faithful and true to the truth. He explains the life of Count Dracula in Romanyan and how he feared the Turkish army by spraying the dead bodies in front of his castle. Of course, this is where reality stops and "based on a true story." Both Bram Stoker invented drinking blood and stuff. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Count (Vlad Tebisch) emigrates to the United States and lures many women. They are all pretty girls, I'll give it. Overall, good behavior by unknown faces, enough blood and trouble to satisfy the most obsessed horror lovers and interesting story. This film is really unknown and has been hidden on shelf shelves in my local video store. But it is definitely worth cleaning dust on the lid and putting it in a VCR. Heck, it's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie of the same title. There is nothing in common between these two films, but I blame this film for stealing attention away from this beautiful little picture. Check it out ... My humble opinion on To Die For = 8.5 / 10
