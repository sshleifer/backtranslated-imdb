This film does not seem to be able to satisfy many people. First, it seems that many did not see him in the first place (I just encountered by accident), and then judge the reviews and evaluate those who did not enjoy them much. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere because of his looks and charm, and although I did not consider him a great actor, I know he can do crazy well (I loved Mr. Jones). But this performance is different. It is not beautiful in this, and it is not a magician. His character is completely different from anything I have seen from him to that point --- old, ugly, broken, designer. And Gere, in what was his best performance so far, pulls him beautifully. I think it's a sign of the actor's performance if you can not imagine anyone else doing it instead - think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonso on the training day. So Jerry was good here. <br /> <br /> The team also stayed good. I think I would not have played the Danes in this role, mostly because I think they are so good looking. But she does an excellent job, sticking to Gere in her best form, and that's not easy. Strickland easily offers the best supporting work, in part requires a large range of them. I actually think they own the main scene with Jerry and Danz, and that's a great achievement. <br /> <br /> So what about the rest of the film, apart from some excellent acting? The story may not be very surprising. There are some 8mm lengths, but it adds the story of "veterans in the rookie" to those who do not add, and also (like the silence of the lambs) adding a sense of urgency by trying to rescue the girl and the impending retirement of the character Gear . All this is a background to the development of the main character, helping each other to settle in his new stations in life. Much has to be done in 100 minutes, but it's done well, and we've ended up taking care of the personalities and what's happening to them. <br /> <br /> The direction and photography were caffeine. I could have done this without the movements and the new music and video cameras, but then I was an old servant, and it was not that bad really, in fact, I think it helped the film atmosphere, which is like you probably guessed, pretty much not happy. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
