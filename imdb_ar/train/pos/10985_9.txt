I was speechless and devastated after seeing this premiere - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are incredibly funny and incredibly surreal - a documentary about No, and this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a race for their money in eccentric horse racing. I have been focusing on how these women (who are strangely clinical) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising ways, and I wonder if their retreat from the world is driven by something beyond the bother of life in the unrealistic blue blood of the universe, perhaps some abuse, Or perhaps just a series of challenge and rebellion that came out of their control and captured their own lives. This may be one of the greatest films that have come close to being exploited seriously, without being quite perfect - as do Edies. I have been referring to things like empty jinn bottles in the cumbersome bedroom, cats peeing on the bed, rocks from holes in the walls, The last scene seems incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party is seriously wrong. Definitely worth watching and looking for - you will never forget, but very annoying.
