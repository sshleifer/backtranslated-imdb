I thought it was excellent and I still do. I am grateful that we are still able to see things different from Hollywood. Saving grace is smart and fun - for those who feel insulted by marijuana, it's best to see the kind of movie bride in America. <br /> <br /> Grace's rescue also shows that a funny film should not be stupid. I used to laugh at my ass during most of them, but I also wonder what a woman's figure was supposed to do to pay for the debts of her deceased husband. <br /> <br /> In short - an ingenious story with typical English humor, good acting and direction. You can not order more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
