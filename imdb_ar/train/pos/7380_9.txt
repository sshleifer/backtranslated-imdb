The three main characters are portrayed very well, especially Anisio's rock musician turned into the first actor Paulo Mikulos. It is very convincing as a bottom layer / invader. The film shows a good snowball effect of participating in shady works more than ever before, and the contrast and similarities between the lower and upper classes. How everyone gets away from greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
