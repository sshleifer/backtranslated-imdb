As others did in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was introduced in 1956, I rushed to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because experts from young, old, male, female, science fiction and people find such a fare "Everyone can follow and enjoy the story of this movie and plot lines well.This is the first film to be placed on a planet other than Earth in the century But Walter Biggon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, and Earl both relieved Holiman and Warren Stevens very well. There is a lot of visual magnificence in this film. , It is difficult to choose a favorite of movie scenes Heading to the Altair-4, the same spacecraft, landing on the alien planet's surface, descending over the extras, the first landscape, the approach of the rocket boat, Dr. Morpheus's house, seen from outside and inside, the underground complex and its wonders, With the beast, the final approval of the unseen destroyer, the escape from the devastated planet - all these scenes are engraved in the minds of the viewer because we discover them with the participants. It is shocking to realize that there is no music at all; the film is executed through words and actors and the mystery story of revelation. I can see it over and over again - I've been doing this for almost fifty years. Until this famous film was created, no film tried to imagine an extraterrestrial world; for decades, ships continued to collapse on Earth - as if the book's fiction was a failure and caused crashes. Still the best, as many say. This says something negative about the so-called sci-fi intellectuals leaders in this country - and something very positive I already suggest about those who made these gems.
