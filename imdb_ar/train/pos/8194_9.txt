Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie. A film that reflects - for better or worse - the social and political sentiments of the country during Reagan's heyday in the early 1980s. It's also an action film. <br /> <br /> It opens with a liberal judge who dismisses the murder case because of a lack of concrete evidence, and then goes straight to the coffee shop with many unfortunate unions (the scene that calls for the famous "Impact Impact", "Go ahead, make my day"). Is one of the motionless non-stop motion movies. The first time you get your breath is when the Callahan Inspector is sent off to a nearby city to investigate the background of the hood of the victim. The situation from there gets better with only a bunch of nasty thugs for Callahan to deal with with Sheriff with a mysterious past. The wonderful direction, photography and funny scenario sometimes make this film one of the best in the 1980s.
