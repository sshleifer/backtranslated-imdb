This movie takes you into itself in the first few minutes and carries you to the end. She has a very human story and very good selected music. The representation of Moritz Blipetrio (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby (Gigi Amato) publications are satisfactory. Recommended for people who are bored with motion pictures and want to see a good movie.
