I accidentally caught this movie on the cable in the middle and I had to hire it to see it all and I'm glad I did. It was drawn immediately by a story that interested the girls in question. Graduates of the naive high school, the best friends from childhood, are taking a high school trip and are greeted by a fraudulent man named Nick, who has serious problems. They also use carcass mules in the smuggling ring of heroin. When they take care of girls they learn how to deal with their imprisonment while trying to find a way out of their problems. All they try to help themselves is lacking when the Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings, and the girls end up in trouble and lose the confidence of their American lawyers, Yankee Hank. Hank gives up trying to defend them after being betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, the original Thai Hank wife smells the mice in the case and does some additional investigation and discovers that the girls have already been victimized. The end of the film when Alice did an unselfish job of saving Darlene (Beckinsale) made me cry. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
