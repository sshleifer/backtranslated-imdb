This movie is good for television. I like it because I'm a fan of disaster movies, even though it's a family movie. The accuracy of the film of the book is half and half got the names of the characters correctly but in the book there was no storm stalker, the car scene involving the Hatch family escapes from the hurricane was not in the book instead Dan Hatch and his friend shared a ride with a police officer To the police station in search of safety. In the book Dan and his friend are 12 years old. That's all I can think of. In general, this was a good film although it could have been a little more accurate in the book. Did you know that the book was based on a true story about a series of hurricanes that destroyed a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
