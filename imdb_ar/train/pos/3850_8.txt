He paves the way by opening this story with a black widow spider hunting prey on her network before we meet Gerard Reeve, an annoying, self-centered writer with a sick imagination. Gerrard was invited to be the guest speaker at the literary club meeting in a seaside town for an hour or so from Amsterdam. Verhoeven lets us take a look at how Gerard's imagination changes reality.

Does this have more than It is a psychological drama and in the narrative of which of these old films were stuck in my memory, I discovered that it is the sexual favorite. Verhoeven, too, is a master in asking us about our understanding of reality: it is a nice change in the pace of Hollywood's usual fare, which I saw in 1983 as a "stuck" movie.
