Glory to Cesar Montano for the revival of Cebuano! The Panaghoy sa Suba is very good, it contains drama, movement, romance, and the scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> While the story is not in this original form (the love triangle - or the occupation of four pillars, the Japanese occupation, the rebellion, and America as a master), its display is remarkable, especially as it uses the original language - Pessaya for Filipinos, Nebongo for Japanese And English for Americans. <br /> <br /> This movie will become one of the best Pinoy movies of the year. <br /> <br /> Go see this!
