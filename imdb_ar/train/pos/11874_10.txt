Best role for Argbelli Al Pacino. Tony Montana is playing, the bonnet has turned from Cuba into the rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it through the only two things he has got in this world - the balls and his word - and he does not break. "No one starts doing dealer jobs. A big Cuban, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and soon rises to the ladder of the organization with his longtime friend Manny (Steven Bauer) Soon he has an eye for the wife of the sexy coach Phila (Michelle Pfeiffer.) After Frank saw a threat from Tony to his post, But without luck, Tony is annoyed and nothing can stop him now As a gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked policeman trying to get rid of Tony and Marie Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's sister-in-law.Conspective of the Ecxellent scenario by Oliver Stone.This film is one of the brightest points of Brian DePalma in his long and short career, The other is the final correction where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick and kill about 20 killers who have invaded his home. . This is definitely one of the most impressive endings of the film I've ever seen. For Al Pacino fans and crime films, you should see. For the rest you are highly recommended. 10/10
