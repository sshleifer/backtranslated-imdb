I caught this on the dish last night. I liked the movie and traveled to Russia 3 times different (adopt our children 2). I can not put my finger exactly on why I like this film other than seeing "bad" "good" and "good" "semi-bad." I liked the shape that Ben Ben Chaplin had through the entire film. Like "I can not believe that this is happening to me" whether good or bad, it looks the same way (and works). Wonderful end. 10/07. Rent it or grab it on the dish as you did.
