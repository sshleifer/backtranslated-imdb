This film captures my heart from the start, when I hear the first Quincy Jones observations or see the wonderful purple color of the flowers in the lawns. It's really a movie that cries and dies for ...! The whole team performs the best performance in a film I've seen in years, and Spielberg has really outdone himself! Wehbe Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (Oh Lord!), Danny Glover, and others, give us everything they can and can feel - almost touched! Goldberg IS Celie, it gives her the sense of insecurity and inferiority needed for personality, grows with her, grows with her, throughout the film, and wins with her. Margaret Avery is as wonderful as Shug Avery, even when in arrogance, and shows us that "sinners", in fact, "have souls too." Danny Glover is always a charming magician who does a great job of making people hate him and the wonderful music of (say, sir) Quincy Jones adds more beauty to this wonderful film! Photography, music, music and film make this beautiful film a fun life experience. You do not want to miss a chance! "Sista" ... Remember my name ... "
