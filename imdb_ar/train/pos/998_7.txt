This is a really interesting film. It's an action movie with mixed comedy. Foxx collaborates with the comedy Epps in this film to give it a comic spin. It will keep you wondering what will happen to Foxx after that. It was a good film, the director used the appropriate colors in this film (dark blue colors) to give it the right appearance. Kimberly Elise also participated in this film, and I am always happy to see her on the big screen. Play its role well. Even Jimmy Kennedy in this film. It's worth seeing him did not see him. Definitely worth it if you love Jimmy Fox. It deserves more credit than is actually given.
