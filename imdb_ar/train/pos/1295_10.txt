The book on which this film was based was excellent; it took some time for me to approach the unconventional Huellebecq style, but as soon as I understood the mood behind the writing, I was completely attracted to the author's melancholy. In fact, no other book affected me much. This is not necessarily a good thing - I have made my personal struggle and made it unreasonable to be harder than my own. Houellebecq's visions are brilliantly captured by Harel and the indifference of the hero and apathy in the world he rejects depicts perfectly. This film reveals today's society of humble males in all its horror. We hope things will change in the future but at the moment we accept the rat race as described in this film. It's better that neither Harel nor Houellebecq do such a genius job again. One is enough for any man.
