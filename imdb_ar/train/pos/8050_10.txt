The most flexible man in martial arts does it again. Sammo's early film that made him imitate his hero character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazing to me like in his works and fighting. The way he slides into Bruce's style and then returns to his own style, Kung Fu is more familiar with the joy of watching and shows how successful and adaptable he is in his art. Throw away a little bit of comic humor that is very popular for this kind of clicks and this movie that contains everything - comedy (some unintentional, like fake black men), motion movies and some amazing fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie of beer and friends deserves an hour and a half of anyone's time.
