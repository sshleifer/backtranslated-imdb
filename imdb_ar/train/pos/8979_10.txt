I liked this film, at first the amazing graphics looked strange to the kindly clips but soon entered them. There must be thousands of hours of footage and I am really impressed with the work done in reducing it. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, this movie may not be right for you, but there are some wonderful characters here (and some real manipulation tools). Technically, I liked them a lot, they should have used a new algorithm to remove tangles or the footage might have looked very dark anyway, but I was not disturbed by the usual artifacts seen in the video transfer to the movies. (Open Water pushed me nuts, mostly because there are cheap progressive cameras available now and I do not see any excuse not to bomb anyone if you intend to show the movie in the cinema). Sorry this is my little rant. I would definitely recommend this film if you are involved in the musical scene, and it has some tragic moments, but most of it is fun, and I have been accused of laughing at others' misfortune, but it is a classic piece.
