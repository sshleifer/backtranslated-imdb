Visually and visually stunning. Treatment for both eye and ear. The perfect Victorian element in the opening series was utterly enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself was proud of. Technically, production is visually stimulating and special effects are creatively designed and creatively achieved in a traditional theater environment. The dance of many leading artists is amazingly good. Photography and lighting are first class and sound recording is impressive with the overall high level of technical skills used. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas time and a more enjoyable discovery which will resist multiple viewing.
