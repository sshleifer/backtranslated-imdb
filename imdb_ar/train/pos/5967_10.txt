Sami, the God of the Rock Metal God, tried to prevent him, tried to ban him, tried to monitor his music !! (Much like the real life de Snyder, from the twisted sister, Tiber Gore or Uzi Osborne) was killed in a fire, Sami Shore was supposed to play for Halloween at his old high school for a dance .. Now Eddie Winbauer, # 1 Likes, the only one who knew how Sami was, and what he felt (or did not do) at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) he has given the only version of the last Sammi record Eddie .. But when Eddie tries to turn the record back, Sammi speaks to him from the dead and tells him what to do to get back into the intimidation in his school that he hates and his music .. Everything works up, Sami begins to kill !! A great movie to watch for heavy metal hairband lovers, with a great sound track through Fastway, and only if you do not know the songs or whether the songs look fastway and do not like them, they have changed their voice a bit and there is a style that looks like the most famous cinderella, or rat .. Is the movie a real horror film? Well, that depends on what you call horror film, for me a real horror film is undefeated, with a lot of killing, or just being scary. This movie is not so, not enough deaths, but can not be called action, comedy, drama, thrill, or excitement, and that's why I think it should be scary .. So if you want Rock 'n' roll, Night, repel your soul !! From Sam Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean "What do you fear? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?!"
