From the rain, the gloomy late winter of England in the early twenties ... <br /> <br /> --- where there is still grief and many young widows and disabled veterinarians of the great massacre of men and murderers of their women's dreams - now known as the First World War. .. <br /> <br /> Four women are sharing this beautiful little Italian castle on a hill; a young widow drowning her grief in hectic parties, two women will rediscover their husbands, and a fourth woman tired of her dead friends ... <br /> <br> / ... These four women will meet with a couple and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "shift" for a vacation Ah in the month of April in Italy in early 1920. <br /> <br /> Note to potential directors. I study this movie to see how it can tell the mood and beauty of a story. (Maybe not a movie to please a lot of men ...) <br /> <br /> NB: Keep the coffee and chocolates hot and let the girls spend a bleak winter day late ... Spring will come ... Enchanted April is your promise!
