Care Bears II film is much better than its predecessor. Contains a deeper plot, developing better characters, and rhythms (especially the closing song) attractive and attractive. Sure, the film tends to pay attention more than stress, but come on, it's Care Bears. This film is a wonderful image to show to children because it focuses on friendship, love and caring again. Not to mention caring for the only very adorable bears!
