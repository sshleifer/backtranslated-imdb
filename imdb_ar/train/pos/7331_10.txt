In the time of witchcraft, the barbarians and devils abound with a demonic tyrant named Nikharon and his mother, Queen Julien, who lives in the ice world and wants to invade the fire zone ruled by King Jerol. But when his beautiful daughter Princess Tegra was kidnapped by the fools to snore, the warrior named Laren must protect her. Nikhron defeats the capture of the world and the kingdom with the help of an Avenger named Dark Wolf. <br /> <br /> A wonderful animated fantasy epic, combining direct actors with their rotoscoping animation, the second best film of Ralph Bakshi with "American Pop" in first place and "Heavy Traffic". Ranked third and "Wizards" ranked fourth. It is certainly better than the "cool world" or "Lord of the Rings", the artwork has been designed by famous artist Frank Varzita and her animation is good coloring and there is also a hottie for men. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to fantasy fans and animators everywhere, especially the new version of Blue Underground's two limited DVD discs. <br /> <br /> The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Conan The Barbarian, The Wizard of Oz, Rock and Roll, Wizards, Heavy Metal, "The Legend of Orin", "Fantastic Planet", "Princess Mononoke", "Naosika: Valley of the Wind", "Conan The Destroyer", "Willow", "The Bride Bride", "Lord of the Rings" , "The Sword in the Stone", "Excalibur", "Army of Darkness", "Krull", "Dragonheart", "King Arthur", "The Hobbit", "Return of the King" , "The American Unicorn," "American Pop," "Jason and The Argonauts," "Clash of the Titans," "The Last Unicorn," " "," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
