I agree with the previous comment in the label content of the film "Daily Madness" but I would like to specify the following: "Dog Days" revolves around how women are treated in a society (male). The episodes we see here show some variation in daily discrimination against women, often classified by age group. There is a big man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife did, treating her like a doll acting "worth wearing" clothes first. There is a middle-aged couple who are almost a slave, a master (violent). Moreover, we find a somewhat younger man not communicating with his friend / wife and instead of being really jealous of her affairs, even making friendship with his rival (his rivals). A young man explains to his friend - a girl who is really worried about being pretty enough - she must have jewelry on his side and follow the rules of narrow etiquette that is seen. Finally, there is a man in his late fifties who calculates his interest in delivering a wandering woman in thought to an angry customer - taking her to sin in scratching his car - beats her naturally. To complete the examples, we find the man Pal in the "slave master" - the husband - after her collective abuse - threatens the first and humiliates her "for her" as she will get rid of her partner and take herself to her "head". During all this, the residents of the newly built neighborhood, where the event falls under the hot summer sun, are completely motionless (as!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minute of this appalling and true picture of the old structures that still prevail in the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen convincingly analyzed the reference to discrimination. It is likely to be a useful tool in teaching the less sensitive viewer the cause of the error - because of the good perception.
