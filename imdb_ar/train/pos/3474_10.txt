This film is worth seeing on its own to portray the wonderful Jared Harris of John Lennon. It does not matter that Harris does not exactly resemble Lennon. His behavior, expressions, attitude, tone and attitude are pure Lennon. Best Scene: Lennon at a local coffee shop competes verbally with a faltering admirer about whether Paul McCartney and Paul McCartney's "Silly Love Songs" deserve first place in America.
