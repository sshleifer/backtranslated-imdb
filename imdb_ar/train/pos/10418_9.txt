The story of the Burglar Thief (as previously mentioned) attracted the filmmakers of Raul Walsh in 1924, starring Douglas Fairbanks in the first silent film "The Thief of Baghdad," which made less recent attempts. However, the best still is the 1940 version, which was then a time of high quality special effects. These effects are still working with their charm. <br /> <br /> There are no more than six directors included in the Technicolor film starring Sabo as a boy boy, Abu, John Justin as the deposed monarch in love, Ahmed and John Dobris as the beautiful princess sought by Ahmed and followed by the evil minister, Jaafar , Played by Conrad Ved the Punk. The Giant Genie acts brilliantly by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmed was traitorously betrayed by Jaafar and when he was later arrested by the traitorous snake, he and the boy Abu suffer from the fate of the apparent impotence. Ahmed became blind and became a beloved father. Their adventures through the decorative backlots in Hollywood are enjoyable, but the special effects make this movie a success. <br /> <br /> The two men were responsible for everything from the magic flying carpet to the harmful genie that emerges from a bottle with a black spiral-like spiral bottle: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, by the way, made special effects for the 1961 version of the film, both men having long and distinguished careers in artistic witches.) Duprez is wonderfully beautiful while little is called for serious acting. Justin Ahmed presents a romantic driven but dreamless story touched by sensational beats. Sabo is really the main actor in many scenes and he is very good. For a film dedicated to children as well as adults, there is a great deal of violence, but of a non-blood type. However, I do not think that anyone under the age of eight should see "Baghdad Thief". <br /> <br /> This movie appears periodically on TV but today my teenage son saw it in a theater where very few young people present. It was wonderful to see computer-trapped children in a rich society responding to the joy and applause of the special influences that must seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "Thief of Bagdad" is Hollywood's pre-war classic film, where strong production values ​​often lead to always attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
