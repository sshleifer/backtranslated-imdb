I watch them all. <br /> <br /> It's no better than the amazing ones _Strictly Ballroom_, _Shall Dance? _ (Japanese version), but it is completely respectable and different in parts. <br /> <br /> I am an English teacher and I find some great ignorance In some of these reviews it is somewhat troublesome, for example: "The name must be shouted not seen." How to move. "How long can the titles of the movies ignore the grammar?" <br /> <br /> Nothing is wrong In its nature about the English grammar of the Caribbean It is not the standard Canadian English standard only Comments about the dialogue look to me I've been put on translations because I'm a standard Canadian English speaker, So I automatically assumed I had a problem understanding everything, it was not quite difficult and gave a completely different flavor because the other films I saw were very American. I loved that this movie was shown in Toronto, and in fact, I wished If I were more clear there I would love the heroine to throw in an unusual way, I enjoyed the routines and I liked the fact that many of the issues in the film were treated more subtly than a feature of the dance movies. <br /> <br /> In short, if you like dance movies, that's a good problem. If you have problems beyond the standard English grammar you grew up in, your narrow mind may find it difficult to enjoy this movie.
