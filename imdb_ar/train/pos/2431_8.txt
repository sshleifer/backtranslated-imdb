Famous for her nervousness and animation, the semi-principal character was in terrible danger, but the hero saved her in the last second. This Casper is the only one I can remember where death really takes his hand. But even in the case of death, there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The most famous cartoon in Studios Studios is that "virtue always wins". Bob always up to Spanhe in time, and always beats Baby Hui over the fox, Little Odier learns to always "study it." Some FS animations are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You have to give them a credit. As much as I like Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry, I do not think anyone would have put a better animation product at the time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (Great Winston Sharples), editing, sounds. It was a consistent and glowing example of the best of art.
