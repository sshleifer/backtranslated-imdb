This low budget movie contains a collection of anonymous and minimal site footage. The Philippines is an alternative to Thailand and no one actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of landing the Jumbo Cathay Pacific plane at the old airport makes the transition quite. This film proves that you do not need huge budgets or a star to produce an excellent movie. It does not contain any evidence or excesses encountered by young directors. A strong workmanship of people who know all aspects of filmmaking and who understand the compromises between art and office. Excellent piece of work!
