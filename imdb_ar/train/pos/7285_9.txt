I was afraid of this film when I was a child. He is not "Ken Citizen" but he has his moments. The arm shredding scene is good. The plot is good even if the characters are not - it can be related to acting. Put some prominent people in the roles and then see what you get. This was one of those who shot, freed (what was little) and was distributed in a few months of films. This is a classic low budget science fiction and worth it because only.
