Great, great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text so I'll explain. The crew was great (Jerry O'Connell is very nice!), The music was great (the 60s were the best music ever, Imho), the historical material was interesting, and so the way they made actors in the 1990s seemed to be actually there in the 1960s. Most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, this is the grandeur of any drama. But in a word: great!
