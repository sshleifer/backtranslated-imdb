] Have not seen this movie? Have not even heard this film? Will not surprise me. One of the few "independent" films produced in the last 10 years, no studio had faith in the image and was not captured for distribution at all. The independent Kino Films, BOESMAN and LENA have been granted a very limited tour with almost no promotion, and most mainstream film critics have not bothered to review it. I think a one-action film, one play group about apartheid and its impact on two people have not had a real chance in today's market - it's the loss of a smart film lover. <br /> <br /> For the record that both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserve Oscar nominations (as did the cinematographer), but the film is so noisy that I can not even blame the academy for that. It is a challenging film, stimulating to think, and shocking, and in fact requires the audience to meet on its own terms. With that in mind, it is certainly not a movie of reckless entertainment. Director John Perry wisely does not try to paint the play Athol Fugard. Sure, we've got a few broken snapshots and some scenic shots, but the film version of BOESMAN and LENA is still, in general, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. <br /> <br /> We have stripped of their basic human rights, Bozeman (Glover) and Lena (Basset) have no one to attack them but each other. There is a third character joining them for a while (Willie Jonan, amazing in a largely silent role), but the focus of the film never deviates from the title characters and what they become. Basset and Glover offer courageous performances as broken couples, which simply can not be improved. Stimulus and brutality, intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN and LENA deserve re-discovery of home video. Hands, Best Movie of 2000.
