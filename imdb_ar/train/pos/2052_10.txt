I do not have much to add to my summary, this film is categorized directly with Top Gun as one of the most made films ever made while I was not trying to be. Personally I do not think it should be taken seriously when you watch it because it is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I do not think it would diminish Christopher's reputation either because his reputation was going backwards and then anyway. It took Pulp Fiction to awaken him from the sleep he was in. As for Michael Ironside, he has been in some great funny movies and is not trying to be serious movies. Total Callback, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget of this movie. Scenes, actors, explosions, etc. are so amazing, so obviously someone loved her so much and was willing to risk a lot of money. Who was he or she loved them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If anyone reads this looking for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt there will be much), I know it's a hilarious movie and you should watch it with a smile on your face!
