It was 7:30 am, very close to school to see it so much. Animation and computer graphics were amazing for this time. The idea of ​​cowboys and ordinary people being thrown around spacecraft and robots was amazing. Perhaps inspired Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's really boring in DVD format. All offers are basically identical. When you view non-sequenced episodes on a DVD, you are stoned with disc # 3. According to today's criteria, the animation is sporadic. We do not notice computer graphics anymore and focus on how characters appear instead. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are heroic characters. They were more sincere, they took themselves more seriously than the modern heroines, and they were not tacky. They have already saved the men.
