"Foxes" is one film I remember because it depicts teenagers in the late 1970s. Since I was just the age of Judy Foster, I was connected to this film. It deals with frustrations, temptations, relationships and youth rebellion. Fantastic soundtrack with rock music like. "More than a feeling" of Boston and sad numbers such as "On the Radio" by Donna Samar. Late teen music. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it is not huge.
