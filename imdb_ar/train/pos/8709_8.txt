I recently discovered (May 2008) that this favorite childhood was available as a DVD disc. Although I've seen a lot of high-quality films since then (the late 1970s (I was 10 in 1978), this three-ring, low-budget thing is still strong. <br /> <br /> The fun thing is that I've seen it now with my 10-year-old daughter, and she's suffering exactly as I remember ever since: scary music (she had to hold on to my hand, even though she grew up with LotR and Resident Evil), ever changing the theories about who is the culprit already, and also complains of the theatrical sounds of the pre-Norway era of the difference between theatrical and cinematic representation. <br /> <br /> This is the only and only science fiction film (or series) ever made in Norway. It is still worth watching.
