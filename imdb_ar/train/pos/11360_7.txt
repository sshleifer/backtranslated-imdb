Chris Girulmo was careful not to give us a sort of list of people who killed Jack the Stripper: He looked into the psychological description with convincing results. Most probably due to the excellent performance of Steven Rhea who plays against Donald Sutherland with good sympathy from both. Was playing these two parts? Above all ?? Making the film more than a satisfactory account of the history of the Rostov butcher. Supporting actors, especially Max von Siddo, carried out their parts well. Good steering. The photography was very good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was filmed in Hungary was bound to produce some distractions, but frankly, given the depth of storytelling and interpretation, we can forget these very simple details. <br /> <br /> One time, a TV movie has been produced from HBO. Recommended, especially if you want to analyze properties and forget about some morbid scenes? Which, hastened to add, is never exaggerated.
