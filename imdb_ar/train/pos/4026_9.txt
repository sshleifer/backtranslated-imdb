Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It's a thought-provoking film that makes you think and make you question our culture. It is without doubt the best Indian film I have seen so far. This film was supposed to be shown at film festivals around the world and I think it would have been a serious contender at Cannes. All the characters were perfectly portrayed, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were in the clear. <br /> <br /> The film's story about division is a very important story and should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> He has no biases or biases and has given the section a human story. Here, no one country is portrayed as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis, good Indians and Pakistanis. Excellent cinematography and music is shocking, meaningful and horrifying. Everything about the film was amazing ... and taking acting was my breath. They were all thrown away completely.
