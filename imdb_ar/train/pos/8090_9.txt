When the young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard searches for Gandalf and discovers that the ring is an old creation of the evil master of darkness. If he returns to his hands, he will regain strength and destroy the middle ground. Frodo and his loyal friends began to seek to destroy the ring with a gang of warriors. This adapts to classic novels because it covers only the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is performed beautifully using a telescope, which tracks live footage. Ralph Beckshi worked well with his low budget. The film also boasts a great deal of music Leonard Rosenmann fits every scene. There are a few holes in the manuscript, but that should be exempted, since the original deal was to convert the three books into two films, many of which were crammed into the first film. My biggest grip is some of the character design, Samwise was a bit clumsy, while the other hobbit worked perfectly normal. Other characters are well written on the screen, and the vocal actors are doing a wonderful job, I was pleased that Legolas is actually more useful to the scheme. Orcs with telescopes are more comical than being scary, while the algorithms of novels are strange and mysterious. <br /> <br /> The other problem is that the evil wizard is called Saruman, Aruman, thanks to the book. In general, I think more money and better writers would have done so much justice, but there is something magical about it. Ralph Bakshi made a brave effort to make the screen adaptation of these classic stories. The movie is awfully overflowing with live action films, but it's still a great movie for cartoon lovers of all ages.
