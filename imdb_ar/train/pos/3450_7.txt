I have never heard of this film until I saw that DVD rental I was a bit skeptical, there have been many movies in the past with good reps who can not do any bad screenplay, and in some cases it does not seem to matter to me. <br /> <br /> Well, I just saw him and there was no reason not to give this movie a play, it's good. The story may seem like most of the stories in this kind a bit turbulent at times, but there seems to be a great deal of realism here too allowing for momentum. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Justin Timberlake's work here, too. Well, he is no longer an Oscar, but he will learn every role and show a lot of promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott was surprisingly good in his unexpectedly bad role, certainly the straw of the crop in this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, try it. You will not be disappointed, you will not feel bored, in fact, I think you will be more than happy with the end result.
