Soprano stands out as a court and a dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and identified with money. By putting the story in an environment of the underworld, David Chase removes all barriers to necrosis, on earth, and means dismantling the post-modern era. <br /> <br /> Every character is an aspect of American industry. Tony Soprano exemplifies the besieged labor force, torn between family duty and the need to maintain his "work" on an equal footing. The convergence of these two things is the necessity that keeps the story going. The characters of Christopher, Pauli, and Bobby reflect loyal followers - who serve themselves in every institution, and who are trusted by necessity rather than merit. With Ralph's character, Joe Pantoliano wrote a wonderful interpretation of the enthralling psychopath, a quirky businessman who thrives on violence, surpassed by his incredible power. Dominic Chianissi is the ultimate symbol of the old guard, who maintains power through established relationships and the need for young and old to ignore blame. <br /> <br /> Despite being annoying and sometimes annoying, the soprano has earned its status as the ultimate television drama. <br /> <br /> Note: The Shield, another violent accompaniment that has made the most interesting characters, will be a good part of the Chase series.
