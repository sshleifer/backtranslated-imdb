"Cinderella" is a film about a little girl whose mother died and her father remarried. As soon as her father died, Cinderella's wife became meaningful to her and made her do all the household chores, like cleaning after her evil sisters. One day the king sent a letter to all single women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella could not go, but her followers did not. Cinderella was very upset and I thought there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball until her imaginary sister appeared. I did some magic and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she had to return by midnight because this is when the magic turns back. While in Royal Ball, Cinderella loses time and hits the clock in the middle of the night, so she runs out of the palace and loses her glassy look. Then the king orders the Duke to find women who wear these slippers. The Duke searched every house, but finally found the women who belonged to him, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronemi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Lusky directed one of the best Disney animated films in 1950. This film revolves around a magical novel. At the beginning of the film, Cinderella was a maid to her family and had no one to love her, but with little magic, her whole life changed and finally found love. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is music. When the fictional goddess Cinderella appeared and performed her magic, she sang the song of Pbidedi Boubide Po. When I was a kid, one of my favorite songs was to sing around my house, so I'll never forget it. I also loved the part that Cinderella sang and the prince sang, so this is love while they were dancing because they realized they were in love. In general, this film was my favorite film when I was a little girl because every little girl wanted to live a fairy life.
