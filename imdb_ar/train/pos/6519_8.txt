This film has great stars in their previous years: Ingur Stevens never appeared the most beautiful; Jules Brenner Jean-Lafitte was very convincing, opposed to his pirate and his desire to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a good job like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit cumbersome. It is really a good click for students to learn this part of our history. This indicates that all happy endings do not include lovers who meet with each other - and sometimes the happiest ending is that they sail away and find partners of the same background who will understand them better in the long term. I have seen him every year at least twice for 16 years now; and although it is not the best film I've ever seen, I love him every time!
