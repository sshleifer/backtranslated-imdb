Jason Bourne sits in a bloodied room on his hands, trying to understand what he has just done. At the same time, the head of the CIA in New York City identifies the agency's response to what just happened on the screen. The American flag proudly stands at the center of his office in front of the picture, but as he speaks, the focus shifts from focus because his plan turns into a morally questionable area, as if she does not want to be linked to the course of action determined by the government man necessary for national security interests. <br /> <br /> This snapshot effectively captures the mood of the film. In addition to portraying Bourne's quest for Jason Bourne, Ultimatum also examines the human costs of measures taken to protect us in order to achieve stability and security. <br /> <br /> It's also probably the best film you'll see in this year's cinema. <br /> <br /> It's too intense. "This is not a newspaper story, it's real," Bourne tells Simon Ross (Considine). The camera shakes, but it remains fixed enough to see everything and feels like you're there with Bourne trying to evade his pursuers, and the performance is so good that these people seem like characters they portray, rather than just being well-written actors. The scenes of the movement are fast-paced and well-designed to the point of being instinctive rather than planning for the shortest movement; hard work is not surprising. <br /> <br /> The speed is incredible. It continues to come to an end, but not as quickly as you struggle to assemble the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next set of tense actions. Although it is often simple (the Waterloo sequence is basically just a man on a phone seen by a man on the phone), they are accused of such tremendous intensity that you can not close your eyes. The film focuses only on advancing forward so that it can not help you get through it. <br /> <br /> Through a series of intense actions, a fascinating story, intelligent examination of the decisions taken in the name of national security, and the Bourne series accurately embody the mystery of our time. The alarm is at its peak.
