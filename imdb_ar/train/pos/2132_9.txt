The cast really helps make this fun and over-normal surprise between a man-woman-woman-arguing-all the time-but-the-wind-in-love kind of romantic romantic spiral / comedy. <br /> Usually I do not go to this type of movies and it is a stressful story, but this film was refreshing and enjoyable to watch, and sparkles with magic. Well other and make a very handsome couple. The cast is wonderful - from Felix Bressart always loved to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in his career. Take the film and turn it into a completely different mood for a while when something exciting happens to it. This "twist" is another reason for this movie to rise above others of its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually works. This is a great example. In this film, it is a romantic film, comedian and drama has been well done. I will take over this reworking of your "mail" on any day. no comparison.
