I can not understand what these fans did not like about this movie. It was really a lot of fun. The special effects were fantastic. I generally agree with the reviews and with the voters in IMDB, but not this time. I waited until the video came home which I felt was another reason not to enjoy the movie. I think the special effects movies need to be shown on the big screen, but again it is not. For me, the film is compared to two films that were released around the same time. Blair the witch and the mummy. Both of the movies I thought were awful. Perhaps Blair was the most horrifying horror film of all time. Making mummy gobs of money was a pure dreck. People like it because it has special effects. Movies like Mummy and Haunting are not rich in personal development, they are more like riding a funhouse. Well with this analogy, the mummy was a B ticket to the Hunting electronic card.
