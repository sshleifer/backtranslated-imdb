The original vampire (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how the sequel would work considering they did not use any of the original characters. I was quite surprised at how this was done. As a rule, sequences are not as good as the original, with few exceptions. Although this film was not a great film, the writer has performed well in keeping the main themes and vampire compartment of the first in tact. John Bon Jovi was a flaw at first, but he proved to be a killer midway. I doubt that anyone can top the performance of James Wood in the first one, though ... unless you bring Buffy! <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a decent hour and I will see it again. > <br /> I left with two questions, despite ... What happened to Jack Crowe and how did Derek Place become a murderer? I think we'll just have to leave it up.
