I just watched the movie I was afraid it would disappoint me. I was finally surprised though. The American Pie franchise remains my favorite feature film at all times. Yes, it would not be true if I said I enjoyed it like a prey and enjoyed the original authenticity. House house along with two past pancakes definitely lost something that the first two pancakes had. It will not become a classic as the two have already done. But this hell is still funny with lots of good moments and I think it should be the first movie to be chosen if you want to enjoy and relax after a hard day at work or school. The beta house is worth 6/10 but I gave it only 7/10 for being another slice of PIE.
