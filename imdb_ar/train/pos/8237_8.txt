For my life, why did this movie get rated R?! While it is zombie meat that eats meat, believe it or not, it is really a good family friend - at least if your children are 10 years of age or older. Unlike traditional zombie films, this film enjoys an excellent sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- albeit a bit crooked! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the style of film is definitely directed to children (much like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - however, some joints slapped on the R rating! Believe me, most children have seen worse violence than this, and it seems ridiculous to make the public think it's just an adult movie. <br /> <br /> The story is in a parallel world. While fashions, cars and customs appear around 1953, in this strange world there has been a plentiful zombie plague recently led to a "zombie war" and enormous changes in everyday life. In the school, the children are trained in armed combat and there is a cute scene in the late film where the father gives his son a pistol and asks him to keep him in his backpack "just in case"! As for life outside school, it is also strange, as people now know that zombie is not bad! Heck, using shock collars and training, can be turned into slaves who can do your chores, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick person, be your "own friend". <br /> <br /> This film deals with a certain family that finally buys its first zombie slave (played by Billy Conally). My mother is thrilled and her son slowly becomes a zombie friend. My father, on the other hand, is not convinced - because he was forced years ago to kill his zombie father, and did not beat it !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this movie must be seen by a much wider audience.
