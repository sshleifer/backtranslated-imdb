A good story. Good scenario. Good molding. Behaving in a good manner. Good steering. Good direction art. Good shooting good voice. Hassan Tahrir. Everything is good. Put them all together and you'll end up with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that there are not enough films of this caliber to make these days. We may consider ourselves lucky because writers / directors like John Hughes are sometimes able to hear their creative voices. <br /> <br /> Whenever I notice that I am watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it quite satisfactory, I have to conclude that something about this film is true.
