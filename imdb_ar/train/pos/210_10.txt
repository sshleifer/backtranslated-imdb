Two great actors in the wonderful film Neil Simon based on his successful play. <br /> <br /> A great combination, especially when the comedians concerned are Matau and Burns. No wonder Burns won an Oscar for this; he's as sharp and funny as ever. And Matao is everything in his game, if a boy more spree. <br /> <br /> This is the familiar area of ​​Simon: two old Fudville partners are reunited for a private TV show but are still unable to stand with each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It is a great pleasure to see these two choices in each other, and their scenes together make this movie an absolute joy. Myself, I especially enjoyed "Ways, Ways, Ways / Entry!" Scene. If you are a fan of either Burns or Matthau, you will also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, you'll enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "sunshine" in your life.
