These delightful stylists feature stunning songs and many unforgettable sights. The great distraction is to ignore the entire authentic dialects. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boer), a Belgian (Francine), a Greek (Paxino) and a Hungarian (Lori)! More importantly, Bakal is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these tampering, all offers are very good - especially Paxinou and Lorre offers. But the scene where Boer, Paxino and Laurie meet, and speak in very different dialects, is a real scene! I think, how I see they are alone, that they should have spoken Spanish anyway! It seems very strange that the Warner Brothers did not find any Spanish-speaking actors in Los Angeles! My favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) like Mata Harry (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have got Novarro for a "secret agent" - he was great at Boyer or at least in Francen (which would save a lot on the dark makeup budget).
