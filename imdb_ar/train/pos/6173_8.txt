A wonderful movie - from doctor to sidewalk artist to a whore, with very few exceptions - was wonderful; I thought that Sony Rezdan (Ms. Noble) and Faragesh Herji (Surab) were the best known actors. Even Kurosh Dipmul, who may be accused of over-exaggeration, has introduced a reliable and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing is the work of the camera - the way it captured the streets of Bombay, the quietness that gustad says as he says his prayers and his life inside the small apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall that became a shrine and then destroyed it - and the philosophic artists take it. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch good movies on Indian topics.
