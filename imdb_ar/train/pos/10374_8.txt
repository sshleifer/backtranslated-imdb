I just sat through a very enjoyable 45 minutes of ROLL. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a rural boy, Matt (Toby Malone), who dreams of becoming a sports star. Matt travels to the city and his cousin George (Damien Robertson) will pick him up. Well, this was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is handing him over. Needless to say, Matt was dragged into George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great that Matt George knew some morals and respect while George Matt knew how to relax and enjoy life a bit. Both Toby and Damian were well represented and did a great job. <br /> <br /> Every character in the film praised each other very well, the police were wonderful. David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic satisfaction to the film. Tiny granny gangster reminded me of one of my favorite characters "Pando" from Todin. <br /> <br /> Among the other things Roll liked were the cities she grew up in and lived in for 20 years, Perth and Frimantel. It was good to see the sights and monuments that arose on them, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
