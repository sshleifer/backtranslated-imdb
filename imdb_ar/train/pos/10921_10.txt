After reading a lot of good reviews about this film, I decided to take it for granted (I bought it on a DVD, and from here it got involved "revolves" ... I'm an idiot (the beginning was all I hope for, an ideal setting) along with some of the quotations I've heard in Wu Tang's different albums) for what should have been a good film. But the plot I heard was so great, it was very predictable. Every time I saw a character (except the orchid) I thought it was venom. In addition, the only brilliant character is killed in the middle of the film. Well, then the plot was not very good but at least there was some good kung fu? Error. The battles were very short and few and far between. Granted all the different styles were wonderful, but I wish the battles would be longer. I kept hoping to see the orchid working and living crazy on the walls, but it never happened. I was hoping to see Centipede doing some fast tails but that never happened. I was hoping to see Scorpio in the film for more than 7 minutes, but that never happened. In short, not much happens. Fighting is all routine. Do not be fooled just because this movie has a plot, and that does not mean it is good.
