Because of all the negative reviews of this film, I did not see it nearly. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror film. The acting was not great - apart from the brilliant Alice Krige - but there was some dialogue ("Just consider yourself a lunch.") Totally entertaining. <br /> <br /> Overall, Stephen King made an effort above average - 10/07.
