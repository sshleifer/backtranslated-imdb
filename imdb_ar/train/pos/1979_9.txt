I and my friend, Annette, saw this together and we will comment. <br /> <br /> Both of us enjoyed watching this, although it took some liberties through Dicken's work. Much of the Dicken's work is rather dark and depressing (including Oliver Twist), but this film is all that. It was fun, colorful (visually and musically), and the characters were more sensitive. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Usually, I do not care much about musical and dance movies, but the songs in this production were attractive and lively, and the choreography was wonderful. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: This really says a lot coming from Travis. I can not stress enough how good the dance numbers really were. You can say, for example, that these boys worked hard to rid the routine of perfection. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Three representatives of the IMO; Nancy (Shani W), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reid), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) were distinguished. Man, that Oliver Reid can really do a good villain. This one scene where you see his eyes through the post slot gave me chills down the back ... wonderful. This was Jack Wild's perfect baby Dodger Dodger. Nancy was wonderful (man, she felt bad when she was killed). She can sing too! Glory to the casting section on their options there. I hated the baby Oliver Toyo. He was very tasty and attractive to my taste. (I kept hoping that Bill Sykes would land him in the mud during the chase scene). They were not supposed to make him sing either. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Acting was really wonderful. In addition to the three stars mentioned by Travis, I felt that Ron Moody (Vaughn) did a great job. It was very funny, and at the same time a very slight villain. Supporting actors were very large. Harry Seacombe played Mr. Bambel very well. He has a wonderful singing voice. I saw Mr. Seacomp lead in another film entitled "Devi" where he played the role of an opera singer with enjoyable results. Harry Secombe was supposed to be in many movies. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, the story is not quite right in the book, but IMO was more powerful. This film was not too boring, as some of the musicals seemed to be. The continuity keeps you moving right along with the characters. The melodies do not detract from the plot or make you sleep through too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any music that Travis sees in full should be a rare discovery. This one is actually a rare discovery. It is a very easy-to-see production that carries the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. On a day when all the films seemed to be moving with beautiful faces, this was a refreshing interval. <br /> <br /> Our common rating for this was 8.5 out of 10. (We'll collect up to 9 in this case.). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I rated this number 7 mainly because the Oliver Twist (Mark L.) kid irritated me, and his songs were an overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My classification is 10. Movies do not get much better. You can tell all the participants in this production that they have worked hard to make it what is ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please do not miss this ... even if you do not usually like musicals. It's really a rare treat.
