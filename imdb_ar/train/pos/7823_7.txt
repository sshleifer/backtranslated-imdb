Lengthening, but convincing re-listing of the romance between civil rights leader Steve Pico and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, how they help each other, but the second half is not strong, because of the removal of personality Pico. However, it is a wonderful film with wonderful performances from Klein and Washington, in the film that put the latter on the map. Washington was nominated for the first Supporting Actor for the first time. Overall, a well-made film could have been slightly curtailed. 10/07 .____________________________
