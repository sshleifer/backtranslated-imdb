Neil Simon had a talent for dialogue, and this was not even clearer than the lines given by WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opposite in the ODD COUPLE - a combination of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the credibility of two flatmates. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is a Felixniknik neatnik, determined to commit suicide after a divorce from his wife and reluctantly agree to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with somewhat disastrous results. It seems that everything Felix says and does is paid by Oscar Wall and no one can stand in the other way, where Oscar is the most male and imaginable Felix. <br /> <br /> It was the most entertaining scene for me when the Dove sisters were laughing at the apartment above by visiting them at dinner time. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau, Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in stitches. The talented Dove Sisters are the girls who voted for the Gables (a pair of geese) in the aristocrats of Disney, and here - their comic timing at the top of the sad Lemon story about Desperate is enough to turn the movie into fun. - While still a lot of time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and have enjoyed other screen treatments for his works, you should not be missed. Matthau and Lemmon are quite representative (although they thought about sharing roles before filming began), and of course, it's easy to find out why it turned into a top-rated TV show later on. <br /> <br /> Summary: Simon Top Comedy, not to be missed.
