I watched the movie twice in one week, at two times at a cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was full every time, and people had to keep them away. Since the beginning of the film with "injury" Henry Winkler in the football stadium, the entire audience was angry with the laughter and laughter that continued until the credits. <br /> <br /> For those who like American wrestling, this film should be prepared to see Henry Winkler because you have never seen him before. Look for a very famous actor whose movement in trademark wrestling is a major thing! <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to watch this movie, it's a family comedy at its best!
