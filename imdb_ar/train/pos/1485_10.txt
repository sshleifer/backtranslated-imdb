This film contains characters who play their parts in a delicious way, love the final, when no one knows what they will do in their lives, but it is absolutely wonderful when you see and realize that the priest is right, be fragmented for two people, so what do other people do there? The film embraces you in a new life, into experiences, to be able to dream with the other person and reach those dreams. It also shows you life itself, hard as it is. But gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. The film worked well for me. I bought the movie by the way;) I took care.
