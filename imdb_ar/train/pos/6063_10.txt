Wizards of the Lost Kindum is a film about a young prince (Simon) who was exiled from his kingdom because of the death of his father (the king) by the smiling "counselor of evil". This film about Simon's adventures. Special effects, plot, acting, and overall all about this film is BAD. However, it is very bad that it is funny. You will continue to watch this film just because it is very bad, and as the other reviewer of the film said, it is very bad.
