I am happy because others have enjoyed this film, because I know it does not have a bigger reputation and did not make any profit at the box office. I thought it was wonderful, and there are a number of reasons behind it - Bogdanovic directs the slightest touch, and the cast (especially Colin Camp) is perfect and Big Big Apple was never the best in the film. I've seen the worst movies!
