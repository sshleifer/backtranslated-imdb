This should be one of the best comedy movies on TV right now. It takes a sweet idea about a show about an intimate family and turning it into a totally realistic but funny picture of a typical family full of brothers, bickering boys, fellow brothers, overprotective parents and Bembo sisters. I was almost amazed that it was Disney! <br /> <br /> Thanks to the fact that "8 Simple Rules" are known as comedy and do not try to be more. Many offers (for example, "Sister, Sister" and "Lizzie McGuire") think only that her main character is now a teenager, that she has to deal with social problems and ends up losing her sense of humor by beating. This is a "8 simple rules" trap that avoids; it addresses some problems (such as being a pariah in school) but enjoys doing so. In fact the only time she was serious was really understandable when she dealt sensitively with John Ritter's tragic death and personality. <br /> <br /> And I think, although John Ritter will be sadly lost because he made the show his fingerprints, "8 Simple Rules" can still produce good results if he remembers humor and does not make Kate's father a second copy of Paul Hennessy.
