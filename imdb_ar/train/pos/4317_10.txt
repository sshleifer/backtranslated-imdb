I really liked this film when it was shown, and I'm still doing it, because the film's story makes you feel hopeful about life in general, and people too ... one of the things I love about Laurence Kasdan's films. In addition to the positive feelings of the film, there are other reasons like the Grand Canyon. For one reason, he has a great team ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, a highly acclaimed film that won an Academy Award for Best Picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that the Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. The crash had the opposite effect with me. It was very dark. I will choose Grand Canyon on Crash any day.
