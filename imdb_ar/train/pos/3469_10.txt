This is one of the few films that have been released about the kind of "what if" of the situations that prompted me to think. It was amazing to hear them talking to each other, remembering all the wonderful (and not brilliant) things that had happened between them. In fact, I think there is a good chance that this will happen as the film suggests, and they have already made peace with each other. These are good memories for each fan to stick to them, and the question of what actually happened would be egotistical. What a wonderful movie this was. The comedy aspects of the film were fantastic. The belief that they were together to fix things between them is convenient for people who want to have a chance to clean air with someone they can not reach. If we look at John as such, the relaxed personality was refreshing to hear all the trash I talked about ...
