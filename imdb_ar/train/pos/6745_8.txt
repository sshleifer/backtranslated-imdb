???? The "Turkish Bath" series in the film Noir is located in New York in the 1950s, it must be a hint of something! Strange thing, in all previous comments, no one has mentioned it, but it seems to me necessary to understand this film <br /> <br /> Turkish bathroom sequence: back street at night, a shaky sauna entrance, Scalise wrapped in paper, Massage the thighs. Steve, the kind of young boxer (Beefcake!), And another person, a bodyguard? Dressing ends. Obviously, Dickson hates what he sees there and flops right away. We know he has a good reputation in dealing with suspects. A good cop but getting out of control is easy. Why does he hate them so much? <br /> <br /> Can he hate himself. This part of himself inherited from his father? This dark side that can lead directly at the end of the pavement, in the bottom? What if this dark side is hiding inside a "closet"? Remember: Whenever he meets Scalise (3 times), the man is lying on a bed, and he has men around him just for the company (a "Girls" sticker on the wall near his bed!). <br /> <br /> Scalise Funny works: Harmful Etiquette, Move his neck with pride, Challenge, Push the inhaler (poppy?) to his nose every time he talks to Dixon. Dixon, with vengeance, is intent on installing Scalise, who does not seem to understand: "I have not seen a man as full of hate as you are ... I consider it very funny the way I came after me alone." Four years jump in my face as if I were a special person! why? <br /> <br /> Because Scalise is a really special person: he is the direct heir to Dixon's father: "Your father loved me", "Your father brought me to work." The dark side is embodied, and besides, Well: "Who killed him (Pine)? You or one of your playmates? "Colleagues note how every time they meet, Dexon treats Scalise: he picks the address book from his jacket, slaps his face, and punches him. Dysson, also known as Dixon's son, is the son of a thief.In response, he decided to become a policeman, well, but there is something criminal in him, a dark side: He is a ferocious, murderous, false, not married, bringing a "dizzy blonde" to his usual place to dine from time to time, but nothing else The sarcastic waitress says he does not know how to make love to a woman Dixon has a deep sense of guilt He hates himself for those reasons. " The hood and the beast are like his old leg. The blood will tell us. "Finally, for the sake of redemption, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself: if he gets the Scalise ego to kill him, he will free himself from guilt and release the girl and her father too. <br /> <br /> The end of the film brings us back to the opening series : Scalise is scaled down and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the pavement and wins the love of the lady, who is straight in the end. <br /> <br /> The subject of the movie that has not been spoken well may be the subject of the man who wants to cover his pent-up feelings , To wish to experience the love of women (Jean Duchit) <br /> <br /> (These observations owe her much to comment on the film by John Dushit in the DVD The Frenchman edited by Carlotta
