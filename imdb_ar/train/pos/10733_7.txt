Watching this film once again brought back great memories of childhood. I am now 34, I have not seen this since I was 12-14. I almost forgot this film, but when I saw it again recently, some scenes literally brought tears! This little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like revisiting my childhood. It was a very wonderful experience for me. I will always cherish this film. I hope some readers will contact my experience, not for this particular film, but for any film you have not seen in a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> - Thanks for reading
