This film has been tinged my imagination for some time now. We have all heard or read about it in some kind of text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What will you do if the whole world suddenly disappears before your eyes? In fact, the latter part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates living in a dilapidated house in the middle of the highway system. Andrew is a neurotic wreck to say the least, Dave is considered one of the biggest losers in society. That alone is the main reason why these two men are doing well, because they simply meet only when they need rest. Just so ... <br /> <br /> Right from the beginning of the movie a lot and lots of problems occur to them. Both are involved in crime, and Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply does not dare to get out of the house. Dave is not successful at his job and his colleagues do not treat him well and with the respect he deserves. The magnitude of the problems they are facing increases until that day when they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it. This is very much for them and they hope that everything will disappear ... Of course this is exactly what is happening. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew in a world of nothingness. At first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment, but later discover that they can do whatever they want just because they seem to be the only ones who are still in place. <br /> <br /> There's nothing unbelievably small cast - in fact, along with the first footage of the movie, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the entire film. It is clear that in order to end this, the cast must be too much for the task, because in a world where there is nothing there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up head shots to make her more exciting and she works very well. Director of Photography, Derek Rogers, has a nice way of teasing the audience by blocking visual information, especially when someone sees something and interacts with it, but we do not see it right away. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this can not be a film driven by an event and not so. A lot of work happens outside their home when they move around in a vacuum. This is where some of the happiest scenes occur, especially if Andrew discovers a dessert. <br /> <br /> Now, one can think: "How does nothing look?" Well, it looks like nothing in fact. The whole world of white nothing ... white regardless of the direction you look at. This is the weakness of this film ... After an hour or less it becomes very boring, and there must be events to make sure it is interesting to look at. Thank God, there are some. For example sometimes when the two players, due to the characteristics of none, are able to jump high as if he was not making something of ... tofu (as Andrew claims). It is interesting to see how they are instantly able to use anything to become gods of their small community. <br /> <br /> Among the best parts of the film ... fashion designer Jasna Stefanovich is a beautiful job in this film, the house where these two people live is very fun to look at, but it seems appropriate for them to live in a place like this . All in all, production design is without doubt one of the strongest aspects of this film because it makes the movie worth watching ... <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the film is acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are both professional actors. The camera is on it every second of the film, and as mentioned earlier, there is almost no film in the props, they are really in the nude stage. With a lot of personal development, some good themes, and intelligent dialogue (sometimes very stupid with joy), all this works to this end - and this really moves the film away from the low budget area to fine craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Let's talk a little bit about visual effects, because they are definitely worth mentioning. Nothing is characterized by digital visual effects and artificial limbs that equate to any modern horror film. There is a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film, and although The Drews has completely molded this scene, it is still interesting to see. One of the best visual effects in the film is finally where Andrew and Dave suddenly discovered their abilities in this environment - they have the ability to wish everything away, so what if they could do it in the opposite direction and make things appear? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and well-lit film, it really helps to promote the idea that they may have died (this is actually one of their theories), but "Nothing" is comedy and it is slowly destroyed Her own theory. We do not know where they are or what happened to them. Do not know if they will come out, because the film ends before we see anything like that. The end, by the way, is not as good as it could have been. It is fairly easy to predict what will happen, but the writers are still thinking of some incidents that help make them more interesting and in the end, they are somewhat satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Take "Hulu Man", "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Era" and lots of other movies and you have "None." It is already a mix of different styles, (At least what I know) For people who remember the original Cube Production comment on their DVD, they may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he put it to the Cube story and talked about André Begelić in his roommate at the same time, The room is very full with no hope of coming out, "nothing" can be the version that was introduced to the origin of the story of the cube, to this end, it looks like one of the pre-Cube bouquets. <br /> <br /> What will happen I have enjoyed "nothing", it's a wonderful film and the various parts of the film are very well designed with lots of smart ideas, but I still feel that the film is missing something and I have problems knowing exactly what it is ... maybe if "Nothing 2" I can answer this question "Nothing" is a wonderful movie, but it is not as good as I expected it to be. <br /> <br /> Final Rating: 7.5 / 10
