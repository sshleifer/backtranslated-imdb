I've been a book lover since third grade, so of course I was watching the movie, I read the sequel, then watched the TV show. It was a good show in itself, and now as an adult, I still enjoy the show. My only real problem is that they did not follow the book. The first time I saw her, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But this comes from a girl who owns the first addition to the book. But after a time I decided to try it again and ignored the book (somewhat like what you do with Harry Potter films). I found the series awesome! It has been a great experience and something that everyone can enjoy, and it's just a comedy to keep everyone going. It's really fun! Clean and wonderful!
