I really enjoyed the performance of the main actors. Emma Long is courageous and interesting. The manager developed the presentations where the characters are not one-dimensional. The story is complicated with the change between the ages. We also appreciate the story behind the loss of power unions and the impact of a large employer closing down on a small town. I do not agree with the comment that the older man should be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without being a good-looking male. The personal depth can be attractive to shallow shallow. The film has a good look and good cinematography as well.
