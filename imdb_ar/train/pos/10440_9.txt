This film is clever. That is, more than most other films, transcends the least common denominator - people probably will not appreciate it. The story also depends heavily on dialogue. There are some similarities that are similar to Lost in Translation, although before sunrise is brighter and less abstract and simply better. <br /> <br /> The text, characters and even the surreal atmosphere feel a bit real. Actors play quite brilliantly. I rarely saw a movie where this script and representation completely melted together. <br /> <br /> The dialogue shifts to very personal issues, with the possibility of becoming slightly higher. However, it is still on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few embarrassing moments a bit. Balancing this fine line requires talented actors. Sometimes, the result is fantastic, and overall this movie is simply enormous! Rarely is "love" in the movies in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time this happens, the result is great. I think the stunning beauty and immortality of the leading actress seems to have helped a little bit in this regard. Still look stunning in this film, after 12 years. <br /> <br /> This is just a jewel movie you can not miss. One of the best films I saw in the 90s!
