AG was a great show of drama, suspense and excitement, which is very rare for American television. Sheriff Lucas gave a lot of viewers. We were rooting for Caleb while he was trying to resist Sherif Lucas' initiatives. We became involved and afraid when we knew the unexpected relationship between these two personalities. The manipulation that gave a weekly reason to fear what Lucas would do after that was really surprising. This exhibition stands up to the title of "Gothic" in very rare ways to try American entertainment, less sophisticated. The suits made a big mistake in not supporting the show. This offer lays bare the abundance of current "realism" programs - less than satisfying the audience. The DVD set is well founded. This offer is a high quality display for a market that is thirsty for quality. The audience, tired of over-saturation of realistic realism, will welcome the genius of telling true stories. Bring on a DVD box set!
