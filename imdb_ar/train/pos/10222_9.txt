The potential duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte collaborates in presenting some interesting and interesting presentations in The Angel Levine. It's an interesting development on the themes of "It's a wonderful life". <br /> <br /> Zero is married to Ida Kaminski and belongs to a special category of poor elderly Jews in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminski is bedridden. He has shortened his application for social welfare. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cried out to God for some help. <br /> <br /> Maybe now if he got someone like Henry Travers, things might have worked differently, but even Stuart had a problem accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing for him, more than 100 years of this deadly file and all his ties to the earthly things were over. God sent to Mostel a very different thing: the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who should have had at least some basic training of the angels before his appointment. <br /> <br /> Belafonte did not accept that he moved from life, that you still have a lot of issues. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he died, hit a car at the beginning of the film. His issues and issues have been set up, and you have a good struggle, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew called Levin. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance of the Polish-Jewish actress Ida Kaminski, who was nominated for the Best Actress Award at the store on Main Street a few years ago. Another prominent role here is the role of Irish actor Milo Ochia, who plays a cute Jewish doctor. I remember Ochia's argument of judgment, I was really surprised to see him and hear him carrying part of the doctor. <br /> <br /> Angel Levin raises some important and troubling questions about faith and race in this society. They are brought to you by excellent actors and of course created by renowned writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure you catch them when you're broadcasting.
