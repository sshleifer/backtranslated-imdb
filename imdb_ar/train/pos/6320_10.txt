The main reason I wanted to watch this movie was because of the wonderful crew. Many of my favorite actors in one film are as amazing as actually seeing. But this film caught my attention. It was not what I expected at all. It's been some time since I saw her, but I remember I could not stop laughing !!! It was not the representatives who did it for me. The script was surprisingly written. Every time you expect something to happen, it does not happen. There were a lot of twists and turns, but they corresponded to the full tone of the film rather than a taut. The cinema, along with the group, was also very beautiful. I really can not say anything bad about this movie! Expcept, I like Andrew Davoli a little more than the screen time!
