You have never seen this movie and enjoyed singing and dancing by Kane and other cast members: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a great voice and Robbie Keller, (By Thorne). James Cane plays Chester Kent, who writes the musicals and ends up with Proglies, which appears among the feature films that appear in cinemas during the 1930s. Chester has a problem with people trying to steal his ideas for his performances. This is a very fun movie with lots of comedy and lots of laughter. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) gave a very supportive role that was very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was wonderful as a singer and dancer and just began his long and successful career in the field of screen. Enjoy.
