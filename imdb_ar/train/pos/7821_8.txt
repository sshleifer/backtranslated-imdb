Denzel Washington rarely makes a bad film and thinks about what applies to Kevin Klein. In this case, it should be considered one of their best films. It is about a film about how strong friendship is more than the story of Steve Pico, though we take a closer look at what the man was like and how the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to keep the name of the man and to inform the world of a corrupt and corrupt society that was South Africa. The wonderful direction of David Attenborough was also for Gandhi though that if there was any criticism could be the goal it could be in the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to watch a historical film. The amazing thing is how to manage it to control all the extensions. Thousands of people in both films. This film really opens your eyes to what happened before the breakup of Aparthiet and can not fail to move it out. 8 of 10.
