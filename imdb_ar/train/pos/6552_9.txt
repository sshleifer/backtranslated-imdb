I usually do not like Emma Roberts much, but after watching Nancy Drew, I changed my mind somewhat. The actors in the movies made everything exciting and funny. Most of the time when you see a mysterious movie, you can solve it before the middle of the show, but you seem to be in this film in fact. The clues must fit together so that you can finally understand the whole crime. I'm still amazed how I found it. The whole movie was really smart and the people who watched the movie with me loved the film too. Clothing was my favorite part of the film, it was very nice. I do not think there will be another film like this until the sequel comes out. I give it nine years because the wonderful girls did not have the right part, but they still laugh at me. It was a really wonderful film and a great puzzle. I would definitely recommend watching it.
