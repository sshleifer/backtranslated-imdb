This is one of those films - like Dave, American Dreamer, and Local Hero - that captures the viewer's interest again and again. Rarely do light films win the Oscars, but the act of this film deserves Soapdish. Even after watching the film for the film and knowing what will come, it is still interesting to see how the various aspects of the cartoons evolve. True, all drama is melodrama. But this is quite appropriate for his film The Background of the Soap Opera. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can not I write like this?" I think it is unfortunate that television and the censorship site monitor all this unnecessary sanitation.
