This game is a bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and you must be in the greatest number of hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game but then came Nightfire and it was better, but now there's a new type of James Bond game. This time the game is a third person correction, there are more than 12 important, game graphics outside this house. It includes all the great actors and actresses in this game, such as Pierce Brunson, James Bond, William Dafoe as villain Nikolai Diafolo, and Judy Dench in the role of M (forgive me all if I am wrong). This game will be the biggest James Bond game. <br /> <br /> I give this a 10/10
