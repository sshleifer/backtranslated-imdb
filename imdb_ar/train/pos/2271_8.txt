I've just finished listening to the director's commentary on this film, and I think the only thing I got from him is that this film, like Mann's The Insider, is completely personal. It's from Howard Bove. So any review or attempt to think about a set of comments on this subject, as Ebert did, is really a Nolte personality. If you feel, as he did, that the movie "does not work," you say, I think, that Howard does not work. To be frank, you may be right. Howard's logic and personality will not stand up to professional mental health treatments and analyzes. <br /> <br /> But hey, this is the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew
