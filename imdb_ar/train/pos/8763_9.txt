This film is cool, bare truth. Often think "No, this will not happen to me." but it is possible. Drug trafficking is big money and people (or con artists) are often not known to do things to smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who love them, and they just want a strange holiday - which turned into a nightmare. People should know that this type of event is unlikely or exaggerated - this is a big problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I recommend this mature mature film because of the understanding needed to really appreciate this film. It is very emotional and raw. Well worth watching and definitely stay in your memory.
