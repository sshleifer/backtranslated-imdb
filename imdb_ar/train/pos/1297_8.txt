A faithful adaptation of the brilliant and provocative French novel about a middle-aged program engineer is naive or depressed (or something), relying heavily on the first person's novel, but the worst. Pessimistic (in a kind of petty bourgeoisie), philosophical and black humor, the best way to describe both the film and the novel is that it resembles Charles Bukovsky's more intellectual (unintentional CB intent). Very funny, but also a dark analysis of social and sexual relations, the great achievement of the film is that it reflects real life in a recognizable way to make you ask: Why are not other films like this? One rare example of a good book makes a film equally good.
