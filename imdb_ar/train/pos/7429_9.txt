She is an extraordinary singer who cares about anything else !!!! This latest scene is one of the best moments in all biz show - bar none !! I'm glad she kept the camera on itself for ten minutes - it deserves this iconic status - like the power of sound. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time when I was five years old and had a great influence on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some drawbacks (like Esther like to leave Grammy right as her prize is being advertised). <br /> <br /> But some other user comments are false - I mean, where is the unjustified nudity - maybe we've seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's ability to sing is enormous, and if she has a big ego - it's okay! <br /> <br /> I've got it.
