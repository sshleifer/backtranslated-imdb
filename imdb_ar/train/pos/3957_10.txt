The three of them have always been among the many actors I have loved. I love every one of the shorts they made. I love all six speculators (Corley, Chimp, Mo, Larry, Joe, and Corelli Joe)! All the Shorts are hilarious and also have many star actors and other great actresses who had a lot of them in many pants! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors ever, and is the most extreme comedy team ever. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is only the Beware Husbands! All that appears in this short film is Christine McIntyre, DeGreen, Doris Hawk, Alan Lockwood, Johnny Cassier, Nancy Saunders, Lou Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emile Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great deals here! There are lots of funny parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There are three other similar comedians such as this one called Bridless Groom and I recommend them!
