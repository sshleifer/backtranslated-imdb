I just watched Bugs Bunny early (the first time it's named here) and Elmer Fuddon on ThadBlog as a YouTube-linked. This was the first time that Chuck Jones was directed to "wcbit wabbit". As a result, Bugs has a different voice from Mel Blanc of the Brooklyn / Bronx voice we know more. In fact, according to Thad, he directs Jimmy Stewart (the "shy boy" character at the time). However, after Elmer bought his pet, Bugs became angry at him by running the radio loudly, pretending to die after his master repeatedly drove him out of his bath and said, "Turn off those lights!" Whenever the mare holds him in his bed. Even with a different voice, it is sure that Bugs is the same hurtful, and I laughed myself all the time! According to Thad, there was another scene at the end of Elmer just giving the house to the Pig after the hell it had gone through, but this was considered too sad because it suffered a mental breakdown at that point, and that too was the scene it had lost. Anyway, I highly recommend the Elmer pet rabbit.
