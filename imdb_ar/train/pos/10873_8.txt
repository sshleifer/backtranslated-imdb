This film really deserves a greater appreciation. It is truly an amazing and rich image of blood relations, favors and loyalties in the underworld. The film was beautifully filmed and transformed into all the classic crime themes of treason and power. This film is a movie movie pioneer, it requires attention, understanding and rewards in the end. He is the godfather of Hong Kong, a welcome change instead of fighting another wireframe, the epic of martial arts that seems to be the major contributor to the film world of Hong Kong and China. It is characterized by the arrangement of great characters, actors and evolution although it is fair to say that I should have seen it only twice to prove what was happening with some characters because of the multitude of their interactions in the film. ALl in all 8/10 characters are great but there are characters that do not stand out enough and the music did not really succeed and sometimes it felt like it did not coincide well with the procedure (there is a procedure by the way) so it loses some points for it.
