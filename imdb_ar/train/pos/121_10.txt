Critics need to review what they classify as a high quality film. I think critics have seen a lot of motion pictures and surrendered to Matrix in movies. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one view is not enough to understand or appreciate this wonderful film. Lars von Trier explains that ancient methods of photography can produce great cinema and embrace drama and tension. Raises the effect of the rear projection he uses during the film and enhances the characters, focusing on the conversation they find. Other influences that he uses such as color, white and black in one scene are very similar to Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat and draw attention to drama and the meaning of the scene. The comment is wonderful and has a hypnotic effect, while once again maintaining a focus on the central characters in the scene and there are actions. <br /> <br /> I can talk about the effects more, but I think you will all agree to pay this movie to its own category, really increase the film drama. Film to buy if you do not already have one movie to see if you do not own it. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss watching this noir artwork from one of the great film directors.
