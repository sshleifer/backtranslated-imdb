The actors are different and now they have taken a different approach in our smart street team "Networth" vs.. The supposed professional team "Magna" but the boy if you think the smart street team will have a problem to be right. While the Magna team sometimes struggled, the street team simply broke up week after week. <br /> <br /> First, some of the things we have to repeat about Trainee 3 first of it continue in the same ridiculous mindset (Trump) and the game in this series: If you are a good project manager, but you lose, The team runs you and will be kicked out, although your teammates in the back challenge often do half the ass. It is simply absurd that the game that claims to employ the best candidate actually "get rid" of the best while the wrong candidates challenge each other until one is left and that person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> We have seen anyone in this season a bunch of degrading stereotypes and stigmas and even homosexuals carried out while the teams try to campaign. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Tara Dudel, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, these three are the only ones who felt that Trump had fired unfairly, and the rest had already come because they instigated only the conflict, anger and suffering. It's just as amazing as one of the candidates Audrey Evans has said about how to get her out of a good job and how some of her teammates still have no value in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's the game, it's the "trainee" where manipulation, stabbing, and always popular "mentality of everyone on the rules of the project manager." <br /> <br /> It has been an entertaining journey, though, candidates are given a wide range of tasks from taking pictures to building miniature golf courses, and building new apartments. <br /> <br /> However, the "apprentice" is still all you can do basically is to laugh all the time as madness and chaos until you are lucky is the winner.
