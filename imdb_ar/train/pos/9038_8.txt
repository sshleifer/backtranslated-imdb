I love October sky. The thing I loved most was music. I worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, the viewer is given a time frame. This is done by running songs from the late 1950s. At 2 o'clock, the result is automatic. The music now fits perfectly with the film's mood. <br /> <br /> I did not just enjoy music, but I also enjoyed the band. Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of Homer Hickam was a special surprise for me. He performed first class, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie about escaping the life that is set for you twice now, and each time I enjoyed myself accurately.
