Simply put, this is the best film coming out of Michigan since ... Well, never! Evil Dead eat your heart, hate A Minute were some of the weirdest and best cinemas that this reviewer will have seen for a long time. I recommend this movie to anyone needing a trip back and forth, or a good state of wills!
