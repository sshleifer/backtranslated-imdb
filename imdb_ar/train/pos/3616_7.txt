The discovery of the unknown Michelle Rodriguez in the role of Diana as a stroke of genius is ideal. Her acting experience actually works in her favor. We have not seen it before, so it looks like her story. It also brings real hardness. This works against it even though we do not doubt it. You'll never have to encourage them to win because they never encounter any fighter we do not think they can win. So as a boxing film, it failed. <br /> <br /> Then again, this is not really boxing film. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be an angel is not a boxing movie? You do not do that. But Karin Kosama has anyway. Like many indie movies, Girlfight defies classification or genre and stands singly like folklore that can happen soon in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana's performance is poor at school. She hits people she does not like (all the girls in her school, for example). It does not suit her. Her father forces her little brother Tiny to learn boxing so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives little money for his boxing sessions and does not give Diana anything, as if she does not need to defend herself, or anything useful in her life. Tiny wants to go to the School of Arts (Clichy, Yuck), so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana, who really wants boxing. Things get complicated when Diana turns into another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who is looking to become a professional. From there the story ends towards the inevitable ... The two meet in the battle of the title of amateur. <br /> <br /> What left me cool is that I did not find any of this interesting. It's all very believable. Children living a harsh life in rugged urban areas are returning to sport. Many professional boxers have risen from these conditions. The mental and physical rigidity required by this upbringing requires a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. This time she's a girl. Great deal. <br /> <br /> Or there's another place to take: Finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced by discussions about people's lives and feelings. Everything uses fighting as a platform through which to draw a bigger picture. respect. Overcoming adversity. Self Discovery. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because she enjoys a good spirit and is an example of some of the great works done by the first director. Dialogue never talks about the quality of the soap opera, but the story itself has already changed my mind on some things. Yes, the world now looks better. The film did it. <br /> <br /> Grade: B-
