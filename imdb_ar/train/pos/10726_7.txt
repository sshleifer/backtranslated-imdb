To my surprise, I enjoyed Spacecamp so much, I remember seeing him about 13 years ago and I recently hired him again. I was very impressed. The special effects in today's space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp. However, this film has a story - a very typical story from the 1980s where you can almost read the next line of dialogue before you hear it. But that's what I like - he no longer makes films like this, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Lev Phoenix and Lea Thompson in early roles, with Tom Skeret and Kate Cabchu to add material to the light and subtle plot. We totally loved the robot that was named Jinx, it was very nice, but unfortunately it was more animated than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at NASA's Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
