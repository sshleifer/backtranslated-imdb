This western is done differently from most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work with Rip Torn at his ranch. How this presentation is made makes the most interesting slice of Americana. I'd rather see it on the big screen instead of the tape, but it's worth considering to see how life has returned to the real West. Excellent cinematography. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excel In this film.
