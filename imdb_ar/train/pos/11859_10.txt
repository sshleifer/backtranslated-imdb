On the MTV family, all ballers and callers draw the classic movie Scarface from the DVD set. This may give you the idea that Scarface is "movie gangs". Sure, there are bands and gangs in it, but this is not the goal of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban haven looking for a new way of life. Falls into a mob group and becomes the drug lord known. Montana was all you did in your life. Classic phrase: "Say hello my little friend!" In Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think of Brian DePalmas, Scarface. This falls under my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie you should see. regular.
