Pierce Brosnan is the newest but no longer James Bond, he is a murderer. He is very good at what he does, but he gets old and tired. Greg Kenner is really good as a straight and narrow businessman. Now when the story opens, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one evening they have drinks in the bar and start talking. Then suddenly you find these two people come together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is top notch, the hilarious humor I did not think Pierce Brosnan would be funny, but he really has to say that this film has to be seen.
