While this film was better than 101 Dalmations (a live event, not an animated version), I think it's still a little less than Disney could do. It was well filmed, the music was more appropriate to work, and the effects were better (compared to 101). Perhaps the acting was better, but then human characters were given more appropriate roles in this sequel, and Glenn Close should not be missed, as in the first film. They make it shine. Her poor poverty and extreme side descriptions are wonderful characters to play, adding to the scene that Disney gave us. It is a wonderful family movie, with little or no objectionable material, yet it is fun and enjoyable for adults and children alike. It must be a classic, as with many Disney movies. Hopefully you will have a better third - because you know they might want to create one. ;)
