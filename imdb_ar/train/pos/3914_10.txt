I personally think the film was done in a very professional way, I liked the design of dances and acting. The plot is also sweeping and mysterious. The film itself is very passionate, and what I most like is that it makes you think later. Antonio Gidds lived his role until the end, and I have to say that it is one of my favorite pictures and Sora is a great director
