This has funny jokes from every Cheech & Chong clicks. This is the first time I saw these guys. I found it to be really good. My dad actually recommended me to get it. What a great role model, the GRANDMA that you already bought me, knowing how it was shaped. What a family I have. Well, this movie is very good and a great lease when you want to see a good classic movie. I have to warn you, this is not funny. Her moments but not as funny as there is something about Mary. Check it anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless you have an anti-drug activist or something.
