I think this film will only work for people who have all been stopped by the giant fury of the Lord of the Rings. Well, I was as well. And I really love this movie. I especially love all these impeccable superhero heroes of LotR because they are cynical and perfect. The most prominent is the counterpart of Gandalf (the courageous, wise and completely ignorant healer): singer, cheese and dead death bisexual. His counterpart, Soron ("Sauro" from East Germany, of course) wears a simple sling with holes in his eyes like a helmet. Aragorns changes the ego is another stupid subject to the accident trying to repair his broken sword ("Ulrike" legend) with Scotch tape. And "Strunzdumm" (peer Wormtong) already has some strong similarity with Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
