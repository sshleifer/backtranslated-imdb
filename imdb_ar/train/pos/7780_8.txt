Robert Stack never won the Best Supporting Actor Award for Oscar for his role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind" by Anthony Quinn for 12 minutes in Lust for Life. Stack plays the highly volatile alcoholic son of the oil swivel. He lived his life under the buddy who grew up with him, Mitch, who played rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marley (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut, and she likes Mitch. Their story is painted in glorious color under the able management of Douglas Cirque, who has really dominated the field of melodrama with some amazing films, including "All All Heaven Allows," "Magnificent Obsession," and many others. > Do not be wrong - this is Potweller, and Stack and Dorothy Malone are both taking their roles. Malone won the Best Supporting Actress award. There is one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she dances violently on loud music while her father collapses and dies on the stairs. We have led to the belief that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the man who pumps gas, because she loves Mitch. Mitch does not want anything with her. He loves Lucy so hard, because out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt that he would be very keen to get there today regardless of his love. <br /> <br /> Both Hudson and Buckal play less exciting roles here - the Hudson Mitch is the good guy who has cleaned Kyle's mess all his life, and Bacall is the wife of Mitch who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after A year of moderation. Sirk focuses on the most volatile players. <br /> <br /> In Sirk's hand, "Written on the Wind" is an effective film, and the ultimate scene in the palace is very exciting. The director got a gift for this type of film, and although he had a lot of imitators, he did not have equal.
