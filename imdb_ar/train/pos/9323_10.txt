For me this film was strong. I do not want to be a spoiler, but I have had a friend for years; we were like brothers. This film brought back some vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I could not put my vote on this movie which would have been 10 years old. I kept getting a message like "No vote put ...." However I saw in the stats that were there. I will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Simple flaws that you've missed. The relationships between the characters that got me. Acted correctly and real cases. I've been in two of them. <br /> <br /> A small gem of the movie. Just like "spring forward" is another gem ignored. I am very happy such films are still made; about relationships between people, well written, sensitively unfolded with first-rate acting and direction. After all, is not that what it is about?
