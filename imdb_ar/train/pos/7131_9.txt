This TV movie is a great movie. This is probably the best and preferred role of the award-winning BAFTA (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thaw) A man who lives in a lonely village long since the death of his wife and son, now landed with an evacuated person named William Beach (Nick Robinson) when he recognizes this child, begins to form a friendship. So William Mamma (Annabel Abession) wants to bring him back. After Tom worries about not calling him William, he goes to London to find him. In the end, William gets on his house with a loving family (or father). He was appointed during World War II and this is an excellent film. She was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Zu was ranked third on screen 50's greatest stars on television. very good!
