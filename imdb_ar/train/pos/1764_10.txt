Steve Carell is in his first role in the 40-year-old Virgin, where he was only supportive in films such as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman and his work at The Daily Show. We got a little taste of Karel's comedy Oh really. You can say that Will Ferrell has influenced his "comic air" but Karel moves him to another level, all he does is innocent, loved and fun. I will not hesitate to say that Steve Karel is one of the great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin is two hours of nonstop laughter (or 4 hours if you see it twice as she did), casting the shadow of perfect support and great clues to the audience through the entire film. The script was perfect with lots of wonderful fonts that you'll need to watch the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music fits perfectly with the tone of the film, and you can tell the director that he knows what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sexual jokes, some nudity and lots of languages, this movie is not for everyone, but if you like Crashers or Anchorman or any movie like that, you'll love The Old Year of Virgin.
