That's someone I am. Not just me, as I can see here at IMDb or when you leave the theater. Why do people love her? Obviously: everyone knows zombie now (at least lovers of horror by heart and others through the movies "Dawn of the Dead" or Resident Evil movies etc.) or at least thought they knew everything about the zombie. So this movie came. You'll see the zombie in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror film, although it contains some violent scenes, but it is a comedy. Spelling should be accurate. Do not run out of power! That's why I categorized them very high. It is wise to be wonderful, the behavior is wonderful and the text contains no errors (clear) ... Quite the contrary: it is a gem and if you are interested in a little Xlsali only you must see it! Even if you do not like it, see it! Because it's a fantastic (comedy) movie!
