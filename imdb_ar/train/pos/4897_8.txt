This film brings you from the beginning because it attracts our attention by acknowledging, yes, that this story opens with cliches? Funeral. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a non-Jew, I did not give her 8 as these articles were repeated over and over again: Great reunion for famous person, choose one, please, team, army platoon, play, singers and band. <br /> <br /> But this film never stops for cheap sympathy, and when you think it will go in another direction. One example is the flowers that a fan sends to Judy. <br /> <br /> The band members represent an interesting group and roam over the clichés as well. One in prison, one found religion, the other is Alki, and one drowned in dementia. But Joey de Viver's game, discovered by Judy, sparked by her granddaughter's interest, carries us along and makes us overlook the simplistic nature of the plot at times. <br /> <br /> The actors are talented, Leslie Karon, the unrivaled jazz musician, Cleo Lin, with her stunning high notes, a recent performance by Joan Simms, and Brava Joan, a cute flirtatious stickman, Jan Holm owns a ball, and Olympia Dukakis As an absolute reap of money living in the highlands of Scotland with her Gail Whiskey, the closing scene is the standard Hollywood Land fare, the Star Kids converted to fans of fun for fun, reunion of old lovers, swept young timers music. Life must be that simple. But I was watching him again, and I planned with my own granddaughter. Because in the right hand, sometimes one loves these old clichés. 8 of 10.
