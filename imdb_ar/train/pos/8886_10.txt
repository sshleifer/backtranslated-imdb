I was not alive in the 1960s, so I can not guarantee that this film was a very accurate representation of this period, but it is certainly an impressive and satisfying experience. There are some excellent shows, notably Josh Hamilton (from Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who plays the part of the divided brothers in the war. Bill Smitrovich, a representative of a character long ignored by many, offers a full hearted performance because their strict father, who has to question his beliefs and values, is made proud of going to Vietnam but returns empty at home, Is quite the opposite. All in all, this is a strong and intimate film and I hope everyone gets a chance to experience it.
