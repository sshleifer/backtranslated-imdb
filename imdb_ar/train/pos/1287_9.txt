"Let's Bowl" started on local TV in Twin Cities. It came late at night, something you might stumble upon while browsing the channel after the seventh bottle of Hams. <br /> <br /> Even locally produced ads, which feature Wally outside Grumpy's Bar, hold onto the microphone and stumble nervously - "Ah ... you, Steve Sidahl." I'm not sure why, but that person made me laugh always. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling competition under the guise of settling the dispute between two players, but the game was minor in the commentary and sections. Sedahl has played the game straight, balanced with the strangeness of Rich Kronfeld and hilarious "Wally Hotvedt". The most prominent clips include "How To Get Rid Of The Old Bowling Ball" (Chuck Them In The Lake) and "Tips On Dating", where "The History" duo a couple of prostitutes and Wally ends with a bitter complaint, "I've done it myself!" /> <br /> Another part - what the duo did on their holidays - Steve appeared in the beer can be scattered in the open air, coming out of the refrigerator while Wali struggles to climb the slopes in Taylor Falls, wearing his tight clothes pale blue jacket and big headphones the size. kidding! <br /> <br /> Wally's amazing comments about the "league players", and his struggle to apply the correct prying expression to the various divisions of the highlights. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was selected by Comedy Central. I got some good moments, but the network did not really know what to do with it, managing it during peak times and emphasizing the "competition" of bowling that was never the goal of the show. The commercials continued to flow and the side profiles (Ernie, Pig, Butch, etc.) were more deviant than anything else. It all looked kind of cruel and kind of forced. So John Stuart broke the "Let's Bowl" in the "Daily Show" - (not lame enough, the heinous jokes?) - a shameful treat to show worth much better. <br /> <br /> How many times does "Let's Bowl" come into the world of modern TV, a mix of local flavor and genius nonsense and crap? The grids contain the "total crap" part of the cold, but sad to see it kills a dark, strange and funny little jewel like "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> Here's a hope to put it on a DVD.
