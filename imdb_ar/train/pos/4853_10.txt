I have something of the old black and white movies of this kind, Will Will and Abbot & Costello films especially because this is my favorite. This film was taken on a DVD because it used the same idea that Will Hay used in "Oh Mr Porter," one of the best comedy movies. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie ended at 12:45 am). I find it best to watch movies of this kind, which relate to Ghost Trains, etc., at night with lights off. In this way the story goes into greater detail, the night vision works well with this film. <br /> <br /> The individual lines in the movie may seem slightly dated to some viewers, and I think this depends on the renderer. It is not dated to me though. I am 28 years old and although I am not big enough to be present when this film was first released (my father was nevertheless). I still have a lot of appreciation for some old films of this kind. Sitting in the room in front of the TV with some snacks, drinks, kicking and relaxing at night while watching these movies, there are not many things that can beat the feeling you get while doing so. It's an escape from reality for some time. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men in the film (who has a black mustache) appears three quarters of the way through the film after his car crashes and is looking for a woman who was tracked to the station. This guy was in the classic Hay Heil "Ghost of St. Michaels" as well. I think I was referring to it in case no one noticed :). <br /> <br /> The pieces in the movie are very atmospheric. Look outside the abandoned station as good as if there were no spirit miles in any direction, and the inside of the station is very comfortable as it moves away from the rainstorm outside. I felt like I'd love to be there in the movie with the crew. The atmosphere in this film is something missing from a lot of movies now. Keeps you suspended from the moment the movie starts to end. <br /> <br /> We need more of this kind of movies in today's market. Sadly, however, he may have finished looking in favor of films with nudity, insults and crude humor. This genre of filmmaking (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr. Porter, etc.) for me is the golden age of cinema!
