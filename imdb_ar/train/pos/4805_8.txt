When I first heard about this film, I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew this would not be just a strong film. Almost everything in this movie is gorgeous, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully photographed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really disappoints me is the offers. The Devil Wears Prada is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and showing that she is a great actress and may choose the first Oscar nomination for her performance. Robert Friend is almost as gentle as Prince Albert but has a wonderful chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Pitani is as strong as Lord Melbourne though I was expecting more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson play supportive roles, but they are forgotten. <br /> <br /> For me, the film looks like incomplete. Perhaps the authors of the script have a lot of things in the script, I do not know but that's what I feel about the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall, it's a wonderful film about Victoria's early years with a great performance by Emily Blunt.
