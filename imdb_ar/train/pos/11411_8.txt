S.S. Van Dine must be a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series of studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But it is clear that Van Dine has sold his rights in every book about Philo Vance at one time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more have been released from Philo Vance. It seems that Tarzan is the only one who has been wandering around Hollywood more than that. <br /> <br /> MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the usual detective. Of course MGM had the original screen Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at that time and I think Lewis B. Meyer decided to focus there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is Philo Vance very acceptable. Lowe began a great end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a series of films with Victor McLaglen with the characters Flagg and Quirt. But after McLaglen won the Oscar for The Informer, it seemed to fade in the image market. <br /> <br /> The Garden Murder case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Jane Lockhart, and Frida Inescourt. The evil atmosphere around the type of perpetrator gives up, and the mystery is in fact how all killings are linked and how they are accomplished. <br /> <br /> I will say this. Vance takes a very big chance in revealing the villain and deserves another 15 minutes of Hitchcock.
