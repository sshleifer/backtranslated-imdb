I am a big fan of Joe Denver. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw Christmas special when it was originally on TV and I loved it. I have an original vinyl album and CDs. I have the original disc and version later. The latest version lacks many songs though. I see it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. Wow - thinking that Christmas CD would be worth it. For me any amount worth selling this treasure. It is a CD for Christmas. I never found it on a VHS or DVD. I love to have either version. If anyone has one, please let us know. thanks
