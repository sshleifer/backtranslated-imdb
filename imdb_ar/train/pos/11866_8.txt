Most people who watched this film thought it was the best film ever made. I disagree but this movie is very very good Tony is a bad ass man and knows that he scares and uses it to move forward. It's about how he moved from washing dishes to a huge house and a cocaine office all over the office. If you want a family movie, this is not the way to go but if you want mobs and retaliation and things like that you'll be impressed.
