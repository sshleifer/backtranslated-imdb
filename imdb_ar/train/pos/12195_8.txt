A film in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph along the third man with Joseph Coton. It is also wonderful in the touch of evil. Please see them all! He tends to get comic and self-serving in films like F for Fake, a really stupid waste of the film. Do not waste your time watching it. He is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone who studies the film must see everything he has filmed. All his great masters were tremendous but in the end Wales became intoxicated like his character in a "touch of evil"! For some reason, Orson Wells had a way with women, and I see how attractive he can be in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Coton, or Carrie Grant, John Wayne, and I can go on but I go on ... and because I'm a woman, His attraction. Orson Welles is one of the last real filmmakers. Unless the filmmakers today: Tarantino, Scorsese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers do not reach the filmmakers of the 1940s! I know there are many great filmmakers today but in such a short time I can not name them all. No insult to any of the top filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remind me of some current and future filmmakers, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I love some movies now, but I rarely find any of them on the "100 Best" list. "Hustle and Flow" was fantastic, as was "Fargo" and "Oh, Brother, where are you the art" from the line on Sullivan's voyages; Another good of the 1940s! Can anyone give me the best list in the 1990s and up to 2006? I would like to know who to watch! thank you! Props also to this site! Anywhere else you can connect a movie or boo! I like the screams and delirium of ordinary people like me who can say what I want and promise not to spoil any movie for someone I have not seen yet!
