In 1983, director Brian De Palma began to produce a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster, with the help of a brilliant screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by prominent actors. The result was "Scarface", starring Al Pacino in one of his memorable roles. The story begins in May 1980, when Castro opened the port in Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban citizens to join their families in the United States. 125,000 left Cuba at that time, to the green pastures of America, and most of them were honest people working hard, grateful for the opportunity they had given. But not all. From Marielitus, who flowed into Florida, some 25,000 people had criminal records and nothing less than in Cuba's prisons - criminals considered out of redemption, and Castro just wanted to get rid of him. They also saw America as the land of opportunity, even if Capone looked to Chicago about 50 years ago. Among the most ambitious people is a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his colleagues as "Caracurtada". Scarface. <br /> <br /> Now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he grew up, Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and wanted him now; from the moment he left the boat in Florida, he was determined to own everything. Wealth and Power - That was Montana's dream, and he will do it by doing what he does best, starting with a man in Miami named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez, apparently, had a brother in Cuba who had a sudden end at the hands of one of Castro's followers, a man who, having suffered his benefit to Castro, was temporarily neglected and was currently detained in Little Havana, along with Montana and all Cubans off boats , Where they wait for their papers from the government that will affect their transition to their new lives. In short order, Montana sees that Lopez's brother has avenged, paving the way for his entry into the crime scene in America. <br /> <br /> Lopez, a wealthy businessman with correct connections, returns in favor of Montana and his friend, Manny (Stephen Bauer), is released from a holding camp and puts them at work. In his day, Capone may have been smuggled as a way to tie his coffers to illegal gains, but Lopez has the equivalent of the modern era, which is more lucrative: cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing and studies it in life, but once he has a taste, Montana is not satisfied with any crumbs that Lopez finds appropriate to throw his way, and sets out a path that will take him where he wants to be: at the top. Through a cold will of iron, Montana decides that he will do whatever it takes to get there, regardless of cost. But before he finishes, he will realize the price of his dream and will pay it; but for a brief moment, he may know how to be a man. He will also know whether it is worth it or not. <br /> <br /> Consistent with Palma's vision, Pachino plays a larger role than Montana, and he does so beautifully. From his accent that affects them (which he thoroughly researched to make sure he got alright - and did), body language and attitude, he got everything, and this makes Montana very convincing and true. What brings him to the role is the difference and elegance, in a way that only a few actors (De Niro will be one of them). This is definitely not a sympathetic figure in any way, and there is nothing about Montana that you can relate to easily on a personal level; but the Pacino screen is so powerful that it makes it a very attractive personality, although it's hard to share you emotionally with it. It is simply an unforgettable dynamic performance. <br /> <br /> Michel Pfeiffer also performed well, in the role he placed on stardom. As Elvira, a woman who has become an integral part of Montana's dream, the Pfeiffer is subtle and misguided, giving the sensation that something is happening underneath her, while affecting the cold and distant exterior appearance. Like Pacheco, she makes her presence feel certain, and she slips across the screen with a stunning and mysterious appearance. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Mary Colon (Mama Montana) Murray Ibrahim (Omar), Paul Schnar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). Since then there has been an excellent introduction to "Traffic" and "Blow" as well as a climactic scene reminiscent of the original Peckinpah "The Wild Bunch", "Scarlet" by De Palma and "Scarlet". By many being the ultimate American epic bands. Many acts of violence are implicit and not graphic, but this film still has the advantage of realism that many may find disturbing. But if you stay with him, there is a lesson to learn in the end. Like many lessons in life, often the most valuable is the most difficult at the time. But the reward is always worth it, and that's what happens with this film. I rate this one 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
