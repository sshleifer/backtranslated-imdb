I felt it was necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film because some of them were a little misleading. <br /> <br /> I originally published quotations from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was true since this is the index of "comments" rather than the message board (although we used to use this method before IMDb adds movie message boards) so I will modify them to make them unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, first, you may not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly was first famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production. When Vincent Menelli decided to produce the film "Panorama" Gershwin, Kelly wanted to be more sophisticated than the roles of "Judy to Shouz" he played in most of his films (except for "For Me and My Gal"). Alan Jay Lerner has been instructed to build a new story in Paris based on the story of "Air Ball". This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway even though the Warners had overtaken MGM for the rights of "Air Ball". In my opinion, WB "Pal Joey" is a wreck, although Sinatra was appropriate for the role, but other problems sank in the movie (script changes and the bad direction. ============== == =================================== <br /> <br /> You complain that pictures of Kelly did not It's done well, even quoting your technical education to prove this point, but you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art has been clearly designed to be bad, that it's necessary for the story / characters, the pictures are too bad, the audience knows Kelly is not ready for an exhibition, That is, although Milo ridiculed him to the point where he almost believed him, but it is important that the audience does not sit there. "But, he is an artist Wonderful, if only he has the opportunity! "She wants the audience to fully understand the shortcomings he is experiencing. <br /> <br /> Then he complains of sabotaging his interest in the show; once again she does not understand the structure of the story, refuses because he does not want to He feels like a gigolo, and because he knows he is not really ready for the show, his enthusiasm for the show is not as big as Joe's enthusiasm for "starting a nightclub." But he serves the same function in the plot. For a nightclub after realizing that it was not worth it. The same with the art gallery. If Kelly's paintings are really good, this whole point will be undermined. =============================================== = <br /> <br /> Then she complains that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry." I think it's in the eye of the beholder. I agree that the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but to me it was good. Compare it with the worst "forced" romances such as those between Carrie Grant and Sophia Loren in "Pride and Passion." =============================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the conclusion of the big dance has nothing to do with anything else in this film, it only shows that you did not dig under the surface of the film in its symbols. Many elements are linked in the dance sequence to the story and characters, and through dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he walks around, his love is over). The symphony movements were built so that part of each dance scene reflects a separate stage of Parisian art as well as a separate phase of their relationships. If you do not see it, this is not a movie error. It's certainly not a "load of crap." ===============================================
