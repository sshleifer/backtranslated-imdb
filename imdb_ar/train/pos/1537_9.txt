The film is held in a small Swedish town that everyone knows each other. Here she visits her father Mia on the occasion of her father's birthday, which always happens sometimes in some kind of tragedy, the question is what it will be this year and I will be surprised ... It is a very well-written film, with a story that has an ideal balance of humor and seriousness, What you see. You are happy, hurt, and basically everything in between. Finally you can not help falling in love with Mia (if you are a boy I think (the main actress)) she is a very well chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
