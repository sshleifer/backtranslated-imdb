I am now in front of the TV and watching Casomai. It's changing, it's an evolving or better ID. Start with a wedding courius for the two heroes where their love story is reported. After everything has changed, a child is born, and all the rest happens normally in a couple. It is not a special film because it speaks of an ordinary couple, and the natural state is the center of the film. You do not want to show us something, there's nothing new, it's just a regular love story, a couple story, and its nature is different from the other. It's also a flicker film, everything is short, each scene is only a few seconds long. It is a story that has been reported, and there are many things known because friends and parents talk about it, their opinion is fundamental, and opinions create and destroy the story. It's a simple story for the couple as I said, but it's not boring, it just shows the couple, everything must be known, as it is, but I'm sure that each of you wants to know what's going on, so do not forget to watch the end!
