Scott Henderson, the engineer who employs Carol Richman as an assistant, says he is called "Kansas" whenever he talks to her. It shows us that Carol, who has been played effectively by Ella Raines, is supposed to be as charming in the woods as it is in Manhattan in the 1940s. Only a woman, from outside the city, was following the shady waiter to the high solitary subway. Even so, it is only a naive girl who can do this adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Ciudmak directed this film Noir well. It shows a tendency to raise the story with much of the raw sex that was surprising in those days. How can we justify the way a drummer plays in a musical orchestra, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, such a frank pass by a lady on a date? The drummer Elisha Kook Jr does not disguise himself as a fan of any desire for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the track where he plays. It was a frank and genuine invitation, first to the "phantom woman" of the story, Fei Helm; then, the drummer the same dramatist hints very openly to Ela Renz, who goes into the theater disguised as the mystery the boss originally took. <br /> <br /> This movie connects any scenes from the beginning. There are things that are not explained in it, but they get the attention of the person all the time. The killer was not detected until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines was with her expressive eyes of the estimated actress. She holds her own against more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York theater actor who works in Hollywood, did not find the means he deserved. He is effective as the best friend of the accused. On the other hand, as a man, Alan Curtis appears when he accepts his fate and is saved only by the perseverance of the woman she secretly loved. Tomas Gomez, as Inspector Burgess, is one of the assets of the film as an investigator who has doubts that police arrested the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This movie will not disappoint you.
