To everyone who hates them there: The condemnation of a television series in one episode is like the judgment of a full book after reading the first few pages. Having said this, I was a fan of BSG, I thought it was one of the best TV drama (not just science fiction) on the air. But it is time for the story to end and the story continues. I liked the ending BSG "The Plan", but it raised many new questions that I answered, so I was eagerly anticipating "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping you would not try to try another BSG, and I was glad that "Caprica" ​​was a different thing, and I personally found the story interesting, in a way different from the fire in space battles, explosions and the effects of science fiction (do not miss me) , These things too). Eric Stools and Isai Morales offer strong performances, and Alessandra was fantastic. I can not wait until next week.
