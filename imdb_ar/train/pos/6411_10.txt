This is one of the best military films ever made. It is wonderful because of its emphasis on values. It is a story of wonderful human interests that turn into a commitment to respect, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Both Gooding and DeNiro are fantastic in leading roles. It is wonderful to see Mr. Schiff's racism evolve towards respect and love through the design of Karl Prascher, motivation, and yes, a sense of honor. The title refers to the source of their bonds. I never even noticed this last time I watched how Carl Lumbley's brilliant image of Father Carl, Mac Prascher. In a way, it is the cornerstone of the film, as it is Karl's memory for his father that helps him endure it in difficult times. <br /> <br /> I am selective about the movies I buy. This is one of the rare ones I want on my rack. We will see many times in the future, I'm sure.
