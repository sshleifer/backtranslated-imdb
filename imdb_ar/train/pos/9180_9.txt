I felt a duty to see Timothy Dalton's 1983 copy of Jane Eyre because I just wrote an article about the 2006 Jane Ther in TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I came close to seeing this the way I did homework. <br /> <br /> I was angry at first. Lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is washed in bright white klieg light, in some scenes, casts a shadow over the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> The sound is recorded badly. I felt like I was listening to a high school play. <br /> <br /> The pancakes are very heavy. <br /> <br /> Groups do not convey the full Gothic mood of the novel. They are very tired, as is Martha Stewart. I can not see Rochester in Bronte committing to Martha Stewart's local arrangements. Rochester of Orson and Willis lived in a gloom-like gloom, very suitable for the Gothic novel's mood. <br /> <br /> So far ... With all these objections ... this is not the best Jane Eyre I have seen that it might be better adapted to any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre, despite his technical flaws, re-read "Jane Eyre" for the first time. <br /> <br /> Critics of this production say it is very close to the book For me, someone who values ​​the book and does not need to be less "lyrics" or "less" Christian or more genitive, the sincerity of this version of the novel already written by Bronte is his best. <br /> <br /> Bronte wrote There is a reason for over 150 years, while other texts have gone smarter, more attractive and easier. <br /> <br /> As a Jane Eyre fan for a long time, I was biased against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester, MA Jim and Rochester are a very ugly couple in literature, and Timothy Dalton is nothing but amazingly handsome. <br /> <br /> But Dalton is performing as enchanting as Rochester, and he has blown me away. Rochester brings the page to the flicker of life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is supposed to be a bit scary, and Dalton is scary, For example, when screaming "Enough!" After Fontaine plays a short piano piece. But Dalton is scary more than once, here. You can not really tell if it will hurt Jin, or himself, in his despair. <br /> <br /> The inevitability of Rochester, his humor, his anger, his weakness: Dalton moves all, sometimes apart. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> Here's the main thing - the actor who leads Rochester to convey that he spent more than a decade of his life in a complete and lonely desperation and lives with an ugly secret that destroys life. <br /> <br /> There is no other actor I have seen trying to convey this black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. Current fan in Toby Stevens does not even try. Dalton hits her outside the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton lead Rochester in an individual bar, I said, "This man is a problem. It is the radiator who suffers from severe pain. <br /> <br /> Zila Clark is not only, in general, the best Jane I've ever seen, she's one of the very few Jens who the producers were willing to make while Jane casts the book. No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only from the 2006 version, Bronte has not described * wonderful statues and a strong gene with soft curved eyebrows and temperament lips. Instead, Jane Charlotte Bronte is in fact poor, clear, vague, few and not pretty. <br /> <br /> Zila has a small mouth, two close eyes, and a little nose. It is really "small". It's not a fashion model. She is the best Jane, the most honest in the book. <br /> <br /> Some have described it as cold or boring. No, it's true in the book. Jane Brunt is not a hot red mama, she is a protected and deprived teenager whose inner emotions only come out at important moments, as Zila does here. Jane's book is someone you should see slowly, carefully, patiently, with a note, if you really want to knock it. You should watch Zelah, here, to see who she really is. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more fire in Zelah in one main scene, but this one scene out of five hours in which it is, otherwise, very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version, like every other version I have seen, goes far beyond the full illustration of public Christian themes in Jane "Ayer." Christianity is not a contrasting text in Jane Eyre, Central. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns guides Jane in Christianity, giving her a subversive cultural way of reading, and living, apparently, her fate and her destiny: a life, a Christian, and a Christian God that convinces a poor, Equal to her, her need to rise to the level of her ideals, and her rejection of a basic marriage proposal.This has not been fully explained here. <br /> <br /> In any case, This is an excellent, complex and rich novel, and adapting to it, to all that I have seen, mine and honor. "The best novel of any adaptation I've seen, and that says so much. <br /> <br /> Other versions, which do not respect the book completely, If you do not care what Charlotte Brunate says about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture based on looks and money, adapting to much of the book will be a quick thing forward to getting kisses between Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like the Bronte novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote - about Jane's experiences in Lloyd, and her relationship with St. John - is part of what makes the relationship between Jane and Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.
