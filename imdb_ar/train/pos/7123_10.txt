Sometimes I watch a film and I really admire it? However, it is not easy to explain why I am so impressed. This is mostly true for uncommon movies? One can hardly compare with the rest there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those special movies. Is there a lot of passion in this film? The acting was so good that while I was watching the movie, I was crying and laughing with the continuation of the story. Young Nick Robinson ?? He is a young boy (William) who was evacuated from London because of air raids there during World War II. Mr. Tom, played by John Tao, is an elderly man who leaves the village where the evacuees were sent. <br /> <br /> At first, Tom refuses to take on any responsibilities - like taking care of a troubled young boy? But accepted because he leaves without a choice. Mr. Tom discovers during the stay how horrible life is for William ?? Besides his bags, his mother sent a belt and instructions written to her son's host ?? Please feel free to use it. This straw belt in the field ?? Never use this brutal way. Mr. Tom provides a real home for William, the boy is happy with his new life, goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. Suddenly, William is summoned to his home in London with a letter indicating that it is not so good? And starts over again? Just this time it becomes much worse? There are so many feelings that you can feel in this film? Love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? And much more. Good luck Mr. Tom Another masterpiece of British cinema is comparable only to others such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? If one to compare. I really enjoyed watching it and highly recommended it. Before completing this review, I would also like to mention the wonderful performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac ?? Remind me of a friend since my childhood (:
