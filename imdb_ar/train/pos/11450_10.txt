This film is amazingly beautiful. Goldsworthy really benefits from the medium of the film because you can see art in its most beautiful form, moving, changing and thriving. I highly recommend this film to everyone. I can not think of anything else to say about it. It's just a kind of movie you should watch, because it's very convincing and left me very refreshed when I left the theater.
