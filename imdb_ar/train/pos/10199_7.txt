As a kid, I loved this game. I played this million times during the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Tops and Adam, no matter how many times we played, never seemed bored. Then the streets of anger went out 2. And soon we forgot that this person is still there. <br /> <br /> You play the role of former Exel Stone, Adam or Blaise Fielding, who have left the power to confront the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels of action through a corrupt rotten city led by Mr. X. The hitting of all the bad guys and the boss at the end of the level is very enjoyable. Level 4 (Bridge) was Favi because you could chuck the bad guys down the holes in the river. You even have the chance to become the right man for Mr. X at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad end" in which you become the union president. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery because you destroy the guild on your way to Mr. X, but do not mind. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has great music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro performed absolute miracles with limited technology of Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level 1, Level 4, and Final Boss are outstanding tunes. <br /> <br /> As the owner of the Wii, I am proud to have this forever on my console. But with the availability of Streets of Rage 2, too, it offers somewhat of a somewhat outdated type. <br /> <br /> Positives: <br /> <br /> The average graphics but beautiful backgrounds are represented in a comic book such as the progress of the board that fits the game tone. <br /> <br /> Great tunes. <br /> <br /> Easy to get into the game and difficult to put out. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> Minimal intensity of the most complex Rage streets without limit 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. The bad guys often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is particularly irritating with Level 5 head. <br /> <br /> No combo moves. <br /> <br /> There are no decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Examples of bad people are often repeated far away. <br /> <br /> Drawings B - Sound a - Play B - Permanent Appeal B -
