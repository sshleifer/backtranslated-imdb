Well, I'll admit it - I'm a comic strip and sometimes I love a really silly comedy. Although I have seen more films for Kurosawa, Bergman and Tropot than anyone else on the planet, I still get a soft spot for a dark comedy that does not try to be sophisticated but simply funny. Some of the films that come to mind immediately are MONTY PYTHON, THE GRAY GRAY, UHF, START OF THE REVOLUTION without me, BREW BREW, BREW TED and Bill and Ted movies. They all lack the challenge of the game but can not be hated by a coma or a professional film critic. <br /> <br /> Although BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY's journey is not as great as the original Bill and Ted, it's still very fun. Also, unlike the original, it seems to be actually improving with repeated viewing. I do not remember that I did not like the film the first time I saw it - perhaps because the other film set high standards of laughter. But every time I see her again, I am surprised at all the great moments - especially those involving Grim Reber. By the way, this harvest machine is different from the Bergman game in SEVENTH SEAL and you can get it !! In addition to a lot of laughter, this film presents some excellent music - a better way than the first film. The ultimate kissing song is great but the rest of the rocky rock tones - provided that you are not an old criminal like De Noumulus. Great view for children and adults alike.
