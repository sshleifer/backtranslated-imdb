This movie has a lot of strong points. She has one of the best horror actresses out of the circle of Lugosi-Karlov-Chani: Lionel Atwell, Faye and Ray, and Dwight Frey, as well as lead man Milvin Douglas. It contains all the right ingredients: the bat, a castle with lots of stone stairs, a crazy world, town people waving hairs and vampires, an Igor character, a pretty girl, and even a dark-haired Burgomister. The work of the camera with a soft focus is moody and creative. So there is some good comedic satisfaction spaced well throughout the script. <br /> <br /> But it is not a really brutal film because there is nothing supernatural happening in the "Kleinschloss" ("small castle"). The plot revolves around the insane criminal world (played well by Atwill), which can do more than human life. <br /> <br /> It's not a first class material, because of the modest accuracy of the scheme and some of the awkwardly embarrassing dialogue of Dwight Frey. But it's worth a look if you love early horror pictures.
