During Kurt Will's celebration in Brooklyn, where do we go from here? It was finally discovered for examination. It is amazing that the animation, of any era, in which weill-Gershwin collaboration may be missing from the screens. The long result, and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, only confirms their advantages, which is great. Yes, the film faces its problems, but the result is not one of them. Ratov is not in his element as an outlet for this musical imagination, and Fred McMurray can not absorb the material. Then, too, the "modern" part is poorly written. But the fictional elements carry the film to a high level, as does the work of two adorable ladies - Joan Leslie and John Havre. Both have the charm that this kind of work needs to work hard. As a tribute to the Second World War of our country's history - albeit in an "unprecedented" context, the film has its place in the history of Hollywood music and must be available to all to find and find great advantages.
