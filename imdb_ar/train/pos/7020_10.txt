* I mark where there are spoilers! Total comments: If you can shoot a serious movie, go to this. You have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave theater because you are confused about what is going on! The film fits everyone well in the second half. I will take my mom to see her again when the film is officially opened. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see that during his presentation two weeks ago, when Will was about promoting the film. It was fantastic - spent a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the picture will! About Will Performance: Often when you see a movie with a really famous actor in some other movies / shows, you always think of them in their current performance as you like in their previous performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this film. I did not imagine the new prince (lol) when I was watching this movie. He was quite convincing in this very dangerous role. He grew up as an actor. I think he will at least get Oscar approval for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very conflicted and tormented. He is sad ... guilty of guilt ... very determined, but very afraid. Very true to himself. His character is so deep ... and somehow he will succeed in reviving it. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a great job of portraying Emily, a woman far behind her. Taxes. Maybe she was not the bright star in this film, but she was very convincing. I think her character did not have much to deal with as Will did. <br /> <br /> About the scheme (no spoilers): I admit I did not like the movie until the second half of it. I did not know anything at all about the film he entered, and there was no meaning until the second part of it or so. But when things finally fit together, wow. Surprisingly written well and thoughtful. It's a very dense film that really sticks to you. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of you to watch. In the theater where I was, most people would cry at the end - even adult men. When you realize what Ben is doing and why, it is a very powerful moment ... Minor Spoilers ***** This is why it is difficult to talk about a plot without giving the main things away. I feel that knowing a lot about this movie really destroys it. There was a lot of symbolism in the film I enjoyed. I will mention some of it here (without trying to give too much). <br /> <br /> - Fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense at all. There was a lot of gabble in the movie theater when people realized the reality of fish. <br /> <br /> - Ben hated the beginning of the film. By the end, I loved him and hated him. This is how the will was compelling. I thought that Ben was a huge jerk for Azra, a blind man trying to make his way in the world. Why he was dealing with Ezra like this became clear later in the film. Wait for them though. Everything in this movie: Wait. <br /> <br /> - Ben was a good person who made a big mistake that he would not forgive him. It remains unclear to me whether he is doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his guilt, or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a little of both ... I think he wanted to help people, but he also saves himself from his past. I love his personality. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is not amazing. You hate him for what he does to himself (as a very good person), physically and emotionally. Nice post will.
