I do not think I will understand hate to Rene Harlin. "Die Hard 2" was great and gave the world "Cliffhanger", one of the most exciting movies of all time. That's right, you little bad guys, Cliffhanger's rules, and we all know that. <br /> <br /> Sly plays the role of Gabe Walker, the former rescue climber who "visits" his old city when asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rucker), helps save a mountain. Walker is clearly back in time, because the stranded people are in fact a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Koelin (John Lithgow). Koelin & Co. have lost a lot of money that they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really want to bring it back. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Cliffhanger" is another "Hard" clone. Just trade within Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, with scenes created to illustrate our hero's weaknesses and keep him deadly. Of course, this setup is completely shredded into small pieces soon enough, where Stallone's character avoids a large number of bullets easily, and criticizes face to face in several rocky faces without obvious side effects. After all, is not that what motion movies are about? <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one of the most exciting action films. View the fascinating and exciting scenes. One of the early thrills is one of the best stunts I've seen in a movie, and although the rest of the movie does not get better than it did at the beginning, it keeps its cool at work. John Lizardo Punk Lead is amusing, one bad dude. Very likely to be one of the coolest villains who ever died. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one of Stallone's best efforts, certainly the best effort of Renny Harlin, and a very exciting film - 9/10
