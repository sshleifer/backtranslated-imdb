Grand Canyon is in a very narrow category: it's a very smart movie, with very smart dialogues and food to think about everywhere from start to finish. I have the impression that he has not reached the level he deserves (and will never do) because of his simplicity. This type of flick needs sensitive monitors. It is unfortunate that IMDb makes me write ten lines, because this is not necessary in this particular case. In any case to meet this demand, I will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in acting: not that it is bad but it could have been done better. He gave an exception to Kevin Klein who was perfect. Go ahead and watch it.
