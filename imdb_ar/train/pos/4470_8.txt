Like "On the Town," this musical film about seafarers on a beach vacation does not live up to the classical level of subsequent speed and quality of songs, but it has its own charm. Kelly has three great dance dances: one with Jerry the cartoon mouse for "Tom and Jerry" fame, one with a little girl, and a fantastical sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his mistress on a high terrace. Sinatra, who plays the role of shy Kelly, inexperienced friends, and Grayson, the woman serving the love interest of both men, most of the singing. Iturbi provides some great piano playing. In nearly two and a half hours, it is a very long time for light music but it does not pull.
