It's a brightly colored movie. That's about it. <br /> <br /> It contains the mystery element that made SCREAM very common in vulgar movies, but I never care about such things. Finding out who is the bad person is not interesting given the clues, all misleading anyway. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death were innovative and attractive, bringing back memories of the 80 horror films such as Friday 13. <br /> <br /> Another beautiful thing about this film is that it is difficult to identify the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM And where IKWYDLS was clear. <br /> <br /> People who do not like vulgar movies will not like this movie. that simple. I really enjoyed it and I plan to see it again while waiting for more of the same thing. <br /> <br /> - MB
