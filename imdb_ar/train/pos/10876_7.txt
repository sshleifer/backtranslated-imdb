I was very excited to watch this movie. I finally thought that Australia made a good film .. But I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt in a hilarious movie ever. I feel sorry that Molly Ringwald had to come to Australia to produce a terrible film. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible (especially the Australian man who was trying to speak in an American accent), the plot was very bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about the appearance of this movie, I thought the title was pathetic (because it looks like a cheesy movie "stab" in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> Warning !!! The main spoilers !!! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about the film is the end. I was expecting a big surprise about who was the murderer. But the killer was not even human, which turned this realistic reality film into a horror film. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
