A team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary about 50,000 people from Bakhtiari and their animals on summer migration to winter grazing. The basic value of this film today is a time capsule for "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we have known in the West as "loud twenties". You can not imagine a sharper variation. River crossings and bare mountains are inspired by brutal realism and the death of animals disappearing under water. To ensure that the public at the time believes that the story has taken place, a certified certificate is signed in the end. The version I saw was a great Iranian music that could stand alone and appreciate it without the film. Having said all this, the film is likely to be more valuable to the anthropologist than the ordinary viewer in search of entertainment on good evening. The crew had only enough stock to capture the shots they had recorded, and there was no imaginative work on the camera resulting from multiple retransmissions. Western titles detract from experience, but are in fact part of the record because they illustrate how Hollywood tried to turn its life around indigenous peoples to be appreciated by today's audience. The out-of-service entertainment by the desert police becomes a "policeman's ball". Producers continued to produce documentary drama Zhang (1927) and Hong Kong fully commercial (1933). The migration issue is used again in People of the Wind (1976) and Himalaya (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they get - and then strongly recommend it.
