Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final flight of Jason Bourne, the spying spook, a man out to kill the people who made him a murderer. The Bourne series is one of the top three hits of the critics (Ultimatum has 85/100 on metacritic.com, which means it is a place of "global acclaim") and for good reason - the fighting is designed very well and the story can be very deep engrossing. < <br /> <br /> First, I strongly advise you to watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the imaginary volcano named "Ultimatum". There may be three different films, but they are actually a continuation of each other: the loss of one of them leaves you You are stranded and confused, just as you are, and you will still be ready to enjoy watching the Ultimatum events and fight them if you miss the first two <br /> <br /> If you're lucky enough to show Brix for this movie, you're likely to have the experience of watching Bourne let down his enemies and hunt down the man who sucked him out of excellence. Well Damon does not do anything to deserve the Oscar signal, his work here is good enough to hold it in. The adventures of Bourne take place in many different cities.All cities are diverse enough to prevent the film from becoming nice at times. The Bourne Tracking Agency takes advantage of every known technological tool for mankind to track. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the details of the characters because they represent an extension of the first two films. However, the film will not hurt to make things clear to the public - not all viewers are a hardcore movie watcher who can catch every little hint about story development. Ultimatum would not have been damaged at all if the story was in the foreground slightly. <br /> <br /> Most people seem to agree that Ultimatum was a successful film: opening the movie for $ 69 million and - the total box office now stands at $ 216 million - is still being done with great force for a film that was shown in Theaters since August 3. It's the best motion movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> <br /> Good (Damon solid but not amazing, very clever movie bad) The story is like a lot of others
