Featuring a small number of Hummer stars, this highly effective range of British horror revolves around the home and fate of former tenants, all of whose stories are listed to an informer in Scotland Square, in search of a missing representative. <br /> <br /> The first, the least impressive of the four, is about a writer and his wife who have just moved into the house and plan to stay for a short time so that he can write a horror novel. He creates a crazy character called Dominique, an eccentric man who seems to crawl, and soon finds himself in a state of madness when he begins to see this ugly man everywhere he goes. After his wife persuaded him to seek psychological help, a sub-plot was presented that was not a success for me frankly. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) stars Peter Cushing, who is as wonderful as Philip Grayson, a man who moved to the house for years to retire and is soon on his way to the nearby wax museum (which deals with the massacre) A waxy figure quite like a woman of his past. Shortly thereafter, an old friend (also with a history of this woman) is in town to work and set out to see him. The two men are waking up because they soon discover that this woman was more than the eye. <br /> <br /> The story of three stars is one of the favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving home with his jealous daughter Jane, her nanny becomes suspiciously apprehensive about the way his daughter Reed represses. Well, find out ... if she knew what he did to me, she would certainly understand. <br /> <br /> The latest story is a somewhat lukewarm vampire story, starring John Pertoy and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a mantle from a mysterious dealer, actor Paul Henderson finds himself turning into the same creature he portrayed several times in his career. <br /> <br /> In general, the speed of direction and direction was very good, as was often the case. There were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective degree to compliment the atmosphere. This is the goalkeeper, highly recommended.
