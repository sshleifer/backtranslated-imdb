This is one of the weirdest movies I have seen recently. That's because it looks like a movie like an experimental film. The experience of Curacao was to take a variety of individuals living in a landfill and coordinate their experiences in a fabric that presents profiles of their generally harsh existence. Not every episode is frustrating and harsh, but in general this is certainly the tone. Let's see, ... we have a case of incest / rape, attempted murder, wife swap, alcoholism, adultery, the death of a young boy after eating contaminated fish, a man suffering from severe depression (never speaks during the film and looks pretty scary ), A hopelessly hopeless dreamer with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who is thought to be a car driver in the street and spends all his vigilant moments driving his car down the street through paths among garbage piles, a man married to a full spell (I think I loved her even less Of incest!), Etc., etc. In fact, it is so frustrating that it looked like Ingmar Bergman in Japan, where Bergman made many films that tend to deal with mental illness and despair of life. Is it strange that after making this film, Kurosawa tried to kill himself? Did you like me? No. It was not an enjoyable experience. But, it was a very good film that definitely kept my attention and as a result I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was like watching a train wreck - you do not want to see the entire massacre but you can only watch! Of all the short essays, I think the older man, who tended to look for everyone and did not really look right to him (was well-meaning and wise to live in a landfill), was supposed to be Kurosawa himself. Can. I do not know that. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a variety of Curacao movies and are highly tolerant of exotic art films, give this one viewing. However, do not make this your first experience watching his movies - sure to scare a lot of viewers!
