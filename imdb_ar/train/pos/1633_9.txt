I loved this light when it came out in the 80's and I'm still doing it! I still quote classic lines such as "Say it again" and "I said you're ruining my balls from my master." Ron Leibman was very spicy and funny! Although it has been taken lightly and ignored by MAD, I must say that this little jewel will always be a treasure to me and take it with me if I send it to an abandoned island! I just wish someone would issue a DVD because my VHS video is dead! If you like jubilant comedy, this is certainly appropriate for you and must be considered classics of worship! It is military humor at its best and worst! Hire them if you can not own them!
