During this movie, you may think that this movie is for children only. Well, they are directed mainly at them, but they are also almost good enough with jokes also directed at adults in attendance. This time, the Muppet gang is trying to reach Broadway, where the terrible straits prevent them from producing, leading them to split. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination keeps things going even after getting the deal together, collides with a car and sends it to memory! <br /> <br /> It is a partial transmission of the 1940's old vehicles with a musical show in fact as a musical theme, here only there is a lot of greatness and the usual wonderful moments in the pot of hysterical funny moments (New Zealand's flourishing almonds; Gonzo's stunning, whisper campaign, among many other things), but also with a lot of heart also. Muppet's book is not afraid of conventions, but on the contrary, they embrace them to the extent that it is almost refreshing to see such a story "let's show on the show" where through the thickness and thinking that the characters will meet their dream. <br /> <br /> Although Muppet is not entirely original in its scope such as Muppet, it contains many of the most interesting and memorable songs and excellent locations throughout Manhattan, and even some of the Tajweed dating between species (and marriage )! Cameos includes Lisa Minelli ("The Frog?"), Elliot Gold (as cop), Brooke Shields (suggested by a mouse), and Edward I. Kosh, Gregory Haines and Joanne Rivers. So, get ready to sing, or get lots of laughs and romantic times (yes romantic) with one of the best Muppet movies.
