The film is directed by Bruce Willis, who plays James Cole, the man who was sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that arose in November 1996. Unfortunately, he is also being returned away from 1990, Where everyone thinks he is crazy. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting and has a great performance in acting from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve Monkeys is one of the greatest travel time films that I think anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam created a real masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
