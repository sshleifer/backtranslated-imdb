I missed this movie in a way when it came out and discovered it last weekend thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate drama film, which does a lot of things well. Writing crisp, realistic, accurate, and even self-control. Cinematography and editing are few but inspiring, allowing visual narration to control through great close-ups, framing images and capturing loneliness and isolation in the most memorable ways. The acting is also wonderful, as all the characters are real, painful and fragile in the most urgent ways the film can offer. They reveal deeper weaknesses with weak unprotected crude. A real victory for Roger Michel and Hanif Qureshi, and the rest of the team. Must see for serious movie lovers.
