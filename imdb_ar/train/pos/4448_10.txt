Watch this movie yesterday for the first time and enjoy it completely. I'm a screenwriter and loved the way small characters intervened only when something pivotal / climatic happened in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of the story is somewhat shocking - at one point Barbara Stanwyck was openly flirting with her daughter; and reviving some emotion in her husband whom she had not seen in a decade; "Two shots, then one" she was dealing with her old Dutch boyfriend (the reason she left the city in the first place!) All at the same time! The moral majority must be quite angry when they saw this blacksmith in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I love fashion, cinematography and straight from the hip dialogue - just to see Barbara Stanwyck and their partners are doing Bunny Hug 'is good enough to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of that period I have seen for a long time.
