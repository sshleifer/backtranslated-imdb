This is a story about Shin Any, who moves to Seoul from Melang with her little son John to start over again after her husband's death by mistake. Her husband was born here, opening a piano school, but also having ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she got from the death. If that's what the film is all about, it might have been like a Hollywood movie, a fall for a local person and a joy in her son's new home. But this is not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and killed, ostensibly because it is known that she got money from the settlement. The process of grief, attempts to move forward, attempts to free conscience from guilt, all admiration, leading actress wonderful. The only caveat to be mentioned is that this is a frustrating film. You have to know that, you want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find some happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, it's Korea and Korean cinema, especially drama, do not make fun of punches. Life is what happens to you. A wonderful representation, but sometimes a difficult film to watch, because of what is going on. If you stay, you will be rewarded. do it.
