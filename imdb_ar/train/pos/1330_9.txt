How delicious my little Frenchman tells a sad story alternately, frightening and confirming life. Ending with a savage end you know it should happen, although you hoped - maybe even incredible - would not happen. Your emotions and your expectations, then drop a bomb on you. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a semester of film theory at the University of Southern California in the mid-1990s. Not easy to find, but it is definitely worth looking for.
