This film has problems in its presentation, and may be offensive to people looking for temporal and cultural fidelity, but challenges the observer to think about a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and personality of the relationship between Jesus and Judah. Another is the historical nature of Scripture and faith. Third, Jesus' humanity. Tension was developed in the relationship between Christ and the film. Judah's passion is presented as a darker balance of the passion of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can be worried. Peter's denial and guilt, regardless of his movement, are not portrayed as strongly as the drama of Judas. Chris Sarandon presents a new and provocative church, whether it is a ratification or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, for use in study or discussion groups.
