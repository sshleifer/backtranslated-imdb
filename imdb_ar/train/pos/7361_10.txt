This film is usually rated as the worst production ever. Start. But in my opinion, this may be more entertaining. The terrifying trend and scenario makes this movie priceless. I bought the movie while I was browsing the DVD of the deal in my local shop in pounds. Then I and some friends saw it, while it was fairly drunk. It soon happened that this was not any ordinary movie. Instead the priceless residue is likely to be James Cahill's last film. At first we felt confused as we yelled until the DVD player was turned off, but fortunately in our abnormal situation, nobody could bother. Instead we watched the film through the right. In the end, we soon realized that we had found a wasted dream, something you could laugh at for hours, while laughing at all the wrong reasons. Soon we showed all our other friends and also agreed that this was not a terrible job. It was a movie that you can wet yourself really laughing. This movie could have been enjoyed by anyone. This was a genius.
