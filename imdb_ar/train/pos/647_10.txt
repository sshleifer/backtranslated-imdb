Well, of course not, the woman is very sensitive and in need of an average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to bitch, although she is not a fake or extravagant or scandalous artist. Unlike many of you, I have only seen Maman and not Putin twice. Since many of the movies were good, I noticed that my opinion had improved after the second viewing. All I know is what I've seen and I still have to go into more exploits so I gained myself a DVD. I still have to know exactly why I enjoy this movie so much, but really, what do I care about? Although I'm sure I can form some wonderful explanation. Well, so you may disagree, maybe it's boring sometimes, I'm not an expert. Reminds me of blonde from beautiful Grushenka.
