A good picture deserves all the words. This film contains the most poetic scene I have ever dreamed of in people with Down syndrome. I will not spoil this by telling you. You'll want to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is a great actor. I did not need to understand a word he said to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie has its own charm. After watching it I understood better that we attach great value to achievement and not to the people we love. Passion and simplicity is all we need.
