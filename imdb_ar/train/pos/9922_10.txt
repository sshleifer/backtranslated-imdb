This is the latest addition to a new wave of educational documentaries such as "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11". Its comment is clear and unmistakable, as is the cinematic style of this wonderful feature. The film can impose a strong sense of the instability of our world as we rush towards an ecologically unsustainable future at lightning speed - while the terrifying beauty of our quest for progress emerges. <br /> <br /> Truly a wonderful achievement to be seen by all who care about the world we leave for our children. Bravo! <br /> <br /> NB - This is the only 8 (in 8) Varsity (Toronto) theaters with a text stick touch ... "To arrange group shows, please call ...." ... The popularity and importance of these gems. <br /> <br /> I bet ... nomination for Academy Award for Best Documentary. <br /> <br /> OB101
