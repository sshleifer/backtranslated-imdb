This is especially true for lawyers and police officers. Puerto Rico, which boasts a small but powerful film production company, brings this multilayered story to corruption, because of the continuation of the drug cartel that begins in South America, a pit stop in the Commonwealth of the island, and then north to north America. Steven Bauer, the most famous face on the screen here, leads a group of first-rate actors in the story "Can you discover the only respectable face in the crowd?" Ricardo Mendez Mata is moving from the adventure fare to US television, in a script written by Mata, along with Polly Marishal. The remaining actors (Elpidia Carrillo, Magda Rivera, Jose Herredia, Luz Maria Randon, to name a few) are turning into wonderful roles, in a film that makes you wonder, "Are there any respectable figures here?" Speaks Spanish with English subtitles. The film was rated "R" by the MPAA, which contains bouts of vulgar language, short flashes of nudity, adult content and violence, some of which are very angry.
