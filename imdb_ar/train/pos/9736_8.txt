Pegg has received a few visits in the last few years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, "Hot Fuzz 2007" in early 2008, and has appeared with "Run Fat Boy Run" How to lose friends and a flurry of people "which is in many ways the favorite comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Sidney Yaund, a man who writes a failed magazine that mocks celebrities mostly because he is not one of them. However, one of the most successful magazine owners (Play By Jeff Bridges) invites him (out of nostalgia) to work in his magazine. Of course, Sydney is excited and moves to America, where he meets a girl who is currently writing a book, followed by joy. <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome and I hope that more will come out like it in the near future. Pegg again gave people everywhere a very good film and I can not wait until I see the third part of the blood trilogy and ice cream "Paul". I rated this movie 81%.
