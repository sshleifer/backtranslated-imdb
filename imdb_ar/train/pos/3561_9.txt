Something good came at least from Damon Rooney's misguided attempt to sympathize with the Mafia. The film "Guys and Dolls", the seemingly indestructible musical theater, was filmed in the 1955 film by Joseph L. ), Jean Simmons (whose character is oddly similar to Audrey Hepburn in "The Roman Holiday") and two prominent leading men, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both recently won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor ("From Here Forever") and Best Actor "On the waterfront") and were at the top of their game. One of them listens to Brando singing "Luck Be a Lady Tonight" talking about volumes about Dylan's early voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who descends the house with "Sit Down You Rocking The Boat". Sheldon Leonard everywhere adds another page to the Rogue Gallery of Gangsters on the screen. The film is bright and bright, and pop art is expected in the early 1960s. The characters in Batwa are embellished, apparently based on Yiddish expressions. Although the social attitudes of the film and gender roles are dated, it is very enjoyable, and even the gentle joke of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real hostility towards organized religion. Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is reason enough to watch this movie, but has a lot of other attractions to offer during 149 minutes.
