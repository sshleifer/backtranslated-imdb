Christina Raines plays a wonderful New York model looking for a new apartment and starts meeting strange neighbors, revealing a secret about the building and slowly rising to its climax at the end of the film. This film contains all kinds of elegant plot elements from the Roman Catholic Church versus Satan, to the Gate of Hell, to the alien rites, to a growing conspiracy, and finally to a group of talented actors and actresses who flooded the film. We get Ava Gardner, Borgas Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Auerbach, Deborah Ravin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slevia Miles, Beverly De Angelo, Eli and Brother, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Beringer and Jeff Goldblum. Forget John Cardin as an old priest. Many of these actors are concerned - especially Burgess Meredith, where he performs a humiliating / infected performance as one of the neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable as Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some artists do not have what they do like Jose Ferrer in the role of a thankless even if he is more than just a hero. Sentinel is a terrific horror movie that contains a lot of psychological elements and some really terrifying scenes. The end scene is disgusting, and so chilling. I find fault with some of the sex and violence unjustified in the film, especially this whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was that really necessary? I do not think so. Also, father / daughter things were a bit too, but overall the film works and quickly win. Michael Winner is a work-like actor who is effective in creating moments of stress and scary movies. The scenes with Karadin are particularly effective.
