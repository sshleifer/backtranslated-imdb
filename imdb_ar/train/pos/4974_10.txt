This was a delightful show. Hemo (blood) played a good Greek god through animation with vanity, arrogance, transcendence, and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) I vividly remember is when Hemo frames of "All this plumbing ... You never learned my secrets at all" and threatens to come out, the world answers with one word "Thalassa" salt water that terrifies the fictional writer but calm down Hemo and vibrate well In the chemical aspects of blood. <br /> <br /> This wonderful combination of entertainment and information makes it a classic, refreshing and appealing day like the day it was released. Stimulating attention and imagination is essential to teach children to love learning.
