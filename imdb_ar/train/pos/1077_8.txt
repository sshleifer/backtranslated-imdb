This comedy as before, compare this with re-making two, hole money and have we done yet? , Only more indicative of how filmmakers had a 40 mile mile of comedy that has since been lost. <br /> <br /> I was 15 years old when I first saw this, and even at that slave age, there was a lot of laughter. Now, of course, familiar with the frustrations of adults, I see a large group I missed a young man. <br /> <br /> The three main actors ... Carrie Grant, Mirna Loye, and Melvin Douglas ... reacted perfectly but the essence of the film lies in the frustration he faced in realizing the dream. It is not as easy and free of invisible complications as one might think. <br /> <br /> In general, this classic comedy still exists above attempts to remake it.
