If you like Deep Cover, you may also like this movie. Many of the highlights that Vishborn follows in Deep Cover are from the lyrical text of "Once in Life," adapted from a play by Fishburne. If you love Larry as much as I like, you'll love this movie which is all Larry, all hot, all full. Of course there is a gun game and illegal weapons, it's a movie gangs of some kind, after all, but the script is beautiful and the story touches, even a little on the side of the flick. <br /> <br /> A stunning film ... dark, scary, sexy and sexy. If you've sneaked out at night or gone out in a club, you'll get the right influence for the narrow groups (the metaphorical echo trapped in life). Is full of intelligent and complex relationships, this film is tight ... all the emotions are reflected in the clothing set and camera shots. good job!
