Robert Eurek was a great actor, and he makes this television movie reasonable. I remember watching this movie when I was 15 years old, and when I see it again my mind remains the same. People who were when they enter this exclusive club are lost in a computer-rich town in California. Orich tries to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I like the idea of ​​a wonderful Halloween suit. This film revolves around the battle of one's soul. TV quality, which exceeds the large budget, New York gangs. I wonder if Robert Euresh is the affectionate man he portrayed in many of his films? I hope so! 6 or 7 of 10.
