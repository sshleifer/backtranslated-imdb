As well documented by the previous posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INXS - but the sequel, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGurman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krytsov. I do not know who they are? It's the wonderful House House band, which made this program smarter than the sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Night of Strings? That was musical precision and perfect if I saw it. The show features Susie McNeill's epic of the queen's "rapoid" queen, Taylor's unforgettable cover for "You Can not Always Get ..." and JD Fortune sings "Suspicious Minds." The common denominator here is the wonderful House Band. <br /> <br /> Like the INXS, unfortunately they were a shadow to their former selves, although the direct JD performance has a fairly new spirit in their music. This show is about HB. <br /> <br /> Note to producers: The third season (if we bless enough to do so) should be Rockstar: House Band. These guys get good lead singer and they're going to places.
