There may be a particular reason why Fox and the child have made a special note in my heart. After having just reached my new fianc√© - from ... one day - for an unknown period of time, I was a bit overwhelmed in varying emotions and was suffering from the consequences of putting on the brave face she needed to see. <br /> <br /> I watched some movies and TV shows, but my interest disappeared from what I was behind from what was and what I did not see. For this, I have this film to thank him. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and hearing about the movie in advance, I was sure I would like it anyway. But I did not really love her, I loved her. <br /> <br /> Mastering technology is amazing. How did they do that? How do you catch animals the way they do? It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> The story of the story is good, and while the end is mysterious and mysterious, it is happy / sad. Again, I caught a bit. As a man who usually retains his feelings for himself, the end was difficult while on a plane full of people I watched for 15 hours or so! Maybe that's because the end made me think about what I left. <br /> <br /> But during those few hours on board, I was happy to see something new and innovative. This is life. Sure, there are those things that you love and feel comfortable around ... but the outdoors holds a lot of mystery. So next time I see something abnormal outside. I'm going to explore it, watch it and embrace it. This is exactly what happens in this movie and this is exactly what you should do with this wonderful movie / doc doc. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Two months after the flight. We still do not know when we will see each other again, but we will.
