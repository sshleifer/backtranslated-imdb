The high-level story of Colombo, which was actually the first episode filmed from a long-lived series but was originally moved in second place (after "Kill by the Book"). <br /> <br /> Robert Kolb makes the first of three appearances as a guest killer in the series and plays the role of the Special Investigation Agency, which extorts Patricia Crowley's wife from a very influential wealthy businessman (who played his part in sympathy with Ray Milland) Ziv reported in her favor after she discovered she was having an affair. The wife later rebelled against the scheme of blackmail but was killed in a fit of anger. <br /> <br /> A highly satisfying episode in many ways, especially since the plot was well prepared and later developed and also because of a rare Colombian element that the crime is manslaughter. The whole thing is reinforced when the killer widows are used to help Colombo in his investigations: a feature that facilitates many good-quality scenes, especially in the first sequence when the three main characters meet and Colombo's deceptive qualities in evidence are remarkable. <br /> <br /> Narrated by Bernard L. Kowalski went to a high standard appropriately, and this put a complete control of the entire chain (since "killing through the book" had created a bad end). The script for the authors of Colombo Richard Levinson and William Link are accurate, well-organized, well-rehearsed, sustained and fruitful, and meaningful sequences that truly show the unpredictability of the story. In the end, the appropriate conclusion sums up that Colombo has always been one step closer to the killer. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very remarkable work of detective work for Colombo, and strongly suggests that the production team has worked positively and constructively to deliver a polished Colombo story.
