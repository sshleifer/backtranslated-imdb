James Stewart plays the role of an FBI agent who began working with the agency before being called the FBI. The story includes dealing with Ku Klux Klan, banning gangs, German and Japanese World War II spies, etc. Years of history; much higher than any movies produced these days. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest to older viewers familiar with Washington DC. In a scene about 20 minutes from the movie --- where James Stewart discovered from Vera Miles that she was expecting her first child --- the scene was filmed at the Herzog seafood restaurant on the waterfront before Washington, the only film showing this historic history Site. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy decided that southwest Washington, a 99% black neighborhood, was eye-catching and must be demolished. By decree worthy of its position of uncontested kings, the entire area, including the famous dining area on the waterfront, but excluding 3 historic churches; was reduced to ruins. Black evacuees were relocated from their homes in the best possible way and without federal assistance; companies were simply put out of business, and a few relocated. Row was converted into a quay, and Washington had no sea front (restaurants, seafood stands, boats, etc.) for 10 years. As a lifetime resident, Herzog's restaurant scene was the first reason to watch this wonderful film again.
