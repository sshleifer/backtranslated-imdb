A powerful, honest, courageous and unforgettable horror film about the painful experiences of rape pain - "Descent" is a film that has been subjected to radar because of its lack of distribution because it is so brutally honest to portray it that, if staged, it may have encountered some strong biased hatred. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be discovered, not just its dark themes, not just for its stunning direction and original style - but most of all its performance. Chad Faust is absolutely amazing, bringing enough disease and enough weakness to cause this disease, not about him, but understanding this man who is broken by a twisted perspective about his sex life not only with the women who rape him, but also with the fragile insecurity deep inside him. It is a very complex, courageous and passionate supportive performance on Faust's part. It is hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, the lead is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is absolute revelation. A set of realistic tics, one of the most pleasant, yet loud, shows. Although Dawson has appeared in some good supporting performances in some great films, she shows here that she has to offer some physical and emotional performances, in a reasonable and objective way. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of her year (2007 was a strong film) - if this undisclosed movie was a great success, I would shout at him for praise, as did Dawson and Fawcett. It was so bad that he was very outspoken about a broad appeal. Movies like these deserve the best!
