CAT SOUP contains two small "Hello Kitty" cats embarking on a strange journey through the afterlife, where anything can happen and do it. This sensational Asian short film does not use any dialogue, and replaces balloons with words instead. There is no way to describe these stereotypes except to tell you to see them yourself. Make sure no one is less than 10 years in the room. Dehumanizing, cruelty, brutality, sudden death and harsh disregard for others are common themes. honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is the elephant's image, which consists of the water in which the bisexuals swim and dive. But like virtually anything else in this film, this mysterious and mysterious separation will soon arrive at an appalling end.
