I've seen almost all the Gundam / Mech anime that has shown in the United States, and this quite has the best story. The way in which the plot turns and turns. Gundam Wing is a series focused primarily on politics and war. This series is followed by a group of 15-year-old boys who have been trained to try the latest Gundams. Gundam pilots were trained to wage a strong rebellion known as Oz. As things start heating up between OZ and Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and the old groups will be lost. Old conflicts will end and new conflicts will ensue. For peace, pilots in Gundam must take control of the events taking place in their world and put an end to all fighting. But, to what extent are people willing to go to get their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a show that has a deep plot.
