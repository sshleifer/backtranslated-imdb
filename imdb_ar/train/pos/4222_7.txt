I love this episode to some extent, Ruth Gordon is good if not a little hammer as it always has been. As we mentioned, the music is very good and has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is a major hole plot, so you can command a fleet of trucks across it. The light is not working in a cellar. Do not you think that Colombo is very intelligent or the rest of the police was thinking about checking the success of the light bulb? You think in a very short time they may dismantle the lamp and so I found the note. Admittedly this is a television fantasy, and you will always find many holes, but this looks very bright. <br /> <br /> It really does not make Colombo a hidden genius when light does not work, but the "deathbed" testimony continues unfounded, apparently for several days.
