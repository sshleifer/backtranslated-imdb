I have been fascinated by hurricanes for more than 40 years. The fifth grade teacher, a Texan, told me stories about who he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I lived my entire life in the Central Atlantic States, where cyclones are rare and usually not as violent as those in the Midwest, but I have encountered two close meetings, one in the PA and the other in New Jersey, in the last decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the hurricane was near, Dan knew most of what he had to do, perhaps he learned at school, because I know that hurricane safety is an important issue in parts of the United States where these storms are repeated. However, the film characters did two things that some people believe are supposed to be done or are safe in hurricanes but in fact they are not supposed to or they are not safe. <br /> <br /> When the sirens were first launched, Dan and Arthur went to the house and opened the windows. This is what people have been asked to do for years, but Tornado's safety websites advise against doing so. Also, people were hiding in the highway. This method became common through a video in the early 1990s produced by T.V crew during a relatively weak hurricane in Kansas. However, in the most dangerous hurricanes, people can be absorbed from this tunnel. This occurred during the May 1999 outbreak in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> Hurricanes hit this movie in the fall, which is not a common time. (And then again, one of my document meetings took place in late September). They also traveled from the northwest to the south-east, while most of these storms in the northern hemisphere go from the southwest to the northeast. However, this is not all that unusual. The famous cyclone that hit Juliette, El, traveled in the early 1990s in that direction (as he did in my other near encounter). <br /> <br /> I think the movie should have been set in the spring. The film was based on a book based on a real event on June 3, 1980. But it was still a compelling story.
