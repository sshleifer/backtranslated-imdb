Dark Remains is a simple and simple home service. The film is full of horrifying images, and a scare that would make the most feared veteran jump jump straight from there. Scenery scenery in particular, these guys are good. Although they were not working on a huge budget, everything looked good, and the actors came. Dark Remains contains one of those explanatory ends that may be negative for some, but I think it makes you think. Cherie Christian and Greg Thompson point out that the sad couple are trying to rebuild life there, but some side-names such as Sherif did not convince me. They are not all that important anyway. I give Dark Remains an ideal rating of ten times as much more thrilling than any ghost story in a new studio / Japanese edition.
