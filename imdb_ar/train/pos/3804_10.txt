I love my 3 years old. I love it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 of our family. As for the level of violence? Not really violent, mostly from a variety of stick slap. No one really die, no gore, no blood, no torture, so it is certainly suitable for children, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where I should go. <br /> <br /> First of all, there are wonderful drawings that were made wonderfully, with real depth, and are not trying to be realistic, but rather to be entirely artistic. Moss on stones, rust on metals, engravings on wood and stone, everything adds to the whole. <br /> <br /> Modeling characters, unlike many contemporary CG movies, are strange, not attractive, again within their entire artistic. The faces may look less flexible than some other films, but the characters resemble a doll more than a human being. I think this is good, it gives honesty, and how strange it is, it is easier to suspend your disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothing, equally, at least with the likes of Pixar. Note only in the opening scenes when fighting Lian-Chu giant alloy; Gwizdo is located in front of some farmers, and they all have detailed clothes caused to pause the film just to admire it. <br /> <br /> Setup. Beyond the likes of cars, even the wall? e. Space has been worked out several times, but the fantasy suburbs of Dragon Hunters are compared only to some scenes in Never End Story Story and Lord of the Rings, but they are again a collection of art, with many good ideas being put forward easily. Scenes like the scenery in Monsters Inc. Where they install all the entrances through their own storage facility, or Wall ?? E where we see the enormous garbage towers he made, abound in this film, everything is wonderful, yet did not hide; it's just the background of the whole road! The separator where you walk in the area with wonderful falls. Chinese wall, floating islands in the sky. Cauliflower in the sky? This is really what I think a CG should do, make something take away your breath, and do it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is diverse and not just epic, and fortunately without it any vocals, purely original for the film. <br /> <br /> The animation is very good. Provide inspiration for cartoons, especially some good use of stretch and compression. Sometimes, do not be realistic, but 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> The description has also been made well. Lian Zhu gentle and uncertain giant gradually growing up with confidence in attracting the attention of small Zoe. <br /> <br /> Guizhou's gentle manager Lian Chu reshapes himself at the end, while Zoe has not really changed at all, but who wants to change this gentle child anyway? I liked Lian-Chu at least more than any other modern character since Solly at Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal conflict in the group is overcome by external pressures, just as it should in a fictitious story. <br /> <br /> The story often reminds us of a "never ending" story, especially how the world disintegrates. The standard fare monsters are beautiful, except for one flocking. She lacks the emotional influence of Wall ?? E, a really powerful point in this film, but a more enjoyable journey, lacking the disturbing musical scene that re-runs it in the previous scene, and has an impact from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch in order to have a fun time. <br /> <br /> The entire movie, as I mentioned in a complete view, seems to have been followed closely all the time. <br /> <br /> The setup seems ready for more adventures, and I personally hope so. <br /> <br /> One side note, the French actor who did the work of Lien Chu looked a bit like Jean Reno at first, but I'm glad he was not, although he's my favorite. It's good to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> Give it a maximum rating, and a little surprised by the average and low ratings by some; I've tried to address some of the concerns raised by two of the reviews with fewer votes. He approached this movie as an adventure, as a European film, not against Hollywood, but different.
