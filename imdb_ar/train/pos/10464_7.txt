For all of you who do not speak Swedish: the [original] Swedish title for this film; "Rånarna" translates to something in the "The Robbers" line. This fact is the main problem I face with the film, because it is not really a thief at all. She is a young woman working for the Swedish police who is investigating robberies. You might think of a regular office job, but this girl quickly gets out of the field and puts things in her hands, the story says, until she shoots one of the thieves ... exactly: we've seen this before. The fact that there is a fairly interesting twist halfway through does not really help because the end is just cliché like the first two thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> What keeps it from just another mainstream movie is the fact that it is performed brilliantly in all respects, that the actors are as big as they are and that the director is really capable of keeping him as exciting as most of the story. <br /> <br /> One of the things I really liked about this movie is the fact that it's the music that determines the right mood when you need it, but it's absent for the rest of the time, which gives a great sense of reality to the shooting range and car chases scattered throughout the movie. Nice touch! The fact that Michael Persperndt is one of the few few actors who often tend to get painful writing hurts the film sadly because you know he will not play the role of a heroine friend and be a supportive figure in the background, but that's something you should ignore. <br /> <br /> In general, it's an entertainment movie that steals more money into a conspiracy than you ever had. 10/07
