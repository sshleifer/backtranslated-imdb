Of course you can not go to the theater and watch the groups you get in this movie. From this point of view, it is an absolute fantasy. But who cares? Of course, you will not find this movie on the list with Citizen Kane, Battleship Potyomkin and all the other films that tell us the false that we should see. Movies like this deserve a hundred Citizen Kanes. It revolves around the best performance of the cinema: great work of the camera, wonderful settings and great shows. <br /> <br /> The three amazing scenes in the end are probably the best in the arrangement to be presented while keeping the best to the finish. <br /> <br /> I will gladly watch this movie again and again ...
