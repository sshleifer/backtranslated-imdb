High school friends Andre Krigman and Gal Gabriel announce war on their schoolmates and plan a terrifying attack on their high school. As the deadly countdown to the final act of revenge begins, the two begin a video memo to explain their feelings and date their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar movie, called the Elephant. Why bring this? To compare the two films, of course. I must say, although I loved the "elephant", this is a much better film. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, this is portrayed differently, like "Cloverfield," "Blair's Witch Project," and "Diary of the Dead." This makes the film better off because it is more painfully real. <br /> <br /> But what he won was how the film was ready to show "the other side of the story." Learn about these two shooters, unlike the "Elephant". I really cared about one of the shooters and was able to understand their actions and why they did what they did. In fact, this film makes you feel empathetic to these people, and that's a good thing because it is not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. Characters are real human beings with logic and the reasons for their actions. You get their understanding. It's not as if they want to kill people interesting. Overall, this film is emotionally dominated and very hilarious and much better than the "Elephant".
