This film was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained wonderful wallpapers and collections. 2) Show variation in a war-torn environment along with a technological environment. 3) John Cusack's acting was awesome. He depicts anxiety very well. 4) and showed the weaknesses of all in a war-torn state. 5) gave us a picture of what could happen in the future in many ways. I was also influenced by acting often. Hillary's representation was the most wonderful. The morals and values ​​of each person in a war-torn state are very important. The liberal journalist and the conservative businessman are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally predictable. Great things. PSP
