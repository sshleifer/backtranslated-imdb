This film, although it seems to be based on a film of the same title in 1951 by MGM production and Janet Lee's film, is still a wonderful film. Danny Glover in one of his best performances, revives the life of George Knox, a baseball manager with a short temperament, to life. For this film "The Stack", what about Christopher Lloyd (his acting experience and acting on screen, a great actor), Joseph Gordon Levitt (third rock from the sun), Brenda Fraker (a well-known Irish witch and actress), Tony Danza Yes, even good in this film), Matthew McConaughey (The show was stolen in Dazed and Confused, and may not be pivotal in this film, but Adrian Prodi (what I said about Matthew McConahee applies to Adrian, except for the angry part and confusion) Prominent figures such as Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Mismer), Jay O Sanders (Ranch W. Yilder), Neil McDonough (Wit Bass) and a seasoned expert in one of his final shows, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, the owner of the California Angels), and the rest of the actors do a wonderful job, plus a wonderful story that greatly elevates anyone much, The comfort of depression. I loved this film as a child, and it brings back memories when I see it today. I need this DVD. I recommend it to any parent looking for something their children, and anyone else, have not seen in this regard.
