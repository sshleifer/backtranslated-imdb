The barriers seem to be one of those series that have been lost in the clouds of time. After moving in the early 1980s and one recurrence, he sank without trace. This shame cry. <br /> <br /> I originally saw this when it was broadcast in the Southern Television area on Sunday afternoon and the show was a classic tea time. Although I do not remember much about the program, some things were stuck in my mind. The most memorable ones were the memorable ones. The sad flute music associated with the attempt to escape across the Eastern European borders and the subsequent car crash (this scene has left me a constant love for Mercedes models 'fintail' while using the Merc 200). Although it was not clear at first, the only solution to the mystery of the series was in these titles. <br /> <br /> A young music student plot was trying to uncover what actually happened when it was discovered that it had been adopted. A lot of twists and turns but barriers were the drama of "amazing" children. Benedict Taylor was as excellent as Billy and it was a shame he did not do much. <br /> <br /> This was a good drama, very late for a DVD version and I hope I get a chance to re-read it in the future. <br /> <br /> A wonderful memory of my childhood
