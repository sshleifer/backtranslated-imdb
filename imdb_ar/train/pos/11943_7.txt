I am a big fan of Woody Allen, and when I saw that this was playing in the cinema, I could not help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would continue to watch his hit film "Match Point," another of his films filmed in GB (which is unique among Allen's work), along with what appears to be the new singer Scarlett Johansson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and humor is the most fun aspect to Scoop. The plot revolves around Johansson's character (a journalist) who gets information about a hot story from behind the grave. She falls in love with Jackman and has to decide whether the truth is worth searching. All this was done with the help of the disgruntled magician who turned into an investigator played by Alan. <br /> <br /> I must say I totally enjoyed Johansson's performance but I am a bit biased, I can watch the three-hour movie with Johansson under the ever-enchanted stay. She plays a glamorous, worn-out love, and this is a kind of variation in the stereotyped sense of Allen's character. Add the appropriate body language to the comic effect. Needless to say, anyone who sees this will find Johansson's personality morally attractive and this is an added advantage. <br /> <br /> Allen Allen ... He still plays the same character as Chaplin and his little character in the Trump. Something that happens in this film makes me wonder if I will see the small nervous cartilage again. He is not in his next photo collection and spends more time behind the camera exclusively recently ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also fun as a millionaire murder suspect. I can not say that Jackman does anything in particular to make his role, but he does not fit his character. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, I can not help but feel that this new ... actually stinks from the scorpion jade curse. Johansson and Allen are more like looking for anything else. However, I must salute Allen for his end because he is smarter than the extraordinary Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white, the objects are painted in gray. Being totally innocent has nothing to do with it and no obvious guilt. Although the plot seemed old, Woody still has a talent for one of the lines. I found that his hints of his latest film are interesting ... Come to humor, laugh and be fun. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you enjoy watching Allen, see him. If not watch something else ...
