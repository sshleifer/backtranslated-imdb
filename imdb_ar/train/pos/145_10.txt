The sequel to "Kingdom" is more bloody and more twisted. I only saw half (I was tired and could not sit for 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, kill, poison, mutant children, voodoo ... This has it all! If you have a strong stomach and like exotic films, this is good for you. <br /> <br /> Also, you will not have to see Part 1 to understand this ... you'll discover it! > <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in the theater is cumbersome. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there may not be "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after filming. But you never knew!
