In this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot. It's really good to see them because Singleton does a great job of providing inner conflicts and personal relationships. This makes the viewer forget the non-existent realism that this film is supposed to be for. In fact what we have here is all the cliches and possible stereotypes on celluloid at a rate higher than the soap rate. Definitely not a deep film (even if he wants to be), but it's better than an average college film.
