This movie is very cool !! If you watch it with your friends, it can be a very nice day ... Obviously you have to know that the movie is stupid and very bad and exists and behaves (Tomba / Unziker what a couple) and maybe this is the worst movie in the world, but you can enjoy it a lot. We saw it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first, when the criminals kill Alex's friend, trying to act as desperate, the result is a comical scene of the first category ... Then when he appears to Liva (Antevleva, what is the name) "Palassio di giusstissia", then the incident of Leva, She drives her car off the road, and after a second, the car is completely empty! What a charm!
