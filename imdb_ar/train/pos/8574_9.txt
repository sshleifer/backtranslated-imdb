Great fun for both adults and children, this film works on several levels: everything from car accidents and cakes to some good (but accurate) jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> Glen Claus is in her best evil case like Cruella (Call Me Ella) De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years at Dr. Pavlov's behavior modification clinic, she was treated for her fur? Even fur puppy skin had a strong desire. They even put all their fur coats in the special castle dungeon they inhabit. <br /> <br /> But it will not be a film for Dalmatia without the trick and intrigue of the Croila and you know that something will change its behavior. She now needs an additional puppy (hence the 102 Dalmatians) to complete her outrageous scheme this time. <br /> <br /> On the spot, Iwan Grover, the hero of the movie that runs the dog shelter, is "second chance." Although he was in Titanic and last year's TV series Like Pip, I did not know him; well, he was the fifth officer Louis in Titanic and I did not see "great expectations" so I I'm not terribly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerrard Depardieu turns a turn, as do pawns. From Cruela. Is he acting in the most unusual and absurd positions of fur clothes I have ever seen? And he does it well. His tribute to "Wicked West Witch" is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInerney is a wonderful follower of the evil Cruela? Has it been too? Alonso, "the 101-year-old chauffeur in Croila, can also be identified by all Comer Brett and Comer Black, who plays his usual modest, well-intentioned character, somewhat of a somewhat dim character. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Oscar for fashion is generally awarded to all the costumes in a film, which is unfortunate because the clothes worn by Glenn Close are incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when released from the Behavioral Modification Clinic) and deserve such a distinctive character. Her clothes alone deserve at least Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation occupies a special place in my heart? It is enough to say that "102 Marks" is better than the 101 Markch film version of 1996. There is much to admire here: from visual gags, dialogue and fashion to the cast - It's a good movie for the entire family.
