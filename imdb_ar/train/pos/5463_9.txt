The spot is very, very pre-Hayes code, and still very rude. I highly recommend watching this movie, even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck. It's funny and exciting and she works hard - she likes that you get! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stenwick is a wonderful spiral-like circle that floats on the surface of the world and is perfectly photographed by a bank building. John Wayne (in the suit!) Plays one of the first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a disappointment, but the groups, lines and clothes all add to a single vertical elevation film in horizontal mode.
