Perhaps as one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing a movie without knowing the story in advance does not in any way detract from the film. Characters have a lot of complexities, which anyone can contact in their own way. The brilliance of adaptation is that it allows everyone to view their own perceptions on the lives of characters, rather than feeding them with a view. You can love them or not, and you still feel the emotional impact of the film. The great performances of Ellen Burstein and Christine Horn give character to life. I highly recommend it.
