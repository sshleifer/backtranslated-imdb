I was in France, around 5 March, and I love to go to these film festivals. I knew about this Latin cinema, but I never went to it. I decided to go and then caught Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The film is stunning. This did not affect me as it did with Mexican users, because he was a French interpreter but still appalling. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire about violence in urban areas, kidnapping and crime in the streets. In Mexico. It is a raw image of the city. Of Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with its stunning Mia Maestro, which was also satire to hijack, almost, but in a more serious tone, I think, has a kinda relationship with Cero y van 4. A, somewhat, the story of how much recovery is too much? A man on fire, which was staggeringly strong, too, was not a satire, but a raw image in the streets of Mexico. Or it's like a brave one. Film hits and hits you in the guts hard. Like the usual suspects, he has some twists and turns, but that makes it even more believable. Sentence: A film that shocks you and makes you think there is no longer any security in the streets. Awesome dialogue, impressive trend and impressive performance. Cero y van 4 will never forget it. Let you vibrate and be amazed.
