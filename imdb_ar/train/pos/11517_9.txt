If you enjoy Cleese and all the British humor "Pythonisque" at the time, this little gem is very fun. <br /> <br /> Arthur Loy is a real treat! <br /> <br /> I saw this with friends on TV when it first appeared, and its classic quotations formed part of our jokes for 30 years and will remain so forever! I have a bar on the tape and is constantly appreciated. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers may take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that it is now only available in the United States (NTSC of course), not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of British humor history !!
