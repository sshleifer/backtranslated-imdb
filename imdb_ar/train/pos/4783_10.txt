"Straight Story" is a really beautiful film about an old man named Alvin Street, riding a lawn mower all over the country to visit his afflicted brother. But this is just a basic summary ... This film is much more. This was Richard Farnworth's last role before his death, which is certainly a role he will remember. He is a stubborn old man, no different from many older men whom you and I may know. <br /> <br /> The Straight Story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. You will reach down and touch a part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will be.
