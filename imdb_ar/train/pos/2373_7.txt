Pendragon Pictures The new "H G Wells' War of the Worlds", the first faithful revision of the original novel, has been under development for about 5 years. The release was released earlier this year (March 2005) but it never happened. The DVD has been accelerated to coincide with the release of the Spielberg version, which reaches the theaters on June 29. <br /> <br /> Like this movie, with some reservations. <br /> <br /> How satisfied is adaptation? He is not 100% believer in the book of Wales, but 90-95% of believers are good enough for me. There were at least several completely new scenes, such as Ogilvy's astronomical face with a farmer, and the unnamed narrator / narrator taking tea with his cousin. But on the whole, this film follows the book closely - certainly much more than the 1953 classic version by George Pal. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that it is clearly made with a very cheap budget. Most of them appear to have been blue and have been fitted with digital backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the indoor scenes and scenes of busy city streets. The public views of 1898 in London look like something from a video game. Many of the scenes in horse carts were fake - I think they can not afford to hire a horse. It seems that the only scenes that were filmed for "real" are those in open fields or woods. <br /> <br /> But within these budget constraints, you've done a lot. Technically, the film looks true. Mars and its trigonometric functions have been well done, and very true to describe Wales. I was particularly impressed by the heat radiation. Although the sequence of Thunder Shield, which should have been one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It is a great shame that they could not afford more actual groups, or better quality animations. <br /> <br /> Acting and directing will not win any Oscar awards. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is also very good, although it does not equal any of the two major Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy because this did not get a theatrical version, because the budget constraints would have made it look much worse on the big screen. In its current form, I would like to make this similar to adapting classical literature to BBC television. <br /> <br /> Some points: Most scenes are presented with different color filters (mostly red). This may have been a technical choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a dirty job in mastering a DVD. Sharp writer / narrator obviously turns from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - is it worth watching? If you can see the technical and budgetary limitations and access to the story, I think you'll enjoy it, especially if you've already read the original H G Wells. However, if it is easy for you to postpone cheap production values, it is best to do so (unless you are a fan of MST3K). But be warned that the film runs for 3 full hours, so I would not recommend seeing it all in one session. <br /> <br /> Btw: A completely different version of World War II (also known as "INVASION") was released on DVD the same month Spielberg hit the theaters: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/ . This was also made with a limited budget, but it is updated to this day like Spielberg - but it is much better! At the highest level, Jeff Wayne is making an animated film for his best-selling album since 1978, but it will not be released until 2007.
