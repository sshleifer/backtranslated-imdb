The Western is well filmed in Arizona rocky prairies. Lots of hard guys around. It seems that Cobran's character is swinging back and forth between myself and a restless type. Many holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to make up for it is exciting and worth watching. One of the really stupid scenes shows Hyston, who empties 45 cases of powder and collects them in a bag for the purpose of shooting. A. To collect this gunpowder a lot was needed to mule pack to carry ammunition. B. The grass was clearly dry: why not just give it up and let it fall?
