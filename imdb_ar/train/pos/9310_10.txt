Wow, how can I even discuss this movie without tears crying on my eyes? It has certainly been the most important thing in my life - all my life. As if raptor graphics were not spectacular enough, award-winning editors continued to use the same shot throughout the entire film, even when the background did not match the scene setting. Wow, what a genius. While the movie is full of holes in the plot (for example, a few clips of animal type t-rex where Raptor must be and for a moment the main one where he finds my door torture room, screaming "Colin Girl!" I'll never forget Raptor Planet shine. The scientific of another classic.
