When I was a little girl (and my father owned a video store), this was my favorite film. I have not heard much about her since then, and I did not remember anything about it. He was forgotten in the wake of the other Don Blaot films, and probably the best. I managed to trace it a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised again. Located in New Orleans in 1930, the animation is exhilarating and the songs memorable. There are some idiots in continuity if you look hard enough, but they generally do not detract from the story story, which makes you smile (and maybe even misty, if you love animals). The characters are believable (perhaps a bit older for young observers), too. Two paws, and for those of you who have not seen it for some time, definitely worth re-viewing.
