After my experience in Finland for more than a week, I say that this film portrays the very nature of Finnish society. Especially that the phenomenon of serious issues between spouses and newborns is familiar to me, as I saw the same thing personally when I was in Finland. People's relationships and problems, the fragility of the institution of marriage, the culture of drinking, unemployment, and the problem of rising money, are all in very good shape, without any self-exaggeration. <br /> <br /> A film that is not easy to understand and connect to each other, but the big picture shared with it is rewarding. Not all of the short stories are exciting or profound, but as mentioned above, the big picture does not fail to offer a sense of "real life" and capture scenes. I think of a quiet moment: What happens in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, that's what happens. Movies like this are good for nurturing your creative power. It would be safe to assume that this film could apply to life in many countries, but it particularly reflects Finland as it is, and damn well. <br /> <br /> One comment about acting: As a fan of Finnish cinema I have never seen any of these actors in any other film, but I found that acting in this feature next to the camera is perfectly perfect. Probably not a masterpiece, but very good attempt by the entire crew. I will closely monitor the future releases of the director and actors. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
