The director, LAURA (1944), was redirected to this powerful policeman: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a policeman to sever all ties to the past, but can not observe his violent methods inherited during questioning of suspects. His victim, a decorated war hero became involved with the leading pilot in the town and the enemies of Andrews No. 1, Gary Merrill (who was himself the protector of Andrews Snar)! As usual with Preminger, this is a well-formed film with a remarkable credit line, activated by a wonderful team that also includes Karl Malden (as current Andrews leader), Tom Tollie (as my taxi driver from Terni) Neville Brand (as head of Merrill thugs) With notable support from Craig Stevens (as instinct victim, wife beat), Bert Fareed (as a sympathetic partner with Andrews) and Robert F. Nolan (as former Andrews captain). After the latter had already warned him to fix his ways or otherwise, Andrews panicked and impersonated Stevens figure for a few hours after his assassination to put the police on (in this case) the erroneous paths of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the prime suspect (while Andrews gets involved) And Tierney in a relationship), the cop goes alone in the Merrill hideout, which he intends to get hit and "shot" to kill him. It is clear that the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews moves to the challenge with a first-class characterization usually complemented by the internal Fox Noir style.
