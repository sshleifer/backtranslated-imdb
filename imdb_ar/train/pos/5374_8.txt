William (Nicholas Paul) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davis) are buying an old house that was brutally murdered years ago in a very poor condition for restoration. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley), and become friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Bryan Kracher). However, strange events occur at home, including the death of Sophie Cat. At Sophie's birthday party, the pipes leak blood and leave the place, revealing the secret later. <br /> <br /> "The House That Bled to Death" is scary and one of the best episodes of "Hammer House of Horror" series. Wonderful development, revealing the secret, the tragic result is really excellent. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Address: "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The House That Bled to Death")
