I admit that I am somewhat tired about the type of film for a small child that eases the heart of his guardian. Have I seen enough of them? Baby Boom, Colia, about a boy, mostly Martha, and to some extent, the Rider Whale? Expect to be bored of the formula. What caught my attention in The King of Masks is the gloom of the place: a small town in China in the thirties. Extreme poverty was the norm, and the girl was considered worthless for poor parents until they killed them at birth or gave them all to take them on the black market. When Wang discovers his granddaughter, who is called "Doggie", is his granddaughter, he was expelled at first, although she has made a great promise in the street. Even after reluctantly returning it, he does not feel very upset when she is kidnapped. The film is then angry, showing the lengths that a young intelligent girl has forced on the streets to survive in this society. <br /> <br /> The two leading shows are trustworthy and deceptive in their social context. In Western society, one expects at least a hint of Wang's dissatisfaction with not achieving more material success. Wang accepts his station entirely as a famous artist with low social status, even though I have done so too. While Doggie shows a degree of precision and crying that will be suspicious of a suburban toddler, it is quite believable in the context of having a child perpetually in a survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like trash. Having learned that her seven former owners had abused her physically and mentally, her strong association with Wang makes him ideal. <br /> <br /> A peek into the life of small towns in a foreign country, the natural lead shooters, sudden plot transitions, and of course, intimate decision all contribute to a very cool film.
