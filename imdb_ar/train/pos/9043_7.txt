I accidentally stumbled upon this movie on TV one day. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel not quite famous for broadcasting good movies. However, this was not good after that. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by Sputnik's launch to become a missile scientist. He and his friends start building rockets. His father is not happy with his sons who have been found on a new hobby and prefer to become a coal mine himself or go to college in a football scholarship like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is written. It may be fairly predictable, but it is fine because it does not focus too much on those parts of the story. It is an important part, but when it is clear to the inner work, the action among the characters focuses on it. The good story has some cliches, but that's good. It depends on a real event, so you can not leave these cliches. The characters are really good. When the story is on a slope, characters are displayed and managed to maintain motion and high movie quality. You recognize and sympathize with these characters. They are written and well documented. <br /> <br /> This is a good-looking movie. The collections and style of the fifties are comprehensive and the pictures are well composed and well lit. All this sets the film's mood very well. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Jake Gyllenhaal performs brilliantly because Homer Hickham and Chris Cooper are as good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are very good. Together, this creates a very strong team. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm glad I caught this movie. The first one after seeing it was learned that it was based on real events. If you know that when you see it, it may be more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting film. It's a film I think everyone can enjoy. It is a kind of good film. Not bad at all!
