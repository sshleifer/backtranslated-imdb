Jack Frost revolves around a serial killer sentenced to death. On his way to the death penalty, his prison truck collides with a chemical car filled with a chemical whose particles turn snow on the ground and turn into a snowman. Being a murderer himself would turn him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on Sharif who was arrested. Jack is now starting to re-launch and kill some people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has a chance to become a classic horror film, but he flicked it off. Keep your mind on hold and enjoy it, but do not take it seriously.
