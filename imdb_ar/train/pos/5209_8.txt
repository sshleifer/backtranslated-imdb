I saw this important film intensive tonight. The most important works of Richard Gere and Claire Dane. Gere deserves the Oscar for his meticulous portrayal of a man who was forced to retire early as a sex offenders. Claire Dunes wanders around when Ms. Geira chooses to replace him - a woman trying to teach her everything he can while investigating a recent case in which Geir's conviction that one of the people she is accused of watching might hold a girl hostage. The subject is shocking, sex offenders and those who watch them, but this film will not be forgotten soon. I know I will be haunted by shooting a gear for too long. Not since Anthony Hopkins filmed a serial killer with a horrified image and felt it. The movie starts with a horrifying statistic, so do not miss an account opening. Intense and memorable. Richard Gere's best role proves that man can act. The Danes can do well and both well in this often challenging film. <br /> <br /> This is a brave film that offers deep multilayered performance. Just give it to Oscar now ... it's worth it!
