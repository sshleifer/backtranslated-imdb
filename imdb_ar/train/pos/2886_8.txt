Cinderella is a beautiful movie, with beautiful songs of course. In fact, it is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters were amazingly photographed. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's sisters and her father's wife, the sweetness of Cinderella. Mice are very funny and sweet. <br /> <br /> I think it changed the story a bit, but I think it's the best. It's a wonderful movie, and I do not think anyone can resist it in the depths. <br /> <br /> Give it 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it is definitely a real classic.
