I really enjoyed this movie. I am one father with his 17-year-old daughter, smart, smart and talented. I hope that my daughter will apply herself well to solve the crimes and help others! For me, maybe this is the Fantasyland PG level. I have read many Nancy Drew books in my teens, a long time ago. Of course, Emma Roberts played this character ably but did not look like Nancy Drew I remember from books. This is due to the script, not representation. <br /> <br /> Emma is a wonderful teenager, playing a self-confident, diligent, proud, well-behaved character with a good taste. Not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around them. There are some weaknesses in the plot, apart from Nancy Drew of the Books, and trying to figure out what contract we are in (like, what car, anyway?) <br /> <br /> Read an overview On IMDb before watching the movie, while I was looking for Rachel Lee Cook from other movies. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to search for more of her films. Rachel was too big to be able to play this lead, but he does a good job as an emerging orphan at the Mystery Center. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the other reviews written here. Some expect an ideal connection to books, and some expect more credible attitudes or action films for adults. I got what I expected! Good entertainment is well targeted for teenage girls, and their parents who want good children with a high level of behavior and achievement. This is Teen PG movie, not James Bond! Want to get a model for your teenage daughter?
