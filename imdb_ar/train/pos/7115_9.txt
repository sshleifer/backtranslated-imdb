A wonderful and courageous war film focusing on the inner torment of the blind sea shark. Although difficult and unpleasant, they are ultimately heroic - the triumph of Schmid on disability and depression. The scene was a wonderful battle. But one bone to choose. Regardless of the number of shots fired by .50 bullets, I have never seen any water or dirt being kicked because of the effects! It has damaged realism, but I can live with it. Good performance by Eleanor Parker, again, as his girlfriend the girl.
