Shakespeare's film was behind the most surprising and delightful bars I have seen throughout the year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where prisoners have been practicing and performing a different play for Shakespeare every year for the last 14 years. The film follows the production of "The Tempest" through performance, and in this process we learn some amazing things about these men, who are involved in committing the most serious crimes. The truth is really strange - if anyone tries to adapt this story in a fictional film, the audience will never buy it, but knowing it is real makes it spectacular - literally; I got louder when I learned of a criminal crime in the face of a talented person. It's like some loopy episodes from Oz, and the most fun because the characters and their weird stories are real.
