I even say some shades of Hitchcock ... this is better than MMM, which is considered guilty fun by some Woody lovers if not most of them. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as a murder mystery? In any case, Woody recovers some importance in the comedy film with this film. The plot turns nice and narrow. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some representatives are very rushing to present their lines, but they are turning around. Scarlett Johansson has proved to be a wonderful role in the role of Diane Keaton, and there are never any uncomfortable moments between her and my older Woody. No one can imagine a more perfect representative of the role of Peter Lehmann of Jackman.
