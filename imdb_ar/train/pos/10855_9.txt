Looking back over the past 28 years (since my first appearance), all I can say is: once you get it, it will stay with you forever. I remember that my initial reaction was: 1) overstatement, 2) under production 3) unwanted characters <br /> <br /> Well, two years later I saw some episodes again and found them almost annoying. A year later I was able to capture the entire series from the beginning and soon engaged in a bitterness story about human error and views on happiness. Yes, the display is not all-good, and I'm sure the dated production value will be difficult to deal with right now. But, I still think of the show at least once a month with a vague longing of the eyes for what seemed to be the simplest of times ... <br /> <br /> Btw I am a married man ... (for anyone who thinks this is a female show)
