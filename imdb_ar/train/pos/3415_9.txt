This film was amazing. It's an inspirational piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed through the fact that Lucy Walker brings the film. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for this special film that shows humanity in the human condition. Lucy Walker presents the beauty of the landscape. This film is a real example of man versus nature and sometimes man vs. man. Internal unrest and victory are enormous in its subject. The theme of how Tiebtans look at blindness as a sign of devils. This film highlights a culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker gave a voice to Erik Weihenmayer when he was not usually heard. Thank you Lucy for your honesty in your film as a director.
