This movie was shown 12 years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in New York. Textbooks on drag performance say nothing about these vogue homes. Anthony Slade does not tell "great greats" anything. Julian Fleischer's "The Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide" ignores the flowing oil scheme of Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol queen, club club 90s and postdates the film. Even Lawrence Sinelic "The Changing Room" - our closest to a final book on the performance of clouds, rushing through the film does not provide basic information was expected from them. <br /> <br /> I understand from the film itself, and various articles found on the internet that the home system goes back decades. It appears that the main feature of the film by a member of the house before 1990 is Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the biggest missing part of "Paris is Burning". <br /> <br /> The movie is valuable because it focuses on a scene or is ignored. It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact of the killing of Venus Xtravaganza during filming offers a very exciting end, but this is not the only film about transgenders that includes real murder. As we know now, Dorian Corrie had a stuffed body in her closet, but that was only three years later. <br /> <br /> It is of historical importance, but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary that provides more context.
