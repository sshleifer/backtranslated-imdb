A good film with - in his time - an intense, sprawling, somewhat dark story reminds us of the "researchers" of John Ford though not brutal. The story begins quickly and does not falter, with many scenes of good dialogue between Jeff Webster (Stuart) and the castle of Ronda and Sheriff Gannon. This film reminds us in some respects of the "Bend of the River" (1952), which is also the work of Mann-Stewart, but I found it less emotional and more interesting. Corinne Calvert, 24, is not very convincing in the naive French teen, and of course the film is screened in the area of ​​Western mythology, a land of superstition where the laws of nations and physics are not applied The real. But these are trivial concerns. James Stuart is surprisingly good as a dark and separate man who thinks he cares only for one, and the mountain scenery can not be overcome. Great Western Drama.
