Until the sixth and last episode of Star Wars Epic, which finally ended in 2005, I've always looked at the 1983 film "My Favorite Movie" from the long series. The various motion scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry forest creatures, etc.) made a particularly attractive film. <br /> <br /> A very long activity has not focused in one place either. The last half hour is more than anything else, as the scene every few minutes of the forest turns into a battle between the spacecraft and the individual laser fencing between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> There is another nice feature to this film if the ex was not the absence of fighting between two stars. John went on the ongoing bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was good to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was just a fantastic adventure story, more than anything else.
