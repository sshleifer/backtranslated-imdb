Kenny Doughty, as Jed Willis, is more attractive in this role than any male porn star, although he keeps his pants. <br /> <br /> The film tore my heart to remind us of the intensity of the great love that blew my life. I do not think I can think of another film, with the exception of Romeo and Juliet for the leader of Zeverelli, who captures that delightful delight. <br /> <br /> The other drag from the film is an eccentric English character who enjoys the scandal. In this sense, it is very similar to the attraction of Midsomer Murder or Miss Marble's puzzle, without chaos. <br /> <br /> This is the great antidote to the imaginary horror currently known in the United States of America and any relationships between people of different ages.
