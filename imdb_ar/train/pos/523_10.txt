Why this movie is not in the best 250? This film still looks amazingly new after 56 years of production, but it could only be produced after World War II because of the near-death awareness. People were more aware that life could stop at one unexpected moment. And beyond life? I finally liked the scene and gathered all people from all nations. (Jeffrey Neffen), as well as June (Kim Hunter) against the US Attorney General Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I) is the reason why he is an American). It's all fantastical! Michael Powell composed, directed and produced this stunning film, a real "cancellation trip". The message of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important, but nothing on earth transcends love between humans. The way this beautiful story is listed is more interesting than any Hollywood movie.
