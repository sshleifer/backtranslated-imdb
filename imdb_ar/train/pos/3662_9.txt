It's a really weird film - and that's not bad. It is a mix of a new realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale. I'm sure some might find this movie very strange, but I loved it. Again, this director brings together a remarkable group of ordinary people (not actors) and gets a great performance from a band. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point - this film does it in a very absurd way. Ignoring the special effects of cheese - after all, were manufactured in the early fifties of the last century, and special effects are not very important anyway (or at least should not be in the movies). Instead, just sit back and enjoy the ridiculous alien trip. Unless you are fully booked, you will have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since I first reviewed this film, I saw another film directed by DeSica that is absolute and must be seen as children watching the United States. Although it is not imagination or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, it is a wonderful film.
