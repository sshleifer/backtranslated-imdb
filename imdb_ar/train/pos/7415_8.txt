How powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be. This story tells the story of daily scenes that reveal the hidden emotions inside. It's true, as others have said, how this film really illustrates Hollywood's clarity of how Hollywood lost its own special, emotional, and climactic endings and forgot the essence of a meaningful story with its simple realism. Much of what these characters go through is covered by the scene rather than being explained in a written dialogue. One of the aspects I really enjoyed in the film was the contradiction between the two brothers, one of which was very expressive in its childlike way and the other perfectly portentous but capable of stirring up deep emotions. The older brother had to say little, as he usually did, everything was there in that impasse of his face! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful representation, wonderful direction! Not to be missed!
