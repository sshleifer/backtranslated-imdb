Ten or more items were produced in two weeks on a volatile budget by Brad Selberling, just a short film filmed in Carson, California, which seems to improvise the entire story ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling had a good chance of co-starring veteran actor Morgan Freeman among his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega. The result is a dialogue between two different people who have improved each other's lives. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays his role - but part of the comedy is that he is portrayed as a work-weary actor four years ago, exploring a location for a little "filler film" to get back into the flow of things. His "role" is to be the role of market manager and descends on the informal market in Carson where he faces, among other things, one Scarlett, and the girl in line 10 elements or less of the exit line. Not only is Scarlett tired of her busy job, but she is also generally angry at her flirtatious husband (Bobby Canaval), who is now sleeping with her co-worker in Scarlett (Anne Dodk) and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The couple having some common problems and stopping them going on a "road trip" leads to the growth of both the characters of the existence and the life of the other. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, simply tell me, but because of the interconnection between Freeman and Paz, it works very well. This is one of those small films about human relationships where they are subject to change and exchange is the message. It's worth watching, a DVD that features touch, media and comedy features - it's fun to watch. Grady harp
