My father grew up watching George Reeves as a Superman, and when I was a little boy he had episodes on the VHS and let me see her including this movie (passed in the family if you will) and I loved him. <br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Louis Lane are sent to a small town and an oil mine, and the mine shows radioactive moles and is targeted by the supposedly lethal city and returns to Superman to stop the chaos. <br /> <br /> It's great and very fun. Special effects and old-fashioned sound - the crew snatched such a beauty with little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a young boy, 16 years old, and goes on to show these timeless and classical adventures.
