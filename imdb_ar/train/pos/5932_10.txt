Stephen King's best film alongside IT, although this movie is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This guy got everything: <br /> <br /> - A great team with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a great ceremony from King himself; <br /> <br /> - Good horror. An entertaining story; <br /> <br /> - Great use of music, Santo and Johnny "Sleep Wack" in particular; <br /> <br /> Favorite characters in the King Kong Model: A Village Anywhere; <br /> <br /> - Lots of humor. You can not really get good concerns here because they are so fun and more; <br /> <br /> - The effects of makeup are old but really nice because they are no longer manufactured! <br /> <br /> Rank 4,5: I do not really understand it. When was the last horror movie like this movie?
