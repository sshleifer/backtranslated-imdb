We recorded it when it was broadcast on television again in 1995 and we waited all these years for its release, because it quickly became one of our family's favorites. Children are now teenagers and must have seen it many times, but they still see it religiously with friends. The immortal appeal reaches all age groups - like "grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is amazing. Jason Alexander walked delightfully and light on his feet. I have noticed that other commentators on this site feel harsh about it, but our family gives it the highest ratings. (We liked the number "The Giant Step".) Mark Kudisch (Conrad) provides us with comic comfort and great musical numbers. And Prigita Dow (as Ursula) just steals the show. Perhaps our favorite character in the entire film. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment was Chynna Philip performing Kim's performance. Part of that has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicating it, Philip's delivery is flat, unthinkable, unbelievable, which is terrible. The manager must have seen and corrected it. Or never start it. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, the picture is exhilarating and highly recommended to families of all ages.
