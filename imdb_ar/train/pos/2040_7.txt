CREEP is a serious horror film prepared in real time and does not want more than just showing people being attacked in an empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. He does exactly that. No more, no less. Director Christopher Smith proceeds the drama as much as he can reasonably by presenting a series of characters that would actually be the reason to be in the subway after it was closed. It also leaves the origins of the ceremonial creeping deliberately ambiguous (hinted at the illegal experiences of the 1960s underground) and little ambiguity works for the most part. Unfortunately, it eventually undermines itself by actually retracting the crooked end showing more genetic deformities (also hinted at). Yes, you heard me well - I wanted to finish clich√©s! FRANKA (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good where the female lead terrifying and the rest of the staff is fine.
