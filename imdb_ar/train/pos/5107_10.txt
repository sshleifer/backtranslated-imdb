80's. I imagine that John Travolta sang some songs, but while watching the movie, he seemed to diagnose everything that was cheese in the 1980s. It is clear that films based on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were elegant. The best Texas accent was lousy. Compare this to Friday Night Lights. I suggest you watch Cocktail and Crazy Stir to start getting involved in the movie. Also, as a side note made in America with Ted Danson and Wipe Goldberg is a very bad film. I was so shocked that I realized I had never seen him. One more unusual film of this kind must include Cadillac Man with Robin Williams. Just remember that all BIG STARS have played big roles in these CHEESY movies .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, John Travolta
