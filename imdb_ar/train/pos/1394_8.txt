I watched the beach leave the other day. I've seen it several times, and never tired of it. Strangely, every time I see her recently, it is up to me the first time I saw it. Including this time. This must be vague and "What's going on here?" For that. <br /> <br /> It's strange that the only part of the story I've ever felt is uncomfortable and uncomfortable for me, this time, it has had a big impact on me - Ruth. I think many of them were the result of Gerald Farid. A real masterpiece, it! The romantic section - much more widely - has been reused on this side of paradise. But of course, the debut here. I have the impression that, of all the girls Kirk has known over the years, she may have been "sweeter". When she said, "Do you have to go?" , Along with music, I really felt the pain I felt for not being able to stay with him. <br /> <br /> Someone commented on the Internet that Roth seemed older than she was, but she was not supposed to be 15 years old at all. Which makes me think ... maybe she was one of the teachers at the academy. Kirk had an affair with an older woman! (Maybe he thought about it again in "MIRI" when he told Janice, "I did not get involved with older women." Maybe that meant, "... anymore." <br /> <br /> Read ST ST review the other On this day, I see where someone compares young girls with I, MUDD, but it seems that the beach must also exist, what are all these "androids"? Can the "Caretaker" be related to " Whatever the case, it seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST where you actually have a "superior" race instead of just thinking about it. <br /> Yeoman Barrows seems to be filling up on Yeoman Rand, Given the amount of interest Dr McQuey had raised , It's just another frustrating example of a potential good character that appears once and then does not show up again! Sheesh. <br /> <br /> There's one thing missing from the last number I saw sneaking back here and it's "Spock" smiling, I've seen him and I really prefer to know that there are two sides to Im happening at home all the time, instead of this "submerged." When he said, "Enjoy yourself sir." Near the beginning, you can see that he was not just addressing him His superior officer, but talk to his friend. In the end, when he says unnecessarily, "totally illogical!" , I can only think that he does so effectively to provoke a reaction. He may not smile or laugh, but I think he likes to see his teammates around him happy.
