I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This film is the best fiction film in years. I do not think "work" is the right type, although there is a lot of movement and KongFu scenes. Hey, did you mention that this is an Eastern fantasy please, keep in mind that you do not use the Hollywood version to evaluate this movie. For the person who "turns" around, I do not blame you, because you are still young and need to know more about "culture".
