Many features of this film are instantly dated. The sound sounds rather loud and one realizes the great steps that have been made in sound reproduction in the years to come. The language of the dialogue is somewhat strange and unnatural and representation still remembers its transition from theater techniques. <br /> <br /> House Davis has always performed strongly in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career. But I feel that the Cockney accent does not match facial expressions. I think the tone of the supposed Cockney does not seem right to me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan loves to engage in human relationships of enormous intensity that satisfy all filmmakers. As in many roles of her character, Beth Davis can be transformed from a seductive attractive woman into a snake full of hate. Leslie Howard is well liked as an English artist who was pulled out with a foot in the club in search of a desperate partner and made a bad choice in a small planned waitress. <br /> <br /> Near the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love on a busy street. They cross the traffic completely oblivious to a bunch of horns and whistles shouting at them. Maybe this was supposed to be a funny scene, but I find it very ridiculous in this very dangerous film. They are likely to be interpreted to send you home with a smile on your face. After all as much as we can see (and hopefully) it's a happy ending.
