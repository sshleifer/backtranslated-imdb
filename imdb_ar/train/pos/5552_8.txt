I waited until July 4th to write this because. . . Okay . . . Because it is correct to do so on this day. <br /> <br /> In 1924. Griffith needed success, and had not had much success since the Orphans Storm (1921). He has worked steadily since then but his films were smaller in scope and failed to reach the right chat with the fans. He was planning a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by members of the DAR who asked if he might expand his ideas to include more of the American Revolution. This film is the result. By the time he finished, he had a lesson in the history of the 14th wheel and there was no trace of Patrick Henry anywhere. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the revolutionary war, but Griffith gave a love story with Nathan Patrieut (Nile Hamilton) in love with the Conservative aristocracy of Nancy Montage (Carole Dempster, a leading lady in Griffiths for many years). The complexity of things is the fact that Nancy's father hates Nathan. . . Well, not only Nathan, he hates all the rebels. It does not help when someone wrestles Nathan's arm during skirmishes in the streets of Lexington, which makes him unload his weapon and hurt my father Nancy by chance! The story of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) is a disgruntled British officer who feels indebted to someone. With thousands of Indians who make up the "Six Nations" beside him, hopes to crush the colonizers and become the property of his empire. <br /> <br /> The comparison with the birth of the nation (1915) is inevitable. The Montague family may also be Cameron from the previous film while Nathan can be part of the Stoneemann family. The Battle of Bunker Hill sequence is very similar to the scene in the birth of a nation with the attacking army, in which case Redcoats breaks into a trench filled with patriots. The only thing that is missing is the shipment of Henry and the deluge across the La Noe Mans area to carry the flag in the gun muzzle. Surprisingly, the battle scenes in America seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes of birth and fail to attract the public. There is something clearly missing. It is not room, JW. The camera work "Billy" Beatcher is very good. Maybe what is missing. . . I dare say that. . . devotion? <br /> <br /> The brutality of Captain Butler and his men has been confirmed well, although much of that happens in long shots or off the screen. Do not expect any head to fall in close proximity as seen in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one scene, Butler Har (Lewis and Lehim) manipulated the captive colonel's eye. We see only the beginning of the act, for the rest focuses the camera on the face of Hare where he obviously has a fun time to do so. Lionel has been working with Griffiths on and off since 1912. According to one story, he approached Griffith to work. "I do not use actors," said DW, who knows his family's reputation. Lionel replied, "And I'm not that kind, sir!" He makes the villain very good and very friendly. Louis William appeared with Lionel's older brother John three times; in Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Jakeel and M. Hyde (both 1920) and later in The Tempest (1927). As Captain Hare said, his eyes and his prickly look not only make him look bad, he makes you think he's crazy too. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later noted that America was his first time on horseback "I was scared to death." He hides his displeasure well although we can believe he was completely equestrian at the time the shooting ended. Mr. Griffith was in love with Carol Dempster and asked her to marry him at some point. She was dismissed and soon her stock company left, and then her stellar condition gradually dwindled. <br /> <br /> I talked about horses, an amusing moment that had to be recorded during the filming of Paul Revere's trip. He rode his horse on the front porch of a family to proclaim "To arm, the regulars are coming!" But while trying to leave the horse can not negotiate the steps back and pitfalls pour his challenger on the ground! I am surprised that Griffith did nothing else. <br /> <br /> Is America a classic? Yes really! Do not wait for 4 July to see it, it's fun anytime.
