The best Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and the movie), Pickup on South Street is one of the best noirs. Fuller represents most of his control. I like when it's out of control, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is very beautiful. Richard Widmark plays the star who steals some microfilm that was supposed to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the role of the woman who was carrying the movie to her boyfriend, played by Richard Kelly. Peters was forced to find Widmark and retrieve it. You find it through a pigeon poo played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, changing Peters' allegiance (and the fact that they learn that they work for the Communists; the Cold War stuff is really interesting). The story of love is a bit quick and unbelievable, but not so bad as to damage the film (unlike the previous Fuller film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is awesome. This must be one of his best roles, but I am not familiar with his career so I can certainly say that. Thelma Ritter offers the best memorable performance. Her role in the film gives an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as moving as any scene you will find in the cinema. I will never forget that. 10/10.
