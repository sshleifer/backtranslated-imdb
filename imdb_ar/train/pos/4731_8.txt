This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. A few actors are able to play the arcade as Jet Li. Rapid fire action, special effects are enhanced for intensity purposes. As a result, it may take a while for the Americans. The suspension of infidelity goes a long way in Jet Li. I feel that it is an excellent introduction to Jet's work and I look forward to more of the masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) entering the US market. A nice mix of fireworks and physical conflict will satisfy most movement lovers.
