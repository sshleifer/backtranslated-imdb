I hated the first episode of this show (the "hippie protests") in 1999 so much that I managed to avoid the rest. However, when she appeared on the Paramount Comedy channel, I saw it in full, and to my surprise, she found it very fun (the slogan: I never judge a comedy series in her first week)! <br /> <br /> The film "Hippies" was set in 1969 on Simone Begg as "Ray Purbbs", editor of an underground magazine such as "Oz" called "Mouth". His friends are the Feminist Generation, Alex the Relaxed, and Hugo. In the late 1960s, there was a sense of astonishing optimism among young people, who could change the world by printing magazines that nobody read. Instead of mocking the naivety of hippies, the "hippies" are fond of it. The ironic manuscripts of Arthur Matthews ridiculed a number of icons of that era - "poetry," "Woodstock," "the graduate," and even the infamous "Oz" infamous experiment of the early 1970s. Offers excellent cast. Julian Rind Tut "Alex" in the minds of the characters of Richard O'Sullivan from the film "Man for the house." It is a shame that there has never been a second series, probably because of people like me. If you miss "Hippies", try it. Once you skip the terrible opening game, you'll get fun!
