Robert Wohl teaches a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> It covers the fallacies of history and facts that are no longer generally known. I would like to see more of this offer. It's very entertaining. Mr. Wohl uses examples and "shows and tells" to illustrate his points. He explained that the person who already installed the midnight flight from Paul River was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth used Longfellow as River because he looked better. <br /> <br /> I've seen Robert Wohl for many years, since he was doing comedy backup and all the way "Arli $$" on HBO. He is a good actor and a good comedian, but he is an excellent teacher! I highly recommend that you see an episode of this show. It is well worth your time.
