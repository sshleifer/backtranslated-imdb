A documentary without loss of words ... never ... <br /> <br /> Let's assume that narrative is more than a parody, let's assume that it is a comment on Japanese society. As this film is fast paced in the presentation of an incredible documentary, the lingual expression, as it is fast, and poorly translated as it is - in its current version of the screening of festivals as seen at Copenhagen Cinematek - It is still very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, just impatient and really open, I'm talking to you fans of Jim Jarmusch with ADD ADD, I think this is a movie for you. It's a smart movie if you let it win you. <br /> <br /> A beautiful, completely beautiful subculture and a completely Japanese culture. And quite experimental. 2D fixed in 3D world. All in all, fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie spoil the Japanese food culture. Excellent if you are in the mood for something completely different.
