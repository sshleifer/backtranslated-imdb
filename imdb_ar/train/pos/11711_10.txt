Patty Duke's story about her life and her struggles with manic depression was like the struggles of my life. I saw myself acting exactly like her. I was amazed at the similarities in our lives to the sexual abuse we had as children. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie when it premiered in 1990 and I liked it a lot. Anyone struggling with manic depression can get a lot of this movie. It does not matter if they show her prizes or what they were for. This is not the issue here. The issue is how Ms. Duke got sick and fought to overcome it. Ms. Duke has much to be proud of in her achievements through her struggle to survive the disease that leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> Unless a person struggles with the disease personally, they do not know the hell they have to live with. For me, the film was successful because it showed the real issues and how a person with depression and mania behaves. It was very real ... so, real. It was like watching myself on the screen. <br /> <br /> I wish to thank Ms. Patty Duke personally for the courage to inform the public about her illness. Bocka
