What's wrong with you guys, if you do not rush through the motion picture series and hot Jessica Simpsons, you're in the head. Of course the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think it was intended to be. It was fun and funny, I never saw the show when I was younger, I only saw one episode recently, and when I saw the movie, I felt it had the same atmosphere. The film seats were practically vibrating, and the car sequence was good because it did not carry me out like some scenes in 2fast 2Furious. Jessica Simpson is very hot, I wish they used it more in the event chains. All in all, I had a hell of a time watching this and I would go to see him again soon and I will buy it on a DVD. People, enjoy what it is.
