I have seen this film and theater, and I must add that this was the most influential story I have ever seen. Until I saw this film, I did not know how terrible life was and probably still is for the children and adults of South Africa who were and still live in that era. Tears brought to my eyes and a great sadness to my heart that any person should struggle like this just to survive, and to take the children directly from that region and teach them to act and form and take them out to tell them their story is simply amazing. This simply exceeds five stars, and I rate it ten. Thank you Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for this amazing story. Although 12 years on the story of this story, it is still heavy in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD on the play, please let us know as soon as possible. Thank you. Note: There has been no error in the desire of children to draw the attention of other States to their problems and circumstances in the hope that someone will have a heart and help.
