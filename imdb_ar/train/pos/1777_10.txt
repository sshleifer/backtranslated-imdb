When I first saw the Romeo section last spring, my first reaction was fantastic! However, in future performances, I got more than a brilliant film industry. This image has a unique sound that will be reflected throughout the movie's history. <br /> <br /> The opening montage offers a great painting by Helmer JP Sarro to create his art on this entertainment board. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as his brush while driving us on a journey that roams the audience with a wonderful movement film that goes beyond the traditional format we used to dig deeper into dark themes of treachery, revenge and the importance of companionship. This film is the dream of any director in essence. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic project. The writing, by writer Tim Sheridan, was impressive. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave representatives such presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the last scene (warning: spoilers !!! spoilers !!!) where Vanessa reveals herself as one of the Allies and villains all the time, is written in a dark tone so that it is one of the most chilling events. The endings I have seen in my life. Sheridan is the next Robert Town. <br /> <br /> In a final note, this production was clearly not a small achievement. <br /> <br /> So, a lot of praise should be given to the producer Scott Shipley who seems to get the creativity and genius to walk next to Jerry Brookheimer. I have never seen very large production with much attention directed to every small detail. Production is one of the most difficult jobs in any film, and Shipley makes it look easy. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film combines creative writing, amazing production and skillful direction. This is the art of the film at its best. When you reach the end of the movie, the only thing you want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo department is a masterpiece, masterpiece and, most importantly, Romeo Division is actually an art.
