Wu other masterpiece! <br /> <br /> This is the best Wuxi movie I have ever seen! Wu - Rolls Forever (except for some Hollywood moments ...). John Wu - the greatest director of the century. <br /> <br /> He may not have been more intellectually hi than many top managers ... but he is lyrical and spiritual to all people who enjoy free thought! <br /> <br /> His movies are like great poetry! Wu is a film Sheakspeare! Wu is the film Byron! Woo is Mozart of Bloodshet !!!! <br /> <br /> The violent IMHO in Wu's films is not a way out of blood, but it is a technical tool. Wu's films are more humane than the new ones.
