I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" and I thought it would be a movie "Sixties / Seventies" exaggerated. Some of my favorite films come from the 1970s, in the same context as "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park," etc.) Because they are pioneers - unfortunately, the vast majority of them do not hold up today as well. I feel somewhat this way about "Easy Rider". (Although it's also one of my favorite things.) <br /> <br /> So, I did not expect much from Midnight Cowboy but I recovered a lot. It's an impressive and well-designed story and I've thought of some of the best performances ever. Dustin Hoffman, like Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, offers one of his best - it's a bit funny at times (looks like a cartoon character when talking - maybe because of Lenny's connection to "Simpsons"), but Hoffman is quite convinced. Half of the film's budget went towards his salary because he was just a big star in Hollywood. In his interview, John Voight II, nicknamed "Joe Buck", is considered a "cowboy" who travels north to "Big Apple" in the hope of becoming a male whore. Soon, his naive ways put him in trouble, and clashing with a paralyzed scam artist called "Ratsu" - offers to become a "manager" of Joe versus a certain percentage of profits. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long in two hours but does not really look very long. Some films may tend to drag, especially some of the films that were produced in the 1970s (because, as was said in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") film directors were in the 1970s and sometimes got a bit intrigued with their material, Characters / scenes / etc. this is not important. The only scene I felt was too long and it was not necessary for the drug party - it makes the film look very old (like Odyssey's drug in "Easy Rider") and really hurt its flow because it is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the "Midnight Cowboy" is a picture of almost flawless motion. I was pleasantly surprised. (Memories of the past are little memories and never used as they could be, for example) and some scenes are a bit uncomfortable (like the gay cinema theater sequence) but if you can handle their content, "Midnight Cowboys" is a wonderful picture Indeed, the relentless scrutiny of street life in the late '60s / early' 70s. It's a frustrating film, yes, and today's standards may seem a bit old and heavy on the liberal perspective "Life is horrible, etc." ... but I still love her, especially the very touching end will stay with me for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the seventies. (It was released technically in late 1969, but I still describe it as a movie in the 1970's and also won the Oscar for Best Film, being the first and only film to be categorized to do so. <br /> 4.5 / 5
