This is certainly a somewhat absurd whodunnit masquerading as a period drama / CV. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious about what Henry Fonda was really great at at its peak. I was not disappointed - it produces a really warm and attractive performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, I can honestly say that I never felt bored at any stage of the film, so a strong performance *** 1/2 of *****
