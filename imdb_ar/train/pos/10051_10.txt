Family problems are many in real life and this is what this movie is about. Love can bring together members through tribulations and experiences and this is what this film is about. One man, Dad, has maturity and perseverance to keep the family in the face of adversity. Children grow up, one of them, in the hard way, realizing that regardless of age or age, the parent still loves his children and wants to provide a cushion for him when he falls. All actors portraying their characters performed well. Yes, I threw a tear along the way and I know I have experienced similar experiences whether you are a young man or later as a parent. This is true in life, which every young adult, and the parents, do well to see, although some will not realize it until they are also parents. Must see for those who care about their families.
