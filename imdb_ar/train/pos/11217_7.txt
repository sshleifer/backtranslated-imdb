Connie Otaku Since the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animations of all time. Consider the time of its manufacture, high quality animation. There are no rings and sequences in which the quality of art decreases. Although the last episode is in black and white, it does not detract from enjoying the movie. Although it has been described as "na√Øve," it must be borne in mind that females do not react in the same way as males. Since the main character is feminine, it must be clear that she does not necessarily need to resort to "macho man" methods in order to gain the respect of her peers. seiryuu to Noriko, incidentally, also plays Akane in half Ranma. Noriko is a three-dimensional image you can get; her character embodies the essence of a lively girl who at first seems utterly powerless but ultimately succeeds by her own volition. The only complaint I have is that the mica looked somewhat like teddy bears. Even Gunbuster uses a somewhat dubious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than a giant velvet cloak wrapped around itself in the real Dracula style). I doubt this scene was supposed to be funny, but it bothered me. After all, I would rank Gunbuster in the best 20 anime of all time.
