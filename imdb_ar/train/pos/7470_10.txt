I went to see the Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge fan !! Tom Cruise, my very sarcastic brother and my friend ... What can I say .. I was blown away by the film and especially TC performance, I thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I had read the reviews and decided not to go and see him, and I am very pleased because I was "forced to see him ... The strange thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I found it totally involved and I can not stop As far as I'm concerned about the film, all I can say is not the story (fiction, drama, whatever) about the people and events that shape their lives and how small events can be changed, like getting into a car every Something ... <br /> <br /> As far as the critics wrote, yes perhaps the original film was amazing in Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this Was a completely different interpretation of the subject, and was by no means a new narcissistic edition of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not even think of writing a few stupid sentences written to describe the movie Go and watch !!!! /> <br /> Yes, I know this is not a well thought out and balanced review but what about it.
