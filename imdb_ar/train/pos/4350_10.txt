This film is one of those who have a resounding affinity for it. It's dusty, ground-based and a movie that makes you think ... and smiled. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey you will never forget. The soundtrack is beautiful and varied. The film itself resembles the breath of fresh air. This is definitely worth the appreciation of both the film and the actors! Finally, a piece of art emerges from the clear story of love and the many special effects we see today. I never came out of a movie with a deep warmth and a deep feeling in my heart. Because he felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket. To see this movie is to find a real treasure and a joy in it.
