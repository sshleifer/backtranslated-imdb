I do not know why people think this is a bad film. I've got a good plot, some good action, and it does not hurt to change the site for Harry too. Sure, some of the attack is unjustified but this is not the only such film. Eastwood is in good shape like Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this film as a small town cop. If you love DRTY HARRY, you are supposed to see this, much better than POAD POOL. 4/5
