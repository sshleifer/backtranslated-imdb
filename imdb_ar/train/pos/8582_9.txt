I like the characters and the storyline. Very funny with a lot of work. Thomas Ian Griffiths and Tia Carr√®re make great performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comedy interaction of Griffith and his career. Donald Sutherland plays the role of a very lovable and surprisingly sympathetic man. All three actors are among my favorites and make them in this movie for special fun. Nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this film. If you love ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, LAA Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss, The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
