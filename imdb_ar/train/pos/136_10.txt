This movie is a great way for the series in the end. Peter (the boy from Puppet Master III) grew up and is now Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the dolls and learn the secrets of Toulon but instead she listens to the story of the dolls. Most of the movie is from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... but I think Paramount will not be allowed to use scenes from 1). Personally I wish Master brides vs. Finally, Demonic Toys will be made but the way it ends up basically says "This is the last movie in the series ..."
