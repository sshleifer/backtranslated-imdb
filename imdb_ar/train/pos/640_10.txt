My sister and I saw the premiere last night ... it was very good as it was glued to everything .. hahaha .. I think I'm addicted to the season !! They had some really good actors in this thing .. The team coach and the player who loved the pete were very good and the plot really got on me, but I do not really understand how they'll stay extended for the whole season .. there's likely to be a large Twist Tho .. I can not wait until Tuesday .. And finally Jeremy Sumputer Who is it? I can say that Hess would be great !! It was good, we fell in love with his character immediately .. We can not wait until the next episode .. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
