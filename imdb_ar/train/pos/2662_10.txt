* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I start this, let me say that I enjoyed the benefits of watching this movie on the big screen and watching the "Certified Version" of this film, prepared by Stephen King, himself, in 1997. < /> <br /> Both features made me appreciate this version of "The Shining", all of it. <br /> <br /> Also, let me say that I have read Mr. King's book "The Shining" on many occasions over the years. While I love the book and am a great admirer of its work, Stanley Kubrick's story is more compelling. .. and scary. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to move the horror of the soul directly to the film. In the direction of the film and writing the same script, he earned the title "Magus" without a doubt. The genius of Kubrick is like magic. The film world had a great way out when he died in 1999. Among his other notable credits: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lindon, 1975; Orange Orange, 1971; 2001: Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 And many more. <br /> <br /> Torrens (Jack, Wendy, his wife, and Danny, their son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been hired as his chargé d'affaires. His mission is to oversee the maintenance of the hotel during several months of severe snow, until spring when overlooking open its doors. There seem to be many wealthy and retired tourists who flock to the Colorado mountains for a snowy summer holiday. <br /> <br /> The hotel was a wonderful piece of architecture and stairs. The atmosphere has been lent, with a "dark" atmosphere, but at the same time an atmosphere of "welcome" itself. The furnishings and furniture were throughout the period (the late 70s - early 80s), and the landscape filmography was close to the hotel in a spectacular opening. Not only does it allow you to enjoy the Overlook approach, it also determines how the hotel is deserted and isolated from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Entering the characters Wendy and Danny was a blow of genius. You can get the full story of their past, "Danny" the fictional friend, "Tony", and the story of alcohol addiction to Jack, all entered into this beautiful and elegant primer scene. There is no need to extend the past history for more than two hours from the film; obviously Kubrick saw it from the start. <br /> <br /> Closing day. Again, the scenic scenery was up the mountains to the hotel (this time, with the family pulling it), and the interaction between Jack and Danny Farhana was also a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The initial tour across the view is very impressive, even as the "staff" move things out, you will get a chance to see the magnificent fire places, the high ceilings of the cathedral, the expensive furnishings, the silence and the crown moldings in architecture. "They've done a good job, pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) so the Staff Suite is well designed and beautifully built. <br /> <br /> The maze was a wonderful touch, reminding us of the maze where Minotaur of Crete was a Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands on the labyrinthine model staring into the middle, sees Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magical moment; one tells you right away, there's heavy energy in this house; there's something seriously wrong, it's already started. "I do not want to go there unless I have at least one hour to find a way out." (Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was real and open in his performance. His smile was normal and his performance was wonderful. In fact you could believe you were there at the hotel, with a tour of the kitchen with Wendy and Doc. His explanation of "Shining" was presented to Danny well, as well as his talk with the kid about Tony and the hotel. It was reasonable and honest. <br /> <br /> A comprehensive survey of the hotel itself, with mountains looming, cold air hovering around it, adds fog from the warm roof of the snow-capped hotel, and adds very much to the atmosphere of the film. He also points to the "half way to hell" point, so to speak; it was the turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of Chile Duval Lewindi Torinese was brilliant. Frankly, before I saw the film on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What?" Oliv Orel? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But in the opinion of Fiend, this was her best performance so far (although I loved her in the film Roxanne by Steve Martin). <br /> <br /> Once Kubrick establishes the parts The daisy of the information that must be in your possession: the viewer, past Torrens; the arm of Danny Broken; Tony; the history of the hotel itself; Danny's fact is not "mentally", rather rather clairvoyant, <br /> <br /> The former guard, Delbert Grady (the girls appeared several times to Danny, first through Tony in the apartment before leaving the family). "They were chasing (and chasing), showing Danny how and where they were killed, graphically and materially." Tony Kubrick wrote as a companion spirit , Such as the spirit guide he was acquired as a result of his arm was almost cut off from his body by his father. He was ... "the little boy who lives in my mouth". He unfolded at the end of Danny's finger and spoke physically through Danny in order to speak to Danny. I do not like this book, I realized, where Stephen King had planned Tony to be Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick left this little shift and made it more frightening when Tony "took ... Danny ... finished". It is not the idea of ​​an older Danny who returns to his younger self ... scary. <br /> <br /> The scene of "Woman in the Bathroom" by Lea Bilden (for whom I can not find any other credit) because she has done anything before, or since then, as a young woman and Billy Gibson Apparently also suffering from a lack of funds for the business before or after), were absolutely repugnant and disgusting. It was dramatic and scary. Scary and scary. When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposed body under his hands; the look of utter terror on his face is full and exquisite. <br /> <br /> Jack is quickly embarking on his journey from "converted" alcohol to a believable believer. The deterioration of the mental state of his personality was documented carefully and accurately by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the waiter (just like alcoholics, addicts and drug addicts) portrays his urgent need for Lloyd's air; alcohol ... "The dog's hair that bothers me." (Jack Torrance) In the case of Jack, it is Bourbon on the rocks, without any fees on Jack. "Orders from home." (Lloyd the waiter) playing beautiful on the words. <br /> <br /> When Wendy finds Jack's "Scenario" no more than one page after another of the same line is repeatedly written, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles. .. When asking from the shadow, "How do you like it?" Wendy roars and yells with a baseball bat in her hand ... very moving. It's the point where you realize how utterly lost the whole situation is. It is very frightening, dramatic and provides a strong presence. Along with the visions of Danny Lopey, the blood-filled hotel, forced on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the end of this scene, make this scene stronger than the film. <br /> <br /> The scene "REDRUM". Wonderful. what I say? What is the mother who will not get quite upset by waking up to find her turbulent little son standing over her with a huge knife, speaking with a slightly awful voice, and shouting "Redrum" over and over again? Even if it does not make sense, it will remain as scary as the seventh level of hell. It was something that everyone (and him) could remember (ed). Talking about the unforgettable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's recent assault on his family may have been one of the most horrifying scenes in the film's history. His polished line, "Heeeeeere's Johnny!" It was a wonderful hit and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. They also go down in the history of horror film. <br /> <br /> The end ..? The end of the cupric was perfect. I felt it ended beautifully. No smarm, no platitudinous whine, no stupid end crying for this movie. Just a perfect incarnation. That's all I'll say about the end. <br /> <br /> Who cares about what has been taken? Look at what Kubrick put in. Rent it, watch it, buy it. It's classic in this kind of horror, and for good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me Being * ... Take this movie, place it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 "Approved" version of King and stick it in the KDE section. This is where he belongs. This movie is rated 9.98 by Punk :.
