I love this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel. The young man who returned from service is still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in romantic driving as well as Donna Reed as a lover of his life. The looks he gives her as if he were starving because of her sight as well as her hesitation and confusion as she played her feelings towards him well. The rest of the strange characters in the store were perfect as they tried to combine them. The most suitable scene, however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I laughed in parts, I cried in some, and enjoyed watching this movie. In fact he has re-viewed it about 5 times. Must see specific for total romances.
