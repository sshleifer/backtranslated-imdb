Great actors, please! <br /> <br /> If you can catch anything else written by Blatter (or starring these wonderful actors). For anyone who does not know Plater has a real sense of jazz, my recommendation is to see a trio "Beiderbecke" whenever you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz - hot and cold and" What time does the melody start? "
