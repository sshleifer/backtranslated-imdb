There is something strangely convincing and convincing about this episode. From the start, an atmosphere of tension is created by knowing that a particular planet will explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy evacuated the residents, and they all seem to have already left for unknown parts, with the exception of an elderly librarian. <br /> <br /> Librarian's polite but subtle advice about the place of all citizens has been interrupted by the crisis in which all three members of the Enterprise crew found themselves unexpectedly in different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a period similar to England in the seventeenth century, while stranded and Makewy in abandoned abandoned wastes. <br /> <br /> The two stories, and the different dangerous situations in which men find themselves, are treated wonderfully, with an unknown opportunity returning, while the minutes are counted to explode. <br /> <br /> This episode is marked by fiction and good acting, with an impressive performance by Margaret Hartley as an exile to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolf as a librarian. Somewhat similar to the classic episode of City On The Edge of Forever, this travel story is a rich and compelling ending to the series, which concluded one episode later. This should be one of the best serials, especially given the generally lower quality of the third season in general.
