First things first, I was not afraid of this jewel extracted as a child ("Little Mermaid" on the other hand ...). As my name says, this was one of my favorite childhood movies that I still love in my teens. It is also a sweet film about the unknown "German Shepherd" Charlie (fictionalized by Bert Reynolds) who was killed by his boss / partner (the name is Ha Ha Ho Karps) Charlie is sent directly to Paradise by default because " All dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are good, sincere and nice. " Chali is returned to the land because he has finished his hour of life, becoming more harmful with his intimate friend Eichi and an orphan girl Anne-Marie. I used to watch this all the time as a child and I still see it sometimes. Anyway, it's a bittersweet movie as I said before it may leave your eyes ...
