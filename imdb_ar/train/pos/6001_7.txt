By no means a masterpiece, far from the best of Errol Flynn, Istanbul still works a lot. Locations and beautiful artistic film photography, bring us back to a long time since the past. Errol Flynn shows moments of his past glory, which is fine like Jim Brennan, the pilot who has come back to chase him. The picture is actually a remake of "Singapore" in 1947, and the story appears to be fabricated and vulgar as standard today. Many of the supporting actors seem to be "turning to suggestions" in this picture. Many people also compared it to one of the great history, CASABLANCA. While watching the film, I could see many similarities, but hey, Casablanca Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take this as it deserves. In conclusion, if you love Flynn, or old love stories, you may want to take a look at this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some classics in Hollywood ....
