This film is similar in many ways to "the enemy of the state" with Will Smith and Jane Hackman, where we have an innocent man (black) pursued by the "government" with all the modern technology known to man. Usually when a story is copied like this the result will be a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course I love everything that David Morse does, so maybe my comments are unfair, but there was more good stuff about this film then. The main Badi, played by Doug Hutchison, was fantastic, and the story flowed with excellent additions like David Baemer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was most disturbing. It is misplaced, breaking bad jokes, and evoking no sympathy from the public. Or not first of all, the odd thing is that it grows on you (and on its followers too!). I did not expect much when I hired him, but I was surprised by a good action film with comedies. 10/07
