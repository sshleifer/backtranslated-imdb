Good view, very entertaining. Hassan Marshal performing arts. A good story. The entire main crew did a wonderful job of Robert Urich, Chuck, Norris, and Jennifer Tung, especially a big hand from Judson Mills. A very good tribute to Robert Orek in his last days. Great ! The actor will really be missed.
