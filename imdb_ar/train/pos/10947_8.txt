The Sarah Silverman program is a pleasant one; you end up with a bias so you can not afford it. The truth is that even though most people will "get it", that does not mean they will all appreciate it. It's a very polarized view, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you might give it up there. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay with us, because each episode has been as good as the last episode. <br /> <br /> Despite all the shows, they are not perfect. I personally love the program, but there are some huge errors in the program. Racist songs are funny, but grow much faster than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I had with "Jesus is magic". It seems as though Silverman has given herself a share of songs in every episode you do not need to exist. Not to mention that although the lyrics you write are good, music is not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to take into account is that while this show will attract fans for some reason to Monty Python, the Straight Citizens Brigade, etc., it's not like those shows. I can see Monty Python all day, but as much as I like this show, I can not see more than half an hour at a time. It's flat very quickly. The repetitive value of this offer is very low - the second time around the episode is somewhat funny, and by the third time, in my opinion, be boring. <br /> <br /> However, the first time around the event is very, very funny. Give her a chance.
