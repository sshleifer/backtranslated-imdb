I've just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out. The performance of Toby Malone has really emerged. I found myself really interested in what happened to Matt throughout the film, which is itself very enjoyable, very mixed with a good mix of well-rounded characters, a remarkable achievement given that it is short-lived. There are a lot of good transitions around and will keep you guessing until the end. The other characters to be aware of are Tiny Totally Crazy and Jesse the Enthusiast. You may not have a huge budget of Hollywood movies but do not let it delay you, you can do much worse than checking it out, you will not regret it. Good fun. 10/07
