Road Rovers was a great show about superheroes for dogs chosen by Mr. to fight crime all over the world. The show was a joy to say the least. Simple and complex jokes can appeal to all ages. Run jokes around the chain that can spawn a drinking game. The work was charming, and it was cleverly prepared. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me enjoy the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has conflicts and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but implicitly in a sub-text. Hopefully, someday, there will be a way to watch Rovers at work again.
