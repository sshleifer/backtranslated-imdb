This film ran completely rolls around the original Dolemite. He had everything that made the movie great .. except the real actors. (I was not able to do this by myself and you know it! Lol) I admit I had killed the first video of this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie contains many attractive and deplorable lines! I am embarrassed to say that I know song song forward and forward! I loved Jimmy Lynch's character to death, and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were never ready for this! This random movie consists of crooked cops, breasts, chases, bad edits, and of course martial arts. (Being the seventies and I can say that everyone knows some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and presented one night in the midst of the marathon in local theaters!
