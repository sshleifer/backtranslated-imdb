*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie is always exaggerated, so I remember that a campus had a former assassin who turned into a Nazi and was a suicide murderer. , Also: his name is Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Search it in Wikipedia - I added some pictures to their article. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but these things do not really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Age Eps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Christie Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rapaport were good.
