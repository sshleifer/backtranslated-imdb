I wait for each new episode, each restart hopefully! The new look of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder I hope it does not end. Combining past and future is a wonderful new development for me. Season 9 must be a thrill in itself. I hope that Richard Dean Anderson will appear again and again in the new season, because I like his dry wit like tantrums like Jack O'Neill. Other characters add their unique character to the show that makes him a winner, season after season. I canceled this program in the next three years and made a serious mistake. You also need a larger role for Asgard - they are so wonderful.
