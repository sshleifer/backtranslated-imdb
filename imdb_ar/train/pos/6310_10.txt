After having the opportunity to watch some films in the Slavic Village-Broadway area, I could not wait to see the final version. <br /> <br /> This film was shown at the Cleveland Premiere last Friday, did not laugh out loud in comedy in a long time! It's a big jerk. Rousseau Brothers did a good job. The entire cast performs the best comedy act ... there are no slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he is as wonderful as the safe breaker cut in that click. I have been the most ancestor by William H. Messi in the role of fraudster "Riley" and Michael Jeter in the role of "Tutu", where they keep you in "stitches". I think they have the most extreme roles in the entire film.
