Thank you very much to Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors who paid only US $ 1.4, and I could enjoy such a joyful pleasure. <br /> <br /> adultery? How rumor is in our modern day. Eva took her two children and kidnapped Nick to chase Lewis and Charlotte to Italy. She wants her revenge, but in the end she is committing the same crime as Lewis: she has sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small production, Vivienne Navey dealt with the problems of teething in modern marriage with a light heart. How can one dare to treat marriage seriously at a time of fast food, where people are now more able to move in the physical and mental fields and technology? Asking a doubles commitment for a very high price chooses most people to surrender to the circumstances. Nick had previously documented in Charlotte but he fell on an EVA trip after a kidnapping that forced him to experience much growth. <br /> <br /> Most viewers may feel happy towards the end because Eva and Nick meet well, and that should be the greatest punishment for their wife's unspeakable act. However, I want a sequel, I want to see how the four will develop after this exchange. Perhaps they may exchange again, how one can be sure of the shaky love relationship. <br /> <br /> Good behavior and good scenery. The two little children should not be neglected, especially the boy when he cries when the hotel is received in Venice. And of course, how can we forget the scene of "Bella, Bella" of the city.
