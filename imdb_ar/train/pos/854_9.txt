"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This very interesting movie captures you from the opening scene and never ceases to offer unexpected laughs, surprises and moments. I enjoyed watching "The Matador" more than almost any other film in 2005. It's an unforgettable film of an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julianne Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit man) who specializes in corporate high-end vehicles (the assassination of rich men). He also suffers from something like a midlife crisis. Realizing that he had no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbled into a Mexican hotel bar one evening and went to Kinnear. <br /> <br /> Danny is a pessimistic family man on luck, about to lose a big business deal that might turn things around for him. He loves his wife dearly, especially because they lost their young son a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The two men are two chefs and cheeses, barely any common ground except they are in the same barren strip and one night. In a way a conversation was held preparing to trigger a series of events that would change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they formed reminded me of a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the straight guy and the other is the constant idiot who makes them in trouble. The interaction is superbly fine-tuned, thanks in large part to the great performances of Brosnan and Kaneer. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... this is the film Brosnan. He prints one of the most memorable and beloved characters of the decade. Your mother can be shot and then apologized immediately and may forgive him. Brosnan may be a charming filmmaker in the end, but this is his most cherished performance yet. I will not be loath to see Oscar's nod for this role. <br /> <br /> Think of one scene where he was openly manipulating a girl in high school with the tiniest ideas and saying the line, "It's all blush ... not funny fun." He does it with a familiar Bond smile and runs away from her. He is able to tell a young boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then count me back" without being unwanted. In fact, he makes us like him more. <br /> <br /> However, the film manages to surprise us with truly impressive scenes, most of which finally comes when the film takes some unpredictable turns. However, when Julian browses through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when Danny and his wife, Davis, sympathize with each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> "Matador" is classy and lively. It's entertaining constantly. It has a crucial role for Brusnan as the only man who is looking for a normal life and friendship and a way to do one good thing at least in his life. This gem has been overlooked in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler of IndependentCritics.com
