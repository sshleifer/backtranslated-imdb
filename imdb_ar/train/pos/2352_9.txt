I must say, when the "Daisies" came out, I immediately won a fairy tale like putting such a dark. The narrator made a cake of every ordeal by making death seem routine, as were the Ned pies. This routinely brought them back to life. <br /> <br /> The trio Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), in addition to occasional owner Olive Snook (Christine introduced Chinnewith, who made the musical villain such a delight) to some Wonderful dialogue and ridiculous. She certainly deserves the title of a comedy / drama (romantic). <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck have made a shy and completely unprepared couple of love who are still exploring their feelings even though they can not touch - the handicap seems to represent no obstacle in fact with tools such as gloves, cellophane and timed roundabouts around the apartment. But despite the embarrassment that has been presented during their work on their feelings about a strange mystery little known to them, they are still able to show their chemists on screen in touching scenes like when Ned Chuck gives a bee cell. However, Oliv's presence makes some of the distinct moments in the pancake shop and the unexpected complications of the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season fell sharply, putting a strain on a show that had real potential. In some episodes, the earth's line has been accelerated and embarrassed, making you ask "What just happened?" In both the plot of the dead person of the week and in the dominant conspiracy line. The addition of Chuck's father as well as Ned's two nieces did not help, and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recyclable ("Comfort Food" did not feel like a "bitter candy" episode in the fact that the dead died of the week in food?). There were moments of emotional influence (hives) to help advance the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they approached, the book decided to throw the monkey key instead of leaving the relationship evolving (Oliver returns from the monastery, Chax) the dead father returns to life and returns, you can get on the picture). <br /> <br /> A shame did not work, but the concept was good and looked surreal in a good way, enough fun / fun color, unreasonable scenarios to remind you that she is not "dead like me". Then again, it is at the "time of payment of daisies," according to originator Brian Fuller, so it makes sense again. <br /> <br /> It should have lasted longer, but it is just a sad thought at this point. Glory to any new attempt to replace this short-lived gemstone.
