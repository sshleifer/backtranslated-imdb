Dominique Tank Police is undoubtedly one of the most amazing performances ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mostly of work and fun, the second part is more serious and the second part should not be treated in the same way as the first part. The minute is really outside this world and the characterization is beyond fantastic. You must have an additional degree of intelligence to estimate the complexities of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, the Bonaparte tank literally jumps over a tank shell and has no meaning at all. One could also question the usefulness of Bonaparte to jump on the helicopter wing even though it was cool. Buaku Rules.
