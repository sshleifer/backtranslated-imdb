THE RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite film for Schwarzenegger. No, this is not 2001, but it is not meant to be. Representation and textual representation here is not appropriate for other Arnie films such as PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I realize that IDEA behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. A state-sponsored game in which criminals convicted of serious crimes vie with the "heroine" armed with all kinds of weapons (the runners are equipped with anything) to satisfy the public's appetite for sport and blood. The final prize of the winning foe: Freedom. Or so the rules claim. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such high-rise incandescent and high-profile scenes, it has little to say. Another person referred to all the comments about the culture / government presented in this film, so I will not go into it here. Suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the naive feeling of the film, you will enjoy it a lot (especially if you are an adult SF fan with lots of imagination). As I said, he is not trying to be a serious technical film, but surprisingly it was shown in the dust in the eighties. The hypothesis was derived from a short novel by Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but rather fairly divergent from the source material, especially toward the end. No need to say that this film does not.) I enjoyed both, but I like the film better. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "I think it's due to steroids."
