In 1594 in Brazil, the Indians of Tupinambas are friends of the French and their enemies are Tupiniquins, and Portuguese friends. The Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) was arrested by Tupinambás, and despite his trial to convince them that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes a slave to them, and lives with his wife Seboibe (Anna Maria Magalhaes). Later, he used powder in the guns left by the Portuguese succeeding to defeat Tupiniquins in the battle. In order to celebrate the victory, the Indians decided to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is another low-budget film by Brazilian director Nelson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and the story is told in Toby. The film is filmed using natural light most of the time and is very realistic. The actors and performers perform nude and Ana Maria Magalhães are wonderful, show a wonderful body and perform amazing performances. The sound is produced by Brazilian musician Zydro Rodricks. This film illustrates the beginning of the Europeans' exploitation of my country, with a focus on the Portuguese and the French at that time, where they trade with the Indians and exchange combs and mirrors through our natural resources.
