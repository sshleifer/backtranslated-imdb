I think the move was very good. There were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall, I was completely surprised. The courtroom scene at the end seemed a little unrealistic, but it was real enough for fun. I found that the film conveys the difficulties of military training and the sacrifices that accompany it. As a military pilot, I can relate to many of these parts.
