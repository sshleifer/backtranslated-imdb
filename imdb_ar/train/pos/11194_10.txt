Bad scenario, bad direction, over performance, overheating. What more could you ask for? For laughs, do not get better than this. Over-representation in Zadura, along with vulgar scenarios that find themselves preparing for a hilarious imitation of the Hollywood machine. Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap" although it was not clearly intended as such. Do not miss Ray Layota's "Penis-Like" film production line.
