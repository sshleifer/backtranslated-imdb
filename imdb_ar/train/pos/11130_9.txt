Jon Voight is great at Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, although he reminds us of his last role in Rainman, is the kind of performance that makes me watch movies. As a portrait of a character from New York, Daniel Day Lewis describes Bill Potcher in New York as a comparable, and Dai does not give the emotional depth of Hoffman Ratsu. <br /> <br /> It's usual in Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to most distinguish with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the best 4 or 5 actors in the history of the film to play people around him in a way that elevates their performance from their natural level. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is so naive that it will float out of the movie altogether, except that Ratso pulls it down - pulls it down, but it also teaches him a lot about how to survive and, most importantly, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, despite being a brave film, it contains a very beautiful message, no matter how much loser it may be (clearly defines Ratso "loser"), if you can find a way to be honest with yourself, , And you may be able to share this vision with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can only compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, after a few years, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself turning into a movie about escape.
