After seeing Arthur on television several times, she laughed hard at the role of Dudley Moore, where luck was good for Arthur, and was a drunk millionaire in a hysterical state, but John Gilgod was the character of his servant / father Hobson as a witch. I bought a DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, although it was almost 27 years old, but it was still as enjoyable as Lisa Menelli ever was, where love interest fascinated chemistry between the two. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunk millionaire who has bar code reads like a national religion that does not want to grow up and enjoy acting as a child. His activities are monitored by his dry English service Hobson (Gielgud), and no one seems to care about Arthur except him. Arthur's father gives a final warning if he does not marry the fearsome blond fellow Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four weeks, Million dollars. <br /> <br /> However, Arthur meets Linda Marola (Minelli) a waitress of the young working class and tie thieves, and is now facing a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson died, Arthur finally grew up and broke with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep his money and true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a really charming romantic comedy for everyone
