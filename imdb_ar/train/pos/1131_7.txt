This is a really fun movie. One of those you can sit and watch as reckless gets more and more twisted; more and more funny. Sally Field, Terry Hatter (in her final days), Kevin Klein, Elizabeth Shwe, Robert Downey Jr ... She is all these well-known actors, high-quality act as if they were stars / producers of soap opera. If you've ever seen the soap opera and thought, "How did they do that on the ground?" , You will love this movie. I have seen him several times. Every time I see her, the more I appreciate humor, the more I realize how good she is. Do not expect Oscar quality. It is a fun film for entertainment, not a technical attempt to find "man's inner man" and so on.
