It's a great movie for McCartney and Beatles fans! It is a wonderful time for everyone. The audience (including some celebrities like Nicholson, Kozak and Michael Douglas), as always, is very amazing: from young children to veterans of the old campaign in the 1960s. They know the words for all the songs by heart, and some of them cry when Paul storms "Black Bird" and "Yesterday" "All My Love" and all his treasures (who, with the exception of John Lennon and Dylan, can claim such ammunition?). There are particularly moving moments: <br /> <br /> - Double honors Lennon and Harrison; first "here today" performs solo (the title was included in "Tug of War" 1982 and was his best track), then "Something" when Paul The Guitar. <br /> <br /> - "Long and winding road", an important moment, when Paul's voice crackles, he moves to the tears of the hearts of the crew of the round sitting in front of the theater. <br /> <br /> I remember, in the early 1970s, when people used to despise Paul, because he did not participate in politics, as was his former partner. He had to change his mind because Paul is a committed artist: "Fame is a great cause because it allows for charity." The film presents different aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is nothing but selfishness.
