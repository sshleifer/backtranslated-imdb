This applies exactly to the original manga of the same name, known as "Tramps Like Us" in the United States, but it can still be enjoyed even if you have not read the manga. It is a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts like anyone else. However, because of her external power, she is afraid to show her inner feelings, and thus make her hurt her with their frank comments. The only person who really distinguishes her and can be comfortable with her is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something different from ordinary boring things with some great actors / roles for J-Dorama (Japanese Drama), this is definitely the series to watch ... and read it!
