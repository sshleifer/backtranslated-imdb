When playing the roles played by Jack Albertson and Sam Levine on Broadway, Walter Matau and George Burns play Old Vodafone comedy, a group of Joe Smith and Charles Del traditions who seem to have a different view of life. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau stop working, the man never learn to relax, take some time and smell roses. It is a fragile old curse, and its best days behind it and its nephew and client Richard Benjamin finds less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What was seriously hurt is that about 15 years ago his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend time with his family. Workaholics such as Matao can not understand him and personally make Burns's decision. <br /> <br /> Benjamin strikes a brain storm, reunites men and does so on a private national television screen. What is happening here is very fun. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are also a sad and bitter story as well as about aging. Matthau is on screen for most of the film, but Burns is the one who earned fame in Oscar form at the age of 79 mature. <br /> <br /> Little Burns of the character brought in this movie as well. As we all know he was the straight man in the great comedy team "Burns & Allen" borrowed by the band Monte Python much. In 1958 for health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George continued to work until the age of 100 years. Or at least very close to effective performance. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys depends on a team. However, if you like The Sunshine Boys, I strongly recommend seeing two tickets to Broadway to look at a pair of men who enjoyed the American audience at the turn of the century. The doctor's work is done by Matthau and Burns directly from his material. <br /> <br /> I think you'll love The Sunshine Boys.
