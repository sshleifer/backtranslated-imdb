It was full house and still a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and it is also a good family show. There really are no programs like that anymore. The kids are very nice and although it is a bit cheesy, it is still good, especially for anyone who saw it as a child. I would like to see the team I have met now. Anyone who wants to see interviews with actors, looks like where they are now writing something for the special features of the DVD, go to the Spot spot website and sign a petition titled Full House Reunion on DVD because there is a solicitation for this in the hope that the cast may wish to to do that. Yai for the whole house!
