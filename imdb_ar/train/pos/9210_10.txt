I feel that this is one of the best films I have seen, I am an older man and I love most Westerners. I like the films that at least partly exist on the facts. If I'm not mistaken, this is a film like this. I also love revenge movies, and this qualifies there too in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the film were the opening scene with the shooting scene of the skin. I felt that the creeping beating scene was a bit exaggerated but did not affect my feelings towards the full movie. I saw what I think is a continuation of this film in a smoke episode. I also enjoyed this. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie and I will see it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this film played well. I thought Randy Travis was playing a very evil role, but I always enjoy his acting.
