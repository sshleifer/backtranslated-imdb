This is a movie that my dentist has already recommended, and I'm glad he did! A combination of British humor (should I say, humor?) And the fact that a lost middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle was magnificence. Add to that mix the fact that it really takes to grow the pot (those plants under the bushes will not make them without the TLC you received), a really hilarious but influential film. I laugh every time I conjure up the sight of all the bar patrons sitting on their chairs in the garden with sunglasses on the countdown of the lights! Maybe it's just blood from Mendocino County, but the British certainly got that one right !! 10/10
