As a bouncer of drunken millionaire Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is considered ideal as a boxed boxer in childhood. As it turned out, the role is perfectly suited to Moore, who has surrounded him as an actor. Many disappointments soon followed (including the sequel to this pale film), but this does not diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is intelligently written and directed. Some Moore scenes have been forced into drunkenness, and parts of the film are volatile, but the actors do a lot of tasting, it's a tough film to resist. He has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winning John Gilgod a fun and dry role as a servant in Arthur, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and has a miraculous relationship. Lisa Minelli (as an interest in blue love) is a slut in a low key and a screeching, but skillful and vital; never getting rid of Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this document which represents a high professional point we cherish. *** from ****
