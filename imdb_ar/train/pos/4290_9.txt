I think Charlotte Ginsburg is one of the best artists in the world. I can not understand why some say it is not. boring....??? Maybe the person who said it's boring because he / she is boring. She was a great actress and the film was excellent. It has a lot of wonderful ideas and very good performance. The direction was wonderful. I photograph myself in the French environment with all the sophistication, perfume, flowers, churches, problems, and so on. When you go to the sister store they are simply amazing. everything is great. Our representative is very good, wonderful, for a long time. Alan Chapp and Bernadette Lafon are idealists. I love him more than in his next film LA SCIENCE DES RVVES. Eric Lartega did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Anna
