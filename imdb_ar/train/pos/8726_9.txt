Now this is what a family movie should be! There are a few films in recent years that targeted families or children who deserve to be seen by the public; but this is one of them. My entire family came out of the movie, horrified, enjoyed, spicy and happy. We still quote a few tales from here and there. We loved the kids as well as we did (hubby and I 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> Regardless of the beautiful and amazing animations, the characters (as small as they may be, as imaginative as they are) are very sophisticated. There is not one of them you can not sympathize with. The characters that bring these little creatures to life are amazing vocal talents, along with the skill and art of some of the best Disney artists. It's a movie worth Walt Disney itself. I think Mr. Disney will strongly agree to this new film ... Flick and Dot and his colleagues may become popular little heroes like Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is a family member who leaves the theater willing to see him again .. and bought the property on the video or DVD. I am keen to see him again .. to pick up what I missed the first time. (I have never seen my children so quickly and clearly identify the characters and embrace them before ... My daughter is still talking about a little "Dot".) This movie is funny, sad, intelligent and great fun for the entire family!
