Torrent was the first and last film of Greta Garbo. It was her first American-made film at MGM, the only studio in the United States where she would work. The last time someone else's bill was issued was in the credits, being the leading man, Riccardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> BitTorrent is based on the work of the famous Spanish writer Entre Naranjos. It is a pair of adorable lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can not meet together, mostly because of the machinations of Cortez Marta Matox's mother. <br /> <br /> Mattox is a wicked woman who has some ideas about who should marry her son. Remember that this is Spain, and such marriages arranged even at those times were quite appropriate. Mattox looked at Gertrude Olmstead in her smith, the offspring of Mack Swain, a man who grew up rich in raising pigs. Swain offers a few moments of comic satisfaction with his keen interest in small pigs before he turns into large old pigs to be slaughtered. <br /> <br /> Blanco Ibanez had previous novels The Four Horseman Of The Apocalypse and Blood And Sand previously filmed with Rudolph Valentino in the lead. It may have been interesting to have Valentino do this with Garbo, but he may have been behind filmmaking when it was done. Anyway, one of the artists Valentino Ricardo Cortez fills the male lead. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why Valentino does not want this film is that it is clear that the character of the lead is the image of Garbo, unlike the other two acts mentioned earlier. When Cortés finishes what she tells him Matox and her bank "Chancellor" Tali Marshall, she leaves Spain and goes to France where she becomes a great opera star. And lead largely to scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When you return to Spain and try to revive things, Mattox is very angry. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortés is now working on the Spanish parliament, which calls for the so-called Curtis. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the flood and breaking of the dam that causes all sorts of havoc in the countryside. Cortez is actually brave borrent in a straight boat in an attempt to save Garbo from the path of harm. When they meet with each other, they have a wild and brutal discussion, coming from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here are primitive, although they now look very impressive for their time. It is very similar to the footage used in the 20th century Fox's The Rains Came, which won an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately for Torrent, it was introduced one year before Oscar was first introduced. <br /> <br /> I will not give any ends, so you'll have to watch the movie to see if Cortez and Garbo meet at the end. Garbo has won the right reviews of her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures were the norm in the silent representation of the screen, she was remarkably hidden in her role. So she will be the rest of her career, and she has a wonderful face for close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo will continue to do a much better job than BitTorrent, this film is still her first appearance on the big American screen and is very well disrupted for today's audience.
