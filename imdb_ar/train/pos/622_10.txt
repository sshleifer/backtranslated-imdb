Although I do not consider myself a great fan of fairy tales, Stardust was based on Michel Pfeiffer's vision of the trailers as a villain (especially when I was about to see her as the head of Vila Von Tussle in Herseysbury). Hey boy, are she wickedly disguised here as a witch, especially with her ugly makeup at the beginning and the end! Robert De Niro is also wonderful as the commander of the pirates who had to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Around all actors like Claire Danis, Robert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, and many others are doing a good job here. While the Danes and Pfeiffer are of classic beauty, there are also amazing faces for Siena Miller and Olivia Grant (as a girl Bernard) and Kate Maguan especially when we first met her. Newcomer Charlie Cox was fine like Major Tristan, and was quite similar to his father Duncan as a young man I thought was in early scenes with Maguain (actually Ben Barnes). I compared many of these comments to The Princess Bride and while I can see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just a fictional story as an old man told his grandson. Stardust often believes that what you see and hear could actually happen even with all the joy that happens all the time. So on this note, I strongly recommended Stardust.
