I have heard that this film was good from many of my friends who have seen it, and they all said it was great, so I had very high expectations, and Nancy Drew exceeded those expectations! It contained funny parts. It kept me fun with events and all the men tried to kill her. Emma Roberts was amazing like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good, too. Definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys were trying to kill us ?!" Corky: "Yes, I was wondering that too." In fact, I've been pushed to a crawl somewhat!
