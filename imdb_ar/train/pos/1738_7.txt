This is a hilarious movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star signing sponsorship contract with Chicken Pit Restaurants in Ned Beatty. The contract contains all kinds of offensive sentences, such as forcing Bert to wear a chicken suit during the race! Jim Napurs is a great mechanic (uncluttered). Loni Anderson (Oh, yes!) Was appointed by Beatty to keep Reynolds faithful and strictly abide by the contract. This funny film proves that Bert is not very proud. I love that!
