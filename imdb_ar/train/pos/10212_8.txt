This entire film deserves to be seen only for the last wonderful moment - it's the best end to any film I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> I found this movie sarah, even with something very deep with French meanings. I loved him - it's a wonderful love story. I liked the way the Algerians were woven - by the way, the music during the final credits is fantastic. I want the CD!
