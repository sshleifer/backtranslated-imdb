I used to write comments on IMDb, but I did not do that anymore. It happens that IMDb has become enormous, so the personal has destroyed dozens. What do I mean that anyone who is not particularly fond of movies and has no experience on this subject sees some waste (or vice versa) and, if he likes it, delivers 10, if he does not go to 1. Of course, Right. Now for the movie. I really regret that I've delivered ten films for a few films, because I have to record this movie with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This documentary contains something I never expect to see again in my life in any other film. It is simply charming, not just a way of saying; it really is. The last 25 minutes have a lot of energy, visual joy and wisdom - words spoken by the men featured in the tournament - that's really ... there is no possible match. I do not keep movies, I rarely find any sense in doing so, but this is the kind of movie you should buy and keep, and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times over the years. I have nothing to say. This is real, goal 10 for me.
