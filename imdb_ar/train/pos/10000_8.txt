Homelessness (or homelessness, as George Carlin said) has been a problem for years, but it has never been a plan to help those on the street who were once humane who did everything from going to school or working or voting for it. Most people believe that displaced people are just a losing cause while worrying about things like racism, war on Iraq, pressure on children to succeed, technology, elections, inflation, or anxiety if they finally get to the street. . <br /> <br /> But what if you received a bets to live in the streets for a month without the luxuries that you enjoyed from home, entertainment, bathroom, photos on the wall, computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it was like to be Shelter? This is the lesson of Goddard Bolt. <br /> <br /> Miles Brooks (who runs) plays the role of starring while Bolt plays the role of a rich man who has everything in the world until he decides to bet on Sisi's rival (Jeffrey Tambour) to see if he can live on the streets for thirty days without If Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project to build more buildings. Bet on where Bolt is thrown in the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor every move he has where he can not get off the sidewalk. He was given the title of Bepto by a vagabond after writing on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters, including a woman named Molly (Leslie Ann Warren), a former dancer who got divorced before she lost her home, and her colleagues sailor (Howard) Morris and the fumes (Teddy Wilson) Already on the streets. They are survivors. Bolt is not. He was not used to mutual agreements as he once did when he was rich in a place where he was fighting, fleeing, killing or killing. <br /> <br /> While the love relationship between Molly and Bolt was not necessary for planning, "Life Stinks" was found to be one of Mel Brooks's committed films, before comedy is considered to be a thin aspect of his comic work, such as Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs. Something precious before losing it the next day or on the other hand doing a stupid proof like all the rich do when they do not know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopolistic money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie will inspire you to help others.
