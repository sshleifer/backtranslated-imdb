I've captured this movie for some time, partly because of the very high score here on the IMDb - AVG 9.0 with more than 300 votes giving it the highest rating for any silent movie accessible! How did I not hear this movie before this site? Well, you can not always trust the labels. It's actually a very good film, well maintained if the good VHS transfer I hired is an indication of it - excellent acting by directors, especially William Haines as Brown, good work in Cambridge with some wonderful shots at the Harvard Climate / Yale football game - But the story must sound like a loud noise even in 1926. A repulsive, self-centered, attractive young man goes to school and is put in place, becoming a sincere friend of self-sacrifice in this process; I suspect that people in 1926 found much that was really exciting. The last few pulleys, the predictor factor is high. However, it starts very well and is certainly worth remembering, if not a compliment to heaven. Perhaps the 350 former voters are mostly Harvard University men. <br /> <br /> Now more than 600 voters have been released and the score has already risen to 9.2! Seriously, folks, there is stuffing at the polls here - I challenge anyone to explain why this movie is better than "Metropolis" or "General"!
