In two and a quarter hours, this film is thought to be slow and sometimes intersected by the sword's vast battles. The battle between darkness and light shows a constant determination of the incandescent sun and is beautifully illustrated by a tripartite battle between "demons", bandits and soldiers in a forest during the eclipse. <br /> <br /> Be prepared: After fighting the stunning sword under the lightning sky filled with the end of this image will make you scratch your head in confusion.
