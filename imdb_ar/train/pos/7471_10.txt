Despite the excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting to be disappointed by the film because I heard that it did not get great ratings. However, she has left the cinema completely in awe of Vanilla Sky's quality. <br /> <br /> There was absolutely no bad behavior at all in the entire film, each character is believable. The romantic moments between Cruz's character, David Iames and Cruise character, Sophia are realistic and intimate (perhaps due to the fact that they are close to real life). <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky's plot will be confused in the last third of the film and there is little chance of guessing the end. However, the ends are eventually linked, leaving you with a strange mixture of emotions consisting of sadness, shock and sympathy with David Aames. <br /> <br /> The film is thought and you have to pay attention to it all the time. This is not difficult, because the opportunities will attract your attention completely to the film and will not close your eyes on the screen for one second. <br /> <br /> I usually let the cinema forget everything about a movie I just watch. But Vanilla Sky is still in my mind days after seeing it. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change from simple shallow movies.
