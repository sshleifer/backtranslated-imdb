The stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed with losing perspective and common sense. The evil magician approaches him and tells him that he can give him a fortune that he can use to win a woman's heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants in their room. The stupid guy agrees and steals the magician's reflection of the man outside the mirror - and bad things happen naturally as a result. <br /> <br /> If this movie was produced a decade later, I'm sure I would not have been too charitable in reviewing and recording this movie. After all, the film plot is a bit vague in spots and representation, sometimes, slightly receded. However, when you think that the films "full length" in 1913 were rare - often take a long time of only 20 to 30 minutes! In addition, the full idea of ​​a complex story like you in this film is an extraordinary idea - where the stories were very short and widely represented. So, given the time constraints, this movie is very good and is one of the previous horror movies known.
