Red Rock West is one of the narrow thriller films we rarely see anymore. It is a good pace, well behaved, and does not leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions of this kind. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage plays stars while Michael, unemployed from Texas unemployed, is desperate enough to drive the car all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is sincere in error, but always on the dark side of destiny. <br /> <br /> After failing to get a lucrative job, Michael stumbles at the Red Rock bar where the owner, JTWalsh, makes a mistake because of the contract killer who was summoned from Dallas and hired by his beautiful but deadly wife Susan (Lara Flynn Boyle). <br /> <br /> Wayne Michael Michael gives the necessary details and a reduced amount for the blow she received on the prostitute Susie. With no intention of follow-up, Michael accepts the money and then sets off to warn Susan of her impending demise. He also sends a letter to the local dean exposing the plot and divisions. <br /> <br /> As destiny fills, Michael will not get away with it. As he was leaving in a violent rainstorm, Suzanne ran running down. Michael Michael, of course, takes him to the local hospital where he is found to have been shot as well. <br /> <br /> The police chief was called, and fortunately Wayne is also local law. Michael managed to escape while doing that last flight, and was then picked up by the real "Lyle from Dallas" which was played with deadly joy by twisted Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they are fellow Marines, Lyle insists that Michael joined him for a drink at, and anywhere else, the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake, and soon he and Lyle chase with Michael who voluntarily falls into Susan awaiting his arms. <br /> <br /> As the speed progresses, we learn that Win and Susan are really wanted for two armed thieves, for Lamm for stealing millions of dollars. Getting money is now the focus of films with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murder. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. Nicholas Cage was usually in a low level, and Denis Hooper and Lara Flynn Polley each had more than one ability. It was the best performance by the late GT Walsh who was threatening without appearing. Walsh was a wonderful representative of the personality that left us very early. <br /> <br /> Marc Richuskis has used many unique angles to add to the thrill and plot development. The film was enhanced by John Dahl's narrow output style and the quick release of Maurice Chestnut.
