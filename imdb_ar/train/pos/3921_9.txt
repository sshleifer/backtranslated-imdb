In Carmen, Sora is once again seeking to create a dynamic relationship between reality and fantasy, and the actual feelings of the characters in the dance company, which is the choreography of the dance parts of Carmen's opera and the textual sensations of the fictional Carmen, the famous killer of free spirit (read ignore ignorance) Men are crazy with desire. Saura used this fictional car in a previous Black and White film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But while the tensions between dancers who train on the blood wedding have shown the advantage of how they evolved into fictional characters of the story to be performed by directing their emotions to their roles, in Carmen, in parallel between the statues of small fat dancers of the dancers during rehearsals and the spirit of shaping the legendary Carmen relationship Never approaching being a rat. Remains a tool, and for this reason, annoying distraction. One really needs to see the blood wedding next to Carmen to estimate the comparison. However, it does not matter, melodrama tries to impose on Carmen, because flamenco dance and guitar rehearsals - which represent 95% of the film - through some of the best flamenco dancers and musicians, are more than paying for entry. The film is flawed, wonder: perfect to do a workout in the "negative Kits ability," perhaps?
