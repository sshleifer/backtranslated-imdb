I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love watching it together. He knows good old values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). It's also really fun to make fun of ... you know and return and insert your dialog box, instead of actors. <br /> <br /> I have a DVR set to record all episodes and I picked up the tail end of the loop (before starting the next episode directly ... so I do not know what the loop is) but there was a very terrible sequence error! Adam Chery gave Kofi a small group of "skins", torn from the coat of some outlaws while trying to spend his escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy had the coat, so he put it on his desk and put the rack in a torn place. The pregnant woman was completely rectangular ... I think it would be almost impossible to cut off a piece of leather (Naugahyde after 1950? Yes ... leather? I do not think so). Well, the rack is perfectly lined and the puzzle has been solved. <br /> <br /> After 10 seconds on the scene, we see the casing again, still lying at Roy's table. But this time it looks like a North Carolina pregnant woman and is now in a completely different place on the cover (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the case) and the touch (which smoked in the middle of Swatch) is gone now ... as is the seam in the coat. I enjoyed my daughter laughing while we played the short scene again and again! It's essential for youtube, and I tell you! <br /> <br /> We still love the presentation completely and the serialization errors make it very fun!
