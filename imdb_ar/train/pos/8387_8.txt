This first part of the BRD trilogy contains more passion and intensity than Lola's plot, but less than the fascination of Veronica Voss. Political reflections: We see shortages after the war and how the owners of the supermarkets can control a lot of everyday life (a delicious moment when Vasbender, who plays a volatile role, sells a whole set of Kleist to Chigula, who notes that burning books does not save much Of warmth: she really wants firewood). <br /> <br /> There is some folly in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, must become faster. The train scene when you meet Maria Carl Oswald falls when you insult the GI - I stumbled, it was so bad. But as the story unfolded and as the years went by, I was drawn more and more to this brilliant, cold world.
