This film features intelligent cinematic techniques where, instead of landscapes that attract the attention of the camera, they are simple details about how someone appears, how a woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrapped in paper. How can a husband wear a hat, socks, shoes and his underwear and both seem quite comfortable and comfortable. How provocative is another feature of the director's choice to tell us that she is a free spirit through sexual intercourse and aims to get her pleasure without courting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what a man might feel. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is an open issue in which you can not be late, you do not feel ashamed of how you behave and you want to share these facts with it because its primary focus is always on the reality of their marriage. Nothing and no one can come between the two. Only the chances of fate are to intervene --- his imprisonment during the war and the next after his return. Very intriguing film which is completely absorbed.
