The director of fascism, Miss Tugar (Marie and Ronov, portrayed by expert photographer Dean Cond√© as if she were ten feet tall) had a plan to turn her square in full. There are complications that challenge this goal in Riff Randell (PJ Soles, which lights up the screen - she is also a celebrity) and is a fan of the obsession of the evil band RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose large glasses and Nordic role can hide her stunning beauty) collaborates with Riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of rock'n'roll for Good, the desired Togar mission. <br /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten plays such a wonderful role as Tom Roberts, who has been successful in everything but has been sacked. Kate is crazy from Tom ... if he can just pull his head out of the sand and see him. Clint Howard steals the film almost (honestly, who can steal the film away from the soles?) As Eaglebauer, the "provider" who can get almost anything for everyone. His office is located in the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also a hilarious music teacher who becomes an ally of the countryside when he enjoys a concert from The Ramones. <br /> <br /> A noisy secondary school adventurer defying all the rules of normal life .. and loved him. It seems like someone says, "Let's make life enjoyable for an hour and a half." The film is in fact a mess. Less chaos is a love of the Ramon with all its heart (even if they are terrible actors, they have a chance to gain new fans with this film). <br /> <br /> It ends up pretty much summing up the film as a whole .. Reeve and her classmates are taking high school and starting one huge ceremony. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! Not traditionally in any way, this film just let us lose frenzy. This film is accompanied by some great rock music featuring some of the best of the Rammons, allowing viewers to take time in life when the war did not dominate headlines and people were having fun. Those, I think were the days.
