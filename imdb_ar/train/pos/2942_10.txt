Haha !!! It was a very funny delirium .. I was in tears. Eddie Mervez's impressions are immediate. The best impression was on James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It is strange how Eddie Murphy was at that time and how he is now sick, but you should not see the obscene language and do not see it but it is very funny and funny .. I have seen it 6/7 times and still urinate myself every time .. This is Eddie Murphy Prime, you can see where he got the sense of humor and ideas of films such as Professor Josephi of. He does impressions of his family too, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> If you are only there ...
