A friend lent me this DVD, which I got from the director at the festival, I think. I warned that some of the technical aspects of the film were a bit fragile and the writing was good but not fantastic. So maybe that's colorful for my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> The most prominent positions where the actors. Joseph Karkour was as good as Ernie, the main character, and pathetically kind. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lin were as excellent as their roommates who led Ernie's madness. The character of Bill (Justin Lin), who spends much of the film wearing a panda, is my favorite; he seemed the least distant, and reminded me of his old college buddy that I called the man after watching a DVD. Really kind of loved, very funny. Some other acting was good, others were good, but none was bad. I also really love the attentive duo. Funny and funny. <br /> <br /> I give these high marks, although they have some problems, because you can tell when you watch them that these people are interested and decided to make their movie on their way. Well done to Adam Jones and his crew.
