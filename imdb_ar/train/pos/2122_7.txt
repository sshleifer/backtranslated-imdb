Back in the day of the Great Studio System, the most spectacular casting decisions were made. All American James Stewart has shown up as a shopkeeper at The Shop Around The Corner. If I were to take the film, it would have been a perfect part of Charles Boer. His accent mixed with all other European dialects was nothing. Stewart faced some of the same problem in Mortal Storm as well with Margaret Solavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullivan was his most popular master on screen, with four films. But this is only where none of them die. Solavan and her husband, Leland Hayward, knew of Stuart's return on the day he was a player in New York. In fact, Solavan's husband was a good friend of Stuart Henry Fonda at the time. <br /> <br /> I think Clark Gable is the only one who could have tolerated being an American in a group of non-Americans in Tamini on the Ponte. Stuart in the Mortal Storm was Germany, but all the other players were also American, so there was nothing. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stuart, you'll see a great film by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is very simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest are not in person. But they seem to be communicating with some anonymous fans who are turning to each other. Frank Morgan also suspects that Stuart was wrong with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although potential clients are fine and Frank Morgan is leaving himself, the players who scored best were Felix Presart and Joseph Childcrawt. Presarte enjoys my favorite moments in the film when he begins after Morgan begins asking people what they think. It makes itself very rare. <br /> <br /> Joseph Childcrawt, who is always good, is as great as the tricky little worm that kisses Frank Morgan constantly. You really hate people like that. I've known a lot of people like Childcrawt in real life who are in the policy office 24 hours a day. Sadly it pays off well.
