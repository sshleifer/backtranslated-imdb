Animation always seems to be a fringe. In Japan, this may not be the case, but in Europe and much more in the animation of the United States marked by "KIDS" big fat. France is probably one of the most liberal liberal countries, home to classics such as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon, etc. (If you have never read it, it is not too late. Marvel) looks like a natural movie like this one pops up in France. It suits my biased image of the French as art-loving and anti-American filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also a "dark scanner" out there to suppress this view - it seems that art is largely universal. <br /> <br /> Anyway, because you may have brought together the Renaissance artistry and France. If you are a layman, you will be afraid of this. There is no need for it however! Under this gentle atmosphere and elegant shaded look, there is a good film and a good film in general. <br /> <br /> This was one of my fears for this film. Extremely easy to transform stunning animation into a gimmick, just like Sony & C: o do with Pixar Piano. I expected a film that was confusing and boring at times and not very attractive, but fortunately I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have enjoyed it anyway for things close to Noir, but it was good that it was worth it as well. PS I have seen French Descriptions which was "OK" as far as I can see. English may be more interesting with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> The last word of praise for animation. It was awesome. Futuristic, well-designed and nice in camera work and smart solutions (eyes for example look very good, hard to do) and visually stunning I felt like I was exploding "This is very impressive!". Then again, I really like the animation, and I appreciate the effort the studio has made, so my opinion is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> A good movie anyway, definitely lives beyond the "gimmick".
