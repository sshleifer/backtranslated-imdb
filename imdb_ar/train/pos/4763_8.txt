Unlike other comments, I found this movie great, even with all his mistakes and the zombie actions of some actors. <br /> <br /> Being technically, I found that experiments interesting and realistic devices. Although reading the minds of people across the computer looks fantastic, it is now being tested to do so. I will note that these experiences are still in their very early stages, although the results are not yet favorable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie are good. The girl, though slightly overstated, looks stupidly appropriate. The trucker is a rider for real truck drivers. The minister raises suspicion at first. (The principal investigator tells the minister that he is not sure if he believes that God created man or that man created God, but the moment the chips fell, his faith returned. Only the doctor plays zombie. , And the secrets that harbor them are appropriately suited to their characters, and in the face of death they interact like real humans. <br /> <br /> The film is a warning against the dangers of unrestricted surveillance by the government. In many exciting films, the film does not enjoy enough excitement , Is a scientific exercise with the philosophical foundations.
