Four stories written by Robert Bloch about the various people living in an old beautiful palace and what happens to them. The first has Dinholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he writes about comes to life. Some nervous moments and evolution in the end was good. Peter Kuching became obsessed with a personality resembling his dead wife. The third has Christopher Lee who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of them. All this leads to a very scary end (although the end of the story was much worse). The latter is a comprehensive comedy with John Pettoy and Ingrid Pitt (both of them mocking the scene) and the head turns people into vampires! There is also a nice line around Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good anthology about horror - nothing scary but the first one and the end of the third gave me a little cold. Also the fourth is actually very funny and the house makes a very sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks nice ... and very creepy. It is well oriented with some wonderful weather touches. The film degree is very good and very unusual. All in all a good little horror selection worth exploring. Try to see it on a DVD - Lions Gate one looks great with powerful colors and a fantastic sound.
