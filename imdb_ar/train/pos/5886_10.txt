Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper are still able to turn the world with their smile. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars makes this combination of hard work / the beginning of the new film. Watch it and look forward to hitting sixty! Mary defies community-oriented young people with wit and charm. Add a touch of 2000 realistic drama. Follow-up to the TV series will expand the new characters and give us a chance to see Lou Grant, Felice, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette sometimes!
