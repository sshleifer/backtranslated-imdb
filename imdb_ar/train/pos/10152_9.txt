I've been looking forward to seeing this since I first saw it in her work. I finally found it yesterday on 2/13/2002 on Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson comments on this subject as "a sweet funny story about two people crossing the corridors" died. Perhaps the authors should not be rewarded, but everyone should make the film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic film should see it. <br /> <br /> Natasha's presence on the screen is very warm and her smile is very strong, to say nothing of her beauty, and that anything you enter is listed on my favorite list. Her interviews on television and the publications I've seen are just the same and worth looking for. <br /> <br /> God bless her and her family and her future endeavors. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to be available on DVD or video yet, but I'll be the first to buy it and I think others will.
