Kiera Nightly moved straight from P & P to this motion picture ... it was hard for her to choose to reshape her image in a more dramatic way. She has achieved great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in the classic Jane Austen film, she is once again "going". Just like the woman who fights the bikini in King Arthur is more muscular, it's hard to imagine the sensitive frame that stands in front of the life of the reward hunters ... But that's exactly what Domino Harvey (real) did, I think (being one of Nightly's biggest fans) Holds the shutdown state. <br /> <br /> Stuff .... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (For the non-American world) is the zip code of Beverly Hills in Los Angeles, where all movie stars live. * The most famous film of Domino Harvey was the Manchurian candidate (shown in the film). * Domino Harvey died of an overdose of drugs in her bathroom before the film was shown in June 2005 after she was arrested for drug trafficking. She had just finished negotiating some of her music to include in the film. * Keira Knightley hints at the sexual life of Domino Harvey in her interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie a bit elusive, you'll see Domino Harvey, because the facts are more exciting than fiction.
