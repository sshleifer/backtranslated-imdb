I saw this movie as a child and broke my heart! There was no other story that was not over yet ... I grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favorite things, because it was unusual - a story about injustice, cruelty, loneliness, life and irreversible choices, and the need for others. Shirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf alone, when Shirin follows him on the mountain. The wolf does not kill the lamb, though he says every night, "Maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." The bar of it has broken and crashed old and used. I'll fix it and watch the movie again someday and cry as much as I did when I was a kid. Such stories, with such depth and feeling, complexity of meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I did not see any more beautiful venting. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a child.
