This film was one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years and laughter from the public support me. Not since my big wedding ceremony in Greece (2002), the laughter was spontaneous and intense. Is easily characterized by Mr. Smith (2005) in his use of irony (espionage in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Director Ivan Retman The balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and frankly ridiculous is great. No serious trauma and seriousness breaking the rule of comedy. At the same time, this romantic comedy is not expected to lose its emotional elements even if the end has been broadcast in advance. In some ways, it's obviously wonderful to see how racing. As in real life, the truth is sometimes so obvious that one can not really see it. Easily eight out of ten stars arranged with Tutsi (1982). Maybe nine (depending on how it appears in the second show).
