No message. Not symbolic. There are no dark currents. Just a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia, and good fun put it on people who obviously had a wonderful time doing it. It is the refreshing antidote to some of the buzz of the studios. Of course anything with Judy Dench is incomparable worth watching. The wonderful jazz from Cleo Lane is a bonus. This lady in the same league as the late Ella. This runs on my film rack to be pulled back at any time I feel the need for a warm experience and a good chuckle. Just a great movie!
