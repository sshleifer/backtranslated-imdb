This one is a very nice surprise. A nice little story of the heroine's quest, a very surprising transformation of the four-eye type quickly supplied to a sexual queen DD-cup. <br /> <br /> Visually a sight of the painful eye, not only for two absolutely stunning representatives but also (for most) costumes and makeup for the actors. A little unnecessary cost came in a ridiculous tradition of the castle. <br /> <br /> Back to Pros: The movie is delightful with some unusual camera shots you do not expect in a soft core. I like this scene with snowflakes, absolute classical potential. A slight negative only for the very few exotic scenes where bad behavior by small sects stopped the suspension of kufr soon. <br /> <br /> 9/10, including an additional balance on the impact of dangerous draining.
