In the barbarians and geisha, John Wayne plays the role of Townsend Harris, a real envoy from the United States who was responsible for the actual opening up of Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Prior to that, Commodore Berry pushed Japan mainly by using warships and imposing a treaty on the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived shortly afterwards, processed the details and helped ensure compliance - as many Japanese did not feel any specific inclination to honor the first treaty . All this is true and appears in the film. According to some other sources I have found, the romance between Harris and Jisha is mostly fantasy, and this romance is a big part of the focus in this film (hence, title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction The first time I saw this movie was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat ?! When he is a diplomat in most films, please say and thank you because he shakes people !!! So seeing him play a man who is not a man of movement and able to play the diplomatic game seems very strange. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more peculiar in this role. By the way, I saw pictures of Harris and Wayne that do not resemble him at all in practice. <br /> <br /> However, although the story takes many liberties to the truth and the strange sound, the film is still very tight. Cinematography beautiful color, the film shows some nice ideas about Japanese culture and customs and representation is not bad. All in all, a grainy film is famous though it is strange. <br /> <br /> PS - Read through the trivia of this movie. You can learn more about real life characters in addition to the presumed fight between Win and the director (John Houston) where Wayne was apparently kicked !! Based on what I read about Huston and the way he treated with the actors, this is an accident I tend to believe. It is also a wonderful example of John Wayne's "diplomacy."
