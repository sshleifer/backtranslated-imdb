"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham," according to ordinary fans, expecting to snatch another Snatch / Lock stock; there are likely to be a few time shifts, but nothing "hard for me and the boys" to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Oh, watch out, you need to watch this movie. There are no cups of tea, no extra diet from the counter, no shouting "Keep running" as you shiver to the fridge - Watch the movie! Do not laugh other than those who might make them out of great violence (and if that floats your boat, let it be) but the sharp strong trend, excellent dialogue, and wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> My favorite - Big Pussy of soprano, always a reliable cover.
