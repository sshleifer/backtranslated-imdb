Do you really like comedies or do you like "wedding lovers" if the answer is to stop reading now? I can not believe this film is not rated higher. Basically Meadows plays a character no different from Austin Powers. There are many innovative moments in this Jaguarama. From the rudeness - Leon plays with himself on the balcony, cheating the former friend in eating. . Oh, okay. To crazy sex crazy, Broadway routine, voice over. The meadows are as large as a childish Leon, but very sweet to Leon. Some great lines "do not blame Wang" "my sex world is terrible" a lot. . . Why this film was not huge is a mystery. Great comedy.
