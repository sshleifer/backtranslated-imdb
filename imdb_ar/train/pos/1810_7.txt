I can understand why some people like this movie, and why some people do not. For me, although I really liked it, even if I noticed some good pieces, not some impressive bits. The animation was already excellent, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, best known as Anne Marie, which was expressed by the late Judith Parsi. (I was physically ill when I read what happened to her) Also, Carvis is a very convincing villain, especially via Vic Tiepak (I especially liked the "Morons I Surrounded Morons") and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat are probably the most wicked Forget about Don Donuth. Charlie and Eichi only lacked the same glamor, but I loved King Gator and his songs. Some movies are very disturbing, such as Anabel's film "You Can Never Return", which scares me. Unfortunately, there were some bits I did not like very much. The story tended to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney Blackboard suffered the same problem. There were also some dark scenes, which would find annoying little children, but the end was very moving. However the biggest drawback was the rather nice songs and the way they sung. Not one of them specifically, except "let's make music together" and "love the survivors", and Bert Reynolds can not sing and Dom Dwayce sang better. All in all, a movie can be seen, it could have been more, but it certainly is memorable and I would definitely see it again. 10/07. Bethany Cox
