As much as I like the great epic pictures - I'll save you the named name - it's great to wear some beer and sometimes simple clicks. The films in which the ground piece takes the back seat to the cutting sets. Films in which the dialogue is not so cleverly written that it connects itself to an endless contract of purple prose. There are hundreds of films that fit the bill ... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the best movies. <br /> <br /> It's an update of the movie that shares his name. It also shares the spirit of that image, but not quite the implementation. Everything that was originally wonderful was simplified. Everything that was streamlined was also enhanced by a larger budget. These types of attempts are often recipes for a complete disaster - see the ugly new version of the "Italian job" of the one who blew it up - but here, thanks to a group of outstanding actors, Stone succeeds. <br /> <br /> A plot and lots of dialogue is not much to write about IMDb. You often have scenes where the same dialogue line turns back and forth between actors, each of whom will express his voice with different deviations. Many people found this annoying. I find it a smile. Each actor gets a chance to show his or her definition here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the package of course (it should also be interesting to see Ms. Pitt not getting the first bill here). Chemistry between the good ol 'Saint Nick (see revision date) and Angelina lead to a few nice moments. <br /> <br /> The villain is not too scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play strong guy roles before, I know he can deal with it, but I think he was deliberately directed to make his role illogical to distract attention from the act. We know that the heroes will somehow succeed; we just sit in the car with them, enjoy the trip. I think many of these scenes have been played so far in the cheek that the head of many people who gave this assessment was bad. In fact, I did not think of some of the winks that surround the fourth wall in the camera: it's just a kind of film. <br /> <br /> All this method is not substance - something that often deplets my patience if not implemented * only * so - it would be worthless if the procedure is not there. For the most part, it is. very wonderful. I have noticed that there seems to be a common trend to use close-up close-ups to direct action these days. Personally I find this kind of stuff exhausting. The best of such films, where stunts are impressive enough for you not to need artificial tension by raping narrow shots all the time. I have been told that Cage has already done a lot of stunts in the car without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character clearly does not care) and this shows. A man can really move a car and this is well used in the slow climatic end as he drives a Mustang to Earth in the most unusual way - and FUN - possible. <br /> <br /> So yes, this film is not "epic, confirming life after 9/11 with mandatory social commentary." The speed is uneven, some scenes could be cut and not all actors pull the line. But car movies rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars ... why do you read these comments?! <br /> <br /> I would take it on the numerous duplicates of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" on any day. 10/07
