You are also at hand for the first show in Toronto. This film was a kind of consolation when I thought I would not be able to enter to see my first choice. Well, I've been blown away completely. By the time I arrived at the theater, I did not remember much about the basic plot of the film (yes, I've already forgotten who was in it). Great offers from the entire staff. Carrie Anne Moss was wonderful in a real departure from her days as a triathlon. For Billie Connolly, I do not think so because Chaplin has a player who plays brilliantly without any lines at all. The children were also wonderful. Definitely check it out if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> By the way, I got to know my first choice anyway and this was the best.
