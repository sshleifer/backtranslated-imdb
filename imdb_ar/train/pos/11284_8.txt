When I was a kid, the time for Lex Parker was Tarzan. I have often heard from seniors that Johnny Wismuller was "Tarzan" and I will not understand the reason since I saw some recent Wismiller movies in personality and I thought it was out of shape. Many years later, Tarzan and his colleague came across, and then I understood that. Weismuller in the form of this picture and his presence and sense seem personal demands that have not yet been matched by other Tarzans such as Parker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Christopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> For this film, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of Jamil Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, mental, self-effacing and "do not stop" woman as Jane was in the times when the film was made (Tarzan pushes her in a naked pool, ; One of the explorers accepts her by surprise, and although she does not accept it, she lets him do little by little to do little); such behaviors were not envisioned with Jennings to come like Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Houston , Or Dorothy Hart, and all of them play some kind of vulnerable women who have had the perfect dessert making N hard to believe that they can Asamadn in a hostile place, such as the African jungle. <br /> <br /> The brilliant O'Sullivan figure steals the show from Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to work and takes Weismuller to the fore easily; a perfect combination. The highlight of the other film is the role of the secondary Chita and not as a main driving force as in the subsequent Tarzan images where the day saves so much. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his colleague stand as a good producer in this kind of film (Tarzan films) and perhaps best, although I must admit that I also enjoyed the "Tarzan's Greatest Adventures" (1959), which was made with a higher budget And a strong support force (although Gordon Scott is accepted only in the leading role through his idealistic physical looks "all gymnasium" that does not suit a rural monkey man). <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her classmate!
