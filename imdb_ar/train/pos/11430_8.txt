Unfortunately, due to the tendency of American viewers to avoid translation, this film did not receive the distribution and attention it deserves. Their hidden themes of belonging, identity and ethnic relations, especially how colonialism affects all parties, go beyond the obvious dramatic tensions, the nostalgic memories of Protestant childhood, and the strangeness of her relationship with her "father," "perhaps the only one." A real person you know. Will not even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope I have given you enough hook to take it, whether you speak French or similar or not. I challenge you to be brave and strong conscious like La P'tite.
