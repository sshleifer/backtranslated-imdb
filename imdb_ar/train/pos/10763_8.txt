I must admit that I was very skeptical in this documentary. I was expecting this kind of American propaganda that we hate here in Europe. I was wrong. This is not propaganda, it is really not political at all. <br /> <br /> It depicts the events of September 11 through the eyes of the firefighters who were called to the scene after the crash. It's an amazing coincidence that this documentary was filmed at all! This film was initially filmed as documents about a rookie New York fireman who became a "man". We can only thank the filmmakers for continuing their work during the terrible ordeal they faced. <br /> <br /> Great work. Very amazing material. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> With my greetings,
