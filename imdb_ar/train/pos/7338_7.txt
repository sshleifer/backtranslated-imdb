Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. The film revolves around a village that was destroyed by a giant glacier that is the house of the evil ice master Nickron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn going to avenge those killed by the glacier. The icy ice moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land called Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn began to find her and also to find the Necron and killed him. Fire and snow are directed by Ralph Bakshi who is one of my favorite adult cartoon. He brought us animated masterpieces like the Fritz The Cat version and some of his self-made films, such as The Big Movie Heavy Traffic. I did not like Fire and Ice almost as much as I did in the other Ralph Bakshi works, but I still find the film interesting. She had some very nice animations in parts and the story was entertaining enough. The only basic complaints I have are that I wish there would be more story for the film because the story used by it is very thin and there is not much. I also wish the movie to be slightly longer because it is less than 80 minutes at run time. Still exciting adventure films that differ from Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic suitable for children aged 8 or older. I just wish there was a more sophisticated story and lasted a little longer than it was.
