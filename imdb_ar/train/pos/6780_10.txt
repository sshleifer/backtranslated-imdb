Coleman's performance is aided by the brilliantly written script. In the 1930s and 1940s, huge Hollywood studios copied some elements of German expressive films and incorporated them into Hollywood films. Very good use of shade, light and silhouette. I really liked the scene in which Coleman lights up in his dressing room near the beginning of the film and begins to read Othello while his face becomes dark and chastity instantly. Already the viewer sees the text and drama of Shakespeare getting "Tony" and going on a journey of torment. I also enjoyed the scene of tragic death in the play, when he became overwhelmed by passion and strangled his photographer so accidentally that it was too hard to bear. Her pleadings "Tony Stops You Hurting Me" are scary and confused. You just do not know if he will go over the top and kill her at any moment. The cat and mouse hunt was added to detect the killer well through two thirds of the way through the movie to add some speed faster and to add the narrative element to the movie. A brilliant work by George Kokur. He's like a skillful manager. An excellent movie is very bad, they do not do what they used to do ...
