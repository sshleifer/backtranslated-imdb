(Spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I was not sure what to think about the film. Not a lot of film for children. It must certainly be monitored with a parent because it includes death and death. But I was surprised that I enjoyed it a bit. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed because of 81 minutes of time we spent. (Even less without balances) and trailer make you think that rodents are a major creature. But unfortunately they torture him. Right until the end of the film. These two gags danced the movie 2 stars. But I recommend the film. So for the sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Reboot: 7/10
