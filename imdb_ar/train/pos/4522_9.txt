I was surprised by this because I was often disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past, but he gained an ideal balance in this performance, avoiding both the farce and the pity while presenting true humor and emotions. Julie Waters is always wonderful here, and anyone who has not yet seen it in the Rita Reading 1983 should immediately rent it (a wonderful movie). The other supporting characters are also played well, many eccentricly superb without passing over the top. This one is fun.
