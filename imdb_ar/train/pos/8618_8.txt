Pop Test: You are part of the modern armed forces in peacetime in routine maneuvers and find yourself exhausted in time with the chance to change history. What do you do? Well, if you're from Hollywood Studios, you're changing Japanese data in GII. Samurai (aka Timeslip) to a US aircraft carrier, ask them to discuss stopping the attack on Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes and then go home and hope nobody will remind you that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this Sony Chiba movie. But unlike its counterpart in Hollywood, the final countdown, this sees its hypothesis: by deferring 400 years of feudal war, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope for return is to provoke history by trying to change it by joining one Warlords. To invade the country? Cue a lot of tanks and helicopters versus samurai action, including a relentless 25-minute battle series characterized by thousands of casts causing serious damage to each other. And yes, there is a head cut. <br /> <br /> Of course, things are not going as planned, and even the superior firepower does not hold up as expected to thousands of soldiers. Even before that, soldiers will fall with each other to those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and plunder their hell. Soft rock music and rural and western songs have been surprisingly impressive and impressive, especially when English lyrics are sung by Japanese singers who can not pronounce words, let alone speak the language, but it is a blemish in a surprisingly good science fiction actor. <br /> <br /> Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of the 138-minute unbroken version.
