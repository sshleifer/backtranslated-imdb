This movie is very good ... Yes some parts lame and exceptionally comfortable, the film does not really justify the big stars (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Minon (not to be confused with KK singer). In the scene where he met Amitabh for the first time, I thought that the man who could just look at AB, stare at him, do not say a word, and still look strong, is certainly a good actor. In fact, he has proved himself worthy again in Sarkar, along with AB for the second time. This man should get more roles, he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> If you have read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, then you already know the plot, and I agree that Akshay Khana's entry into Pakistan was a little too easy. The little corner of love he shared with "what is her face" was absolutely unnecessary. But he is a fairly good actor (as described in DCH), Dutt Sunjay is wonderful to watch always. And ab ... what can i say. I do not know if you're one of the biggest fans in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the place. <br /> <br /> It is an interesting hour, considering it to be Bollywood, although it is somewhat inspired by old Hollywood songs. Such as the Great Escape and the Bridge on the Kwai River.
