The show was a milestone in American comedy where it was the first comedy series to star all African actors sadly that it was not widely published on British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African family living in a tower building. Dad is called James, trying to run the house, but his wife Florida is always improving. The three children are the artistic JJ and the Thelma mood and the young intellectual child Michael. I always go back to the house, an arid Florida friend and Willa. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of this show on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and the Evans Family - the only only 2 on the site). You might consider why a viewer saw an English series that was barely shown or heard about in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, the British first came out of the black sitcom, "The Fosters," which produced only two series and now seems forgotten. But I saw a ring and was really impressed. Then I learned that the texts were identical to "Good Times". The same characters were different names - Sam Foster was the father and his wife Pearl Foster and the three children were Sonny (young Lenny Henry) and Shirley and Benjamin. A friend of Pearl was a movie gossip. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote a review about it). While watching Good Times, I was only bothered by two things. The first thing was the theme of the opening tone (awful) and secondly the audience laughed. I like audience laughter, but in this someone says a funny little line and the audience will get mad and start clapping. Apart from that it was a very funny show. Let's hope that more episodes will be played on youtube, and hopefully someone will release "The Fosters" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Sex and the Evans family- Series 1 episode 6. The Fosterer of the episode was called Sex in the Black Community. The other episode I saw, Black Jesus was the title of one episode of "The Fosters"
