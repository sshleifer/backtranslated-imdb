Overwhelmed by "Braveheart" released the same year, two costume drama begging compared. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, yet I maintain a logical preference for Rob Roy. Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" portray Scottish history in a bloody and romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic paean for individual honor, courage and fantasy revenge fine. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and muddleen. Notice its use for slow-motion volleyball. Its violence is ugly and glorious. It is the last quality that makes it more attractive to teenagers. While the film "Braveheart" "Rob Roy" goes beyond the levels of intense carnage (not to mention the time when it is a loose play), the last film is more mature and satisfying at the end. Its work is too short, but it is more surprising and smart. Her sex is less flashy, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a romantic interest better realized. His dialogue tries to round the poetry of the period. Its rotten teeth in the mouths of actors are trying to bring dentistry to the age. Tim Roth is the super villain. Also recommended: "Another of the Mohicans" and "Patriot". You may find that the latter is closer to "Braveheart" by focusing on blood lust, and the other is similar to "Rob Roy" in tone. All of the above films deserve R ratings for violence.
