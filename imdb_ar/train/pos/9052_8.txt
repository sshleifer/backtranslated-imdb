This is a great drama and a nice change in the pace of hectic and bustling day movies. It is another shop based on a real foundation, which still means that much can be compensated for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I do not know but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a young man from the 1950s who is interested in missiles and wants to enter this field instead of working in coal mines. As does anyone else, including his father, in this West Virginia city. The biggest problem is the conflict between the boy and his father, which I think was exaggerated. I would like to have a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> I think the young man, who is still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first tasks to stare at. He is loved, as are his classmates here. It is nice to see cute children in a modern film. The other two main actors in the film are Chris Cooper (father) and Laura Dern (the teacher who encourages him all the time). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is appropriate because the soundtrack in the 1950s is fun to hear. Again: I wish there would be more of this kind of movies today.
