Professor Tweed thought they had discovered everything. Today's people living in Polynesia are descended from Asian immigrants and moved passionately from the Far East, island to island, eastward to Tahiti and all other exotic tropical islands in the South Pacific over thousands of years. But deep-seated thought did not agree well with ethnic ethnographer Thor Herdahl. If this explanation is true, how can some people who were born and grew up in these islands have traditions, works of art and material features not similar to those in Asia, but South America? How can plants in Ecuador, Peru and Chile look like what you will find on the island several thousand miles away? Is it just a coincidence that islanders point to the sea in the direction of South America and say that where did their ancestors, led by Tiki, come to the equivalent of Adam? In the meantime, how do the Norwegians speak of Scandinavian pioneers who were persecuted from the continent of South America they colonized and set out with some of the indigenous peoples who lived with them on the westward westward sea? It's all a coincidence with Hardal. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of crews, and local know-how to build traditional rafts, an exploratory journey begins. It is a journey to the human imagination as much as false scientific evidence that this journey is possible with the basics of tools and navigation only. The Oscar-winning documentary may be chronicled in its ethnic-feminine tone and approach, but it rises with the adventurous spirit of the space program launched a decade later, as men are willing to risk all of this to test a theory they believe is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It is an amazing file for pages and the perfect preparation for a movie in the style of news.
