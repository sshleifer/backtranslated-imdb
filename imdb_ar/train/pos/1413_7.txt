In 2006, AMPAS was awarded one of the most innovative documentary films depicting wildlife in the coldest place on Earth, and this film was a march of penguins by Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has been a mobile circuit monopoly for decades now. They took their stabs in the making of live films and had hopes in all areas. Disney then created a sub section called Disneynature and released his first feature film, Earth. This is definitely one of the most informative and informative documentaries I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> According to James Earl Jones the Great, Earth does not offer anything new to anyone who has watched Discovery Channel in the last five years or is following the global warming crisis closely. Earth touches deeply on this issue and adopts a very liberal approach on the subject. <br /> <br /> It provides an emotional connection to the nature I have never seen before. It also shows not only the beauty and the puzzling parts of our wonderful planet, but also the anomalies and nuisances that it entails. It is one thing to watch as "Mufasa" falls from a slope to a stampede or the mother of Bambi is shot by a hunter in the middle of the forest. Everything is good because at the end of the film we know it's a movie. This shows the penguins, polar bears, elephants, all sorts of families, from all walks of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. These real things make a real movie experience. <br /> <br /> Although it is a bit heavy on the graphic nature of the film (which many people will disagree with), Earth is an impressive experience. There is a spectacular film work here by a fantastic photography team and a great degree for George Fenton. Compared to March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, he does not keep any action but stands alone. At the end of the day, you are more appreciative of our planet and a bit sad because many of us may not be able to visit the places we will see in the film. We live here, but we do not seem to explore the planet for one reason or another. The land is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
