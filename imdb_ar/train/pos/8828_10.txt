I was very happy because I ran into this short film. I always feel very disappointed because the short films are hard to show, so when I saw that and saw that he was nominated for the short action film at the Oscars, I was very happy because I got a movie already rooting. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vegalondo tried out for a reason that people would suddenly break into a number of songs and dance as they do in musical movies. The result was very entertaining and the song really attractive. <br /> <br /> It's a short, well-edited short film, well edited and all actors doing a great job. The last shot of the film was perfect. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie.
