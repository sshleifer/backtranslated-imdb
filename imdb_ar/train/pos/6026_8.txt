This film has a strong philosophical end. But this ending only makes sense if you're watching the movie from the start. <br /> <br /> The alienation of young people in the late 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and woman, is the obvious subject of "Zabriskie Point." Mark Frechette and Darya Halperin did not have much experience in acting, a fact that actually reinforces the film's message. The presence of untrained representatives conveys a sense of realism, as both players appear emotionally separated from the surrounding unrest. <br /> <br /> This film is not a script-driven movie, except for the first 10 minutes, most of which are visible, with stunning cinematic portrayals. The beautiful natural images look unnatural and coincide perfectly with the emotional separation of Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I had Astb "The Rangers on The Storm", the music of the most infamous "Pink Floyd", has been shown to be the most vulnerable to music. <br /> <br /> However, I like this film. And the rugged desert terrain is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, the "Zabriskie Point" seems more attractive, conveying the mood of the late 1960s in America, an astonishingly bohemian technique, and the last eight minutes of the film are amazingly philosophical .
