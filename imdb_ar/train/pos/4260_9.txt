After the first work by Akin's "Im Juli", which was fairly good, he created a truly wonderful Italian family epic. It is a German film, unfortunately a bad precondition, because we produce more than moderate films;). But this movie makes some very good shots at the time. "Solino" revolves around an Italian immigrant arriving in the Ruhr area of ​​Germany during the 1960s. The immigrant and his family begin their first pizza restaurant in the area. The figures are beautifully painted. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he does. His brother, played by Moritz Blepetro, is not good. Well, you just do not believe the role. But the personality is balanced and fits perfectly with this text. I feel the urgent need to compare the style of this film with "Godfather" style. Many people probably hate this movie, and say boring. Not too much tension? - Yes, but the film is outrageous. 9 out of 10.
