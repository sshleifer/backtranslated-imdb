When I was told of this film I thought it would be another chick flick. I was wrong. This film sends a strong message about judging others. I was deeply impressed. Everyone I've encountered, I've recommended this movie to. No one said it was bad. Busy, he also did a wonderful job with her role in this film. I do not know much about her acting career, but wow, her slow pace was wonderful. <br /> <br /> At first, it was a bit slow. But after I went to the hospital .... Wow, the movie comes back again. I have no idea why he did not speak this film in the world of cinema. I wanted this film to be released again and announced more ... because it sends a strong message in just an hour and a half.
