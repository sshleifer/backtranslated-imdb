I'm not an acting expert or the details of other films, but this film has hit me deeply. I do not think I'll forget it. One scene in particular (I think anyone who saw the movie will know who I'm talking about) is printed on my mind. <br /> <br /> I also watched a similar movie Lilja 4-ever (as referred to by the previous commentator). It was also very impressive, but not quite quite and brutal. If you are sensitive at all, bring tears to your eyes, but Angus do Sul (sun angels) may stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very sad subject, but I think, no, I hope the film will get more attention to it. <br /> <br /> More people need to watch this movie !!!!!!
