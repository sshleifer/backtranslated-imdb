I loved this movie perfectly! I do not comment at all on all the other comments I have read on this subject. I was thoroughly grateful every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story sweeping, intense representation, and immediate direction. I literally jump every time the phone rings near the end of the movie. Although there was nothing "scary" about the story itself, I was on the edge of the abyss throughout the entire film - and the rest of the evening. <br /> <br /> I found that there were lots of perfect choices made ... casting, text, and a little humor was sprayed in it. There were a lot of points where the film could have gone for cheap thrills, but it did not, and for me it put this film over a lot of the modest thrills that have just emerged ... and for the last few years.
