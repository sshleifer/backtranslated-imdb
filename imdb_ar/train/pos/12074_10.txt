Joseph Lewis was one of Noar's best directors. This is definitely the best he has. <br /> <br /> It does not contain some standard features for what we now call noir. Although they are American-made, they are entirely located in England. He lacks gangsters. It lacks the femme fatale. Does not lack crime. <br /> <br /> The title of the ad answers. She is thrilled that she will make some money as a secretary. Instead, I woke up days later as debt in a scary plot. Only a very strong person can survive this dreadful ordeal. Nina Fuchs gives the strong woman the name Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement comes from the dye against the genre: Ms. Fuchs is stylishly characterized. It is not a scream, a miserable victim. They are actually glacial and a little bit, though useless. This makes the plight of her character more believable. <br /> <br /> Certainly the most wonderful element is the casting of Dame May Witty. She was (and still is) famous for her charming title character in "The Lady Vanishes". It has a sweet and harmless way, in a slightly graduated way. But here she is far from the heroine. <br /> <br /> George McCready is as excellent as her very troubled son. The cast is full, in fact, fantastic. <br /> <br /> This famous and wonderful film seems to have been made almost by chance. No doubt the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did so with a low budget. This is the thrill and charm of Noir's film, The Real Noir Movie: It's a small, convincingly low life, in which case, do not forget.
