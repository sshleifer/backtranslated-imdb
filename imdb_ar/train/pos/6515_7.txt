I did not hire this thing almost because of all the bad comments, but I did it anyway. I thought it was similar to the darkness I loved too. The only part he hated about the phrase teeth is the red-necked brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh but it was not comedy. I've ruined the film a bit for me because it was not necessary. The rest of the film was the way it should have been a horror film or suspense. The make-up was good and I saw the worst films of these films. It was a simple story with a reasonable representation. It's not the most terrifying or the most wonderful film, but I did not go out or want to recover it after watching it. On the DVD, there were previews of other films that looked good and I would check them out.
