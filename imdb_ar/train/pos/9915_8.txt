I do not have anywhere to go. I was on a trip to Vancouver. Maybe I would miss this movie if I did not choose Air Canada. I watched a small screen at the back of the front seat and I found this captivating and enchanting. I drifted in two places and had to skip, but I had to watch to the end. Now I'm looking for a DVD in Europe even though I'll be quite tired when I can get out of the door, not yet discovered! <br /> <br /> The combination of stunning photographs gives the film a lot of insight and fills the story that the images tell. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time on your hands).
