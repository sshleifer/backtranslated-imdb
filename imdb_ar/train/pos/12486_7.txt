Well, this film is really difficult. To be frank with you, this film does not contain much of the story of fixation, it makes you "want" to know how it will end ... but I will tell you something now ... I never did it was tense and jumped in my life! This movie definitely does not jump and jump! To be fair, I saw him at about midnight, so I was sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was jumping ... or maybe the reason why this movie is on this side! This is mainly about a couple losing their child in a tragic accident. They decided to move away and rent a cabin looking in the mountains ... everything seems calm and quiet so that they have their first visitor (I think they are the main personal sister, they bring her husband) ... During the night, the husband hears sounds ... Things are really wrong ... do not stay for another day and tell the couple that they should be left as soon as there is something wrong ... to cut a long story ... Eventually, they discovered what happened in this house in the last few years and decide that it You must pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> It's not a Hollywood story, you do not have a huge budget, but please do not let it put you in a bind. It's creepy, very tense and very tight! Just give it a try :)
