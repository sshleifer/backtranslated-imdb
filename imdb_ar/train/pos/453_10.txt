I have always told people that "Enchanted April" is an adult film with no money, sex or violence. One may think of it as a "flick of the final chick," but I bet there are a man or two enlightened there who love him too. Do not call children, though. This film is too low. <br /> <br /> The "enchanted April" vision is a very satisfying experience. The audio track and scenic landscape, along with the gentle literature of the ladies, brings to mind the comfort and beauty of the pre-Raphaelite palette. <br /> <br /> So no one is thinking of watching only one kind of movies, I'll rephrase a line I once heard on "Saturday Night Live" and say my favorite movie is "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April."
