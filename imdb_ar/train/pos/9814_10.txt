The award-winning Peabody Award is one of the highlights of the first season, with the disrupted Huldick captain Picard and Beverley and the data and Starflight historian Waelan in San Francisco in 1930. This episode is a tribute to Raymond Chandler "The Maltese Falcon" where Patrick Stewart plays Humphrey Bogart - complete with fedora and trenchcoat. The office itself is almost a replica of those found in the Maltese Falcon Buggy. <br /> <br /> This episode is a brief introduction to a mysterious insect race called Jarada that continues with a high-pitched sound. Communicating with this foreign race is difficult, and Picard must communicate with this race in their mother tongue until diplomacy and diplomacy finally begin. The best part of this episode is the appearance of the famous Hollywood actor Lawrence Turney as gangster Cyrus Redblock. He was a handsome man in his forties. Oh, okay...
