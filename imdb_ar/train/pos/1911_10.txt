I love the latest episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the story of Kate's fall to the director. I want to know what's going on for Rory, Kerrie, Bridget and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I love watching it with Grandad. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it is credited for his actions that I have never thought of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and I believe him just like my father Kate. This family is real and funny. It was very sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessy died, but as in real life, these things and the way she wrote in the series and dealing with her were funny and sad and she was always very sensitive and loving. But overall a very funny show with lots of laughter and fun.
