I have to hand them to the creative team behind these films "American Pie". "Direct To DVD" is often synonymous with inexpensive, non-specialized filmmaking. But last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying the DVD series "The Naked Mile". Filmmakers took the opportunity to make a funny little movie. This year they are following up the "Beta House". This is the truth, as Beta House makes the first American Pie films look like Little Mermaid. <br /> <br /> This is not immune to loud and tasteless fun. The story is certainly a bit thin, but that's the beauty of it all. Within the first ten minutes, we presented all the main characters, the new supporting characters, a handful of evil gags, meeting the bad guys, and establishing the general drawing line. With all this away, the film becomes a boundless journey. Many gags, and did not retreat in this. I speak semen of male, urine, dildos, chicks with dicks, sex with sheep, female orgazim sprays, and so much more. Not to mention the fact that it did not pass a minute without a breast or a sexy scene. <br /> <br /> The Naked Mile's returnees are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar film) supporting roles like the last few films.) The cast are all working well. Steve Tally (Dwight Steffler), in particular, has a great energy and screen attendant. I expect good things for him. The movie is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh in the film for me was the spoof "The Deerhunter". classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you're a fan of the series, you'll feel at home through Beta House. It really drives the limits of good taste, but in the end it is quite funny.
