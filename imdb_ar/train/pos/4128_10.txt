With all the violence on television and local news, it is refreshing to have a show that does not contain any violence or adult language, yet is still amusing. My children look forward to seeing us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judges. We all enjoy Elton Elton. We enjoy knowing the background of the main ingredient, vegetables and unique spices. We play at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's a great time for entertainment, as well as for information. Best of all, in our life, the life of a bussle, it is a family time spent together.
