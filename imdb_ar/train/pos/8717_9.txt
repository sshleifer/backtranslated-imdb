I have to admit directly from the top, I'm not a fan of family movies these days. Mostly, IMHO, is an emotional crap. But this movie, like TOY STORY, the previous film from Pixar, is a lot of fun. Maybe two of the characters were very nice (especially compared to the two numbers that appeared in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film is more than compensated. The animation looks great, although the humor was wide, but it was consistently good (especially I liked Hopper's line: "If I do not put the mother back on her deathbed I will not kill you, I'll kill you!") Dennis Leary made an animated film; what a concept). And like everyone else, I loved outtakes! I hope the video is new.
