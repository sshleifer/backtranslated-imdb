This was one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. Great for the whole family to see. Ideas may be a bit elusive, but they are a good comedy feeling and behave wonderfully. I love the little boy Adrian Prodi's part, Academy Award-winning, may be very short, but unforgettable. Highly recommended.
