I touched nothing about "Pauli" my heart as he does a few films. It is a clever, funny but emotional film. I'm coming late in becoming an admirer of this film. I did not see "Paulie" until May 2004, and since then, I asked for a Widescreen DVD from a seller on eBay. <br /> <br /> The special effects of Paulie's talk show are wonderful. My son asked me how the bird knew a lot of phrases. Perhaps my favorite part of the film is when Pauli is at Gina Rowlands (Ivy), followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a wonderful role as a good-hearted man. You root it throughout the film. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong in renting or buying this movie !!
