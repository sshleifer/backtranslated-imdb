What is with all the European comments (especially England) here? All I'm saying is that when I first saw this film when I was 13, I thought it was fantastic. Of course he is stupid. This is the whole point. You should see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the full humor behind this movie, but come on, what do you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are much worse than that, and Holwood movies were expensive with real actors in them. What's worth is that Men in White is a very stupid and funny picture of a movie. And with all the ridiculous little things that England has been doing for half a century, I'm shocked at all the negative comments. We Americans are stupid like our stupid humor. P.S. , See "America's Team: World Police" for some real laughter that Europeans will particularly like.
