If you are in the mood for fun ... you want to relax and enjoy ... Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies you can watch. Amitabh started very well ... but Govinda is the one who steals the offer from his hands ... Timing is great and a good dialogue ..... Inspired by Bad Boys ... but he has an Indian masala. .. People think it can be confusing and stupid ... But the fact that David Davidan is running Govinda and acting ... should not raise any questions .... Other recommended movies of the same genre (David Davan / Govinda group)). .. They are Shula Or Shabnam, Aachen, Raja Babu, Sagan Chal Sasural, Diwana Mastana, Colle No. 1, Judy no. 1, hero No. 1, Hasina Mangaje, Ik Or Ik Gihah.
