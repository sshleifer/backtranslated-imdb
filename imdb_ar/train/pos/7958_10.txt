I really liked the movie. I ended up crying. This film is incredible. Watch the movie. You will enjoy it. I have given it a rating of more than 10. I loved the excitement between chance and rudeness. I love driving the shadow.overall this movie was perfect. <br /> <br /> The sequel is a good movie but not good because of this movie. I think there should be a third supplement to it. Not only does this film attract children but also adults. My whole family enjoyed this film. It was full of humor. <br /> Again, I say that this movie should be watched. The more you watch this movie the more you are attached to this movie. This movie is classic.
