It was a very enjoyable film and I really enjoyed it, and I usually do not rent movies like Andy Indy, but I was attracted to the film because it had a great team including Jimmy Kennedy, who I've loved since the Triple Scream. The director puts the risk (a risky risk) in telling the lives of many different people (I mean many of them) and interlocking at different intervals. Risk was a good idea because it was the end result of a very good film. <br /> <br /> The film contains a few key characters; Dwight (Jimmy Kennedy) - a wealthy writer displeased with fortune cookies, and ties her relationship with his girlfriend to the rocks because of controversy. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - An aircraft loader / technician who loves all living things (except, perhaps, maids) and who despite his good heart has bad luck in bad luck. Cairn (Brian Cox) - Chinese restaurant owner / shop Donut is a bacterium and because of his fear of germs puts his assistant / cook Sung - (Alexis Cruz) under pressure to keep up with his phobia. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) is married to Olive - (Christina Kirk) who is convinced of an attempt; to stop him from being fun, to be silly, to go insane, and to lead a normal life. They begin to make trivial and almost insane arguments, and Oliv seriously begins to doubt Ernie. Gordon - Grant Hesseloff is a man who is not going well, as bad things begin to accumulate in his life and he decides to take them in his hand. Mitchell - (John Huertas) is convinced that Gwyn - (Alexandra Westcourt) is a girl of his dreams and they are devoted to each other, although she is more skeptical. He tries to attract every chance he gets and certainly tries! Johnston - (Michael Hitchcock) has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as a provider, and he has another job that does not suit him. His wife Annelle - (Arabella Field) is relieved by her experience of losing her job until she learns that Johnston was not the loving husband I thought he was. <br /> <br /> In general, I would definitely suggest this movie! <br /> <br /> -Erica
