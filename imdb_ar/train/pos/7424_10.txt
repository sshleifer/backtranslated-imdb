I was 16 years old when I first saw the film, and it was always my favorite. Of course, you can not deny the attraction of Christoferson in the film - how this guy ?????????????? Shish. Still remains. He is the evil child that every woman secretly wants. His behavior is flawless. He played drunk / anesthetized just the way someone managed to pass him - and he had - in 76 he finally got the cart, so everything was very real. <br /> <br /> The music is great, and although I thought in subsequent years that Streisand was not the right person to him in a sense of physical beauty, I think it is a problem for male viewers more than females. The US girls only look at Chris - and of course men look at female interest - my husband can not watch the movie B / C - he does not like her looks. But I made him just sit in the red Ferrari scene on the road in the end so he could see how well he did - the camera work was perfect and I was in the car with him completely with the music explosion - you were supposed to see it on a 50 inch plasma - WOW !!!! Finally, the quality of the transport was superb - a distorted visual display with brilliant colors and very low noise except for the natural dark areas of all films. <br /> <br /> I got some wonderful memories of my mom and loved this movie together, I bought a copy for Christmas. I wanted to watch it with her last night. <br /> <br /> I tried to sit with the original with Judy Garland, but I think this first, I can not reach the previous era, watching all the concert footage in version '76 was very similar to what I was living in at the time . <br /> <br /> I work my way across the Streisand suspension, but it seems to be talking only about itself and ongs, so far barely mentioned Chris or details about the scenes in the film. Her voice sounds exactly as it did now. <br /> <br /> Check it out, if you grew up in the same age as me (born in 1960) you'll love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
