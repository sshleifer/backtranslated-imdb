Farah Fawcett spent the better part of her post-Angel career, confusing us, with occasional performances of the Playboy dances and Letterman's escape. But when it comes down to it, there is no denying that this girl can act. Away from a story of epic proportions, this good TV movie is nice, quiet and sometimes moving. Fossett plays the role of the stray black sheep's daughter in returning home to find that she missed the last days of her mother's life as well as the funeral, infuriating her sister's most stable and most rational. Brad Johnson plays an interest in love, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telephonic drama - but then it is always confusing to see her, and she is, in fact, still at hand. (And yes, I admit it, I had a poster of joy on my wall when he came back). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on the Corkymeter. Bossley will be proud.
