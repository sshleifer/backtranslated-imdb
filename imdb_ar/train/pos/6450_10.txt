It's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Take me on the roller coaster of emotions. I laugh and cry and I get disgusted and happy and in love! All this in just over two hours of time! <br /> <br /> The actors are all fantastic! I must mention the main actor of course, Michael Nequist. It does a great job !! I also admire the actor who plays Toure, who plays this young man who faces a mental challenge in a convincing way! He reminded me a bit of Leonardo DiCaprio in Gilbert Grape! Then there is the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriela Song. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to everyone to see and enjoy!
