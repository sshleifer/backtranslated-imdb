This holy crap is very hysterical! Why do not American comedy films be written that way? For anyone who thinks that comedy should be stupid - there is intelligence and intelligence in the six episodes of this series over a shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is shouted full. I could not believe it was the same guy as the house! There are lots of lines and great gags in this series, where you can watch every show dozens of times and still pick up new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is as hilarious as the taller and Edmund Butler wears. This is my favorite all in the Blackadder series. Tony Robinson is as wonderful as he has always been, like the somewhat lonely heart of the "oppressed masses" of the Baldrake. Some of my favorite lines are: "When someone closes with Wellington to set foot on him", he studies how he got his name, his cousin McAdader, "the sniper's biggest salesman," and the murder fugitive from Scotland.
