The film is sexy, foul, ugly, and ugly, about a bodyguard determined to find (and destroy!) The killers of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost anachronistic in today's right political atmosphere. Scott has no desire to apologize for the immorality inherent in the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is either unaware or does not care for 30 years of social progress. I do not really think we'll watch a more violent film any time soon, so it's better to see this movie while you can. Despite its relentless crust, I believe that the film is a powerful example of cinema in its most efficient, effective, efficient and effective way. Scott has a hard time selling, but I think I'm a buyer. The exceptional technical aspects of this film are extremely effective for me to ignore. Scott's options in the management area are simply amazing, and he pulls out a wonderful performance from Denzel Washington. Sensitive lives need to get away from this, but I recommend it to those viewers who are looking for a great motion picture.
