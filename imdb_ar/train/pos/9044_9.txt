I recently watched this film because of Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I would watch the movies I missed. I had no expectation of going to the film, so it surprised me that I missed this film at all. It is the story of a father and son gripping, and it is also a weak story. I have thrown tears at the end of this wonderful story. This film appeals to all ages. The only reason I gave him 9 out of 10 is that he slows down a bit in the middle, but he returns strongly at the end. The acting was fantastic, the story was fantastic, and the film was as good as the film. Go to see this movie! Rent it, buy it, watch it and love it! I know I did!
