Well, I was not sure what the film would look like. I saw only a small piece, but I was thinking it would be good, and I was right when I saw it twice the day I get it, and it's good for me. <br /> <br /> I think Allison Lohan played a good bet as a grate actress and must have done a lot of research to find out the bulimia although the end when the bet is in the hospital is Horus note 2 after meals because it was told The fourth is that the house is fine and that the hospitals do not help people with bad health, as we are told, and it is probably the reason why I am still at home, even if my sister and mother want to get me into the hospital because I have an illness, but this is a movie I recommend to anyone Suffers from or without eating disorders or to people who know someone who is suffering from stress Eating food because it may allow them to enter the life of a person who is sick and see the world how they do a little on every film grate and I recommend it to anyone and any kind of person
