The secrets of KELLS may be the most spectacular film I've seen since my BELLEVILLE. Although different in style, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and KUNG FU PANDA, a stunning artistic direction, production design, background / design and color richness, a feast for the senses. The KELLS is very large - almost gothic in design (somewhat reminiscent of klimt), perfectly flat from the general public perspective, or decorated in a Celtic and luminous design, yet the figures are simple and attractive - all working beautifully together. Fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are drawn to every detail of the story and to every blow with the pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross and Paul, all of them in Cartoon Saloon (and their crews), achieved with this small film / VERY of the crew, is amazing. The growing support among our animation community is enormous. This film is breathtaking, and the spread among our colleagues in recommending this film spreads like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS for her numerous submissions, Annie's nomination as well as her current competition for the Oscar qualifiers. They are all very apt gestures, in fact ...
