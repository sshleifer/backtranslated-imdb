I have seen a lot of actors from Hong Kong, and this one is at the top of this genre. Motion scenes are exciting and dynamic like anything I've ever seen in any motion movie. Kung Fu amazing, fireworks appeared eye, stunt hearty action. The editing is at an ideal pace, which increases the tension and completes the work of the fluid camera. This film is directed by the old pro Curie Yuen, whose autobiography is filled with some of the best works of this genre, including the Jet Li Legend of Fung Sai Yok. If there is one thing that does not exist in this film, it is a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the male man, approaches him. This film is full of original forms rather than characters - the killer thriller, the idiot thief and his evil girlfriend, the persecuted bad guys. However, Shannon enjoys me with a wonderful presence on the screen; she's fascinating with fighting, stunts, and guns. When you're on the screen, it's hard to close your eyes. It's good. Why is not this woman a major star?
