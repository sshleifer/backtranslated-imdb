Norman, is that you? He (this is everything from a third hand, so I take it with a grain of salt) adapted to the African American family of a Jewish family, when I made the transition off stage and on the screen. Also, it was one of those films that were originally filmed in the video, so the prints of the theater can not be great. However, Redd Foxx and other offerings were good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you all about is that the movie is PERIOD PIECE: It reflects attitudes in the mid to early seventies about discovering that you have a gay son or daughter in your family. That's why alone, it's interesting - if not a little "Hollywood." Do not believe me check the lines around the blinds, etc. Very typical. Not very deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the film really shines in several areas. There is a split scene when Red Fox tries to find his wife, who ran away with his brother (!) To Ensenada in Pinto. The cross-border telephone conversation is truly memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the film is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did a gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To my knowledge, this is the only time the routine has been filmed. I was told it was a slightly cleaned and much shorter version. Still, it's Madame vintage, and should not be missed. People are still stealing lines from Island. The man was really talented. Enjoy the movie!
