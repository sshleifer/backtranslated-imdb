Well, I know I do not like this movie but I like it. From the pathetic interpretation of Pat Morita to the Japanese stereotype to the screaming scream of Jay Leno, she laughed throughout the film. As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is talking to President Morita in Tokyo with alcohol in the second.
