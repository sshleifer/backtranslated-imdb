It takes Serbs or at least the Balkans to understand and enjoy the many positions, personalities and jokes of "Zavet" as well as many other Kusturica films. See, for example, the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with low-tech devices that defend the safety and lifestyle of the population, nostalgia for the good days of Communist rule, and the awakening of a naughty guy watching his naked mentor in the sounds of the Soviet anthem. Kusturica does not try to get away from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous films, but creates a whole world of himself in the process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or an explicit political film in any way. It's a fun movie first of all. Kostorica creates a group of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this film as in all his other films. His style is direct and wonderful, and now we feel his feelings towards his characters and know that he wants us to feel the same. The space it develops blends present, history and magic, and seems to be the colors of the Rousseau duaneir in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not an ideal film either. The main drawback is length, and some editing and default may be useful, as it seems that the director has run out of ideas and repetition at some point. It's so far one of the most interesting and entertaining movies I have seen recently.
