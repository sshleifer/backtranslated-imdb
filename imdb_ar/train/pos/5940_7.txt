This short film revolves around the work of Superman and Batman together and the formation of an unstable alliance. It is clear that the two individuals have very different views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment. For length. I will not go to the story here. But I'm going to play acting, and it's wonderful. Everyone is awesome. Two actors playing Superman and Batman are appropriate to their characters. Make Batman: Dead End and Grayson also this short film. Of the three, I may have liked this film at least, but I still think it was done well. For me, the best in the world is 7/10
