Ray Liotta and Tom Holsey starred in this Australian example of love and brotherly commitment. Holly plays Dominic, (Nicky), a mentally handicapped young man, who puts his twin brother, Leota, who is 12 minutes old, in the role of Eugene, through the Faculty of Medicine. He is appointed in Baltimore and addresses the issues of rivalry between brothers and sisters, the unbreakable bond between twins, the mistreatment of children, and the perpetual triumph over evil. It is captivating and full of laughter and tears. If you have not seen this movie yet, please rent it, prepare it, and you'll be amazed at how this wonderful movie can go unnoticed.
