This film is so complex that it can be given any description and it is still being recorded. You have an unsafe, turbulent and wonderful master character (played by Jean-Pierre Laud) trapped between two women (no, three). We listen to his social, philosophical and moral characteristics in endless monologues, and see him working his magic around the three women he loves. This may be the basis for the bird film, full of cold, cold and uninteresting comments. After director Jean Justach managed to keep it fresh, cynical and clever. Being a long film, one can only laugh when, two hours after speaking politely, Jean-Pierre Loud suddenly screams at the phone screaming while remembering the cheesy line of a movie. This type of situation is purely cinematic and can not be fully restored in a commentary. No one can recover the beautiful beautiful tragic monologue of Fran√ßoise LeBron at the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hour and worth every minute.
