This show is good I love acting, funny bit and attractive of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Anne Freil ... etc, have performed superbly in the show. The show began admirably with the ridiculous and absurd idea of ​​returning the dead back in the first series. Frankly, as the people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a disappointment but later returned to good research anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why does ABC not allow it to end until all episodes are over? I really want to know how the story will be. I think you should give a chance because there are still a lot of viewers who love it.
