For me there is something very appealing and nostalgic about the low-budget science fiction. As a child in the fifties, it was all. In 1957 I saw "The First Man in Space" in the cinema with my father. Marshall Thompson was starring and some other poor people who got the starring role. It is also about a space mission that has become bad as the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. He is afraid of good & lots of right for me. The memory of these Habibis remains in me. The stunning fusion man can only be made in glorious full-color ... wherever the scenes are well lit. You just have to love it for what it is ... just over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noise, and this exotic music. Bravo!
