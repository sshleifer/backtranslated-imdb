Garde à Vue must be seen several times to understand the sub-plots it contains. If you are not used to producing French movies, based on conversation and the battle of intelligence rather than action, do not try to watch it. You will only feel bored to death, rest assured that French movies are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a wonderful film, based mainly on dialogues (written by Audiard by the way) that cuts the veil of appearances. <br /> <br /> Why does Mater Martino (Serrault) prefer to be accused without justification as a child killer instead of telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he had had sexual relations for eight years. His wife knew it, she was jealous of him and preferred his execution (in France in 1980, there was still the death penalty) instead of revealing the only "pure and innocent" side of his unfortunate life.
