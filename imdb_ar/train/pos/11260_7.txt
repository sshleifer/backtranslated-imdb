Well, it's hard to follow the story a bit the first time, but this is only due to vampires / witches in the seventies and dancers on bongo drums. This course is interrupted by a few vampiric orgy. There are some candles and very interesting uses for them. For a girl on a girl's job, vampiric or not ... This movie just rocks!
