Michelle Rodriguez plays the role of Diana, a high school girl with a slut and 2 Ã— 4 shovel on her shoulder. She is ready to fight anyone, especially her father who pays for her brother's boxing lessons. Diana decided that boxing would be a good way to focus her anger. <br /> <br /> I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. Watch how their emotions are shaped towards each other by the square circle.
