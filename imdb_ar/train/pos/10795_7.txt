O'Farrell, the film was fairly good, a good plot with a good deal of bangs and scenes of fighting, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing, except disarming the bomb and shooting some characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11, when a bin Laden-like terrorist sent a video to President Urich threatening to blow it up. Godson Mills had some great roles in the action, taking the Rashed complex and various kicking roles, but there was a shortage of Chuck Norris. Judson took over most of the actions, leaving Joshua (Chuck) with Que on her computer. But, in general, they were realistic and did not lack procedures, but they did so by Mr. Norris. The film was given 7/10.
