The mysterious killings in a European village seem to be the product of the "vampires" who have been plagued by the horrifying community. <br /> <br /> This amazing little movie was created by Majestic Pictures, one of the Hollywood studios of Pravio Road. The values ​​of sporadic production and raw editing add to its strange atmosphere and give it an almost expressive quality. In general, it leaves the viewer feeling trapped in a bad dream, which is suitable for excitation of this kind. <br /> <br /> Although the final interpretation of the heinous crimes is ridiculous, and not because of the development of the appropriate plot, the film can boast a good game. Grave Lionel Atwill offers his usual good performance, this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle. Play the beautiful Faye Ray assistant in a role that requires them to do more than just a beautiful and disturbing appearance. The role of Melvin Douglas as a police officer appears to be puzzled when she happens to be her boyfriend at Miss Ray. <br /> <br /> Moody Eiburn, who may be very funny given the right situation, steals most of her scenes as Miss and Rai's hypochondriac aunt. Elder Leonel Belmore plays the burgers in the village. Little Dwight Fry, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in Frankenstein and Dracula's films, is most effective as a bounty lover.
