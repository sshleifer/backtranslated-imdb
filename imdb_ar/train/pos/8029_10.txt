I am curious about what Beckett used in the film, as well as the bullet he was supposed to have fired. If this is built loosely on the sniper Carlos Hathcock, I think it is 7 mm long. Round - spherical. I'm also curious about Venice itself. He also made a comment in Sniper's latest film about the gun that the Vietnamese man was allowed to use for his father. Beckett said he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know which gun is also. I know that this particular gun was manufactured throughout World War II or beforehand. I could not take a closer look at the movie to see it. <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Hathcocks who was killed, his longest shot was 1.47 miles away, and he had 93 confirmed dead and 14 unconfirmed people killed. After healing his wounds somewhat of his burns in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers at USMC the skills they need in this area. He still mentions his career in hunting for our brothers and sisters who train at USMC. I discovered his name from my friend, a former Marine. Any information will be great.
