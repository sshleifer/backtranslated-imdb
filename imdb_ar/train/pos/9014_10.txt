Shame, before I watched this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research, in order to assure myself that she was not already infected, and also her character, b (ok?), what she was suffering from. I was in absolute anguish for this beautiful lady. I've pulled it out of the blemishes. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that sexually explicit conditions involving the ultimate needs and needs of a unique young lady could be interpreted as tender and romantic? Well, they can be, when presenting the right artists to them in the appropriate way, as they did in this wonderful film. I forgot to mention how Miss Carter looks pretty dynamic in this film. I said a lot that she was the most beautiful creature that ever got our face, but she seemed to have done it herself in this particular film. <br /> <br /> I hope that any of you watching this movie will enjoy it as much as you did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
