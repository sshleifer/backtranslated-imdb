This show, which was filmed for "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner", is the most beautiful and quickest poem of Cooleridge. Stunning cinematography, along with a set of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by renowned international artists, and the brilliant Michael Ridgraph novel, deserve a lot of time to see this excellent visual work. <br /> <br /> In the age of television, this work is an invaluable tool to inspire young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. To my knowledge, this kind of work is really rare; this is unfortunate. As a student of world literature, as a former university professor and academic adviser, I feel that more great epic poems such as "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Coleridge must be translated. Although I am not a critic of films, but as a thirsty reader of classical literature, I am delighted to recommend this wonderful production without any reservations at all.
