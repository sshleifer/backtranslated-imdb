I have watched this movie more than 100-200 times, and I like it every time I watch it. Yes, it can be very vulgar but very funny and also enjoyable. The camp described in the film is a real camp that I have already attended for 7 years and was filmed as a camp already, a great place to spend the summer. Everyone who went to the camp or wanted to go to the camp or send a child to the camp should see this film because it will bring back wonderful memories for you and your children.
