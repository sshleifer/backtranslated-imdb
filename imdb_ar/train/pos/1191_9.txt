Robert Taylor as Crazy Buffalo Hunter Charlie Gelson is the main character in this film. At first I was thinking that Charlie would end up recovering himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the film progresses, Gelson continues to do more atrocities until she realizes that there is no hope for him. Stuart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop fishing because he realizes that the buffalo will soon be gone and will feel disgusted by the act of murder. Gilson is a natural killer that does not differentiate between animals or humans. Debra Paget as an Indian girl is an amazing figure given the self-censorship of the time. She is lying with Gelson in complete resignation, even though she hates him. The last scene of frozen gelson, unforgettable.
