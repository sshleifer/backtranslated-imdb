When I rented this movie, I thought I was going to see a horror film. However, there is little horror in this mysterious 1970's typical drama directed by the strange James T. Flocker. The beautiful Boston Matt Boston carries the picture with its superb performance, and the typical alien atmosphere of the Flocker movies is there.
