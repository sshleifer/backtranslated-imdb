This is a strange, serene and mystical film. If there is something like the cinema of "intellectual horror," this film is. I started to feel scared and I wish there was someone else watching with me, and he hardly had a conspiracy! I have to see this film again several times before I really understand it. If you're a fan of "My Dinner With Andre" and movies by Godard, or if you're taking a lot of mind-altering drugs, you might enjoy this movie. Wonderful.
