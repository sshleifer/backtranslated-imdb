This is a classic game from the 1980s in which Arnold Schwarzenegger plays one of his unforgettable roles. Is located in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is "Running", where convicted criminals are tracked down and killed for entertainment for millions. It was set up as a game show, with the public voting on their favorite "stalkers," the trained killers who hunt and kill the unsung "runners" in the show. Members of the audience also win prizes to correctly predict who will be killed by whom. He plays guest host Richard Dawson of Family Feud, and the gaming experience makes him perfectly suited for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of Arnold's classic series, such as his famous film "I Will Go Back" just before he enters the arena. He ridiculed an armed stalker with a flamethrower with "What about the light?" I could have continued, but I do not want to spoil the film. It's funny! <br /> <br /> Whether it's intended or not, this movie is a parody of the madness of Reality TV today. There are already many programs that show people suffering from pain and humiliation to entertain viewers, and even court cases are televised about their "entertainment value." Running Man shows what happens if reality TV hits the bottom, a scary picture. One can only hope that networks have common sense not to allow them to reach that limit. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
