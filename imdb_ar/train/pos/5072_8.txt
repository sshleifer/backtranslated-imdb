Pierce Brosnan is probably the only thing familiar with the new biography of Richard Attenborough. The rest is new to international audiences: Canadian history and the culture of the First Nations. <br /> <br /> "Gray Owl" is a light check of how a man in Ojibwe, northern Ontario, learns and advocates environmental protection decades before they become politically correct to do so. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. This torture, however, does not always appear in life with the dramatic effect that may occur. <br /> <br /> However, it is a film that holds his audience without any violence. He respects the deep respect of the first nations of Canada and presents them in a dignified and untypical way. Brosnan's performance is fairly strong, but I think that's what Lord Attenborough wanted. <br /> <br /> Thank you proud Canadian.
