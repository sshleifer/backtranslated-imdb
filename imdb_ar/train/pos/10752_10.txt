This was the most impressive, moving, amazing and brilliant story I ever had. Quite frankly, even those qualities can not be described. I can not choose just one scene that came out to me. I suppose that if I have to include some of them, the fireman's reactions will be the rising sound of jumping from the victims; the reaction of the people trapped in the elevator, who were not aware of what was going on, And disbelievers onlookers; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> On that day, so far, I remember Star Wars (1977). "I felt a big power disturbance, as if millions of voices suddenly screamed in horror and were suddenly silenced," says Obi Wan. It's amazing how very precise it is. There was already a disturbance in power. <br /> <br /> This documentary clearly reveals this turmoil. The visual feelings are incredible. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion and awareness of his power. Everything is there. Nothing has been missed. <br /> <br /> This is a strong and influential documentary film worthy of Amy. Not only does it document 9/11 but simply because it all has to be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch, make sure you grab a packet of tissues. You will need it. I know I did.
