To connect with the beauty of this film, pay careful attention to the audio track, not only the music, but the way all sounds help in weaving the images. How beautiful that the opening scene leading to the expulsion of Gino is based on the subject of moral uncertainty! Notice the way music presents the characters as we are directed inside the Giovanna marriage. Do not expect to find much here from the political life of Italy in 1943. That's not what it's about. On the other hand, if you are exposed to music, images and sounds, you'll be directed to a word that goes beyond the new realism. By the end of the film, there are moments like the landscape of Anthony linked to the inner life of the characters more than the real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
