The story is simple: an old man who lives alone in the woods stumbles accidentally when he kills a young child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred. Despite providing a little dialogue throughout the film, only the visual narration narrated by the eye of the camera alone made the film very attractive. The state of the gray forest conveys the sense of loneliness, which complements the tranquility of the characters themselves. We can also feel helpless in the inability of the old man to convince the police to kill, which is equivalent to the inability of the silent child to tell her story. <br /> <br /> True terror lies in feelings of despair, helplessness and irrationality. . This film successfully addresses these elements by visualization alone, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and scarcity used by other horror films when the novel is weak. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds at a slow pace to build tension for a few creepy and startling moments. The end is also unpredictable and credible. Japanese horror films, such as The Ring, Dark Water, or English horror films such as Lady in Black and The Innocents, remind us of the true horror of the atmosphere. I recommend anyone who enjoys a good kick up to intimidate the bones to experience this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you do not see the movies you just mentioned, you might want to give them a try as well.
