Say what you want about schmaltz. One of the beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a moral that some Americans are called to a very high level and how they rose to the occasion. It is an inspiring idea because it revolves around people with a noble purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Varelli (mother and brother of the House of Davis). "We're out of Mongolian," says Fanny. <br /> <br /> In the current political climate, where a president has lied to us shamelessly and exploited the events of September 11th to bring out the absolute worst human characteristics, we sank to the level of 9/11 killers to get vengeful revenge. You can not blame Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in this direction and even re-election after he revealed his lies. Now, with full justification, we Americans are pleased all over the world. <br /> <br /> Today, we are watching this film with new awareness: that the rise of the Nazis in Germany to power was not due to a defect in the German character, but a flaw in humans allows us to rationalize anything that justifies our immoral and hideous actions. I do not compare George Bush to Adolf Hitler. But I am referring to how the leader can drive us into a frenzy of terrorism, hatred and excessive nationalism to do evil things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the extortionist, who will do everything that needs to be done to be believed, no matter how immoral, like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who buried their heads deep in the sand , So they can not be bothered to vote. A movie like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we were looking forward to - a force for improving humanity - and that we have to look back to high goals. <br /> <br /> Jeff
