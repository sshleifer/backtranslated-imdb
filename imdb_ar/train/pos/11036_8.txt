A prison cell. Four prisoners - Carriere, the director of a fraud-ridden young man, a 35-year-old transgender in his transformation, Daisy, a 20-year-old sane, savior and savior, a 60-year-old intellectual killed his wife. The cell, mysteriously withdrawn, discovered a book: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the turn of the century. The diary contains magic formulas that are supposed to enable prisoners to escape. "Malefique" is one of the most intelligent and intelligent horror films I have seen this year. The film has a mysterious dark feeling influenced by the HP Lovecraft, which creates a very disturbing and disturbing atmosphere. There is a great deal of involvement in some of the fantastic and brutal scenes of death, and the characters of the four captives are surprisingly sophisticated. It is shameful that Eric Vallet once again recreates a truly horrifying picture of "One Missed Call" after his stunning 9 out of 10 appearances.
