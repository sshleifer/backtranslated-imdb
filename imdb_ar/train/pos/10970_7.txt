A wonderful but troubling look at Edith Boveer Bill, her daughter (Aunt Little Edie) and her late cousin Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent-infested palace, which is a health hazard to the city. It becomes very obvious very quickly that these two are the last eccentric. Little Eddie seems to be the most active because she acts with the mentality of a 10-year-old child even though she is 53 years old. Content consists largely of two things. The first is the talks, and Little Edie lambastes Big Edie led all potential suitors and destroyed her ambitious career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, illogical and often amusing. The second part consists of long spells of singing attempt by both parties. Each of them, of course, thinks that their songs are perfect and that the other is the one that looks bad. In a stunning scene, Big Edie physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to stop her jamming. One is captivated after one feels that there is some serious exploitation happening here and the subjects are far from knowing it. It seems that filmmakers deal with this as a strange show in the circus, and every day comes to record (chuckle) any strange behavior that may occur. In the end, this is a sad picture because it shows how the world has overcome these two. Their hopes and dreams fell like the palace they live in. Despite the bickering between them they need to be closer to each other than ever before. Because without the other there will be no refuge from unity. The most wonderful line comes from Big Edie that gets many of the same cats during her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply incredible.
