The straight story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state border. He decides to take the trip on a mower because he can not drive and wants to blow himself up. The film beautifully depicts his journey and the life he touches along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays a great role as the rest of the actors, notably Sissy Spike in a gracious performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton play in a small but very important role. <br /> <br /> I felt at first that the story of an old stranger's journey through the countryside would be bland, but I quickly found out that Lynch with all the in-depth thoughts of a man's life makes this film a movie I recommend to anyone.
