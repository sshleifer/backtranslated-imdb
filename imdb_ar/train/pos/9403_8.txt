"Man in the white suit" is another feather in the cover of the Scottish director Alexandre McKindrick (Whiskey Gallor, the smell of soft success). The film's star is Alec Guinness (which includes his comedy films Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings its usual chapter to the film, making it more than just a typical comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, comedy is not entirely public. At the end of the picture, almost became a full drama. It's a kind of Ealing studio comedy that is calculated as not producing laughter, but a sense of public entertainment, like the best British comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the trick is not original, but the way it is implemented is. The movie is very original and is recommended for Guiness or Britsh fans. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
