I do not understand your objections to this film. It is a tight, exciting stretch of personality created in the "basic instinct". The only part of the less realistic story is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and not in prison on this late date. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As the film progresses, we are presented with three theories of what happens: 1) The character of Sharon Stone kills all these people because they are crazy (an addictive risk); 2) David Theoles' twisted policeman kills these people from For the framing character of Sharon Stone; 3) analyst David Morisi kills these people for revenge. What disturbs most people about the film seems that none of these theories are interpreted as the "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric facility to kill the policeman; the only murder that happens on the screen.) <br /> <br /> I think this is a wonderful conspiracy device in the spirit of "A Space Odyssey 2001". Who cares what is real? The blonde is really crazy, the cop is really crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. What is important is the interactions between these characters and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone actually thinks and is more complicated than the movie. throw it away!
