This picture appeared in 1975 and was the second in a series of three parts of the life of Sheriff Buford Boser. Bo Svensson plays the role of Sheriff Buford Bowser, and Luke Asquey plays Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last we saw was Sherif Buser lying in bed in the hospital after he and his wife were killed in an ambush on Sunday morning. After Poser's recovery, the men who killed his wife are pursued. Is the Pusser capable of completing the revenge that the mob wants or tries to remove before it succeeds. The only thing that bothered me about this picture was that this was a true true story. How can you leave in town with this kind of crime but do not do anything about it. Since there was no real actress in this picture, I can not give it 10 stars from weasel but I can give 8
