This is a well written and well behaved psychological drama. It's not a flicker of horror, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me in this film was the intelligence and careful attention to detail in the plot and the effort to achieve internal consistency. I also appreciate Dr. Phil's absence in psychology or revisionism in the new age. Instead of making an agenda, the directors just told the story, told it well and let the viewer think about it. The sparse dreamscapes reminded us of Wyeth's paintings and surprisingly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to produce a good movie with a small budget, without big studios or star actors or directors with big names (this was much better than many Hitchcock movies) or special effects or "clever" plot transitions.
