Return to the roots with "as in heaven" - what are the true values ​​of life? These Swedes publish a message appealing to everyone. We've seen it twice in a cinema filled with the last seat: I like the joy and joy of a simple chorus, but full of power as soon as everyone finds his own inner dialect. <br /> <br /> From Daniel's fame to his youth school, now vacant and ready to adapt to his new home after the crash on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and drawn to the lives of people in the north simple, warm and violent. <br /> <br /> He has won the hearts of music and gained the ability to love and be unconditionally loved. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see it if you've been the standard for Hollywood. These things do not contain additives, just your laughter, your kindness, your tears!
