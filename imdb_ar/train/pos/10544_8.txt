Well, Cube (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most intriguing and deceptive ideas I've ever seen when talking about films. They had only one scene, a group of actors and a plot. So what made him so special was all the effective directions, the great squares, the strange situation that the characters had to deal with like mice in the maze. His second film, Cypher (2002), revolves around his story, but it was not as good as "Cube" but here the characters are tested like mice again. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a very interesting thing and Vincenzo returns to his "cube days", with the characters locking back in a very different space with no time to play back with characters like playing with mice Experience room. But instead of the erotic sci-fi (even some of the promotional hassles and erroneous sections looked like this), "nothing" is a loose and light comedy that can certainly be called a modern satire about our society and also about the unforgiving world we live in. Once again, Vicenza is surprised by the wonderful idea of ​​something very small. Two actors and a generalized white script, that's all I've got most of the time and do not need more. While the "Cube" is an awesome experience and the "Cypher" is confusing, "nothing" is exactly the opposite but at the same time desperate as well. <br /> <br /> This movie proves once again that the smart idea means more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the film fails sometimes, but its basic idea means a lot and make up for any flaws. There is nothing else to say about this film because everything is a wonderful surprise and a completely different experience in my films since "Cube".
