Very bad some comments in front of me do not know the facts of the case. It depends on the actual events, the highly promoted case of disappearances and killings occurring in Wilmington, Devolovia, from 96 to 2000. I must admit that I was largely skeptical of how Hollywood would show history and actual events He was in fact deeply impressed by their proximity to what has been reported consistently in local news stories and Philadelphia Inquirer stories throughout the time period. Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress (whom I really loved in the Cold Case) and played Fahey did not look like her (Ann was actually the prettiest Marie). I have to admit that Mark Harmon really allowed the kind of personality that was revealed as Capano and the behavior that Capano showed throughout this period. The details of the case were right ... no deviations from the dramatic effect ... even on carpet, gun, furniture and radiator. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I met Tom Carper several times in different jobs (a good man, though a politician) and I am very happy that he pulled tendons in the federal field necessary to resolve this heinous crime. Men like Capano were real and it was wonderful to see him finally sitting behind bars.
