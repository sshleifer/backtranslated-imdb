The PRC which was the lowest level actually hit gold with this little temperament film. They did the same thing a year ago with "Detour," one of the best low-budget films ever. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically one of a group of film, full of fog and shadows, a technique used by most poverty class studios to hide groups or not exist. But here, it works fine. The ghost of Charles Middleton (known as the Ming Mercilids) disappears around the swamp, killing those involved in his unlawful execution for murder and generating some sympathy from the viewer. His last victim is to be the daughter of the boats ..... He focuses his anger not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well. <br /> <br /> Rosemary Laplanche has her usual tradition of someone in a coma that goes through acting. She presents herself to the outside in order to put an end to the murder, but as a temptation to the public, the suffocating view of her country's gesture as evidence that his mission has been completed and returns to the Hereafter, is somewhat punished. If Olmer (who directed "Detour") directed Strangler, she would hang from the nearest tree and perform the choke task. But who complains? The story is not the main attraction, but the sparrow sets, lighting and general mood of the piece. It stands behind the "Detour", as the finest PRC watches
