In many ways, L & H's "hard work" is predictable on the surface where boys sweep someone's chimney. Guess what will happen next? This is the right paper juggling in the most successful cases. <br /> <br /> But there is one thing or two that seems to be non-typical. For example, he is not likely to be the first to be very unwanted, he is arrogant, rude, not only to Stan because of the way the server addresses him with "HEY YOU" and takes a childish crawl very easily with the phrase "I do not have anything In short, Ully Ully plays the Bully in a very unpopular way, and it is a lot better to see him play with the arrogant Coward as he is always in the brink of his work <br /> <br /> School work also lacks the news systems of other L & H reports such as shorts Finlayson, Long, Busch and Housman, which means when we turn to the mad world planner there is a little creepy atmosphere going on with the left الفيلم The film <br /> <br /> After I said that this is still pretty good mainly to Stan ... Watch out also from the scene that includes a fish.Not many jokes / plots from L & H are characterized by fish and that's another thing
