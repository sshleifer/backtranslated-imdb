I love this wonderful story film and the actors and film sets are good. I told the story in a way that I can easily understand and watch out without sleep. I would like to know where I can get the soundtrack. I can not find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where I can get the soundtracks. Unlike the inability to find soundtracks I thought the film was wonderful. Suizi did a great job. I think this is some of his best. His previous films were fine, but this film really narrated a change story. This date will be reduced as one of the best television films ever broadcast. Congratulations to the producers and writers of this great work.
