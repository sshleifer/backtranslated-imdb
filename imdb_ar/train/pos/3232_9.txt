I went to see this Finnish movie and I have to say it is one of the best films I have seen this year. The plot consists of 5-6 different stories, all of which occur on the same day in a small Finnish city. Stories come together very well in the end, and may remind us a little bit of the way Tarantino films are produced. Most actors performed well, which is certainly necessary in realistic dramas of this kind. I particularly enjoyed acting by Sanna Hietala, the lead actress, and Juha Kukkonen. I have noticed BTW that IMDB has the wrong information about Sanna. Her name, as noted in my assessment;), is not Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
