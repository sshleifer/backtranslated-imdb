"Domino" was widely condemned in this site for its overheated editing and "fatal" imagery. Critics cite its simplism and criticize the publication of "style on substance" and I did not disagree with it. I think Domino is the culmination of Tony Scott's life in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> After Tony Hollywood devised the style of motion pictures in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tony Scott gradually approached a more self-directed style of cinema. Early in using Crimson Tide, Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - the phobia of fear and drama inherent in the conflict aboard a nuclear submarine embodied in the excellent use of long lenses along with framing the broken corner. He was then transferred to the "enemy of the state" and "spy game" which visually represents the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" was a severe departure, a transition to a more expressive aesthetic aesthetic. Scott used here the old hand-cultivated camera and flash frames to express his extreme anger for his character. Although not fully successful, the techniques they found full expression were presented in "Domino" <br /> <br /> He was placed in a FBI interrogation device "Domino" and displays the life of the notorious reward hunter through her novel Fragmented Fragments of Memory . It clings to memories as we all do in fragments, flashes and short clips. As Domino narrates her story orally, Scott portrays her visually not only to illustrate the events she describes, but also the view she directs. She has "mescaline effects" in her system but her individual vision is in any case unusual - that woman who has given up the luxury life of the reward hunter. <br /> <br /> When Domino begins to link the events that lead to her capture, Scott really lets rip. Together with cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry Gregson Scott Williams are organizing a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that it is unusual for Domino to be more disassociated than the "90210" culture you rejected. As he wanders through this cultural mix, Scott makes his opponent more aware of the innocence that destroys the deprived children. In the end, Scott depicts their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film for being too poetic is a criticism of Picasso or Pollock for not representing what is a recognized human being. Like any fantastic painting, the meaning in "Domino" exists in the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not in any way connected to Scott Free, but I have always been and still admire Tony Scott's work.
