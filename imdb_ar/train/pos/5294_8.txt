Pecker proves that Waters has no intention of changing his attractive ways in his old age. Much has changed since Waters began making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he still does what he wants to do. Over the years, Waters' budget has increased dramatically. This is one of his latest productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still possessed the touch of the Trailer Park. Edward Furlong plays Becker, a child obsessed with photography. He lives a quiet life in Baltimore, Maryland, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a technical agent in New York (always Laila Taylor), and his life changes to the worst. Again, Waters ridicules art, fame and other sex. It is not among his best films, but there is some great laughter from the belly here ("Memama" has the best lines in the film!). She's always smart and funny, and she has a very "weird" feeling that I like in Wires movies.
