What can be said, really ... "The Tenant" is a sexy first-rate film made in equal amounts of paranoia and suspense. It's a complicatedly planned film - all the details seem to be listed for some reason - although the plot is rarely logical, and many of them have never been addressed objectively. Thus, we have left with increasingly unstable Trilkovski (Polanski), a Polish gentleman who got an apartment because of the suicide of the former tenant, to guide us into a world of fear and uncertainty. After a party for the warming of the apartment delivered by a group of abominable coworkers, Trilkovsky is exposed for further scrutiny, which is apparently unexplained by his fellow passengers of the building; the rest of the film depicts his mental deterioration and gives us an equally comprehensive idea with his subsequent efforts David Lynch. "Tenant", however, is more brood and sinister, topped with unexpected comic relief, beautiful performances, and really painful degree. It's a film with a better experience than description, so jump into it.
