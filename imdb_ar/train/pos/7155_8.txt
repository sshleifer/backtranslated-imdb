More than just a "children's film," the "holes" look at how past events continue to affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When Stanley Yelnats III (Xia Lipov) is sent to the prison camp where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal relationship with him. Through past memories, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you will understand this better when you see a movie). LeBoeuf works well, like other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kitt. Very interesting movie.
