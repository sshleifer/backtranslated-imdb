If you like adult comedy, like South Park, this is almost the same as the little adventures of three teen girls in Promwell High. Kisha, Natalya and Blattera gave explosive sweets and behaved like bitches, and I think Kisha is a good leader. There are also little stories going on with school teachers. There is a stupid manager, Mr. Bibb, a neurotic math teacher and others. The cast is also wonderful: Lenny Henry, Jenna Yasir, East Enders Crissy Watts, Tracy Ann Oberman, Smack the Bonnez Don MacShane, Dade Rangers Mark Perry and Blinders Nina Conte. I did not know that this came from Canada, but it is very good. very good!
