I would say that this is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. I liked the first time but I really appreciate it on the second look, just a few weeks ago. I can see why the sequel is doing such wonderful work at the box office. Apparently, many people like this movie. <br /> <br /> A great color palette (man, this looks good) and lots of good humor (but clean) make this a great winner. The opening scene is 3-4 minutes with "Scat" as excellent as later. "Master" laziness (expressed by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the film. He usually has something funny to say throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the Mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the evil man who turned into a good man sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> These are not just comic and beautiful colors but a nice story And emotional about how to soften a small child to two difficult people. This is not interrupted by many songs, either: only one short and there is nothing offensive, linguistically speaking. <br /> <br /> If the animation is good, I'll have more.
