Of these Pokemon movies (which are arranged for me at least): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200, Pokemon: Entei and Unknown, this may be the most related to the environment, It can be said the most beautiful and quietest. Whether these points are good for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever", still enjoys a lot. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three points described above, this Pokemon movie includes a good humor and a good CGI (as well as anime). The theme of travel through time is represented in the film in a good way, and Team Rocket ends up with very good pods and ends up becoming more important figures than side numbers. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages are, as always, somewhat unnecessary violence, and Paddy is largely uninterested, even more than just a number of villains in the Pokemon movie. <br /> <br /> A strange Pokemon is tracked by a Pokemon hunter in a forest. A little boy tries to save the Pokemon and takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter a big forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious? See more ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pok√©mon lovers and American cartoonists, and enjoy Pokemon 4 Ever! :-)
