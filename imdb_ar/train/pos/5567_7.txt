I will tell you the reason: who decided to modify this film to make it fit for television was very unwise. Everything about drugs disappears and disappears !!! How do they do that, you might ask? Well, they do not do it well, that's for sure. However, instead of the marijuana supposedly owned by Chish and Chung, they are said to have diamonds! However, the characters wandering in the haze of marijuana smoke stoned others along their way without any explanation at all!
