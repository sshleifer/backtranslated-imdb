I've seen a lot of PPV's in the past but this is the most entertaining, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. DVD extras are worth it because they give a different view of how the wrestlers acted after the show (like Chris Benoit's interview / Edge interview), and some glimpses of Monday Night Wars, the first Hogan match. Gold and some promotional talk. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Team Tag Team Matches: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 This was a very good game to start the show. There are not just a lot of arguments and purely physiological. Spike could hold himself in table games and gave Guerrero and Benoit good wrestling skills. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight: Jimmy Noble w / Nidia vs Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd did not care about any of the wrestlers and did not care until Kidman starred in the shooting star. People often expect a big rise in the Cruiser weight championship, but that was very little. In fact, it was so bad when Noble struck his final device, nobody cared or knew him (you can tell there is no flash of the camera). The end was quick though. <br /> <br /> 3. European WWE Championship: Jeff hary v. William Regal 5/10 I never liked Regal as a wrestler, he lacked strength and elegance. Hardy was impressive but he really did not get a chance to show his high moves, although he still had some good counters and added that a quick pace was needed. We ended up quickly and that was perfect for this match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny to look back at the first appearance of the PPV channel in Cena, how he used to act, how he used to wear his clothes, and how he used to look (see the interview, it's funny). It was a good match with Cena, offering a great variety of suspensions, delays, meters and some antenna. Jericho was substandard but he helped Sena definitely launch his career. Win Cena. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 It was a very strong and good game. Both wrestling patterns match well on the screen, with exclusive Brocks moves and raw energy versus full RVDs and speed skills. RVD looked great in this match (better than his subsequent games with Edge and Sena) and the entire game was quick. The end worked perfectly because she still retains Brock's defeated behavior while RVD gives his fair-sized sweets in his mother's condition. <br /> <br /> 6. Does not match qualification match: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Other strong games lack a certain intensity like RVD match but still a good follow up. Although it started somewhat slowly (always with a big show), Booker T was impressive and made a sick move at the announcer's table. The finish was great, and the end was a big surprise and a big jump for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a modest match. As usual, Hogan goes out into pop music, but the variety of his movements lacks such intensity and energy. Then again Christian does not have exactly the greatest mathematical abilities himself. It ended up being a modest match at best but still agrees to the PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. The triple threat match for the tournament is undisputed: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easily match the year. This is by far the best triple threat game I've ever seen. It had close waterfalls, lots of finishes, stolen finishes, raw energy, rigidity, and fast speed. No one can expect who will come out of this one. If you want to buy this DVD, I will buy it for this game. (Overall? Watch yourself!) <br /> <br /> In general, this was a powerful PPV game with lots of goodies that make you see again and again. Although it is hard to find (I had to pay a bit more than usual on this DVD) it is definitely worth your money.
