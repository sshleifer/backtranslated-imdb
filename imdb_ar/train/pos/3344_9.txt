I went to see Fever Stadium with my mom and I can say we liked it. It was not a traditional romantic comedy, where someone sympathized with the other, blah blah blah ... did not wait for the first kiss or meet at the end. It was more realistic, because you saw them during the relationship, rather than having the whole movie related to them. People can relate to the film already, because it does not seem like exceptional circumstances, or impossible situations. It was really funny and I think it was the best performance for Jimmy Fallon. All in all ... I would definitely recommend it!
