Before I saw this TV movie, I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After seeing him, I realized how Lucille Paul's life was really sad. It was a wonderful moment, but I did not realize how sad it was. This film was very good and told the story of the well-loved Lucille Paul. I highly recommend it.
