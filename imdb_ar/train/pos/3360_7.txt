On May 1938, when a rally celebrating Hitler's visit to Rome was the backdrop of a love story between Antonette (Sophia Loren) married to a fascist (John Vernon) and Gabriel (Marcelo Mastroiani). She is a boring housewife and has many children, a gay unhappy, solitary who is fired from the radio and pursued by fascists. She was left alone at home when her husband had to attend the historic celebration. Then they both develop a very enjoyable relationship despite their differences. The film is shown at the historic meeting of Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini with other authorities such as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III, describing events through a radio voice that sometimes provokes outrage. <br /> <br /> It is a romantic drama performed sensibly and sensitively. A relentless love story between two opposing characters. Offers wonderful performances from two fantastic movie pros worth watching. Of course, the Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola scenarios have exciting, fun and emotional results. Cinematography and atmospheric photography by Pascualino De Santis. The emotional musical result by Armando Trovajoly with a polite and sensitive. The film won the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film. <br /> <br /> The imagination of director Scola extends to highlight limited scenarios where drama is developed. His films are usually staged in several stages and are semi-staged. For example: Lee Bal¨ (1982) uses a French dance hall to illustrate changes in society 2) uitNuit of Varennes (1983) The trick is the scenario where it encounters an unlikely group such as Thomas Paine, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette who fled revolutionary Paris 3) "The Family" (1987) are all held in the old Grand Roman apartment of the family; and of course 4) "Una Giornata Particulare¨" or "Special day" where Loren and Mastroianni reside in a wonderful relationship in each apartment and on the flat surface.
