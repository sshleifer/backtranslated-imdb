My favorite film of all time. The Oscars work by all involved, in front of the camera and behind it. Perfect scenario, explains the relationship between Ms. Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The care that has been used by other eminent personalities is a tribute to writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won the Academy Award for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Media. It is the best work for Jose Lawrence and I do not think of Juan Blaouette. After watching this movie 50 times at least, I do not find it wrong. Music, written by famous composer Richard Rodney Bennett, is a marvel.
