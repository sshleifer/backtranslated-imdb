The zero day of the Columbia High School massacre is based. And in a video diary for two boys. At first you do not know what will happen you think it's a bad student film. So they start talking about the terrible things they will do at this school. So they start talking about bombs, pipes, guns and shooting in the forest. They have a lot to say about this film. Everyone knows that this is a movie that forgets that you are watching a movie and watching a real video made by two children. <br /> <br /> Boys behave like they are in a strange cult. They burn everything there. Such as PlayStation Games DVD Books Stuff Stuff School Stuff. These guys can be either your friends, brothers or people you see walking down the street. There is a daily activity (and this makes weapons.) The videos they send indicate the bullying that happens to them and how people said things about clothes there and the things in which I do not say their right but many people do things like that. </ P> <p> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> So let's just say that scene has been corrupted shooting.
