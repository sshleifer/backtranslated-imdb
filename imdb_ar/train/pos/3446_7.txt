Yesterday I attended the first world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. I had a good time. It was sold and attended by all major stars including my colleague Marcus Patrick Spacer. <br /> <br /> I give movie 7.5 starting from 10 stars possible. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. You can visualize the typical college environment through wild parties and adventures. The photography in this film was excellent. Meet Jared (Chad Faust) and become loved. It looks like no other relationship at first. Men are looking for women's interest and passion and women are playing hard to get them. Both played this well. A very innocent flirtation between the two. He calls her to his apartment and everything collapses. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very gloomy and dark. They end up in the basement which is very dark and lit by many candles. This really reminded me of a cell. This is where his true colors appear and continue to be raped. This rape scene is very dark and brave. This scene is not for the youth or the weak in the heart. The rape scene is long and difficult to capture, but it is necessary for the rest of the next film. <br /> <br /> Maya now begins to lose her soul because of drugs and sex. It lies in its own abyss. She begins to attend the most violent party and wakes up in a room in the morning without remembering how she got there. She was told to go see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say, "He's the one who saves anyone who needs to save." Is actually the person who offers Maya drugs. They start with a dependency relationship that comes into effect later in the film. The scenes of the club were filmed at this stage of the film with great experience. I thought they were good and noted that the director of photography had been praised at the end of the show during the credits by the audience. <br /> <br /> Then Maya returned to college as TA and who was in her class - Jared raped! You can see the confusion and passion on Maya's face. What should I do?? What am I doing then? Her face shots and emotions are priceless. <br /> <br /> What happens next does not actually happen. It works interested in Jared. She seems to be looking forward to reviving the relationship and being loved again. I was sitting there saying this could really happen. Not so. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him to her apartment and of course appears. Now her apartment is dark and brave. It has a completely stripped. He thinks he will be lucky. And then harass him like any woman. She is everywhere and excited. Note: For anyone planning to watch this movie, this scene is completely naked - it may not be appropriate for younger viewers. <br /> <br /> Then you change the situation and become the monster and continue to rape him. Once again, the scene is dark, brave and very cruel. <br /> <br /> If you are watching the movie and do not want to know what happens next, go to this paragraph and go to the last paragraph. <br /> <br /> This is where Adrian returns the image. Maya had Adrian rescued her (?) By having sex with a very tough male with Jared. She believes this is the ultimate revenge. Adrian still takes Jared's manliness and removes his dignity to nothing. Marcus, as Adrian, plays this scene as much as it can be believed. It's a strong actor playing strong personality and strength that stands out all over the screen. After the film, during a question and answer session, Marcus explained that this scene requires a lot of confidence between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her, but I do not think she does. One of the final scenes has a close-up Mays face and you'll see a tear roll in her cheek. This was a wonderful close-up scene, and it always provokes a discussion of anyone going to watch this film. Have you got the revenge you want ?? Was it as satisfactory as I expected? In my opinion, no. It makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, will play good roles, and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking of going to see it. I'll be a bit hesitant if I'm under 17. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be commended for doing a good job. Guidance and photography should also be commended. It was a night I enjoyed.
