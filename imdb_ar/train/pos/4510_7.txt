The insistence that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit lies not only in American civil liberties but within the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Helmer Danish Niels Arden Opoleff transmits this belief to a Danish middle school in 1969. More specifically, Frits (Janus Desing Ratke) is charged with the headmaster of the Samad school, which assaults the Knesset and Svendens (Bint Megeding). Quoted from a true story, performances are performed with a certain aplomb and a refreshing order on their diverse characters makes them involved. The battle of ideologies between a 13-year-old man and a different specialist opens the way to the spirit of innate humor, but embarrassing shifts in mood patients, while keeping them ridiculous in the same context as the Dead Poets Society rather than Matilda. It follows a familiar route but the continuous and accurate service of the young protagonist, including a personal sub-plan almost Frites when he becomes a young man, was able to raise the film to a sexy family movie with his nose on the money.
