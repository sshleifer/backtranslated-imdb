This "tragedy" by the famous Serbian dramatist / filmmaker Dusan Kuvasiewicz is probably one of the best films made in the comedy category. However, its appearance of a theatrical theater turned into a feature film does not take any of its value. No one should miss seeing (preferably with translation, not dubbing). <br /> <br /> In an old bus on its way to the capital Belgrade, the impending war sets out the behavior of the passengers. Two of the gypsy musicians sings about their miserable lives, but they expect a tragedy to come; their songs divide and connect stages in this extraordinary road film (Real Life, the Kostic Brothers amateur actors, but with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who plows the way performs realistically). <br /> <br /> The spectrum of characters gives a wonderful picture of a society facing war, an insight into the collective person of the nation: everyone knows that war is about to begin but they try to live their own lives as best they can, hoping that ignorance can avoid tragedy. Using a simple cinematic language, director Slobodan Segan paints a picture of the war-torn society (World War I), but also highlights personal images successfully: the singer's boycott, the inexperience of the newcomers, the seriousness of the old warrior in the Great War on his way to visit his son, Recently recruited and grim predictions of a man who appears to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Wonderful in his narrative, with memorable music (especially Gispsy songs) and a well-adjusted atmosphere, this feature (for the first time in Sijan), filmed and edited is just an introduction to a series of nice comedy films for directors, Serbian cinema in the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota" and my favorite director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
