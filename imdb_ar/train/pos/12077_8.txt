I enjoyed this mysterious 1945 film about a young woman, Nina Fuchs (Julia Ross), who got out of work and dropped in her rent and was desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushed to try to get the job. Julia gets the job and is hired by Mrs. Hughes, who asks her to live with her employer in her home and wants not to get involved with male friends. Julia tells them she does not have a family or is free. To dedicate it throughout this task. George McCready (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some exotic desires in playing with knives. This film was low budget, and most scenes were close in order to avoid calculating the background and costs of the scene. This exotic family lives in a huge palace off the Cornwall coast of England, there are secret doors and lots of suspense.
