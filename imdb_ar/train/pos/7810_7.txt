What is the "cry of freedom" like? It is simply a wonderful and unique experience on how South Africa was made and how blacks in this country were oppressed by whites. The main character in the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Klein), editor of the Daily Dispatch in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, critically speaking about the views of Steve Pico (Denzel Washington). He meets Sun Woods Pico, changes his views on him and begins to understand what black authorities are doing in South Africa (from the top, even from the chief of police). When Pico dies in police custody, Woods decides to write a book about him and no matter what he should publish. But Woods must escape from his country to publish this book and also put his family in second place, so that the world to know the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough has produced a good film about people, with the main message being that black and white are the same, because we are all people. The story will lead us to South Africa and this film is a great way for the whole world to see what happened in that land, and I am disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie. This is a movie from which we can learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story can not be presented in any way because the director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to publish this book after Pico's death. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Biko has also been dramatically demonstrated, just like the capture of these two individuals and all the problems they face. But sometimes sacrifices (Pico's death) must be made until the truth is discovered (the Book of Woods).
