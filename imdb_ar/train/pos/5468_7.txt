I have not seen a refund or any issue of this issue, from "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I pick it up on TCM. What a wonderful movie! In short, Laila lives in a noisy conversation, and has been tossed by her father since she was fourteen! Then he still explodes as he kills Leila (Stanwyck) alone for her black maid Chico, played very well by Teresa Harris. Leila heads to the big city of New York to decide to use her sex to reach the top. She does it in a wonderful way! <br /> <br /> She lurks a hazy writer to enter the ground floor and moves to go through men like disposable sweets! One unloads his fianc√© and kills his close mother-in-law, as well as the father of sugar in Laila, and then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! Stannick is wonderful as a girl who does not really know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris, she goes to Cortland, played by George Brent, and she marries, but when he is in deep financial distress, the bolts. Almost free of Chico and a half million, realize she likes the court! Lily races to find it, but will you be late? <br /> <br /> This is the Hollywood preset in its best. Stanwick has a phenomenal appearance and music in the film is perfect. This reminded me of "original sin" with Angelina Jolie, another exception that was unfairly ignored by an unethical woman, and those who did not like the romantic romance films, would not like Baby Face better, those who believe in sex, love and power, love her. Highly recommended! Look!
