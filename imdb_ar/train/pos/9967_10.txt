There are some things I will never understand; why lingerie comes in packs of thirties when it is clearly not enough is an example. Similarly, I will never understand this film ever, and this is wonderful. If you come close to this movie you expect a real film, you may also approach the devil expecting a hug; although this may be possible if you receive the characters of this satanic movie. Take the stadium, for example, the most effective image of the camp and the intangible of the devil since Freddy Mercury and Win Slip unite to form a demon's uniform 10 feet of red body paint and horns covered with condoms, yet it creates some of the hilarious moments of any film at all. Seriously, this is not an understatement. The same may apply to any other person, except for the young girl who acts with a very sick innocence and may be compensated for some serious crimes to which she belongs. Then again, if the Santa station for space between space is real, there is no chance to avoid it this long time. Simply, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself a serious Portuguese. The funniest description, representation, concept, and racism that is almost without radar make it necessary to see any film so far (if you're having a good laugh).
