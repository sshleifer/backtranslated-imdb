I can not understand the negative comments about this film. Yes, it is a typical friendship for the girl, but it is done with taste and refinement so that the time will come. Henstridge (talk about winning the lottery gene!) Is as magnetic and attractive as ever (who says the golden age of cinema has died?) And Vartan holds his own. <br /> <br /> Lead two. The movie is alive when they share a scene - a lot! Well done so you're ready to meet ... <br /> <br /> Ignore negative comments - if you feel a little blue, watch this click, you'll feel a lot better. If you're really happy, you'll be active. <br /> <br /> (Note: I am a thirty-three-year-old from the UK and a hopeless romantic is still looking for the princess ...)
