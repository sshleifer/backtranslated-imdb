Again, I was browsing the discounted video basket and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time I find films in the trash is sheer nonsense (I mean, beyond the imagination), but half of the time I arrived was surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very attractive, although it is obviously made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> The trend is not distinctive, but the story is interesting with some good tweaks. I was expecting to be more of a comedy, but I was not very disappointed. <br /> <br /> For the excitement, this film is surprisingly sweet. There is no bloody violence, no blasphemy, nudity, no sex. Typically, these movies require all these four elements. The rating of PG deserves it well - not like "sixteen candles" where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short nude scene for free. <br /> <br /> I wish only romance between Corey Haim I love attention may be put more. The film tends to be a heavy plot, and potential sub-plots are pushed to the side. Instead of developing chemistry between the two, we ended up with a three-minute montage in their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing in the end, but there is a little chemistry that seems forced. <br /> <br /> The Dream Machine is not a gem, but it is good and clean entertainment. It is something that can be completely forgotten - especially with a group of unknowns, except Haim - but it is also much better than you would expect. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 7 (out of 10)
