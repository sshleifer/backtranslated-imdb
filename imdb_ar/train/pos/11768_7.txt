This film surprised me in a good way. From the box, I got the impression that it was a thriller but it was funny to be an exciting film, although it was rather exciting. <br /> <br /> This film was born and James Belushi to do Bill Manucci, he does a wonderful job. The rest of the actors are not too bad, especially Timothy Dalton is fun. <br /> <br /> The story can become very confusing sometimes when new characters appear during the movie. Things get complicated, as the truth rarely tells us about things. If you do not care, things may end up being a bit unclear but I really like them. <br /> <br /> Luis Morneau is not well known but he did a very good job with this I never felt impatient while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The manufactured men deserve review.
