When he was a teenager at the time, Airwolf was watching a forced offer of a generation of "cowboys and Indians" to have amazing tools and powerful explosions. <br /> <br /> The show was essentially Knight. Rider in the Sky: The same comic book technology, a central character that was in essence single, and the frequency of the concept of one man makes a difference. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways, they were of very objective significance different from the Knight Rider, Hawk Street, the team and other motion shows at the time. For one reason, the serial hypothesis is based on the desire to help those in need, but by possessing Hawke's Stringfellow Hawke for essentially selfish reasons (as a pressure to try to find his brother MIA, St. John). Then there is the dark edge of the serial's existence in the context of the Cold War of the 1980s, with Soviet espionage and dictators in Central America, not to mention the enemy at home. Sure, the A-Team team always refers to Vietnam and put the team as Harbin, but was generally done with a slight touch and was seldom essential in the plot itself. With Airwolf, intrigue was the key to the tone and direction of the show - although it was loosened (incorrectly) with serial continuity. <br /> <br /> As it is too late, the preparation of the Cold War is clearly back to the history of the series. Many stories are sordid and contradictory, and much of what Airwolf does is not clearly possible even with today's technology. But this is not really the goal. Airwolf was very fun. He tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on large traffic sequences, and did not cover everything with sugar by making sure that someone died miraculously. Sometimes it failed, but it often succeeded admirably - and on the TV budget to take off. <br /> <br /> For UK readers, DMAX (Sky 155 channel) just started to restart Airwolf daily (January 2008). Set the Sky + box to this explosion of the past - we may get the fourth season redesigned and restructured (unfortunately), which was not previously displayed in the UK at all.
