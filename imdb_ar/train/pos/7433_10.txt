My mom took me to watch this film when it was released around Christmas 1976. I loved him then and I love him now. I know everyone is making fun of Barbara's hair in this hair, but I think she looks great! ... I seem to remember a number of women who copied that hidden copy at the time! Also, the bathtub scene between Streisand and Christoferson is very sexy! The music is great as well. This is the 70th door in its gorgeous at its best!
