Winchester '73 was the movie that moved Man from B movies to the Big League, saving the distressed James Stewart's post-war career by portraying him as a conflicting hero (although he inherited the project from Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang deserves credit). The two men will go to darker places - Mann with the heavily oppressed Devil's Door entrance, which was suspended by MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to launch it ?? But a movie about a man chasing his brother where the gun is delivered the address from person to person along the corridor before ending up in a favorite movie director's favorite at the foot of the mountains is still flesh stronger than you would expect from the studio system. Wonderful dialogue, impressive support team? Dan Doria, Will Gere, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McInter, JC Fleben, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them? And a stunning visual sense of man lifting the ribbon with this one.
