Certainly this movie was not like. 16 blocks, inside man, american haunting. Etc ... <br /> <br /> But it was a great mystery that could happen to anyone of us .. I found this movie really wonderful and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where this film was shot "San Pedro, California" and we have heard real stories based on the events of this film. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you have heard about the famous boat at Long Beach Queen Mary, this boat is haunted. I believe in seizures and delusions in parallel or with that spelling. It's real. Everyone in the universe is there. <br /> <br /> The mind is a strong thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. It's great, not bad at all. <br /> <br /> For those who classify them 1. They do not understand the film. Its meaning. Her plot, her point of view. How bad the ocean is for each of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
