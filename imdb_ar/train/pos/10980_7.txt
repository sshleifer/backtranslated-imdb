I watched this movie two weeks ago and it has been stuck in my head ever since. Starring two of the characters in an average documentary, unfortunately. To get the real story of Piles, I had to go around all the additional articles and comments on the DVD and search the web. <br /> <br /> Although Maysles and their admirers (not to mention Edith and Eddie themselves) are rude in suggesting that this film is exploitative, that is to exploit in the true sense of the word. Every effort is made to explain Beales or how they came to the situation where they were - it seems that the Maysles approach is just running the camera and wait for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. Sound, even when re-issuing the Criterion is weak and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate that this film was produced fairly early in the history of the documentary, it is paradoxical to compare the Geraldo Rivera (!) Series superior to the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at the State School of Willowbrook on Staten Island since 1972, four years before the shooting of Gray Gardens. <br /> <br /> To rewrite a New Yorker review, there was a lot of things Edith and Eddie needed in their lives, and the documentary was not one. <br /> <br /> For Edith and Eddie, the thing I kept thinking about while watching the movie was "Where the hell is their family?" They were living in dangerous, unhealthy and unsafe conditions. How could Jackie O, married to one of the richest men on Earth (or the wealthy Boffiers themselves) afford Edith and Eddie's house? Or at least hire a housekeeper or part-time caregiver to come and watch them both? It is shameful and shameful for all members of the Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may seem negative, I strongly recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries. Maybe one day someone will come and make a documentary about this documentary - bringing with it the rich film (and beyond) of Bills and the entire Hamptons community in the 1970s.
