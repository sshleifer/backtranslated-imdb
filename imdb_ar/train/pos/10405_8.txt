It was one of my favorite movies in my childhood, and I must say that, unlike some of the other films I liked at that time, The Thief of Bagdad stuck to its quality as I grew up. This is not just a movie enjoyed by children, but can be seen and enjoyed by adults as well. But the only drawback is that one can not see a past in the bad effects (compared to the effects at the present time) just as one can when he was a child. I did not remember any of these influences, of course it had been about ten years since I saw this film, when I was about 11 years old. Who is watching the effects? One just looking for good stories and entertainment is exactly what this film is offering. In my opinion, this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. When you think about it, I feel that the Indiana Jones movies look exactly like this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure in each one, creating a wonderful mix that will pick you up from start to finish. Although the film is old and the music and style of the films are not clearly modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great story, good direction and good performance of the actors. In that circle, Sabo (like Abu) and Konrad Vidat (like Jaafar) stand out, providing the most terrifying comedies of the film. Fantastic movie and although "the lizards' enemy, definitely" Goldie ". I hope someone has the brain and the courage to release it on a DVD someday. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
