Von Trier once explained how he created such a powerful participation of the viewer in his films by putting his film world in the middle of the real world and the imagined world. So, as viewers, we think we're seeing a "real" story, while in reality we're being manipulated, often to the point that the film is annoying (dancer in the dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idiuterne). Of course, Dogme's films were not a means to this theory (along with creating some welcome lights on Von Trier). <br /> <br /> The story is typical of the iPhone Trier: Our hero is perfect, and seems to balance him with relationships with everyone, but soon become a victim of problems that others have created in the past for themselves. Ideally, society must reject society in order to remain ideal and become a terrorist. The spoiled human race and purity only lead to self-destruction. (They were also everywhere in Breaking Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of sarcastic (even comic) tones about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical achievement, the film was beautifully designed: transforming faded colors, vanishing them, overlapping them on the screen and working on different overlays (with the mayor soon to be the most interesting). In this film, we can see how the good film Von Trier is treated as a technique. In his later works he seems to step aside (as if he no longer cares about artistic achievements because they are readily available).
