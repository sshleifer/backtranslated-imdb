I saw him last night on TV and was very happy. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of movie that makes you feel good and warm in the heart, and we think there's still some good in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see what Grace was doing to help and protect it - the old cop is my favorite) , Although you know that this story is not quite realistic. <br /> <br /> I liked acting (they all seemed ordinary and general, living in a small place that was the picturesque English coastal city) but the greatest thing in the film was intelligence and humor. Just remember the scene in the store with two big ladies after eating "tea" !! <br /> <br /> The ending may have been a bit confusing, but that did not stop me from enjoying it, the whole story!
