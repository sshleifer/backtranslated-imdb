Lily Mars may have provided to Judy Garland one of the easiest roles she has played while at MGM because Lily Mars is definitely a character she can recognize. She is a young girl who has enough talent for 10 years, and she knows she has what it takes to make her in the theater no matter how frustrating the producer is, Haflin from her hometown. <br /> <br /> I really liked Judy in this one as the girl is determined to make it into the theater. Because of Judy Garland with Judy Garland's talent, you know in the audience that she has the right things, even if it's almost necessary for van Hevelin to have the entire film convinced. <br /> <br /> Both Judy and Hevelin are descended from the same small town. Hephlin's father was the city doctor who was handed over by Hevelin and may have moved away to become a major producer on Broadway. Their mothers, Faye Pinter and Spurgeon Paington were in touch. This is her entrance, but Hufflin is constantly plagued by conflicting children, but no one has ever been like Lilly March. <br /> <br /> There were no real big songs from Lilly Mars to Garland, though she sings all her numbers. The best in the film is reviving the chestnut age of the invader, each small movement having its own meaning. Judy sings with Connie Gilkrist, who plays cleaning lady at the Broadway theater where Hufflin's show is produced. Gilchrist was a star in the days of FloraDora Girls, and my presence is presenting the song in a wonderful way with Connie. It is the best scene in the film where Gilchrist encourages Judy to continue. Composer Karl Hochna died a long time ago, but the musician Otto Harpach was still alive and I bet he was impressed by what he heard. <br /> <br /> European musical star Marta Egerth introduces Lilie March as the star of the show, which is initially confused, then furious and finally, Garland and Hufflin. She worked several films with MGM and then returned to Europe for more work on the continent. I bet that the MGM does not quite know what to do with its thick Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Meyer never met Soprano he did not like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin has done a good job producing a patient that poses lots of Garland and Eggerth. Hufflin had just stepped out of the Academy Awards for Johnny Eager the previous year, and it seems that Garland is not an ideal team on the screen, but they are not bad together. <br /> <br /> Introducing Lily Mars is a good show for the talents of Judy Garland. She did not have to share the screen in a backstage film with Micky Rooney.
