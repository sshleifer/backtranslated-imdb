<br /> <br /> The actors were photographed accurately. You feel real when you see Lucien climbing from poverty to the most beautiful girl around her. Feeling a tragedy by winning the tragedy again. All in all I have seen this movie at least 10 times. It can be said well that Prix De Beute (Beauty Award, Miss Europe) is the main favorite in my silent film collections. Louise Brooks's expression is perfect and I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty along with a tragic story.
