... when this movie proves well that it is not really necessary. <br /> <br /> Although there are a few lines, it was odd to watch this movie, no submarines, in an unknown language. A friend sent me a VHS, and included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated into English. With her translation next to me, I began to watch this story (it's a story already), and from the first tones of the Sfeir melody during the opening credits I was stuck. The colors, that minimal representation (well, in most cases), silly comedy, slapy, thoughtful, beautiful ... Besides some other films (Paris, Texas, Ninet et Bonnie), this one is able to talk to anyone's heart - without words. Whenever you get the chance, see it. Whatever you do - do not miss out. It's a once in a lifetime experience. Oh, wonderful acting, fantastic soundtrack, simple story and a thousand times story before - but rarely (like this?).
