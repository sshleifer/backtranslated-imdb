Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their flock from Seattle to Alaska and then to Canada to participate in a claim. As soon as they arrive, they have to confront the attractive and charming businesswoman Ruth Roman and the lucky cold cold lucky James McIntyre. <br /> <br /> John Wayne may speak more, but his good friend Stuart has some excellent Westerners with a strong edge, some with great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I would take this, with a strong traffic sequence and a fine melodrama, more north to Alaska on any day! <br /> <br /> The far-off country has some picturesque landscapes and cinematography which was certainly filmed in a wide screen. <br /> <br /> Also, there is some strong support from Brennan who is always reliable, the Roman (who is great), the unbelievably gentle Curren Curtiff, and James McIntyre, who plays one of my favorite types of villains, Who does not take himself very seriously. <br /> <br /> This would make a big bill with another Man / Stuart West Northwest appointment, Bend of the River.
