Because of the invention of the "domestication collar," zombies who control meat and become productive members of the community are being controlled; Those who live in small fenced-in towns of the 1950s, while an uninhabited zombie walks in the "wild zone", bring the dead dead. In the town of Willard, Cason Ray lives before adolescence (with Timmy Robinson) with his parents Carrie Anne Moss and Delan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, the Robinson family is the only family in the street that does not have a coma; their new neighbors, bottoms, have six. So, to keep up with it, Robinson gets a coma Billy Connolly (like Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "domestication" has been corrupted by an old lady's infantry and eaten; then, the new and hungry zombies invade the city. In the meantime, Ray grew up with Connolly (Timmy and Lassie) and the Robinson family found it difficult to cooperate with the dominant Zomcom authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go a long way in its interesting "wilderness area"; however, it adds colorful, elegant, and amusing amusing to the zombie movie traditions. Ray's performance casts well, separately. With zombie zombies Sonja Bennett (named Tammy) and Tim Blake Nelson (like Theopolis) the most distinguished couple. Director Andrew Corey and his crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jean Keiser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Wilcok (design) won awards. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ Cason Ray, Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
