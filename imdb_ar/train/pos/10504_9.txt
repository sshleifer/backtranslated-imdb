Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very enjoyable and very wonderful game for the N64. Bowser is up to his usual work (yes, it's a stupid word but the only word I can think of) and Mario must stop it again. This game is very enjoyable and has a lot of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about it is the graphics, which are awful for today's standards, but everything else is good (especially small mini-games that you can open) it's the second best game N64 (the first is the best on Bad Fur from Conker) Mario, or any of the basic game lovers. Super Mario beats Sunshine on any day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
