Sara Silverman program ... better than other programs. Do not laugh tracks, no painful jokes, just a program. Sarah Silverman. If you're like me and love comedy, it's likely to be an offer for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman presents a funny and funny experience here on the table easily. A combination of different styles, making it special. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start a comparative war, seeing how it has nothing to do with it (other shows). This show is his own entity, I think most of the heads of comics will love him so well. <br /> <br /> Go and watch.
