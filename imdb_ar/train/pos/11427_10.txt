I liked this film because in my opinion it seemed to capture what I was imagining exactly in French colonial Africa, it should have been the case in the 1950s ("Geely" anyway). But I was really angry because of the quiet speed and glorious end. During the last five minutes of this film, you have to focus on what is happening. I have never been impressed with the "summary" of the film. I remember yelling "Wow!" When I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch!
