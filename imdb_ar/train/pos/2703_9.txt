I'm not a fan of the huge camp and kind of watching "very bad it's good". However, I really like this film because of its fun factor - believe it or not - it is an innovation. <br /> <br /> Everything contains an episode of John Waters who is infinitely excited, but with some wonderful actors who are considered to make the most of the slippery and stalised movements. Billy Zane travels incredibly (see the scene on the bus for a lesson in the textbook on how to use the movement) and is surrounded by some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie, you may not like it, but if you have the opportunity to watch it, save time because the opportunities will end with a confused smile on your face and a new sense of humor for some of the big stars. Highly recommended.
