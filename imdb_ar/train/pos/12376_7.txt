The Sentinel (1977) is so impressive that it looks like "Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad World" from horror pictures, yet it is an effective creeping film that focuses on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this model, you play the role model, Alison Parker, who moves to the heights of Brooklyn Heights (which I do not think I give up much in this late history) near the Gate of Hell. As a tenant in this building, it suffers from much worse conditions than leaking plumbing and occasional water insects. In fact, the scene where Alison, her noisy neighbor on the top floor, is on the top floor is truly terrifying, and surely the icy water that walks through the columns of most viewers should be sent. Despite many critics' complaints about Renz's ability to act, she thought she was fine, more than just being skillfully kept in the scenes with Ava Gardner, Meredith Bergges, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Ellie Wallach. The picture turns into a quirky conclusion effectively, and although some plot points do not explain, I left feeling more satisfied. In the words of DVD Delirium, "Any film with Beverly Dangelo and Silvia Miles as nude female eunuchs in clothes can not be bad!" In a side note, I walked yesterday to 10 Montague Terrace in the Brooklyn Heights to take a look at Sentinel House. Yes, there is still, and although he is isolated from the heavy Ivy coat and lacks a blind priest / nun in the upstairs window, it only looks like it was in this picture. If this house actually sits on the entrance to hell, I take it that hell is ... Brooklyn Queens Highway. But we New Yorkers have known this for some time!
