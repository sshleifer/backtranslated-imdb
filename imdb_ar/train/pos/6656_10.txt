This movie is simply wonderful. It was a very sensitive issue and the film was great. This film did not create any controversy in India (as far as I know) and its propaganda remained low. At first I thought it would be a waste of time because most Indian directors and producers used to change the subject despite its sensitivity, add a love story to the original story and spoil everything ... Most Indian viewers agree on this subject if they mention Ashoka, Mangal Pandey and LOC and so on. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of movies in India that would have become a milestone or huge success if the part of the love story was not added unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> But her treatment is very similar to the Bingar movie (also to be seen). <br /> <br /> If it is important, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Fayrouz Abbas Khan (director) for making such a wonderful film ..
