The film is almost entirely shown in a public bath in China. No luxury groups, bursts or glamorous people - just good writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, notice!). <br /> <br /> Ibn Maabar returns to his home when he thinks his father is dead. He is surprised to see my father looking good and running the family business as usual. In fact, he notes that his father and his retarded brother have already established a close and caring relationship, and soon becomes clear that he is out of the loop! My father is very traditional and this visiting son of the big city does not really see the value of the old bathroom. How their relationship changes and where the plot starts, there is exceptional and believable. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is a moving picture (like those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), and I do not care much about these frantic movies. The Shower and Springtime In A Small Town are two great examples of good Chinese movies about people!
