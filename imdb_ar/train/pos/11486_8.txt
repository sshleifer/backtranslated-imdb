Watch this movie in Rotterdam IFF. You can question some of the decisions made by a maker - such as choosing a mockery model for a sensitive and terrible subject - but this movie definitely hits you in the gut. Especially the recent scenes were almost painful to watch. I hope you get the distribution you deserve.
