The "thieves and liars" offer us a very natural picture of the levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and force them to make difficult choices, if not impossible, for their lives and loved ones. The cast is excellent, given that some actors are professional. An excellent selection increases the level of reality in the film. Photography drives the story without breaking into, as it should be in this type of film. The script captures the peculiarities and attitudes of "Boricuas" in a very profound way. Sometimes you seem to be watching a documentary! You see this movie that you feel as if you had secretly entered the real Puerto Rican society and stood by its hidden sight explode. loved it!
