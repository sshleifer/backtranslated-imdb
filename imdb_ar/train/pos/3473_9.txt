I admit I felt some fear when I first saw previews of this film. Was VH-1 down on a hollow ground here? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not really look or look like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this film really surprised me. It's far from the exploitation film I was expecting. Instead, it's a study of the characters, a low, eccentric look, a bitterness in the end for friendship, and the final lesson we all learn: it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture what we had before and what we went through.
