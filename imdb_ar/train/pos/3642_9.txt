I watched this movie for the first time in 3 years, and it was introduced by the Disney President Eisener and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, he returned to the TV, this time you recorded him. Since then, I have to watch it at least three times. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful, inspiring and good-looking movie that has been intelligently written and reasonably done by all concerned. He resists going for every emotional trick in the book, as well as all the cliches. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to watch a movie where children do not have jerks and have a wide range of behavioral problems, and players are not portrayed as testosterone-powered heads. <br /> <br /> These are just ordinary people with dreams like you and I. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood has also gone from among other extreme things to what they call "courageous realism," making movies where everyone swears , And faces problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around a man with a dream, and friends and family encourage him to follow this dream. People at Big Lake TX seem so stylish that I want to go there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the movie does not try to elude feelings. Dennis Quid, as usual, never disappoints. I've seen it since the late 1970s, and it's very interesting. <br /> <br /> But this movie has excellent offers from everyone interested, and welcome to the book. <br /> <br /> A jewel in the movie is nearing the end when Jim plays in the hideout before the big game, and his wife calls out to him from the stands. He rushed and extended a helping hand to his family. The appearance on the faces of the other three shooters sitting on the seat in the bunker is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a speed change, choose this movie up.
