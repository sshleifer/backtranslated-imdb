I watched this movie for the first time when it was aired in 1988 by the BBC when I was working in the UK 2000AD. My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. So far, I've only seen Shaw Bros kung fu movies, with their harsh lighting (so the audience can see the movements clearly), so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like Riddley Scott had lighted out of Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to Tsui Hark's films (apparently, "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> Yet, in spite of all these smoky external elements and special ambitious influences (stop motion? in the Hong Kong film?) at the heart of the Chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story that has become more realistic through outstanding talent In Leslie Cheung's film (What a tragic and tragic waste of life!) The beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Granted Joey is gorgeous, but her ballet gestures that give her character an irresistible thrill are difficult to analyze. Although Joey is almost 20 years old (Jude, which of us is not?), This will always be the permanent image of that actress. <br /> <br /> Some critics here said the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises, but they lack the fact that the film was based on a famous Chinese story written by Bo Songling around 1700! This is somewhat like the complaint that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable end, and they only copy the West West story. (I just wanted to remove it from my chest!) <br /> <br /> To me, the Chinese Ghost Story is the perfect romantic story. Its a high tragedy, because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can not be together. She becomes mature, because none of us can mature until we experience a great loss. It is about sacrifice, because sacrifice is an essential element of true love. Wu's comedy movies also do not hurt a bit too. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Chinese GHOST stories by trying not to see them through a Western culture candidate and you'll enjoy them well.
