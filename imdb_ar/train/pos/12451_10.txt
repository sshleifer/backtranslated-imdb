Although I purchased the DVD when it first appeared, and I watched it several times, I did not write a review. <br /> <br /> I loved him when I first saw him and loved him. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems he has never earned enough money to motivate anyone to follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls rights, but after Kill Bill, if he makes a movie that is true for cartoons and books like My Name is Modesty, with another harsh female intro, anyone who is not familiar with the character will see this as a disappointment Amal. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than sensational excitement. <br /> <br /> The Tension between Modesti and Miquelos is very real to source material and tense, impressive and wonderful for anyone who does not have to have gore and bangs. Alexandra did a great job of figuring out how O'Donnell's character had dominated the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this especially in front of the curve after the badly needed re-runs from Batman and James Bond. After two previous efforts at first, although it was not known to the public, it is already a reboot of the modesty character, and it is truly sad that no more films will be produced.
