Ignore the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing a hazy day and many other dances, one duo with Juan Fontaine hapless. We see here that Astaire does what he basically dances in "Dances" in the purest way of his films with Ginger Rogers, before learning how to make full use of the film's potential. Best of all: the fact that we saw Burns and Allen before their comedy career for the radio / television wife, they are doing the dance they must have done in Fudville and had no chance in Paramount College films from the thirties. . (George was once a tap dance instructor). Two numbers with unique are high points of the film, and worth the wait. The first soft shoe trio is warm-up to the delightful "Chin up" carnival number, in which the three sing and dance through horse riding and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth acclimating under the "conspiracy". I've seen this once or four times, and I find the Quick Launch button useful.
