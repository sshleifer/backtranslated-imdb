I saw this film again and noticed how close it was to the novel if we ignored the part about Carrie's childhood [Leslie Howard]. Given that it <br /> <br /> At present there is not much to show on the screen, [there is not much in the novel], the obsession with Mildred [Bette Davis] is well transferred to the public. I recommend this movie to anyone who ever dropped to another person and the other side tried to take advantage of it. I read that he asked Mugam to record the novel for sale, but when he started in the studio he began to cry and could not finish more than a few lines and the entire project was turbulent. One can say that the novel is written from the heart and the film is good. <br /> <br /> At least part of it is adapted.
