This movie was great and I would buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a small eagle. The boy must feed the eagle and take care of him until he is old enough to sacrifice him for the crops. The boy saves the eagle from the murder and flees the tribe. Helps the eagle to feed him by catching a duck from a small pond frightened by the boy. Later on, the boy shot the deer, who was called a bulging child because their arrows were too close. Just until they check the thickness of the red lines, they decide who actually got the deer. But this was unfortunate because he made the other boys more cruel than him, and eventually he was chased on a slope but when he thought he would drop his pure love for the eagle turned him into a golden eagle with only an eagle to hold it as a reminder of who he was. Please find out if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, let me know. I have not seen him for more than 30 years, but I still remember parts of movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
