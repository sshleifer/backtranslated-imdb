Worst movie of all time? Wow, stand now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's what you expect a movie to do for you. I live in Oregon, so I enjoyed taking beautiful pictures of the familiar and still stunningly beautiful Smith Rocks images and other parts of downtown Oregon (plus our own sweet veil Ken Kensey and Ken Bapes overlooking the cradle of a Cissy child at the beginning of the film). These alone were enough to motivate me to give the film better than "average". <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was all about what you had expectations for. After reading the book since the last few years, thinking of myself "Well, no one could make a film of this interesting and strange book ... Especially after 20 years, when you can not put the habits (MORAYS) in the accent has changed on the Internet" - I have I was pleasantly surprised when I first saw the film when it was introduced in 1994 and I was so impressed today I see it again. <br /> <br /> Sisi has been beautifully written, and I do not care what you say. I was also pleasantly surprised by Ryan Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not lesbian, bisexual or transient, but I met many people who looked like the people who were supposed to be filmed - these "real" people acted the same way those actors acted. A little stooped, on stage - always a little "on". Gus Van Sant is a native Oregon native, but did a good job adapting this crazy book IMHO.
