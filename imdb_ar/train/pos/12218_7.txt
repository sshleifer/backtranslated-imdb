Japan in serious trouble. The Edo devils spread out, and got the earth shapes and discourage them from their unholy will. Moreover, the birth of Ashura, the queen of devils, was close. The only thing standing against this dangerous threat is the "demon guards", a frightening group of warriors who may be as bad as demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumu is a retired demon who, five years ago, took up the theater instead of killing a demon after accidentally killing an innocent child (in a battle that reminds us strangely of the fair scene from dusk to dawn). One evening she meets a mysterious and mysterious woman called Tsubaki. Their wealth is literally intertwined and they are bound to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like an epic fantasy / typical Japanese swords, you will be wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical about Ashura. It is a kind of different film. Those just mentioned, as well as comedy, drama and romance. Director Yogiro Takita (Onmyoji) plays the genre fairly respectfully (although the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but really funnier movie. <br /> <br /> The flaws in the movie. Some humor looks contrived, and out of place. Representation is not the greatest. But seriously, do you watch Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movies for great theater performances? No, we watch them for action and crazy CG images, all Ashura in the Spades. The film should not be misleading, but the film is not perfect, but it is singularly generous with lots of whips and buckets of green blood to keep the ordinary viewer happy. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the films contain errors, which are not epic martial arts, but they do not try to be, they have interesting images and a good duel movement. The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself very seriously, and if the viewer does the same thing, he will certainly be delighted by this fun and funny work. <br /> <br /> My rating is 7 out of 10. The Popcorn Movie is fun.
