Yes, it's over, yes it's all cliched and yes, Constance Marie is a complete babe and worth seeing again and again! Nicks and pokes may become old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. Since it is a family show, humor has been removed and the book guarantees values ​​and family ideals among gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny. Do not take it seriously, the winner is the winner. I'm sure he did not intend his character to be serious or a model of virtue. His blasts and cheers are hilarious ... <br /> <br /> I must say that the big dark and bitter spot is Benny. I hate personal ... so much so that anytime I work in it for more than 30 seconds, I'm silent on TV so I do not hear it. There is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes. As a mother, it must be the worst there, and I am quite surprised and surprised that George, in his personal capacity, will stand by this sad person for a long time. <br /> <br /> Even at any time I get annoyed outside of seeing Benny, I think to myself: I see her much better than having to watch Bill Engvall. Now there is a bad sitcom ...
