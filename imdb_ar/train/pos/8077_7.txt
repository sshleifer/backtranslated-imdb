A film made for the contemporary audience. The masses get what they want to see. Motion, comedy, drama and sensual scenes of course. This is not exactly a film one feels to see with the whole family. It's not for children's eyes. I had to progress quickly with a large number of scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just entertainment, you're looking for this movie. Attractive songs. Luxury production, I must add. <br /> <br /> However, the film's message is not universal. And emphasizes the idea of ​​Karma. That is, if you do well, you will get good. And if you do evil, you will get evil. The fruit of good works is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not always true. It is known that most people do not get justice in this world. While some villains meet an evil end, there are many who flee. Then, there are many people who do a good job, but in return they meet by the end of sorry. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about the message, and all you want is to escape the mundane reality, this movie is a fine artist.
