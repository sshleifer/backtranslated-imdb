Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by h. The producers turned it in some way, making the series successful without any h elements. This could not have been in any other way because the development of characters is absolutely wonderful in the way they appear in this series and any change in it may only destroy perfection. (You will understand as soon as you see all the episodes). <br /> <br /> Despite the relatively slow start (the product takes its time to present the characters), things gain momentum quickly and soon after the middle of the chain, the procedure becomes too intense to glue you to your seat. <br /> <br /> The theme of the series focuses on the Holy Grail War that took place in Fukuoka City 50 years ago. The pilot actually begins with the end of the previous war and develops from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that began during the recent battle and enveloped a large part of the city. He inadvertently witnesses a battle between two servants who call it Reiju (the holy sign) to call one of the strongest servants on the Saber battlefield. Leaving him first contact with Saber surprised him "such an invincible beauty ... I was in loss of words." <br /> <br /> This series should not be compared to any other string to fully understand. FSN offers much more than some wonderful sword battles, good animation, amazing lights, and brilliant soundtracks, as it offers personalized development and excellent relationships. Displays the changes that occur within character characters when events accelerate. The procedure reveals emotive, dynamic, believable patterns of individuals (not like the linear type used by the other series) that constantly shape their characters to reveal, under the mask of perfection, flawed characters. <br /> <br /> The Saber character is associated with the medieval legend that has been changed to suit this series and should be accepted as such. You should not see the FSN and think that it does not give the viewer a historical fact, just remember that this is a series of adventures / fiction and not a documentary film and enjoy this as long as you can. The end is sudden and unexpected, and if there is twice the number of episodes that I would be watching at the same time.
