This is the best movie ever to deal with AIDS theme. It is a documentary film about two men who live and die because of the disease. The film is beautiful, tragic, funny and incredibly moving. Above all, it's a truly amazing love story. Make sure you have a few ready hankies before watching this movie --- you will need it. Exceptional.
