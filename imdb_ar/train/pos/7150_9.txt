What a great movie! This reminds us of the wonderful Disney family movies of the 1960s and 1970s. I was pleasantly surprised, after the last twenty years of production of Disney live sets absolute. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. The baby stars were just that. Professional actors and quality. I was very impressed with the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was a complete membrane * built here * running a prison camp for lost children. Siobhan Fallon was a great mother of the star. <br /> <br /> I will not retract the story here because there is little point in doing it again, but the story is great, the direction was great and the acting quality was great! This work reminds you of being like a child, without feeling happy or being very depressed. Deleted scenes in a DVD copy were better left deleted. It was very harsh for this film and it would take a lot of it. While abuse was hinted at in the final product, it was not clearly demonstrated. The best way was this way. <br /> <br /> This was a very enjoyable movie to watch. <br /> <br /> He has earned 9/10 of ... <br /> <br /> Wicked :.
