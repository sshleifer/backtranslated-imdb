"Cinderella" is one of the most popular classics of Disney. It really deserves its status. The film is based on classic fairy tales as told by Charles Peroulet. The film follows the experiences and intrigues of Cinderella, a good girl who has been mistreated by her evil father's wife and unwanted children. When a royal ball is played and all qualified young women are called (read: the king wants to marry the prince), Cinderella is left at home while her father's wife takes her nieces with her. But there is a fairy godmother at hand ... <br /> <br /> The story of Cinderella will not be able to break down one of its features, so while generally adhering to the story is otherwise, somewhat incidental characters of animals Used by "Fairy Godmother" to help get the title character in the ball become the real Cinderella realism. The mice Jaq and Gus are the two main side-hunters, and the cat is the father of Lucifer's father. Their instincts generally overlap with the tale of major anecdotes, which are mostly fascinating. It is recognized that the film slows down a bit between the main intro of characters and shortly before the sisters leave the ball, but after this slowdown, the film becomes again surprisingly (since Cinderella is the most disturbing story of all time, it is likely to end up) As one of Disney's most engaging stories. <br /> <br /> Animation and artistic direction are beautiful: all nine older men on this picture, Mary Blair's colorful design art and design art (as she did the color design and design of " Alice in Wonderland "," Peter Pan "and" Three Caballeros ") manage their vibrations on the screen. <br /> <br /> In general, Cinderella is classified as one of Disney's best Disney games. The recommended stories are for young people and all that embodies Disney's philosophy. That dreams can really come true.
