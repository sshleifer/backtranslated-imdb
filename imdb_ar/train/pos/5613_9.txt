I am a very old man, old enough to remember the taste of Orius and coke as they were 50-55 years ago, when all the tastes of the child were new. I wish I had put some aside and then some magical hanging cabinet, so I could taste those things today. This magical wardrobe may have altered the fabric to take into account how drifted, physically and otherwise, a kind of dynamic chemistry of expectations. For half a century, they had to adjust a bit, because you see I knew I had put them aside. Eating now will be a celebration of the past, the story, and the feeling that makes the interval years almost a reward expected. And I can not invented one of those psychic magic reservoirs? If so. But I did something almost well. In the 1970s, I really read Roman Polanski. It was fun strange and strange ?? As you know, the films are smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Movies are so sensitive to beauty that they cry for weeks afterwards. Films that make you want to live with Polish women, then decided to be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what you did. I took what I knew would be my favorite film of Polanski and set it aside. I did not see him. I was delayed until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it. Over the years, I have experienced myself, and my ability to surround and identify beauty without occupying it. There are likely to be a few Poles who have worked in this, and are exercising the merit of Chopin. Working on deserves femininity when I see her. Try getting trainees from the edges. <br /> <br /> You've recently achieved something like the assurance that it's time to pull this out. I already knew that I had exceeded the time when I would work optimally, because I had already seen and understood the "Ninth Gate". <br /> <br /> If you do not know it, it is about a man who rents a room where the former tenant (named after the story) jumps out of the window to die later after the man's visits (Polanski). What happens is that time turns and becomes this woman. We are fooled into believing that he is just crazy. But the way we do it is not. He has only flashes that the world is normal, and that the people surrounding them are not part of the falsification of its reality. <br /> <br /> The story is not important. What matters is how Polancassi shapes this thing, whether in the way it inhabits the eye that makes the edges only and houses the body that is made up only of mutilated flesh. The two did not meet. There is a reluctance that may haunt me for the next 30 years. In an idea about the inside and outside with no edges at all? Absolutely except a red wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone who can do it, this fee that remains a fee, and this horror is still normal. <br /> <br /> To understand the genius of this, you have to know one of the greatest films ever made; "The Rear Window." The genius of this film is the idea beyond the noir that the camera forms the world; that the viewer creates the story. What Roman is doing is taking this movie and turning it inside out. In the back window, the idea was that the screen attendant (Jimmy Stewart) was an announcer and everything else was fantastic, as we woven as we saw. Here, the apartment dweller on screen is the director. We know this. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know that it is true that objects change identity, that time changes, and that causality is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that narrator will leave us in constant terror, on this edge that causes it, but it does not show us and allows us to imagine. <br /> <br /> TED-4 of 3: Every movie person must test this.
