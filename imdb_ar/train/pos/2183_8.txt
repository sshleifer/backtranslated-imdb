Billy Wilder is referred to in his story of the story, its unusual touches are remarkable in this story is completely original to the book writers who write about the ghosts and who work in the myth of burning music Oliver Courtney. The obvious misunderstanding is very quick, thank God, and the rest is a brilliant and humorous invention with some wonderful songs (and some of the most forgotten songs), Crosby in his most beautiful songs, his wonderful role from Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant The sharp criticism (Levant in a rare form and his claims is undated at all). Pleasant surprise, recommended to all lovers of this genre.
