<br /> <br /> I once saw No No's Land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and I found it just fine. The film revolves around a man who steals a Porsche only. He went in sixty seconds and comes after 13 years and adds nothing to it. In fact, it has a lot of scenes that are worthless. The result is very bad. <br /> <br /> Sphinx enjoys the presence of a magnetic screen that should have been used better ...
