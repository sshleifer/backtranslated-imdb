In 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara disappears after being a Cuban citizen for the last five years, leaving the face of Fidel Castro to declare that he may have died, while in fact he left Cuba to move to Bolivia to live a presumed identity. During his stay in La Paz, Guevara pledges to overthrow the corrupt bourgeois government there. Again, Steven Soderberg receives the place where "Che: Part One" is left (only better this time). The greater speed in the target, the very good acting task (including the turn of the mysterious Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say, it is better to see the two films most likely, to get the real story of Guevara and the type of guy who was (I had a rare open window of opportunity to see all of the movies in one show ---- talk about the long term!). As with 'Che-Part 1: The Argentine', this film has no MPAA rating, but contains enough salty language and violence to crush 'R'.
