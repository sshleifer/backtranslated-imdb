Ten out of 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I found only the Egyptian film disappointing). It is strange that everyone except the Mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in relation to the events of September 11: Afghan refugees, the deaf, the Palestinians, the Srebrenica widows, AIDS, poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochet's coup and the ensuing bloodbath. Suicide bombings in Israel and American Muslims who were afflicted by paranoia and the oppressed in the United States, the elderly who live alone, and in the wake of World War II in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This may say something sad about the limits of sympathy in both directions: directors may feel that Americans ignore the pain of the rest of the world and care only about their own tragedies, while doing the same effectively with their short films. br> <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find Sean Penn one of the best in the group, *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I think his portrayal of Ernest Borgnine is a half-crazy old man diving in an apartment in New York attested The happiest moments of a widow's life when the sun shines through his window after the WTC collapsed "away from light", I think this may also be one of the most egregious abuses seen by the general American public.
