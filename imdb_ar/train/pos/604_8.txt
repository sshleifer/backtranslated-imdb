Saturday June 3, 6:30 pm The Neptune <br /> <br /> Monday, June 5, 4:30 pm The Neptune <br /> <br /> Few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity work as strongly as the brilliant Carlos Saura interpretation Explanation of Isaac Albanes Masterpiece Iberia Pavilion. As the centenary approached, Sora gathered an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this perfect love song to their homeland. The twelve wing "impressions" are presented without narration in strict circumference, allowing all performance to explode before the Saura camera. The innovative use of large apartments and mirrors throughout the collection, along with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection, adds dramatic effects to a variety of songs, dance and performance. Alpenes photos appear throughout the program, linking the passion of music to its wonderful creator. Sora includes all Spaniards on stage from the beautiful elegance of old flamenco dancers in traditional costumes to children who dance joyfully with their coaches.
