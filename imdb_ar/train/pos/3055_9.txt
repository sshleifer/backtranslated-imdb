In his first work as a Hollywood director, Henry Brumel threaded a string of enchanting threads that were all about penetrating marital issues associated with a sad originality, and linking them to an equally enjoyable sub-scheme for successful businesses. The film is beautifully directed and consists of a wonderful cast of actors in addition to a fast-paced family-aware script (also by Brommell) that brings life to a cumbersome type. As a reward, "Panic" offers a terrible humor, an unexpected surprise, a charming, undeniable, and very welcome, through its humble, uncertain star, whose pleasant state is always interesting, especially given his line of action. <br /> <br /> The great William H. Messi forever captures our hearts as Alex, an unhappy, torn and middle-aged husband and father, finds solace in the most skeptical person: a young, attractive, chaotic 23-year- Sarah (Neve Campbell), where he meets in the waiting room of the psychiatrist's office, where the treatment of Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) is expected to discuss his growing interest in leaving the family work built by his father (Donald Sutherland). Alex, whose desire to live a new life out of fear of his father's dull disappointment, causes an ill-advised whim for Sarah, which eventually leads him to understand the essence and irresistible responsibility of being a husband to his wife, and most importantly to him, For his six-year-old son, Sami (played enthusiastically by beloved David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> The wonderful "panic" of Henry Bromel is rare in Hollywood rarely seen (with the exception of 2002 "Road to Perdition" since its debut in 2000, it has woven two opposing types (organized crime, family drama ) In a wonderful and warm piece of watching movies equally strong in either direction? And it's one that will maintain its extraordinary and rare brilliance for future ages.
