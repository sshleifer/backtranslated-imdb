An excellent story about teenagers, leaders and high school football "Stars". How far will you go to protect your friends? Lying, kill? How much can you lose if you are wearing an innocent girl? Can love overcome the odds? Can you defeat the people of a narrow-minded town? When your friend records "lose", will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it, or will you be a man in it, and respect her right to choose? Would you rape her and show her that she had won a "problem" girl? Can you stand by the only person who is sin to have her own opinion, to be able to make her own decisions and choose for herself? He made me think twice before judging who was right and who was wrong, but it is certainly a film and a very disturbing subject in general. Lift your thumb!
