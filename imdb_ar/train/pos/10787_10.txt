So when I was small I got this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved him. We were watching him all the time. When our friends came, we would feel like a bed and we would see a great mountain of rock candy and grandpa's magic games. I am now 21 years old and still love this movie, and some old friends. I have recently met and seen him, we knew all the songs, we danced and talked about how much we respected Profster when we were young. A friend bought this movie and played the magic of her two-year-old daughter because she wanted to convey our love for this film. It's really a movie you can make your children watch and feel safe, no violence, no bad language, just a lot of great songs and important lessons.
