I saw this in the theaters and I absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain ever seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kelly Mitchell and Paul Robbins were the match maid in paradise. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great like Blue Raja, and I especially liked that the character was not really British. The scene with him and told his mother that he was a supernatural hero brought tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that the Rami talked to the ball. He shared some of the most entertaining things with Stellar and his angry and false character Mr. Vorius, the fact that his threats and his members were all lamenting, and that they had no meaning. I can barely stop myself from applauding when he said "Ugly, Freinken-puss". But one of the things I enjoyed so much was that Captain Aamesing was already dying in the film. I highly recommend this film on any occasion, and give it my personal answer.
