This was really a wonderful movie. I loved Dennis Quid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very lovable and very enjoyable actor to watch. The chemistry that the team once had when they combined things together was amazing. It only showed what you could achieve when minds joined together for one goal. This team came back from the brink, after several losing seasons to win everything. I like movies like this because they are really very inspirational. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Dennis Quid's character gets a place in major tournaments. You can not do anything, but the root of this man. It seems like someone is supposed to do something, they will. Speak things in place and make everything click. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this film will really make you think of "nothing is impossible."
