This is one of the top five animated features of Disney, in my opinion. Cinderella's return was perfect for a long-length animated film (unlike the 1940s' compilation movies), and an expensive depth through the multi-level camera returns to the film in any other way. Although Disney adapts to the story fairly liberally, you gather the idea of ​​the times through dresses and set fashion patterns --- a clear time period for the story to occur. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multidimensional character. In fact, all the characters fairly sophisticated, except Prince - who left most - we know that he enjoys a sense of humor and a wonderful smile, but that's it. Like Snow White, Disney has some lasting influence on the story in popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella, the sisters are considered attractive, not only beautiful like Cinderella, and her personality takes away from her otherwise beautiful appearance. <br /> <br /> Disney favorite extras: Mice! Also, the estimated continuity - Cinderella always loses its shoes throughout the film. The addition of a home-made dress plus the next assault from the sisters was always dreadful as a child - I remember the Master View program showing this with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken slippers show Mrs. Tremin's unwilling unwillingness to give up her grip on Cinderella and admit defeat --- Odley will continue to describe the most evil villains among all the bad guys of Disney, the demonic witch, the Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
