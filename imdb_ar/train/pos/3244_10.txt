I can not agree more with Nomad 7 comments and I HVR. A perfect laid back film on Sunday morning. Humor is sensitive (the opposite of "hysterical" exactly as one of the misleading commentators noted). <br /> <br /> But what always stops my surprise is how many times I find myself wanting to go back to this movie again and again. I originally copied this movie to VHS about 12 years ago when it was first shown in a Pay Cable free weekend preview (maybe HBO?). Never heard before. I do not know why they are not marketed well. ?? When the DVD was released collectively, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A great mix of cast and writing. In addition, the back of the Montana wilderness does not hurt things (beautiful). <br /> <br /> It's probably not a comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler's stuff is in your alley, this may not be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. Humor is mostly in the dialog box. <br /> <br /> I think my next show will probably be at the age of 12. But I still know that when you get to scenes like those where the police hoods begin to explode, I'll miss it (Ed O'Neill's gorgeous face!). Recommended 110%.
