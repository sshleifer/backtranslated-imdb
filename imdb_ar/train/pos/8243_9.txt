In the 1950s, where the eruption of the upper part of the lead (caused by the mysterious "dust of space") was contained through the use of special electronic hoops, the young Timi was found alone in Fido (Billy Connelly). The domesticized zombie family recently gained. <br /> <br /> Fido soon became an alternative to Timmy, whose real father was unable to express his love for his son (or his hot wife to jog) who played wonderfully, Carrie Anne Moss, was suffering from psychological scars when he was a child When he was forced to shoot his father who tried to eat it!). <br /> <br /> Timmy encounters a place that disturbs himself, when he surrounds the collar of his corrupt friend, attacks and kills an elderly neighbor. With the authorities on Fido's trail, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new friend? Problem / fermentation with a pair of local bully, his mother in the composition of a link with help their unread home? Fido is a refreshing experience on the whole zombie lazy game, a completely entertaining, dark and delicious comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly cheerful spirit. Romeo's film was taken from a coma and planted in a small town in the 1950s. America is a stroke. The result is simply one of the most original films on the subject of the fully re-animated "Death". <br /> <br /> Connelly Fido is a movie comedic worthy of being listed in the Undead movie hall of fame, along with the Day of the Dead Bob, and the return of the living dead in Tarman; I do not often feel sympathy for the walking corpse, but the performance of The Big Yin is good So much so that I found myself wandering around in the big blue bag of pus! The other actors also make commendable performances, where the two young men K'Sun Ray (like Timmy) and Ms. Moss deserve special references? Ray, because, for a very small person, puts in turn a particularly assertive turn, and Moss because it is bloody very delicious! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I have seen this week (others are the somewhat disappointing planet of terror and the fairly fun journey of the living death), and I have a surprise that it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie gave lovers this kind of truly original stuff a treasure, a talent that must be seen in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, almost up to 9 for IMDb.
