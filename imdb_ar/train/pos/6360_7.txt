I have just read the main commentary of this film which appears on the front page with the vote results and casts darkness in it. <br /> <br /> Why can not some people film a movie for what it's supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This film is supposed to be light and blunt with comedy and family comedy and things that make children laugh and things for adults, and that's exactly what this film does. <br /> <br /> I laughed at my Nuts in this film, and I thought Carrie made a great show and that the whole movie (if you watch Christmas) really gives you some celebratory chants <br /> <br /> So for all of you, They look like film students and they knock every movie because it is not a "taxi driver" or "godfather" and they take films for what they are supposed to be, entertainment !!
