If you like kung fu movies and you do not see this movie, you cheat on yourself. This movie is one of the cheapest kung fu games that can be recommended for lovers of all kinds of movies. Usually, one really needs this type of film to see anything in these movies, but this movie has it all! The story is good, complete. The fighting scenes are fantastic and tend to end before you are completely bored with them (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself a heck of a single movie. See this one at all costs. Heck, so I enjoyed my wife out. <br /> <br /> Wu Duha! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
