What is forbidden in love?! People seem to have big problems with transsexuals. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie has not caught their attention. It was a lovely shot in about 4 minutes in the film which made me stop watching the channel. I could not believe how amazing this film was. It touches so many levels of human emotion that it never fails to react in a way. It's one of the best independent films I have ever seen. I did not see these figures either as a gender, but as a human being. I would recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Especially independent films. Praise to all the brave directors!
