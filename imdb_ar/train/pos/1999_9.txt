Oliver! Musical is my favorite. Music, characters and story. Everything seems perfect. In this presentation of the timeless classic novel that has turned into a musical theater, director Carroll Reid brings Broadway life onto the screen. <br /> <br /> Moving from music to music is not easy. You must have the correct sounds, the correct group, the correct text, and the correct operation. All the signs indicate yes to this play. It seems to have been typed on the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story is in Old England where a boy named Oliver works out of the orphanage. He ends his way across the country to London where he meets a host of juvenile delinquents, headed by Dodger, Smart Talk, and Quick Pickup. The leader of this gang is named Vagin, a senior colleague who sells all stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But it's not good in London when Bill Sykes played Oliver Reid and his loving girlfriend Nancy. With Oliver, Vaughn and his young troops, the law. What follows is a wonderful story of love, affection and wonderful musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like it or not, listen to these melodies and continue to be interested all day long. Oliver! Is a triumph and outside the theater, an immortal art work.
