This is a collection of documentaries that lasts 11 minutes and 9 seconds and one frame of artists from all over the world. Documentary films are diverse and address all kinds of concepts, the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme (very small in some cases). Some are weak, others are very strong; others are political; others are not; some are just about 9/11; others simply use 11/9 as a theme to touch human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are prevalent while others are abstract and artistic ). This film is not censored in any way by anyone, so the ideas you see are very powerful and fifth. <br /> <br /> It's a very controversial film, especially for Conservative Americans. I think that two parts may really be placed in the right wing (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a Palestinian attacker are dead; another from the United Kingdom recounts the overthrow of the US-backed Chilean on September 11, 1973, resulting in 50,000 deaths and horrific atrocities) . The part of Mexico was the most powerful, where it tells the fall of towers and death produced in a vivid way (you must see them believe it). <br /> <br /> Although the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost "useless", I still recommend this. It is very difficult to classify this film because the slides vary everywhere (some are weak, some are very strong); This was given a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some sectors were excellent and cover issues that are normally controlled (Mexico, UK, Japan, and Egypt).
