I found this movie really exciting from the start - like the movie Spielberg - and found that the plot was interesting as I tried to figure out what the actual situation was. <br /> <br /> Right from the start - before starting the opening credits - the action begins, with immediate comment. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very popular. (I have a problem admiring any of Baldwins, due to Alec's extracurricular political activities, but William was not so bad in this film.) <br /> <br /> There were several very unexpected transformations, which contributed to the enjoyment. <br /> <br /> There were, unfortunately, many places where there was a loud annoying noise in the sound - something like 19K Hz. I think the microphone was picking up video screens on the group.
