One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes her clothes and retrieves a young worker and takes them back to Eva. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to get Eva back home. Eva refuses, wealth leads the trio to the same place, and ends the case in a tragic way. I've just watched "Extase" for the first time, and my first comment on the terrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: The film is only 75 minutes long and seems to have been used in different rollers of the film. There are some parts completely damaged, and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images has not been achieved by the Brazilian exhibitor, if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent film, and the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Thus, characters are developed badly. However, this film is also very bold, as Hedy Lamar is exposed to beautiful breasts and nude body of current beauty standards. Another wonderful point is the poets and metaphor used for flowers, which symbolizes the relationship between Eva and her lover. The way the viewer manages to show Eva's needs is very clear. The inconclusive ending is very unusual for the 1933 film. I liked this film, but I wish I had the chance one day to see a restored version for 87 minutes. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "xtxtase" ("ecstasy")
