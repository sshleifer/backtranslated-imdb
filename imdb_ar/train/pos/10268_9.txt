This typical MAMET film offers a quiet insight into what makes a man of confidence (Joe Mantegna) good. Has been explored as a psychological study by a famous psychologist Lindsay Crouse, slowly pulling her into the world with its bad consequences. The cast includes a number of actors who have been found, including many of Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potoc, Allen Sull, William H. Messi) and doing their usual good work. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film and often wondered why you did not become a more famous player than I became. Maybe I'm not looking at the right places! <br /> <br /> The movie continues at a slow pace, with a flat dialog box, yet it maintains a level of tension that leads logically to the ends of the explosions. I was expecting a real disappointment at the end, but I found it upscale and satisfying. I like this film!
