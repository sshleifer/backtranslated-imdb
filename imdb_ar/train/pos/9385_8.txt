The Red Rock West is an ideal example of how good a movie is without a budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and lots of atmosphere. RRW offers all this and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays a former Marine, wounded in Lebanon, who reached his last $ 5 after refusing to work in an oil field because of his bad knee. He plays the role of Red Rock and is mistaken by JT Walsh, who is not the most threatening - but still evil - man of a Texas man. <br /> <br /> He pushed him to kill his wife and make her look like burglary. Only when it gets there, just to check it. It gives him double to kill Wayne. Cage only wants to get the hell out of the city with his free money and let the sparring lovers. But a series of accidents and setbacks led to his appearance at Red Rock and to him. Eventually, this leads to a second round with a night of Dallas (a friendly and somewhat sympathetic Dennis Hopper), the real guy from Texas who offers help without the knowledge that it makes the plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW did not have a big release, and so its audience discovered it via video or cable TV shows. Watching it in a way that makes it look like a TV movie but bigger. It was supposed to be both slow motion, slow timing, mood effect, and floating desert wind for a wonderful film in the theaters but the best thing you can do these days is watching a DVD on a big HD TV. <br /> <br /> The only weak point in the film that I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring story with a bad hairstyle. I certainly will not drop it but if you assume that Nic Cage's character is a hardcore lesbian you will accept it though.
