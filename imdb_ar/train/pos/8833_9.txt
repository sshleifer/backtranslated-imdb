I was fascinated by the title, so during a small bout of insomnia (nourish my curiosity ...), I watched him. Then I checked the TV listings and watched them again! There is a very clear perception that occurred to me when I saw this film - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc., adolescents everywhere are almost identical. It was possible to transfer the characters of children from Belgrade to somewhere in the Midwest during the same time period, and apart from linguistic differences, it would be impossible to distinguish them from any of the local teenagers of that era. They certainly showed the same pains, growing concerns and politics aside: music, sex, film idols, music, drinking, sports, music ... in fact, the same things that occupied my time in Southern California in 1970. <br /> <br /> This was a sweet and bitter story, but the delight of the young made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were also quite right. I would not say that this was the "American graphic" of Yugoslavia, but I say it fits well with the other 50 films.
