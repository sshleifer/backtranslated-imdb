My first child was born the year the program came out, and I ran the boys' registration album all Christmas after that. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives while they are founding families ... it always becomes their favorite album for Christmas. I recently found several DVDs (probably made from DVD-R videos) for sale on eBay. The version I bought was excellent, and it was great to see the program again after more than 25 years. There are some songs in the show that were not in the album, and some songs in the album were studio versions of the same songs in the show. But the CD and DVD in our library will remain the best Christmas entertainment ever.
