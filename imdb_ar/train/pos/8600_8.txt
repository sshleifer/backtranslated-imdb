There was some hesitation on the part of me about what this film was about. For starters, the choice did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland was already well performing the "24" and it seems that the preview does not offer anything that is challenging for him or the audience. Eva Longoria appeared misplaced, and the rest was not interesting. <br /> <br /> When the film ended in the end, I was not completely upset because I saw a wonderful film that could have been much better, the responsible parties have taken a little more care to monitor the narrative gaps and give more attention to personal development. We have seen threats of this kind before, making the main conflict more challenging for writers. As an audience, we do not want to tell the same old story again. We want to see something different, and feel happy and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this choice. From the first Mrs. Kim Basinger. She carries herself with enough grace and sexual attractiveness to make the part memorable. Michael Douglas had done it before. Unfortunately, the president is not too much to care about his fate. Sutherland rephrases the strong man's "24" approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does a good job, as a newcomer. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as many transformations and fireworks as some established classics ("North of the Northwest" and "Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations abroad and enjoy the trip no matter what. OK.
