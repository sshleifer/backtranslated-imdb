This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it to anyone owned by the local video store. Or better yet, you can buy it because there are opportunities to watch it over and over again. I can remember watching this movie as a child and it was wonderful at the time. But after watching it again yesterday, I found it wonderful. <br /> <br /> A good mix of comedy (although it's not as big as "Mr Magoo" - one of my favorites). This is worth 10/10 and I hope they will make a supplement soon (crossed the fingers). If you are a babysitter or have to take care of young children for anything, I recommend renting this movie because it will keep them amusing for hours :).
