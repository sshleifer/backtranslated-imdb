With partial reconstruction and partial direct fire, the directors made a stark documentary about the coup against President Chavez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and with the full support of the rich Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the Church (cynical laughs Cardinal) and the US government. It was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Stephen Kenzer called "overthrowing" or "democratizing the American way." In fact, this foreign-backed intervention was not only a coup against President Ch√°vez, but also against the democratic majority that elected him. <br /> <br /> This wonderful documentary is strongly confirmed by the violent reactions against him and against him on the Internet. As St. Augustine said: "Men love the truth when they bathe in their light; they hate it when they prove wrong." <br /> <br /> This film must be seen by everyone who wants to understand the world in which we live.
