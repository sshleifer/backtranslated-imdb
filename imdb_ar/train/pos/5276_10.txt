I joined IMDb so people know what this wonderful movie is! Do not often encounter a moving film and cinematic but modest. I have read the plot. All I want to say is not to watch it because you want to see a conflict between religious and cultural identity chatter, because that is the wrong misconception that people read in, and instead I just realized that it revolves around the father. And his son on a journey that grows to get to know each other through their struggles. Bought it and moved it before it was wrapped in film 4. This was one of the very few films that were nominated to be independent and foreign BAFTA. Its beauty lies in its ability to attract anyone's attention. Even if you've never seen anything translated or used to Hollywood, it's just a great story that keeps you connected. The only thing I hope is to be longer and see what is happening
