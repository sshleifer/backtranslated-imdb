Amazingly, "Insomniac's Nightmare" is amazingly good for an independent film, and it paints an amazing picture of what it will be like in insomnia. It is well written and well directed, and creates an atmosphere of dream where the scenes are captured in one night in a life of insomnia. <br /> <br /> Starring Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we can see everything he sees as long hours of lonely night lengthening. The narrative is almost hypnotic, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to retreat. It is wonderful and somewhat disturbing, showing how someone adapts to the lack of sleep, balancing on the edge of the abyss and the madness. <br /> <br /> With twists and turns in every corner, An Insniacia's nightmare is provocative and appealing. It is highly recommended.
