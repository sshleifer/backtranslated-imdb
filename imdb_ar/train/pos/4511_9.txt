I just picked up a DVD copy of this movie while I was on vacation in Norway where it was released with an English translation. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully filmed and strongly represented. The young man who depicts Frites' leading personality has an amazingly open face that accurately reflects the painful tragic events unfolding around him. <br /> <br /> Early in the film we see that the father who loves Fritz often suffers from mental health problems and this arises when the school principal denies the brutal assault on the boy and indicates that he was his father. <br /> <br /> The atomic scene where Frits refuses to show any respect for the school principal; you just stand at home and repeat a "liar" being brutally assaulted by his colleagues in the scene, an unforgettable scene. <br /> <br /> The only point that lies in the movies is the vulgar "flower power". The teacher who uses each trick is a "friendly teacher" in the book. Other than this, I'm sure this movie will really enjoy it.
