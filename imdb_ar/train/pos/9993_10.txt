Brooks is the most hilarious and funny film I have ever seen. I can watch and replay the tape 100 times. I laughed, my children, and I cried at some moments. It's a really good and funny film, and if you love Brooks - it's a must! In short, Brooks (the billionaire) arrives on the streets homeless for 30 days in order to win the whole poor region of his rival. Bites reality, but in the end - it is about warm relationships between humans ... I highly recommend!
