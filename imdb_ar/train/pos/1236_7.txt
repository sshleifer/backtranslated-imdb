Eddie Murphy spends his time looking for lost children, so when a special magic child is kidnapped in Tibet, the erotic Charlotte Lewis asks for help to save this child from the clutches of evil itself. <br /> <br /> The story is a little silly, it is never satisfied, despite the ignorance of comedy in the film. Charles Dance distinguishes comedy by its dangerous and dark portrayal of the evil that holds the child hostage. <br /> <br /> The golden child is very funny and full of movement and very charming in almost enchanting charm of the way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.
