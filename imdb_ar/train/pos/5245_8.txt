I think this movie was a funny lol. It's fun, it should not be taken seriously, a film about the views of one twisted man about life and love, as well as ... ladies "from the humble bus station, to the high-class bus station ... Tim Meadows is a man (Leon Phelps, who grew up in a Playboy-style palace by Father Hugh Hefner, is surrounded by models of beautiful porn and actresses: When his "father" casts him out on the street, he must learn how to defend himself without anything but the chauvinistic view of life taught by his youth ... so the mysterious level of magic and the magic of stupid luck.Then the Hynix starts! If you have not seen this movie and you Stmta love story / comedy / love story light, I strongly advise you to rent "ladies man."
