Let's make it simple: my child has been pasted into this film. It has its drawbacks from an adult perspective, but buy some jellyworms and enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The Pepsi girl was excellent! <br /> <br /> Kimberly Williams was very hot, although she is not in the movie very much, so she does not feel very enthusiastic there. <br /> <br /> This is not really bad, but it's the kind of movie you see only once. Do not buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Have you mentioned Kimberley Williams? (That was for parents.)
