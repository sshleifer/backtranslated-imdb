When I first got the N64 when I was five or six years old, I fell in love with her, and my first game was Super Mario 64. I loved it! The graphics were great for time, good layout, great courses and above all, the best music I've ever heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the plot completely, but I think the princess kidnapped was kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario has to save her. The game is to get 120 stars of castle curses. Each had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are safe parts of the castle, where you can get more stars. But of course you beat Bowser. * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser on * Lets start with letters. Mario is the main character and gets useful advice from Toad, so he's basically one of your only alliances. I have heard that Luigi and Yoshi in the game in the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are a bunch of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really wonderful. <br /> <br /> After that, what about people saying that Gameplay is more important than graphics, and I fully agree. But with a fantastic plot, there are fantastic graphics. Especially for the time has come. I have a whole bunch of other Nintendo games like 007 and its graphics do not have Super Mario.Bright colors, great effects and great sound effects. I found the drawings in the water courses very very good. Along with Bowser World, contains the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, music. This is my favorite part of the game. As I grew up, when I was playing this at an early age, I would gladly leave the game all night until the music made me sleep. Especially the music of Jolie was Roger Bai, who was quiet and wonderful. There are other very wonderful people, especially in the worlds with Bowser again, who are more committed to me than others and prefer me. <br /> <br /> This game has been my favorite past time as developing games, and I love it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO PLAY GAME GAME!
