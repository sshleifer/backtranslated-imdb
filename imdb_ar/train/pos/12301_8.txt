It's a kind of madness, but I'm registered with TCM alike, this German edition of "Anna Christie" by MGM and the other in English ... but I saw this first, "I have heard that many people thought it was better than the English version. /> <br /> Without seeing the other version, I can not compare it, but anyway, this is a great start early, with Garbo performing directly from the heart, looks very beautiful in this film, shines her whole face, especially when the photographer William Daniels on the wonderful close-ups of her. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film seems different from the usual things that MGM made in that era, By French and German expressive films of the 1930s. It was directed by a great French director, Jacques Feder, who directed Garbo in 1929 in "The Kiss." Theo Shall is excellent and gives reasonable and credible performance. As a strong and cruel sailor, Anna is a child in the man's body. Hans Junkermann also performs very well, as Anna's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel as well, as a good-hearted old Florentine. <br /> <br /> In every experience, because the only movie you can listen to Garbo speaks in a foreign language ... all the other films were made either in Sweden or Germany during the Silent Era period. <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
