I grew up during the time when music in this film was common. What a wonderful time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was too young to go to USO and night clubs. I think I seem to live in the past, (I have wonderful memories) What's wrong with that? !!? World War 2 was a terrible time, except for music. The death of Glen Miller was a terrible grief for us. This movie will be my favorite. Cleo Lin was excellent. What a voice! I do not know how I missed this film. The main reason for this comment is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to rap and the new era, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
