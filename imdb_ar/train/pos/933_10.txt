I watched this movie in the sixth grade at Christmas time, and I was very excited to see it, and when I heard that George S. Scott was in it, I was very excited, because I really loved George S.. When I was descriptive I watched this movie, I was really in it, when it ended, I was really impressed, I thought it was awesome! This is the best version of Charles Dickens' classic novel that I have seen so far! George C.'s performance Scott as a Scrooge Another thing, I thought was the perfect choice, was Scrooge, Scrooge is the final! I've seen two different versions of Carol Christmas, the other is the version with Patrick Stewart, but that's the best! <br /> <br /> What's really wonderful about this is acting, I thought the actors were wonderful, and everyone, and the souls, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, could not find anyone better than those who did the parts ! But the best part of the film was George S. When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! It's Ebenezer Scrooge final, I do not think they could have found a better person! I do not think they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This film is probably the final film of Charles Dickens' classic composition, and I really think you'll agree, you'll think this movie is awesome! I might have to buy this movie on a DVD, because I thought it was absolutely fantastic! I would highly recommend you to see this masterpiece! This is the best version of Carol Christmas, this period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
