Bromwell High is nothing short of fantastic. This parody of students and teachers at the South London Public School, brilliantly written and delivered, makes you roll with laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. Characters are a wonderful cartoon cross-section of British society (or more accurately, in any society). After the adventures of Kecha, Blatter and Natalya, our "three heroes" for lack of a better term, the show does not shy away from parody of every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies from the window in every episode. If you enjoy offers that are not afraid of ridicule on every subject you can imagine, Bromwell High will not disappoint!
