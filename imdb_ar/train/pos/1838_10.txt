WAQT is a perfect example of chicken stew not only for your soul. Unfortunately, the gravy has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excessive dilution and excessive decorating that has occurred. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing in the WAQT is that it comes from a way out of the usual cliches of Indian cinema in his first project but that the second outing surrenders to all the film formats. While Vipul Shah had a conviction to show something as senseless as blind men stealing a bank in the AANKHEN, he failed to push life into the full package of WAQT based on something imaginable as a father-son relationship. Adopted from the Gujarati play Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a reasonable story with a social backup message. A mature look at the father-son relationship, unconditional love of the father towards his son and the responsibility of the son towards his family. Ishwar Chand Shrawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who founded his entire empire on his own from scratch, lives richly with his wife Sumitra (Shivali Shah). Their only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar) never needed to strive for anything because he got everything specially designed and licked in life. The Ishvar pamphlet has only corrupted him. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a star but does nothing to make his dreams come true. Meanwhile he marries his sweetheart Metali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishvar hopes the marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya remains at its best and lives a decent life. <br /> <br /> The Endurance End finally collapses when Aditya is expelled from his home. The sudden change in the attitude of his loving father toward him and his now-waiting wife is a sign of Aditya. He had no choice but to seek the livelihood of his wife and unborn son. He began to become an independent man but the difference in relationship between him and his father grows. <br /> <br /> The story is simplified while the non-complex scenario has a very preliminary approach. One can easily identify credible figures for both father and son. If you are not one of the two, you may have encountered people like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to this an easy and quick way to manage director Vibol Shah. With such a family relationship, any other way out has added tons of melodrama to the proceedings in accordance with the Bollywood family drama laws, turning the film into a compulsory tearjerker. However, Shah excels in dealing with emotions without bothering most parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a clear example of his simple direction is evident in the pre-separation scene where the father was removed from his home in a rather trivial way. The purpose of the scene is achieved without blowing the biggest burden on the brains of the masses. As was the scene in the second half where the separated son now has a failed conversation. This is what distinguishes WAQT from KABHI KUSHI GHUM or RHTTAA EK and actually puts it on a single high level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the points of discrimination, one might wonder where the WAQT still fails to? The problem lies in the fact that while WAQT distinguishes itself from others in its cyclical terms of treatment, it lies in the glitches in packaging conditions. What with the director forced to dance a song every now and then in the first half. There is a song of Canadian Shadi essence, the song Shopra Kinda Holly, the song of Father Jr. disco Dundia, the song of dream and dream, became a real song that stimulates yawning enough in the scenes. This photo ... The father has just been expelled from his home and his son dreams of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Misplaced! without reason! The public is out of the seat. <br /> <br /> The film continues in the first half only and the actual story begins in the second half only. The director has wasted a lot of WAQT on unnecessary elements. Much of the talk about dog chase sequences is not bad but does not benefit him either. However, the Takshav Akshay Kumar dance is ridiculous. Imagine that he qualifies for chasing the stars in the film with this comic (unintentionally) history. Add to that the climax in the finals of the search for stars where the son exploded with emotions. This is the original model! It was also possible to reverse the pattern of editing to hide the father's reason to change attitudes toward his son. <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is good though not necessary in the proceedings. Santosh Thundiiayil's work is efficient enough, if not too much. Aatish Kapadia created some good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Make-up Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav or light moments in the movie with high efficiency. While Rajapal Yadav was walking in full swing through his comic history in many recent films, this time he relies on his character and is completely constrained. His blocked expressions are full of details of Bauman's history. <br /> <br /> Shivali Shah is disguised as a mother. It should not be considered reprimand but flawless in playing and "looking" at her character. Priyanka is wonderful and plays her role well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main applause deserves Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is particularly vulnerable in the scene, where his dissident father deliberately intimidates him to raise awareness of his responsibilities. Although Bachchan looks dramatic in a few scenes, his brilliance is reflected throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, the WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both delicious and nutritious but the final recipe is not one way or another as appetizing.
