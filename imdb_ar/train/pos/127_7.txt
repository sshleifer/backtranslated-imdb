Zentropa shares a lot in The Third Man, another Neuer film among the ruins of post-war Europe. Like TTM, there is a lot of innovative camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman who does not really understand her, and his naivete is more surprising in contrast to the indigenous people. The third man has a more literal story. Zentropa is somewhat disjointed in this regard. This may be intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, making it more coherent that will spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is very dark - "Noir" in more than one sense; no one sees that the sun shines. Dim, but interesting, and scary.
