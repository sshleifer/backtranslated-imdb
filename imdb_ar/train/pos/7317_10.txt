It was a film I had heard about my entire life, but I only saw it a few years ago. It's a truly embarked upon reputation. I knew Michael Myers, I had seen the mask, and I saw commercials for all the brilliant disciples that followed. But I grew up during the decade when Jason and Freddy were in control of the horror game, and I never thought of Halloween. Boy, how you were fooled with cheap weights. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a truly terrifying movie. Now, according to today's standards, this is not a graphic and brutal form, but this film delivers on all other levels that most horror movies do not achieve today. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is very creepy, and the fact that he is located in a quaint town in the Midwest is testimony to his ability. The lighting effects are absolutely terrifying, with the appearance of the "shape" apparently and disappears in the shade at will. The simple and effective result of music adds brutally to the thrill. <br /> <br /> All players have performed well, with specific references to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Blaiseans. Mrs Curtis is a good Lori Stroud because she is petty and weak. It's even more frightening when Michael Myers is being pursued because the director and the viewer have invested a lot in our lives, we want them to survive and escape. <br /> <br /> Donald Blaise plays d. Lomis is like a man on a mission, and it works fine. Adds a sense of urgency to the impasse that the town finds itself because it knows what evil is chasing in their streets. <br /> <br /> In general, Halloween is not a great horror film, it's also a great movie. It works at many levels and attracts the public and never allows registration. This must be the standard offer for anyone who wants to experience a really scary film. For more frightening time, try to watch it on its own by turning off the lights. Do not be surprised if you think you see the "shape" lurking in the shadows!
