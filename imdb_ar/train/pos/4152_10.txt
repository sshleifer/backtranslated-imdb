I've seen a good number of Cold Case episodes over the years, starting with the episodes of the first season in 2003-2004. Although most of them were good, this episode was not only the best, but also a few Emmy competitors. Although some may disagree with the content of the story (ie the romantic relationship from male to male), I doubt that anyone can see this without moving deeply into his soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the reopened case, based on the testimony of a drug dealer. The two main actors are police officers in 1960 named Sean Cobb (aka victim of the cold case bearing his last name, Kopp) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story, Coop is one, a Vietnam War veterinarian, and has a very troubled past. Jamie, however, is married and has children. They are both partners in the police force and not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that each of them must hide from the culture of deep homophobia that prevailed at the time. <br /> <br /> The flashback scenes in their lives are mostly black and white, with parts of color now and then sprayed all the time. Examples include their red car, the yellow curtains blowing gently next to the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where she watched the wife of Jimmy Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other while they were in a state of alcohol. I found it interesting that only the specific items were colored in flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale. <br /> <br /> The apparent tension between homophobia among fellow patrol officers and central actors increases the severity of the episode. It was one of the main emotional scenes when his father Coop was confronted after the baptism of a Jimmy child. In this scene, the father of Coop, Sarge, who was a respectable colleague in the force, faces Coop in front of the rumors surrounding the Coop relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, at this stage, where the shame and shame of Coop's father had bowed to Coop - "You will not deform our family ... and you are not my son too." - clearly shows the anti-gay views of that era. <br /> <br /> Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go after naming Coop and Jimmy "Batman and Robin Hummus." <br /> <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it is clear that Coop wanted more Jimmy in his life. One can see the tension in Jimmy's face because he must choose between his commitment to his wife and his children, his church, and yet his unpopular loyalty to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he can not have both Cooper and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop was killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but perhaps Coop was killed because of his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached the highest level in the force. <br /> <br /> The most exciting scene of the movement. In the entire episode, when Coop, sitting in his car, was quietly talking about his last words on police radio to his partner: "Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones, do not forget that." <br /> <br /> The choice of soundtrack is great throughout the episode. I enjoyed the last scene with actor Chad Everett, where I played the role of Jamie, who is still sad, and no longer older than him, and obviously I still miss his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is without doubt the most well-written, well-behaved, and best-performing episode of all the Cold Case episodes I have ever seen.
