With this film, everything about elegance, atmosphere and acting. True, I did not believe in all the plot's developments, but it was not that important - the wonderful acting, the unexpected plot transformations, and the wonderful atmosphere immediately absorbed me, took me on the ride, and got a great time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a wonderful actor, but a master of accents, and proves it again in Georgia's impeccable tone. He is surrounded by a lot of talent in supporting the roles (Robert Downey Jr., Embeth Davids from the Schindler and Devlin list, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah, and Robert Duval) to the extent that I was blown away. I recently purchased a copy of this film, and I never tired of seeing it. Simply one of the best thriller movies of the year. If you ignore this movie (and you have chances), I suggest you check it out.
