If I see a movie and I do not look back at my watch or watch to see how long it works or when I hope the final scene is not the end of the film, it should be good. I am not a film specialist or a cinematographer. I watch movies, and if they remain interested in me until the end, they are very good because some of the most acclaimed film critics have carried me to death (English patient, Shakespeare in love, atonement, faults.) This film kept me interested and absorbed from start to finish, The acting is fantastic, the story is absolutely authentic, the technique is very backfire, there was a little Citizen Kane was thrown out when Hoffman broke up his apartment after Tommy left him, but I forgave it because I see him greeting Orson, instead of ripping it.
