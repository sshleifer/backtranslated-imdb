I watched this film with the joy of Shire. <br /> <br /> This may have been one of the best films of all time. Its immortal value, you get a lot of them amazing. There are moving, funny and great parts. <br /> <br /> All aspects are in place, the story is perfect, all the details are 100% original, and even the tiny Irish details are covered. <br /> <br /> Using low and high shots gives two fantastic views of Christie (look for it). <br /> <br /> Daniel Dae Lewis's performance is incredible. I have never seen a representative ever do that. It's really amazing. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch it, it flows well, and it may be the closest thing you can get to experiencing real life. I like that. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it, you'll see it. You have no doubt about it, there is something out there for everyone.
