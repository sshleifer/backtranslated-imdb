This film was wonderful ... It made me laugh, make naked, and most of all it talks about animals !! This movie must be watched by all kinds of people! It's one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much that I had to comment on it !!! It is a very gracious feeling and a wonderful story that makes a wonderful film and heart! My favorite character is Shadow. This is because I think it is the most interesting and charming. I used to get a Golden Retriever like Shadow, I miss it so much !!! He was my best friend, and I knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but I missed him with all my heart !! This movie is the best I love and everyone must! Love your pets no matter what they do, cherish them forever !!!
