I actually liked the original, this movie has ups and downs. Here are a few examples: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the original sound sounds have returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I did not like Timon Ma. I know she voted in The Simpsons, but this show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We recognize Simba as a "teenager." <br /> <br /> Downs: I've wasted it in a tough competition between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was my companion who told Timon about Hakuna Matata. <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Bomba discover that? The songs are back. (Some original songs were there, but they were just background music.) Downs: But stupid songs. (For example, Timon alone.) <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very good movie. I would recommend it to my original lover. But if you do not like the original, chances are you will not like this. <br /> <br /> My points: 7/10
