This is a delightful and completely unexpected film. Start with a young man who hopes to join the qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, it will reach the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young man is a girl and a girl (or women in this regard) who are not allowed to play football matches "to sit with men". The following is a wonderful comedy, skillfully played by a small cast team. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on women's freedom (and for this purpose, young soldiers who are forced to crawl). There are some excellent pieces, not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet, and of course, the playground does not contain toilets for women. The camera is the simplest, and in some ways this story may be a play. However, the small scale that gives the film its bite. Great cinema? Probably not; wonderful entertainment - definitely.
