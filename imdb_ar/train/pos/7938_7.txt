Rob Estes and Josie Bisset carry nonsense from children who do not look alike. <br /> <br /> Essentially, Rob and Josie evaluate a hazelnut wedding on a drunken night during a Vegas vacation. They all come home to find that their children already know about weddings because of the tabloid-like fodder. They, Rob and Josie, move both and their eight children to one house or another. <br /> <br /> I think Robb is building the furniture, apparently, and is close enough to the task of Frank Lambert (Patrick Duffy) to build in a step very similar to justify an eternal parody. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of cookie-making queen, although she does not seem to make any of her cookies. Not far enough from the hair styling performed by Carol Foster (Susan Summers) to justify mockery, but with joy enough enough to justify the brutal irony. <br /> <br /> Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the vacation and knew someone else's last names, or so one assumes if they are serious enough about the relationship to make a trip together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I, personally, I think they should have Andrew is younger than Andy. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of placement products, especially for soups in hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packages. There are also some stupid, meaningless moments. Nor is it a great movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my assessment of "Step By Step ... on some really bad medicines". Watch him for Rob Astis and his beautiful eyes! There are some beautiful shots!
