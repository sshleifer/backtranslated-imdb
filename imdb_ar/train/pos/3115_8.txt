First of all, Bourne Ultimatum is a non-fan of this type of film, a wonderful and impressive film. <br /> <br /> Second, it's a boring, ridiculous film of supernatural objects. Third, the film bears an important and complex point about the transformation of crime fighters into criminals themselves. Abu Ghraib or the outrageous executive branch attacks on constitutional rights are not mentioned, nothing is necessary. <br /> <br /> So, the latest in the Bourne series, in 2004 by Bourne Supremacy and United 93, is an important achievement that may have been delayed but has not actually diminished. The inevitable excesses of this type. <br /> <br /> The word "breathtaking" above is a free description and description of the physical sensation: For more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer seems to be holding his breath, And there is no difference in the rhythm and withdrawal of the film, yet it does not become as tedious and exhausting as some sections of the feed You can use your own cinematic bestseller Tony Gillroy's 1990 novel Robert Ludlum (which does not build up well against the Bourne Identity, written a decade ago) <br /> <br /> Matt Damon Once and again, the irreplaceable Bourne, the most deadly CIA agent, can be dispensed with. This time he takes the entire agency looking for his identity, his past and the mysterious IAEA program that has turned him into a Killing machine. Not like Edward R. Heroically heroic Morro, David Strathren, who has always been wonderful, is the agency's senior official, who stands against Bourne in an attempt to hide some of the illegal "non-taking" policies and brutal actions. <br /> <br /> Joan Allen plays what seems to be "the good cop" against the bad movie "Stathorn". Julia Steeles as a new worker comes to Bourne's help. The combination of Greengrass's trend and Stiles representation produces an amazing effect of a mostly silent character, its lack of communication and empty expression more interesting than the tendency of dialogue. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum is so far away from the old individual punishment against man, and this time it has spread to absurd excesses. Born challenges the limitations of geography, time, gravity ... and physics in general. <br /> <br /> All this "real" magic - jumping from country to country in seconds to reach an unknown place just like when, when and how it is done That - outweighs the special possibilities and supernatural effects of supernatural animation. However, only the existence of ignorant pedantry "facts" are allowed to interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of Bourne imagination.
