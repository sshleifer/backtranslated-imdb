Melvin Douglas once again presents a polished performance, this time the role of the investigator who can not put love before service and adventure, and the beautiful beautiful Joan Blondell (who, as one of the reviewers suggested, wrote a novel about her early life) Like a sweetheart that has ever suffered. It's almost a quasi-spiral comedy, and almost thin film of the high genre, almost a series, I think, did not make it a sequel. It's not exactly classic, but it has all the ingredients for fun for 85 minutes with casual but fast text, fantastic character actors, and a direction that makes everything move fast enough so you hardly notice that Williams (Douglas) is not exactly Colombo when it comes to uncovering . I wish there were more movies like this.
