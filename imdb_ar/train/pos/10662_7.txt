Leonard Maltin I have to watch some other films. (Although I find his directory to be a very valuable resource, please ignore his comments on this). The little "starts well then fades" when it is just the opposite - "starts from the lukewarm and then grabs with fire." The plot is almost as simple as it gets. Happy Mom, Happy Dad and Happy Son spend their vacation on an isolated beach, my father is helpless in an accident, my mother flees for help, and meets with a serious conviction she ran away. My mother tries to fool with help while my father waits and waits for dear life. <br /> <br /> A good white wrestler is given by Ralph Maquier, who has suddenly appeared (director John Sturgis depicts the film in an intelligent way that will make you gasp in the middle of the road to become a desperate criminal.) Meeker is an unusual vocalist (at least here and in The classic film Kiss Me Deadly) and happily picks up the keys to the narrative and quickly starts from top to bottom, his character usually having a childish smile and saying "beautiful and elegant, huh?" When he is particularly happy with his actions. On a flat frame and steals his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not go away." Again shot "Where to go?" (They are in the middle of the Not a place) and he realizes the sitcom "Yes, that's right." The friction between them is hustle. <br /> <br /> There are flaws, some of which are somewhat ironic, and there is one scene where the police, He puts his mike on her shoulder as a supposed granny husband and pretends to be asleep during her interrogation .. It seems that he is not clearly mentioned in this position and B. I think it is safe to say that any adult seems He sleeps during a confrontation with the application of the law will certainly raise suspicion. <br /> <br /> The excitement that builds on an interesting and useful conclusion remains strong. <br /> <br />
