Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his cousin were all stars of the series. What made it very good for me when I saw it was the real feeling of going into the water. The exhibition presents a young energy energy for underwater exploration and is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was educational as well as showing the viewer things about underwater diving from someone who looked like a witty supporter, Mike Nelson. There were excellent shows, and the program always looked good. Admittedly, drama in scripts sometimes strikes the same notes in more than one episode, but each show carries itself with any other program produced during this era, the appearance of American television.
