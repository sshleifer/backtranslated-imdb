Faye, the sister of the gentle Nobel laureate Simon Grimm, still loves Henry Fowl. Their son receives a bunch of anecdotes in the genius of an unknown sender, resulting in a hunt across three continents, including a group of very busy government agents, terrorists, flight attendants and goules. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey offers a perfect, timely, and humorous performance, including some great physical work.
