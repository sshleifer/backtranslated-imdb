THE BLOB is a terrific horror film, not only because of the horrifying images of his character that can almost be stopped, which melt in the flesh, but because it has a real social message. It is, in many ways, a "horror film". The story has helped wise enough through the solid performances of the entire cast. The two romantic leaders, Steve McQueen and Anita Korsawt, bring an amazing depth and sense of action. They are misunderstood, but they are very well-intentioned young people, and it is very easy to root them for them. <br /> <br /> This is a pro-society film, and its juvenile delinquents cause problems outside boredom mainly, not boredom. Some disadvantages of malicious personality. Steve McCain's rival for horse races seems to be an enemy in the early stages, but soon joined McCain's campaign to save the city from invading invaders once he saw McCain's gravity. In this way, the attitude of the characters, initially seen as a cartoon, suddenly develops deep and human reality. <br /> <br /> The initial authorities' suspicions of the child's cruel allegations have proved to be wrong - once the threat becomes public, all conflict within society disappears. This uniformity becomes the purpose, and verifies the "troubled" teenagers, officially when the father of Anita Korsot breaks into the school to get the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob. On any other day, breaking into the school is a typical sabotage act for juvenile delinquents - on this particular day, a necessary measure by an adult. At this turning point, it is clear that there are no dividing lines between young and old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film because it recognizes the "generational gap" scenario but suggests it is more realistic than fiction, and that given the real crisis, people will naturally gather to restore order. "The Blob" is an ideal tonic for this type of depression that generally comes with the show "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). <br /> <br /> Much of the cheap but innovative film (and effective!) has been made of visual effects. They are undeniably smart. Many of the gravity-challenging tricks we see in Blob have been achieved with miniature sets designed to rotate them. The camera was usually connected to the crew in a "closed" position very firmly (the lights must be connected so that the lighting stays constant as the room is turned off in this way). These scenes often depicted one frame at a time as the room was spinning slowly - the silicon bubble fell very slowly and it was necessary to speed up its work. One way or another, this was like stopping the motion photography, but using a bubble of silicon rather than a articular doll. Even today, the effects were amazing and quaint. <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie with a title that seems to be exploited, THE BLOB is a must.
