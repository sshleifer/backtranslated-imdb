If you like Star Wars / Trek, come and see where they got all their ideas and cinemas. They are my favorite films of all time, and they are other worldly, futuristic and psychological films. The whizbang trick is not overwhelmed by the stunt of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest"). Because it was manufactured in 1956, do not assume that you can "see the strings" carrying the flying saucer. This was the first movie you could find. Miracle was made on the scale of "A-film", and the economy and tastes of that time were heavily stacked against it. The success of Wilcox's former director was Lassie Come Home. Until I looked at it, I assumed that "Fred Wilcox" was a pseudonym for the director who was already known or later, but at that time he did not want to be associated with science fiction, which was a "B" accurately at the time. This was either a very great production, or a big "mistake" by people financing Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are many huge issues with live procedures that have been introduced almost microscopically and widely used by Lucas. There are intelligent machines that go beyond the typical "UI". "Computers", because they became less visionary in future business. There is an existing "Star Trek", visually, almost unchanged by Roddenberry after 10 years. If the Trek / Wars technology quits you, the scientific references to FP are not exaggerated and all are accurate, even today. The "Ship" range is as comprehensive and realistic as sparkling and good as anything I've ever seen and more convincing than anything Trek did for television or film. We could not spend as much time there as I wished. <br /> <br /> If you ever wonder how movies fit into space efficiently, you'll see FP watching all of this. It's definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
