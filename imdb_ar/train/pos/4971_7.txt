This is a silly dark comedy from Belgium. Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) was superbly portrayed as Roger, the enraged father of a family in a small Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer visiting, with his little daughter Lewis, road accidents to take pictures. He is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a contest where the rider must break a record - and decides that his son, Michelle, should try to break the record for a constant walk through the door - and even hire an extra coach. Michelle is dressed in Elvis and has a site on a radio program called "Lies of Lies", where he describes mistakes in films. Louis and Dei with his close neighbor Felix, the pigeon fanciers. Roger is a tough character and he drives Michelle beyond the limit of the registration attempt, which almost leads to his death. The film features surreal images similar to Magritte. It is undoubtedly charming and worth your time.
