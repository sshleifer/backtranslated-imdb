I strongly disagree with "ctomvelu" regarding the talent of Jim Bellushi. I happen to like Belushi so much. Admittedly, I was skeptical when he first appeared in the scene, because I was a great admirer of his late brother John. But Jim has the charm on the screen to make it very far - and has developed well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his previous movies - his weight is a gift (is not that right for most of us?) - I love the movie. Yes, it's painful and intimate, so if you're chasing cars and blowing up and having sex for free, you might want to move this movie - it's a warm movie made up of three missing soles that you find each other. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for the three keys above for a successful movie, but I also love a pretty solid story like this. <br /> <br /> Although Belushi and Kelly Lynch make excellent performances, the real star of this film is Alisan Porter - who is very adorable. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened in her career, but who is responsible for dropping the ball (client? s parents?)? ?) You should shoot. You can not ask for a more famous introduction to the fame of this film, yet nothing has been heard about it since. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
