The comedy gem is nice and nice, until the last five minutes, which turn into a run of the British television mill farce. The last five minutes cost me 2 points in my assessment. Despite this great plot and design flaws, they are well worth seeing in order to represent the characters and prepare the unique Cornwall. There are so many small things you can taste, such as the tense eternity that we all have to wait for the approval of the bank after the employee has passed the credit card ... made us more enthusiastic when we are not - sure - sure that the card did not exceed the limit.
