Such as the Streetcar film Desire (also directed by Gadg on stage and screen) depicts Panic In The Streets in New Orleans, where her main claim to fame - the birthplace of jazz - is not mentioned. It was Richard Weidmark's seventh film, and it can be said that he went a long way in establishing it as a good actor who was really more than just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in a small role that is not supported as a morgue supervisor but the film is rich in talent from Jack Palance (still called Walter Jack Palance) while the local 'Big' follows the lateral kick Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Retig Paul Douglas, who is characterized by rock hardness, is the cop who is heading to Widmark. It is a very rewarding film because it has not been seen much. Catch him if you can.
