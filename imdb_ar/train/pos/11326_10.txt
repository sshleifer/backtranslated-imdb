I've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! I was not interested in the anime series since Neon Genesis and Evangelion. This series is actually based on the game h, I'm not sure whether they have been implemented before or not, I have not played the game, but from what I heard they followed well. <br /> <br /> I give this series 10/10. It has a great story, fun characters and some of the best animations I've ever seen. Also contains some great Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you do not see this series yet, check it out. You can find sub-episodes on some of the anime websites, which are outside of Japan directly.
