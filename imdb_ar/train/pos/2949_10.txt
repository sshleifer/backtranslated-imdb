This is the farthest stand I've ever seen and I think it's the funniest time I'll see. If you do not choke on an absolutely hilarious laugh, this is not just a cup of tea. But frankly I do not know anyone who saw this he did not like. It's been 17 years and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to fart, Aunt Bunnie to Ice Cream Man, Ralph and Ed to GET OUT !! There are a lot of individual and collective performances of joy here, if you do not see this movie honestly, you will miss one of the best positions ever. Take either Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, or Dis, or George Carlin, or even greats like Richard Pryor or Red Fox, and this will surpass him. I do not know how or where Murphy got some of the stuff he works in but works. This is what it is about. It's funny like hell. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine how this show should have shocked people who are used to Eddie doing buckwheat, Mr. Rogers and the like on the SNL? If you listen to the audience when they break their first joke or when they say the word F for the first time, they are in complete shock. <br /> <br /> The first time he says that the word F is when it is a comic about Mr. T being gay. <br /> <br /> "Boy, boy, you look very nice in jeans, come on here now, and f @ ** raise the ass!" <br /> <br /> The crowd bursts into laughter. No one expected the dirty mouth he had fired at them. But the results were fantastic. I have never been outraged by uncompromising comedy as I was in this position. In fact, the next time I hit my stomach a lot of laughter was not until 1999 when I saw South Park: bigger and taller. That comedy was raw and unrecognized and went to De Gaulle, as Darius did. I do not think it's possible to watch this comic history and not laugh. Almost twenty years later, this is still the funniest curse on the video. <br /> <br /> "Your children took the fishing last week, put the worm on the hook, the children prepared the fishing pole in the boat, and they shook their heads in the water for two minutes, Gus." The normal kids do not do shit like Gus, Around them like this m **** f ***** with the fish, then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo! I said Can you believe this f **** n shit?! "<br /> <br /> Watch it again and be ready to laugh at your weird ass off! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
