I have watched this movie many times, and every time I see it, I can only enjoy it. Gunga Din is one of the classic films produced in the Hollywoods Golden Years when actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on special effects and man-made "monsters" to carry a scene. The charisma and comedy shown by Carrie Grant, Victor McGlaughn, Douglas Fairbanks, Junior Superbeb and very entertaining to watch. The position of the tongue and cheek in which the three actors play their roles works beautifully and flawlessly. Some may consider them "vulgar" but I consider them classic "classic" films and behave at their best. One must remember when watching this film that Europe was involved in a war with Germany and that the masses went to the movies to escape the horrors of war and entertainment and move it to a place where people were greater than life and did heroic deeds and good always conquer evil. Gunga Din accomplishes this entirely by allowing the audience to laugh with actors during their horrific escape. In short, it is a classic film that does not take itself seriously and does not want the audience either.
