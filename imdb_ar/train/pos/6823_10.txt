Last week I watched John Cassavet's films - from "Woman Under Influence" to "Opening Night". I'm blown away completely and especially, especially by these two films. From the first minute to the last in the "opening night", I was completely absorbed. I have encountered this on several occasions only, but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted about two-thirds, until the emergence of credits. Everything about this film, the way it was filmed, the amazing performance of Gina Rowlands, credits, opening, music, plot, sense of depth, pace, tenderness, originality, characters, skill and small moments ... to me, truly sublime. I did not agree more with the previous comment about moving him to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something worth seeing. If you are not lucky in a home fire, I guarantee that instead of making a final attempt to save the money under your bed, you will save your copy of this film instead.
