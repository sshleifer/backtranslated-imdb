This is an exceptional film, fooling you constantly. It seems to be heading towards cliches at several points, and then something amazing will happen that is truly amazing. It's better to say much more, but you have to stick to this movie and you'll get a rich reward. William Heinz is very delightful - he is definitely a star worth re-discovering. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Beckford is amazing - there is even a scene in which Haines rubs Beckford's chest (Beckford suffers from the cold). Both actors play this subtext subtly and with great emotion, so that there are very moving moments. I did not think I could participate in a football match like I did in this movie - I do not even understand the rules! Ralph Francis X. Bushman is Haines's rival to the girl (yes, it's not a completely gay film). The magnificent silent classic - a great example of Twenties' commercial cinema with an edge.
