I usually do not have a specific program (except the OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20 years old), but I'm not kidding after one episode of Reunion I was hooked. <br /> <br /> I can not even say how much you bothered me that time may have conflicted with Bush's speech last night because I was really looking forward to the 1987 episode, which will be broadcast next Thursday. Again, this conflict was unfavorable because because it is a new offer, it needs to create its follower, and after the second week is stopped the week will kill some momentum. <br /> <br /> Even so, television does not always have to be Emmy worthy of being fun. I do not expect Reunion to get any awards, but I expect to be able to attract my attention throughout the season. Have you ever seen the first few episodes of the beloved show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you got hooked. It takes personal building some time. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, a single episode of each idea is a great idea. The only other show I can remember is to do something similar is 24 episodes, each episode takes an hour ... and spend a year full of more realistic events than a day full of events! Please give this show a snapshot. Relax around the artwork ... it's just a TV!
