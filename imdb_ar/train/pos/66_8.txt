"The room of the house" came as a complete surprise. There was no idea what was going on around him. He gave him a lot of time because he had no punches and what we saw was how life changed by a disgruntled young man who decided to make his fellow classmates, innocent victims of his reckless acts. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director who works and edits his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by stunning performances everywhere by his team. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl trying to graduate from high school. It has been a few years away and does not seem to be in the same wavelength as other students. On the one hand, she is a rebel with a punk appearance, and a lot of make-up and mouth that will cut anyone who dares to approach her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the room of the house where nine students died, presumably killed by her boyfriend. I realized that Alicia was an infected girl who had gone through a terrible tragedy in her life, but we did not give any evidence. <br /> <br /> The following is the tragedy of this tragedy, because it focuses on a young woman who survived it. Diana Cartwright is a wealthy older teenager who should not have been at school at all. When a bullet hit her, she was hospitalized with more than one wound. She tries to overcome this dark period in her mind, but nightmares do not let her forget. <br /> <br /> The school principal sends Alicia to the hospital. Since she does not cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Diana in her terrible condition, and perhaps she will ease and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia hates Diana, but within days the two girls will achieve peace. We do not even realize the latest sequence of what actually happened on that terrible day at school. <br /> <br /> Phillips makes Alicia and Erica Christiansen excellent in the same quality as Diana. Victor Garber, James Benkins, Taylor Holland, and the rest of the actors play as a group. <br /> <br /> The film is very intense because it is not clear how the shooting took place, helping to make Mr. Randy's tone.
