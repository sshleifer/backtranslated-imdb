It is more like a psychological analysis of films, but the psychological sound seems better as a head. The man in charge of the film (narrator if you like) films the films here in his own way. Most of them are classic, but they are all listed here at IMDb and I highly recommend seeing them (especially Hitchcock, Solyaris, and Conversation & Lynch) because Slavoj Zizek will point them out! <br /> <br /> In other words, it may corrupt you. I do not remember if it spoiled more than the ones I included (I think the films are also Chaplin), but as I wrote, it would be better to see them all in advance! The IMDb list has a missing movie, and you have reported it, so it may be there soon. It's Meg Ryan, but it's just a short clip and not a big deal. <br /> <br /> Zizek's views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you're open to seeing things from another perspective (even if it ruins your favorite movie a bit for you ... it does not mean he will, but maybe)!
