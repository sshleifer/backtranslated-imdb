This is the list of the best favorite movies ever! It's a wonderful movie. It was historically interesting and great to see! I thought the acting from Emily Blunt was fantastic and Robert Friendt Albert was wonderful, and Albert's best actor was chosen. The costumes were wonderful and the settings and sights like the opera house were amazing and detailed. I just loved it, all this! I loved the scenes of childhood that were being bullied by John Conroy. Her mother says she has to walk down the stairs with an adult. Again the book did it! Produce this wonderful script! <br /> <br /> They deserve the awards they have received. (Oscar and BAFTA win the Sandy Powell fashion design) A BAFTA for the best make-up and hair, the Oscar for Best Achievement in Artistic Direction, the best achievement in fashion design and the best in make-up ... The design, also nominated for Best Actress, Emily Blunt, CDG for Excellence in Fashion Design for Film - Period, Hampton International Film Awards for the Audience Award for best feature film, PFCS for Best Fashion Design, VFCC for Best Actress, Emily Blunt.) Total 10 wins and 11 nominations! this is very good! Take a look at yourself, it's really interesting! Personally Robert's friend must have been awarded an award.
