As many reviewers have noted here, the film version is slightly different from the storyline version of the story. I have never seen the play version of the story, so I have a more appropriate review of the film than many other reviewers. Richard Attenborough may not have been the best choice for the film's director, but the film is still an amusing tale of many dancers trying to spend a great deal of time in the show of dancer Michael Douglas. The film is true by not choosing any famous actors or artists to end up in the final set. In this way our focus is on the movements of dancers, individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of attempts. Douglas is also not the best option for the part. It is clear that some of the songs have disappeared in favor of a new song, and the full story of the cliche has added to a romantic bond between a dancer and a dance designer. I have to say with all fairness that this was the weakest part of the film. Cassie's repeated intrusions during the experiment seem to reflect the almost desperate calls one must make when engaging in the arts in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film has been to death in the past, it is strange to see this tired old boot kicking his heel again. The dancers themselves began to reveal themselves in a promising fashion with the number "I can do it", but then sprang up at different points while the dancers were telling their stories. Frankly, their stories were a little different from the real-life people who never get such a chance. *** of 4 Stars.
