Ship Ahoy may have been made to showcase MGM's talent. The film is an enjoyable voyage aboard a ship in the ocean on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, while the country participated in World War II. These were model fare for the studios, which gave the film a light weight entertainment as distraction during those difficult times. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell appears at best in some of the music numbers where she clearly shows that she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton is also seen in a straight part with a lot of clowns, as he follows the beautiful Mrs. Powell on board the ship that takes them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good chances in the film to show that he is a funny man. Virginia Gray is also seen as a gay girl who is not fooled by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers featuring Tommy Dorsey and Orchestra, where one sees, among others, the amazing Bodhi Rich, who has a few solo tunes with Mr. Dorsey and Ms. Powell. Young Frank Sinatra also appears as the band's lead singer, supported by Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey that must be enjoyed by fans of this genre, which is fully controlled by MGM.
