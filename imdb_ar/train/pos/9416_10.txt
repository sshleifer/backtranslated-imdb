The man in the white wings, like I JIGHT JACK, takes a dim view of employment and capital. Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but eccentric (he never got his college degree because of ... misses ... in the college lab). He managed to push himself to various industrial laboratories in the textile industry. When the film begins, he is at Michael Gough, and Gough tries (in an unforgettable moment) to convince his wife's father (Cecil Parker) to show him the company of his ship. During lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter (Joan Greenwood), Goff gets a message about some of the problems related to the unexpected large budget problems of the lab. He reads huge expenses (because of the Guinness experiments), and chokes his coffee. <br /> <br /> Guinness continues to work for Parker, repeating the same tricks he did with Goff - but Parker also discovers it. Greenwood discovered what Guinness was doing and convinced Parker to continue experiments (but now legally). The result: Guinness and his assistant seem to know how to make synthetic fibers that can constantly change electronic bonds within their molecular structure so that fibers (in all intentions and purposes) remain in good condition forever. Any fabric made of it will not fade, become dirty or ever erode - will last forever. <br /> <br /> Guinness has the support of a female hostess but not her boss. He sees the Guinness book selling to the rich. But when he explains what he did, they turn on him. If everyone has clothes that will last forever they will not need new clothes! Parker's colleagues in the textile industry (led by Goff and Ernst Theissinger - in great performance, and Howard Marion Crawford) soon felt alarmed by what might end their careers. They seek to suppress the invention. With Greenwood only in the corner (despite Parker's sympathies with him), Guinness tries to deliver news to the audience. <br /> <br /> In the end, Guinness is defeated by science and greed. But he finishes the film and he sees the error in his calculations, and we believe that one day he may still discover his discovery after all. <br /> <br /> It's a great comedy. But is the oppression argument correct? There is nothing to show that the cloth will extend if the owner is fat (or shrinking if the owner is thin). Do we think that People want only one set of clothes forever What happened to change the fashion and new styles? The cloth is made only in white (making Guinness look white) We learned that color dye must be added early in the process, Fabric structure? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not true A scientific paper, but a film about the hypocrisy of labor and capital in modern industry, it is wonderful, but these questions that I mentioned continue harassing me about the health of the suppression of the invention of the Guinness
