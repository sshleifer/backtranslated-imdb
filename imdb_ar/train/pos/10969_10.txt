I knew about her and I never saw Gray Gardens before I saw Broadway musical of the same name. Friends warned me that if I did not watch the film, the musician would have no meaning. It happened, but it also prompted me to rent the film. At first, I thought it was the wreck of a train, full of strange characters and her, and it was very hard to see. But the ability to stop, digest and return to it made me realize why Gray Gardens is an unforgettable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable, and their complete lack of self-awareness is worth watching. Both are still beautiful despite the age of infringement. They have a relationship that will calm any woman (no doubt some men) and make you reconsider your dealings with your mother. In an era where reality television and cinema are common, it is great to see the works of Milees three decades ago and to realize the impact that the film must have. <br /> <br /> I echo what the other posters said: How were they allowed to sneak into such a beating by their families? But then, how can two people who live in the 1970s survive reality this way? Or were they simply considered so crazy that they could not be helped? I highly recommend watching this with the suspension track, which gave me an extra insight into the film.
