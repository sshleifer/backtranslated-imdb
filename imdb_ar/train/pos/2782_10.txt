"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that got very little show here in the United States. Perhaps because of the fact that the film was a strong British in terms of dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football (football here), which some may also have difficulty connecting to in the United States. It is unfortunate that this film is very cool and deserves much more coverage here. I think the basis of the story, (after the dream), is something that many people can relate to. Finally, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a good film with a really good inspiration and representation. I was not very excited to see this film at first, but now I feel sorry not to see it sooner. I highly recommend this movie!
