I sincerely hope that at least one season of Cosby will be released on DVD one day. The episode with Hilton's eccentric genius brother, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Brown), is a classic cheerleader. It reflects the rivalry between brotherhood, brotherhood and love among brothers whose lives have taken different paths, but both end up happy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Ms. Rashad have brilliantly captured the chemistry they have participated in at Cosby for many years and placed them in a more middle class role that illustrates the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> Comic dynamite list ... Madeleine Khan, Felicia Rashad, and Mr. Cosby ... Classic Genius!
