This adapts better than Paltrow's book (although I also liked it). It's no better than Beckinsale's best - both are very good - but the best movie scenario. Davis is Master of Austin's adaptation of photography, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not as shiny as a Hollywood treat, but it's close, and I think the sites and costumes are actually working better.
