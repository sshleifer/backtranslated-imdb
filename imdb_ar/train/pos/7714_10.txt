There were a lot of science fiction movies. They were great draws for the Drive-in theaters. Many of them were so crappy at that time. This film and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" stand out, and both have gone their own way. From the beginning with a rich rich musical score (which is still strange because theodod is barely used at all) it takes you to the forbidden planet where no man has ever gone before. When talking about Star Trek, there are a lot of material in this movie that has entered the game Star Trek TOS as a pilot in the series; from Interactive Captain / First Mate / Doctor, Crazy World, Alien Objects, Babe in Short Skirt, Computer Intelligence; Now, but this was the first of its kind. Moreover, it contains well-represented, well-performing works of art that to this day create a certain horror in the pictures. Think about how to portray a huge Krell machine successfully with some real depth. I saw this as a child (in a car: 0) when it was a new film and I was scared. Of course, every film was scary at the time, but I remember that I was really worried about this invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that sci-fi fans can watch several times and find something new with each show.
