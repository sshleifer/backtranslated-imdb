One of the best films Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music in Irving Berlin. Strong support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> The wonderful songs "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Put All All" feature my eggs in one basket. "The latest song was performed by Astaire, playing the Jazzy piano and then dancing with Rogers." Rogers also sang "Let Yourself Go" with Grable among the reserve singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays a sister Rogers' mousy mousy "This is a song that sticks to you for days," she sang, "but where are you?" Stunning and fast-paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best. and Dance "is one of the most famous of their numbers, Rogers wears one of the great dresses in the history of the film .... It is a twinkling figure twirling around her legs as she dances (as if you see a little) This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters have recreated in Beniz from the sky. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems a strange choice as an Astair colleague, but he also appeared in Roberta with Irene Dunn. Or dance.Grable and Ball seemed to have bigger parts in 1936, but they have a few scenes and little impact. Allwyn has a bigger but a fair role. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of its best individual numbers in the series with " Let Yourself Go ".... Jazzy and thumping, it's a great song. It's fun all the way, although I'm tired of "joining the Navy" after the third time ....
