... and if you are very good, it will look like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a little silly story, but it was a fantasy after all, and it was acting and acting immediately! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / impersonator, full of all the small ages and vanity imaginable in the actors. You get a glimpse of what actors look like behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> This was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just like his character has his best role in representing the dead dictator! And the scene parting: like something from Casablanca, in fact! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was wonderful as head of the secret police in Parador. He has got some funny lines, some of them greeting other films, such as "Catching the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> Sonia Braga was excellent as a girl friend - in addition to being a very hot figure: "You should get an Oscar tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget Johnny Winters as a CIA agent and many guest stars playing their roles: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavite - all of it has been fully implemented. All in all, a memorable fun under the fridge. <br /> <br /> -R.
