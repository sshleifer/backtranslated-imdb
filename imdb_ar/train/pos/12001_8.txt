I do not know which film these other people saw, but they must have seen "Joseph Smith: The Repetition Prophet" different from the film I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the film was both well done and inspiring. I think it is definitely worth watching. It is clear from the beginning that there is a lot of interest in the film industry. The background scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith as a man and an apostle. Joseph's spiritual experiences are depicted with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
