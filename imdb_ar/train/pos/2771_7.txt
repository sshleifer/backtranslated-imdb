David Pachiba is a portrait of the 20th Century Bible produced by Daryl Xanok, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Beck (King David), Susan Hayward (Bethchba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kiron Moore (Yuria) and Gene Meadows . <br /> <br /> The film is based on the book of the Second Old Testament of Samuel from the Bible. King David, who was killed as the giant Goliath child, follows King David as the second king of Israel. The king is tough and assured, yet David has heart affairs causing great problems. For once he spies with a bathing suit, it's the beginning of a journey that includes adultery and treason. A journey will end in God's reign that is called. <br /> <br /> These games are usually produced by David & Bathsheba. From his excellent designs to the brilliant designs of Leon Schamroy, Technicolor is of sufficient quality to ensure that you sit side by side with the best of the genre in terms of production values. Though the film is at an enchanting pace and relies on 99% of its value, driven entirely by dialogue. This is not one for movement fans or anyone who needs some colors to carry with a buckle. This is a very human picture, in fact, do not let the bush burn here, it is a biblical love story full of heart sins. But this is not a bad thing at all, because it is divided into very well-found (Peck has a poor but poor thing that happens well & Hayward drives it to the limit) and will be a great story directed with skill knowledge by Henry King Folding Forgetting. Although some dialogue is disturbing, the flow of personality is never interrupted. The Philippe du Dan (The Ghost and Moyer) scenario takes Oscar's attention. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a forgotten picture of the Bible / Swords and Sandals (probably because it's a chatter with a heart as its main selling point), but it really deserves the time of anyone interested in the most luxurious species. 10/07
