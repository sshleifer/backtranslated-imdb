When I was eight years old, I always watched movies and television that I was not supposed to be, and this was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it must be the most extraordinary film I have ever seen, and the acting is excellent. They do not make comedy like that today. (Movies are really funny and make you laugh without resorting to feces or a kind of body fluids that stimulate vomiting, as in the films of the late Jad Abato, which starring non-familiar actors such as Seth Rogen and barf). <br /> <br /> This movie is classic with actors who can do it and deserve all the accolades.
