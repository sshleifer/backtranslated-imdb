From the first scene, you get clues about what can happen here. It becomes clearer with the continuation of the story. The acting is excellent all the time and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what was going to happen, I was only very puzzled by the impulse. I'm still puzzled as to what Ben did. We can see "second thoughts" in his face, but the ultimate sacrifice seems to contradict his feelings and feelings. It was a very interesting and moving story but left me confused. Maybe that was the aim of the film. I liked the movie and Wil Smith could fail to pick another good movie. This man knows how to enjoy the audience!
