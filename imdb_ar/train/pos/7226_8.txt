Something fairly typical of filmmaking of this age. Obviously, it was first designed in this world for the theater, but nevertheless a very good film from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Suzanne Yorke perform their roles in the silver screen, both of which work effectively. There is very little in the way of the story, and anyone unfamiliar with this type of study of tone characters may be a bit late. All in all, though, is a good film in which Peter O'Toole and Suzanne Yorke exaggerate.
