I liked this movie, which reminded me of my marriage. It is very clean you can see it with family. Well done. The songs are fine too. I think the director is a wonderful director. The film shows how marriages progress through time. They have pairs in different stages of life and relationships in their lives, and the film beautifully depicts several parallel stages in the same story. Some dialogues are very good. The film depicts complex human emotions very well and not over-represented. It also shows perfection after all is not perfect. Very well illustrates the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The film is written and directed very well.
