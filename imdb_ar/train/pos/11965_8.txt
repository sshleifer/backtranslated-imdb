When I read a great variety of reviews of "Scoop" over the past few days, I entered the theater set up for a subpar walk from Woody. Luckily, I could not have been more wrong. Woody is acknowledged to slow down a touch or two, but Woody the writer / director is in good shape - and found a reliable way to integrate his 70-year-old in the story. Judging from laughter and snooze, the audience took on a monosyllabic and their dialogue in a way I had not seen in years. <br /> <br /> In a cinematic scene dominated by the story-approved story bows and 20th-party fare and assembly line fare for children, it is both a source of satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen following his very personal quest and still rewarding track.
