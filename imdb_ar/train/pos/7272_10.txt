Before I begin, let me tell you how you can enjoy these special sounds when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (Red Mountain level in particular). So while watching this position, I suggest - no, I ask you to do so. <br /> <br /> Carlos Menesia takes his position to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There is a mockery of everyone without any apology at all. <br /> <br /> I thank very much God here that Carlos did nothing to use the same joke again and again. I know a few times I said, after Carlos said a joke, "Damn, this guy makes a good point!" Then the "Game Over" screen appeared on my TV because I forgot I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing to complain of this attitude. If you have TiVo or something like that, please provide a service for yourself and record this historic clock.
