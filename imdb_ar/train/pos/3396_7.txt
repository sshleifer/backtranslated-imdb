so interesting. The big torsion was not as great a shock as they had hoped and was very dated but it worked in my mind. He really made me think of a world free of plants or cattle and made me appreciate the world in which I live so much. Charlton Heston does a good job, as do all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film that was surprising. It lacked direction sometimes and had a lot of settings and background needed more illustration, but it was still a very good and amazingly smart film. The main mistake I found was that I did not want the movie to end when it was over, and I wanted to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
