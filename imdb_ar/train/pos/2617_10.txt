I have seen the King of the Lion more than once by all my friends. Get a little sister .. You know how it is. Now I save both the plot and the lines. After the lion came out of the king 2 I was fine, let me see ... The second was much weaker ... Then I saw an advertisement for the Lion King 1 and 1/2 ... I was an example so good, we go again. After watching 1 1/2 you like wow. All my expectations (for repetition) were broken. A beautiful and original plot keeps you in your seat all the time. I noticed that the animation was filled with many of the comedy moments that ROFlmao would apply here 100%. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend seeing the animation.
