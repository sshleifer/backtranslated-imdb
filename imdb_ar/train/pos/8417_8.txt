Although the style of this film is no less realistic and realistic as if the audio version was perhaps, it is still a very good film. In fact, he was seen as an excellent film in his day, where he was nominated for the first Oscar film Best Picture (lost to WINGS). I still consider WINGS a distinct film, but this film is wonderful despite a bit overrated by the lead, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general of Tsarist Russia living outside his last days making a few dollars in the 1920s by being an extra Hollywood. His luck seems to have changed with a strong call - to play Imperial Russian generals fighting the Communists during the revolution. Of course, this is not enough representation, but it also drives the old man to think of the old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what will happen next, I'll leave you, but it's a good film - especially in the end. By the way, look for William Powell as a Russian director. Although made in 1928, he does not appear to be too small in many of his subsequent makeup.
