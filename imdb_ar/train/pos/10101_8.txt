Dominion tank police is an exercise in the making of contrasting films. The narration combines the four parts between reckless work, humor, slapstick, touching humanity, and thinking about philosophical questions. It is hard to believe that there was only one exit, where the pattern changes from loop to loop. A movie you should watch for anyone who likes anime.
