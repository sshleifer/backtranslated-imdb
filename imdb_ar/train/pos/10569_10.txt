Intelligent, intelligent, intelligent, fast-paced, sexy, high-spirited, playful, lustful, vibrant and fun, Footlight Parade is a first class entertainment, what movies are about. <br /> <br /> Realism, sarcastic treatment gives a new feature to the material and the speed and connection of the line is breathtaking. To believe that they just started making pictures talking about features 7 years ago! The brilliance of dialogue can not match anywhere today, especially given that "realism" has captured contemporary cinema and swept. <br /> <br /> This movie was produced at a time when the content of the Hayes code restricting the content was ignored. The result is a new cinema with self-reference, criticism and living that speaks directly to contemporary audiences suffering from depression and general anxiety of the age. I recommend watching any film of this period, ie 1930-1935, to see what the popular cinema could be.
