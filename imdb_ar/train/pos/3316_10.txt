Beit Meidler is not described at this ceremony. She gives it every time you are on stage. Whether we laugh at her jokes and instincts or close our eyes to the strains of one of her enormous songs, Beit Meidler moves her audience. If you can not see them directly (which is the best way to see Bette) this is the next best thing. The interesting thing is to note how her voice has changed and matured incredibly over the years but has never lost his strength. Do not lose the "right with me" version of "Stay With Me" Never anything in the spirit of THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, it is here more pure and heart than ever before. I will appreciate this concert for a very long time.
