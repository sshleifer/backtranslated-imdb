This is one of a good number of cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - a space dog called K-9 was also included. Looney Tunes Loop This is very funny, and it has reasonably good animation (Marvin's animation was done very well) and the plot was done well. The ending is rather strange, so be prepared for it, it is a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin Mars was sent to Earth to capture a Earth creature and return it to Mars. With his reliable K-9 dog, Marvin begins and soon found paths there is no rabbit other than Bugs Bunny! Congratulates them on treating him, believing they are a trick or being treated in their own fashion. Only realize that they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin Mars and Looney Tunes in general. As far as the beginning and beginning of the episode are concerned, you are likely to love this. Enjoy the Hair Hair! :-)
