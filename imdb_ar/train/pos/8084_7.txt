<br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the other night. I have been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years, since I graduated from high school. I did not grow up in this film ... Maybe my mother took me away from him. It's definitely not for kids. This is not a bad thing graphically, but these topics will apply correctly over 10 years of age. Overall, the animation was excellent considering that this was done in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book well in a loose sense. But I was annoyed that Bashki did not add another 40 minutes or so and took parts of the king's return. Would make it the final film. I was disturbed because of its sudden end, and then when I heard the "Return of the King" sucked, I was even more upset. Too bad it was not a great animated film. Maybe I got a higher vote than me. I give it number 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will do justice to the books through the new direct action LOTR.
