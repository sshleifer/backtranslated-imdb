This is one of the greatest love story films I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract attention from the film. One should try to observe, critique and enjoy any form of art from a time perspective. Clearly by the standards of "Sex in the City", Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. However, when it was judged by 1925 America, it was wonderful. Similarly, Saonara is a wonderful film in his view of a mixed-race love relationship, arrogance and prejudice, the "obvious fate" of America, and the complexity of different cultures. It's another natural step for movies like Gentleman's. But its purpose was not merely a social commentary, but rather an interesting and enjoyable one, with innumerable lines that can not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> However, even when it is just considered a love story, even though some are attacking Brando's tone, it is at its best in detail and discrimination. Buttons and Umeki (both Oscar winners) and other supporting actors add much to the film. <br /> <br /> Taka, the real star, does a great job of feeling the passion she feels for Brando, while she is torn by her sense of commitment and loyalty. Her speech when she meets Brando and talks to him for the first time is a classic and rarely in film. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the film is equally good. Of course, does not contain the mouth, spit on the worst, which embodies love in today's movies, but this makes it better. It depicts true love and passion, not just "heat." If you do not catch this movie, you are young, naive or dead.
