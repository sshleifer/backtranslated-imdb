I do not think I would have enjoyed it any more, although some things were annoying. I will not say if you have not seen it ... you have to know it yourself. In any case, what movie could be lacking in puppy dog ​​eyes by Robert Downey Jr.? All in all, the plot has been developed sufficiently. Nothing seems too fast, because movies like these tend to be. The characters were like power, and there were lots of fun scenes in them. The general idea is that the story is linked to each other well, even if some aspects are not satisfactory ... according to opinion. But as I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
