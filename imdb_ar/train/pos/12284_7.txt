I could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it was necessary to show a more disturbing tone, speaking through the taut teeth, and from the back of his throat. In fact, the film has messed up for me, distracting him from what was likely to be a good performance for him (very annoying). There does not seem to be a representative or other representative of a clear tone, while I always rated Jeremy Irons as a good actor, I did not classify this film as one of his best films. However, the film has inspired my appetite, as I did some other comments about this film, which I found interesting, and I intend now to read the book.
