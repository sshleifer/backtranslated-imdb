The only word that sums up this film is quirky. It's a light-hearted paper through the concept of my being. Bouncy (in more than one way) and a little nut. I will not call it the big movies that are completely memorable and do not seem to be as memorable as the first director's "Cube," but it's good to see him on a Sunday morning. Distractions behave from respect to sometimes annoying, but I think that's what has been written. It was done as a serious film, perhaps it could have been wonderful or it might have turned into a pretext. Somewhat similar to the "matrix" meets the "head" meets "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
