This movie is hilarious, original, and beautifully directed. I have become a big group BIG BAD SWIM, and follow it to film festivals whenever and wherever I can. I have seen him now about six times, and each time, the enthusiastic audience's response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to be shown in years. In almost every festival, it was shown, sold, or won a favorite audience award. Obviously people like this film, and even more obvious why they do. Fantastic cinematic photography, characterization and brilliant disposition, wonderful ending, the trend filled with compassion, wisdom and perfect timing art. It's hard to believe that this is the first film by Ishay Seton. I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.
