"The Rich in Love" is a film of life segments that brings scenes to the Charleston family world to some extent exotic. Very romantic, beautifully filmed, written and well represented, "RIL" is washed like a summer breeze, as the ineffectual laziness revives life in characters like you at the end of the film will feel you are an old friend of the family. <br /> <br /> RIL is a wonderful film driven by great characters, directed by "Driving Miss Daisy," a short-sleeved "Sleeping" film that attracts most mature audiences.
