The Four Man (Paul Verhoeven - The Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> A film based on a feature film by Gerard Reeve, works best as a thriller. This is surprising, since the study of the countryside needs almost a hundred pages just to twist a simple conspiracy and tension is the last thing in my mind when reading his works. <br /> <br /> The "fourth man" is the highest on the symbol. Paul Verhoeven is generally very concerned about proving something to most hostile critics, and I'm never sure who he is exactly trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in an indifferent way, quickly distancing himself from the original idea or story, and seems to forget what he needs to see on screen and what should be excluded. In "The Fourth Man", he was not explicit in plot detailing as with sex and nudity (of which there are many), but as in most of his films, he seems to be afraid that the public will not reclaim it and toss it into the home story with a public symbol mixed with Some scenes of nudity and sex are supposed to shock. There is hardly a scene without sex or full frontal nudity, most unjustified, and in your face, it undermines a good story. <br /> <br /> However, when you can handle Verhoeven's very obvious comic approach, they are sometimes very exciting with some intriguing plot transformations and good performances throughout the tour, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√© in particular. The mysterious camera --- 7/10
