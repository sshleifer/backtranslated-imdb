Not a bad movie as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> Contains a good representative. It is better to see Roger Moore again on the screen as well as to use other British actors. <br /> <br /> You want to see more "Olivia de Obo" in future projects. She may have starred in front of her exciting cousin Mariam Deppo. <br /> <br /> Also good use of invisible sites like Luxembourg> <br /> We hope to see more joint production between the UK and Europe like this.
