There are so many people in our lives that we meet them only once in our lives, but for one reason or another we remember these people for the rest of our lives. These friendships occur once in a lifetime among people with long distances, and there are always some natural reasons why we do not meet these people anymore. We do not always know their names, since we never offer to each other, sometimes forget to ask about their names. It is funny that common humanity makes friends from time to time and we would like to keep it this way, because reunification may spoil the wonderful memories, or we do not know. We are very afraid of checking it out. <br /> <br /> The movie "Before the Sunrise" was watching me. I never intended to watch it, but since the discussion between the couple was interesting, I took a look at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect, but I did not know the young couple. They had time to discuss each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to break up. I think this film was a good review because the situation is something that everyone has lived on this planet once or twice at least. Makes us all think of all those people we have met only once in our lives.
