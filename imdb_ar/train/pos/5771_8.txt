This is one of those movies that occur when you surf one Saturday afternoon, get attracted to it and end up watching everything. I thought it was a good thing and made me really feel like a character. Although it is a bit slow, where they focus more on the relationships between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, they have never been dull. We do not really see much of the robberies that were legendary to them, and instead most of the shootings occur when the police are ambushed. I thought Tracy Needham, who played Bonnie, did a good job with her character. Moving from a nice rural girl to a cold-blooded killer is difficult, and I enjoyed the precision with which I brought this position. Made for TV movie.
