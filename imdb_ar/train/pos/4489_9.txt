This film does not revolve around the cat and mouse battle as mentioned in the other comment. For a cat that consumed up to 8 of 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing another one. The cat is sober and scared to death all the time, hence the name "terrible cat". The former Freddy Cat's life haunts him as ghosts dating back to a different time and constantly tries to kill him, but he fears more than the ninth life that represents a cloud in figure 9 and spits the lighting of the bolts. Very old now but would still be fun for kids if I got a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie nearly every day as a child: o)
