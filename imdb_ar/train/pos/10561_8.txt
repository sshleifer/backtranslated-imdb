089: Footlight Parade (1933) - Issued on 9/30/1933, viewed on 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The ice cream cone was invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we hit the other Busby Berkeley song from Warner Bros. This time, Footlight Parade is fast-paced, starring James Cagney as a theater producer, Chester Kent. I'm 100% sure that Kane was directing Berkeley with his performance for Kent who is unstoppable, and who has to come up with new ideas for shows every minute. Joan Blondell is also as excellent as the attention of the board secretary who has become popular. Robbie Keller / Dick Powell is not a big sub-plot this time but it's no less fun. The only thing that puzzled me was Berkeley's own shows, which seemed so expensive and complex that they could not be performed at any stage, let alone stage a film afterwards. Busby obviously does not let anything like the story hinder him from compiling the most musical figures he can conjure up. I almost loved this film to the very end, with the Shanghai Lil, who, as one might imagine, is completely transformed into the stomach and the outrageous performances are racist. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six movies in three months.

"The funny thing about Kani was that he did not seem to be a leading man in the traditional sense. 5 inches tall "with a square head and spoke in a strange dialect in New York. But the man was very diverse, moving from the gangsters who made him very famous for the types of quick-talk producers we see here. Joan Blondell and the theft of the show almost as a secretary of loyalty and passion for Kenny, and Dick Powell and Robbie Keller played the gentle couple, but they seemed to get less time than before; Billy Barty Once again as an impulsive sprite, the film is typical of the most dynamic and adult-oriented music of the pre-cod era, unlike in the 1950s and 1960s was more family-oriented, an excellent peak for Warner's musical music that year Stand in front of him, with K T weak work in the search for Chinese language). <br /> <br /> The last film: Dinner at Eight (1933). The following movie: I am not an angel (1933).
