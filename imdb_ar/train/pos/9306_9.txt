The world is a terrible place. But this film is farce and fun. If you do not like it ... you will not get it ... and if you do not like it ... it does not matter. It is up to you if you want to play along. Each actor in this one was fun. It's just a joke. That's good enough for me. Gabriel Berne is priceless. Bayern and Paul Anka make my way, says Vic, "... the best version ever." Well, it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned to see him, but I'm sure I did ...
