Of the Austin film series of the 1990s, this is my favorite, even more than "persuasion," which was the one who turned me into an Ostanya. Before I saw this "Emma", I saw two earlier versions, but in one of them everything looked wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and on the other side, she looked somewhat wrong, like a potential antichrist, while she looked right here, young and silly and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and atmosphere of production convey the charm of the novel very well; it is actually one of the sweetest things I have ever seen, but in the nature of Christmas. The script is configured abnormally, and the plug-in plugins, such as the light column that Harriet reveals about Emma in the church, are all saved. Mark Strong, as Knightley, is not what I expected, but I enjoyed it a lot: it strongly highlights the clear practical side of the character, unlike Emma's influences, and his vocal tone against Frank Churchill is very funny. Bernard Hippon makes Mr. Woodhouse a nearly ridiculous figure of Caroline; Samantha Morton as Emma's protector is perfectly smooth and perfectly fixed as it should be. As in the same producers "Pride and Prejudice", care is taken to be able to ratify the final coupling between characters - uniquely in some cases. For me this production was still a joy.
