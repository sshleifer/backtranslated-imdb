I loved it so much that I bought a DVD and a novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including Arthur Small) is spectacular and exciting. <br /> <br /> It was possible to use a little more time for the screen for Frederick Lawrence (played by James Biorvoy). Gilbert Markham was "amazing" since the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Robert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon was the person who impressed me most with astonishment and astonishment. I'm impressed with Forsyte Saga, and everything I've seen in it. But he outdoes himself here as Arthur. In my most violent dreams, I could not picture him playing a scary mental like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. I love it too. I love it too.
