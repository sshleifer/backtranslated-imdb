I've seen recently and although I'm not a romantic comedy, I just think it was just a nice and sweet film to watch. Lots of movies in my opinion lack honesty. Do you know this feeling when you see a movie and feel stolen because it takes something from the story, and it was as if the director threw it together as if it was a waste? The story between scientists is sweet and funny. How they clung to each other and tried to help Tim Robbins become smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and raised a good point when it comes to love, "Nothing seems to be." I would recommend this for Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
