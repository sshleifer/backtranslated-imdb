Wonderful movie. One to excite all senses 5. Not a true historical report and all information must be considered as factual information. Hollywood's real conferences, such as running a list and very attractive actors such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook, Habib Ned Kelly), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Berne) were unattractive (sorry Jeffrey Rush) Actors play a Victorian police force drunk and corrupt. This also instills a very unreliable love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to seduce all romantics, where females are particularly vulnerable. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat young from drowning and calls his father "Sunshine" and "Shines in the eye as he looks at me, his hand on my shoulder", he is very romantic and convinces viewers along with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Besides, does not all Australians like the underdog?
