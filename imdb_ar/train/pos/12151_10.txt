This is just an example of what a film should have to make. I was lazy on a Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were at grad school that we stumbled on this. Cheesy representation. The script is badly written. Good boys. The premise is silly, but fairly straightforward, vulgar, and vulgar. Ride in pickup trucks with your wife's body supported. All is well. <br /> <br /> You'll meet familiar characters: the mania who digs the gold, the stupid stupid guy he wants to make alone, his friends who know best, his father who knows best but drives the son away. The wife is the corpse. Supported. In pick-up. <br /> <br /> Wow: The title. Many of the things in our lives have been the "Texas tragedies" since watching this beauty. Each participant in its establishment deserves a medal.
