The only reason to give this movie 8/10 stars, not 10, is that 1) Sinatra is awful and 2) Kelly's personal love interest leaves much to be desired, (IMHO). Do you like Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap, is the little boy. The dance series with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my personal favorite and my daughter. The 28-year-old is four years old, so while the character is less known than Mickey, he is still favored by many children and adults today. Kelly is always captivating, his eyes full of fun and excitement. In every film I saw him, he always stole the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder that Paula "sampled" Kelly's steps. I would also like to include Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you see only one part, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
