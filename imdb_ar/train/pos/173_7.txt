In fact, Goldie Hoon of Washington (Tacoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. This kind of film Mr. Smith goes to the movie genre in Washington, with some differences but the same premise. I have been recording this film for years because I was suffering from Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but some cocktail waitress is unlikely to get an important job in the government just because it saved the lives of some big shots. He made me laugh and made me mad at the same time. He made me laugh because some of the situations in which she found herself were so ridiculous, I had to laugh. (Possible spoiler before). It bothered me to think that our Government would establish an ordinary citizen in the manner in which it was established. And the speech she made in the end ... beautiful. Too bad, many people do not have such courage in real life.
