If you grow up on a diet of games, you will understand that you need to repair bigger and better gradually. Well, in the running world, your needs will be met. Because in this exhibition, prisoners compete for freedom and the final prize - their own lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was a parody on the circuit of mind that we see every day. It's not one of the best Schwarzenegger shows, but it's generally a very good movie. The basic idea that television companies will one day become the "true" rulers of the planet is believable, and is well portrayed in this film. Of course there are the usual Arnie characters, my favorite is when he is about to jump into the game area, asks a host of gameshow "any last words?" Arnie says: "Yeah, I'll be back" but the host mocks "just reboot" and presses the output button. I give this movie number 10 to absolute originality. I have to watch it 30 times or more. The only movie apart from the Die Hard series that I've seen so often !! <br /> <br /> In short, do not think you have the TV for a short time - it owns you .....
