People tend to complain about the number of films being produced about mentally disabled people. I do not see this as true criticism, nothing more than complaints about a lot of movies about what kind of people. Jaco van Dormael does a great job with text and direction. Daniel Otwell and Pascal Duquin work together perfectly, with Duquin playing himself mainly. The film covers a wide range of events, not simply by seeing what was seen in Rain Man. The ending is rather frustrating, but it does not destroy the wonderful story that has emerged before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 of 10
