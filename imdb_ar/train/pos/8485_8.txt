Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertainments with comedy wiseguy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally entertaining. Keaton balances all three aspects of his main character well. Wantabedde is the best. One warning: George Windt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is a very enjoyable capsule time.
