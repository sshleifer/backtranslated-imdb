Tidyly styled, beautifully photographed and acted brilliantly? Crosby's explanation seems quite correct. Hardwick has his best role at all. Yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> One of the main songs of the film, of course, is the songs. As expected, Bing in good voice. Although the single Hardwicke song has been cut, we can still hear his voice as he sings warmly as he dances with Crosby and Bendix in their new novel Busy Doing Nothing. It is also a pleasure to hear Ronda Fleming, who, despite having a wide range and career as a singer, rarely gives an opportunity to listen to her in the cinema. It has a beautiful voice that exceeds what looks like its charming manifestations ?? They seem to really bring Mary Mary Dodson fashion. <br /> <br /> Director Tae Garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget, using all the resources in his leadership to make every scene as spectacular as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse sounds trivial, but who complains?) <br /> <br /> In short, as the trailer actually describes, fun is fun from start to finish.
