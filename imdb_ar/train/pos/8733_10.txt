When I purchased my Toy Story when it was shown to Video after it was released in theaters, I watched a trailer for this by Toy Story creators. Once I saw that I know this would be a good feature! You're right! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is a wonderful story, great characters and great animations. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle, which was expressed by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar, which was expressed by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when the Slim Walking (David Hyde Pierce) from Hemlich moves in an attempt to distract Bird and Hemlich's you you hoo. Early Bird. What about a nice tasting worm on a stick and as good as I'm going to pick up! I'm going to pick up! I just died laughing in this scene. Being a fan of bugs, I think Bug's life is my favorite Pixar movie, although I know that many people consider it the worst Pixar movie ever! I do not know how you can hate the Pixar movie! I think they are all very good movies! Good job Pixar!
