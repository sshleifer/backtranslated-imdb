I'm not sure I understand what all those people who are being very ruthlessly talking about are talking about, here some people might want to bother them. <br /> <br /> The film was definitely incomplete (uneven representation, others may have experienced difficulties with time changes, actors are quite willing to go to places you do not prefer to go, etc.) but IMHO there were some things More than compensated for defects. <br /> <br /> First of all, I liked the bit of Breaking Rules. When you leave the naturally inhabited house, the bad guys leave you alone, giving you time to regroup and get friends and find a mysterious symbolic paranormal type. Normal (semi-spoiler alert) When hiding under the covers, they can only get the little opening you are looking for. Usually, in the end, ghosts have somehow become less creepy because you've found them misunderstood, edited, or anything else. <br /> <br /> Second, production was exceptional. Although the film did not influence special effects, the supernatural bits were too short. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best film for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the ultimate horror (none) against them, they've got their place), but that's great for those who started taking the conventions as a matter of course and do not face Problem with time distortions.
