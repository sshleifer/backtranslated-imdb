I have watched this movie three times. The last time, I kept wandering around in chaotic scenes to find a solution to the plot. Perhaps the plot is not intended to attach to each other logically. Or perhaps these are difficult sites in the plot because Ann's call to distant events is somewhat erroneous. <br /> <br /> Take Anne Grant's little (Claire Dance). Here is a young woman who joined an unnamed college with a wealthy family descendant. You must have helped afford this very high education, but it does not seem to have any family ties at all. Does not seem to have any relatives to turn to when the consequences of one of its disastrous decisions come into force. <br /> <br /> Ann shares an emotional evening with her great love, Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Later, when Harris accompanied Leila after the tragic death of her brother Bodie, Anne suddenly found him disgusting and disgusted by her actions. I must have missed something important here. Anne's behavior seems completely incomprehensible. Anne relinquished her relationship with Harris and eventually married one of the wedding guests at Laila's wedding. Despite Anne's refusal to Harris, she still clings to her deep feelings at the bed of her death. <br /> <br /> It was clear from his behavior that Harris was deeply in love with Ann and would happily marry her. A scene showing their chance at meeting years after Laila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings towards Anne. <br /> <br /> The film has shown a pattern of Ann's romantic relationships. She always fell with her men and refused. This style with Harris and two couples. In contrast, Laila married a man she did not love and remained with her husband until his death. Perhaps Laila was able to build a relationship because she refused to allow her marriage to fail. <br /> <br /> Then came the very comfortable appearance of Rose at Anne's bed. It seems that Anne's nurse was able to extract enough information from the last clear moments at the time to get to know Laila and contact her. None of these contacts appeared in the movie. <br /> <br /> I kept wondering about the house where Ann lived in her last days. How could she buy such a house on the meager profits of her singing career? Anne was always one step ahead of a financial disaster as she raised her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoyed making the movie and music very much. The coastal palace was very beautiful. Claire Danis was as bright as Anne Grant. She is really a talented singer. I much prefer her natural brunette to look her blonde bottle in the movie extras. If those annoying CGI fireflies just disappear, I could raise the movie in my voice!
