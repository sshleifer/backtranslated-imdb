I spent years searching for a copy of this movie (16mm, DVD, VHS), so I could show it to my kids. The film is funny, and shows Spike and his band members why they are the best musicians at work. They had to be good to play this dementia. I love it and recommend it to movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the turn of fire in the century, with a crew of professionals who are firefighters and the Circle Squad (when they do not fight fires). There are usual running gags, plus Spike Jones and his orchestra chaos. Also, the comedy relief provided by Comedy Body Hackett and Straight Man Hugh O'Brien.
