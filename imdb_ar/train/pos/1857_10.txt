This film was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than I expected it to be. It was certainly a disturbing film. It's an amazing story, with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (Should not surprise anyone) Derek Locke did a great job as well.
