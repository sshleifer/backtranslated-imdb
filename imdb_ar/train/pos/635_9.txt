I went to the small preview of this film on July 19, and I did not know more than the names of a few actors and it was a fantastic endeavor / adventure of some kind. <br /> <br /> The plot line is really not like what I've seen, and certainly a unique story is appreciated by everything that is currently or soon in the theaters. In spite of what the first impressions may give him, he is not cowardly, vulgar, vulgar or ridiculous, which is actually very amusing and funny. The flow is well done, nothing seems to be accelerating or withdrawing. The sound, because of the lack of better lyrics, magically adds a lot to the film, rather than just filling the silence as it often happens in movies or television. Although I may know what was happening at points, I could not afford to stop watching the screen; as far as I know, no one left the theater during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One gripe to me is that it seems that there is no marketing for this movie, and as ingenious as I can not figure out why.
