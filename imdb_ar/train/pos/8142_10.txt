Chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you see it. But if, by accident, I saw him for the second, third, fourth and fifth time (I am now in the hundreds now), you will find yourself spitting a line here and there and breaking yourself! My friends and I have already raised the fear of black hat parties to get more of our friends, "they say, in the riots."
