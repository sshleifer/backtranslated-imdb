The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Joseph von Sternberg. The Commander-in-Chief, the Grand Duke of Sergus Alexander (Emile Janings) shows us in the days of glory. In 1917 he enjoyed all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of the Russian Empire he had nothing. He also had a love for a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent). After about ten years he applied for a small part in a film about the revolution. His old enemy, Lev Andreev (William Powell) is the director who will choose whether to employ him as an additional film. Last Command is a very good silent drama. Emile Jennings does an unforgettable job in the lead. Evelyn Brent is great at leading women. William Powell is as wonderful as ever. There are a lot of scenes to remember in this film. Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. Then there is the end with Powell and Jannings. This film touches in many parts.
