I just saw "MURDER AT THE VANITIES" in the newly released Universal Pre-Code collection, and I was amazed at the extent of my enjoyment of the car to the end. Most other commentators covered the story, a murder mystery within a musical, but I wanted to add some additional notes. Bresson and Carlyle are relatively nice, compared to most young players, and no one seems to have the right voice to sing. (Carlyle is a trained opera singer, and Prison is a little wobbly on some of the top players). Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play a great role, enjoying a great sense of timing that keeps the ball between musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities girls, but let's not forget the great jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick shows one of her early appearances, looks like Yves Ardennes; Patrick will continue to become the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Then there's Jessie Ralph, the wardrobe mistress - you'll also discover her in David COPPERFIELD (like Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. "Sweet Marihuana" with the peyote button girls barely dressed in the background (the falling blood on one white complexion was fabulously disorganized); "The Rhapsody Ebony", with the Duke Ellington Orchestra A group of beautiful, black and white dancers mix it up. I think this is one of the early musicals that show such a mix - and fashion leaves nothing to the imagination.
