Disney's classic movie XII is a reasonable film tells through a simple story. Although it's a bit dated, it is well worth a place in the Disney Classics list. <br /> <br /> It's not one of Disney's best works, but it's sick. One of Disney's most simply acts, yes, but it retains a certain charm and charm (famous for its old Disney). This was an important film because it saved Disney from an exact position. If this is a failure, there will be no more classic Disney animations. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is somewhat like a return to Disney's first classic cartoon ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") because it recreates this kind of fairy tale. It's not clear where the story is going, but I suppose it's somewhere in France because it's based on a story written by Charles Perreault. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of favorite characters, such as Cinderella, Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jack and Goose (the main mice), the godmother of the fairy (for a fairy that is certainly funny), the birds, the king and the Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is extremely intelligent and entertaining. I love his voice. He really has that quality like a mouse. Gus may not be smart, but funny. <br /> <br /> King is hilarious, but I think what makes him funny is his short temperament. Grand Duke is a very cool and very funny chapter. They are two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most enjoyable moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is certainly one of Disney's most charming characters. Prince Philip of Sleeping Beauty was certainly inspired by this Prince, because they are very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Mrs. Tremin is not supposed to be loved because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastachia and Drazila) are not much better than them. However, the father's wife is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with it. Cinderella cute, cute, lovable. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the dress made by the godfather of Fairy. <br /> <br /> Lucifer is very harmful. The way he walks, and sticks his nose in the air and arrogant and smirk facial expressions make him funny. Ironically, it is very much like a father's wife when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the attitudes of the father's wife towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the correct name for him because he is like a diabolical cat means. However, there is nothing annoying about him. <br /> <br /> Soundtracks are simple but fun, although they are not among the best Disney songs. The best song in this film is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many talented actors in the industry, such as James McDonald, Marion Darlington, Elinor Audley, Verna Felton and Louis Van Rutin. . <br /> <br /> Although simple in appearance, the film has good works of art as well as good details, although there is nothing "out of this world". However, the King's Palace is an amazing masterpiece, being majestic and truly huge.
