I found this movie really funny because you have a young black comedy (Chris Rock) dying and being sent to earth in the body of a white man in the mid-fifties. Does not realize that his behavior must change and continue to behave as before. He listens to rap music, sings, and plays the typical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this film was the problem that this behavior collides with the black community.
