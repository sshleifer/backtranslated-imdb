Around 1986 I saw this film by accident on television one night. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my occasional scenes of the dreadful ending of "Do not Look Now" in 1987. I went to Venice next year in a state of silent horror, I hope my parents do not know I saw it! <br /> <br /> Were I thinking if my parents knew I saw Les Valcios when I was a child? I may avoid this subject with my parents even today, and my mother may have been opposed to the afterlife. I do not know if they want to see him anyway. From pursuit and quotas to a woman in a block of flats in the first scene to slide into the mountain roads with eyes glazed with glaze, I'm not sure if this film is an insensitive piece of garbage ignore the sexual revolution or if the sexy film is free to watch it explode so you can not Be offensive to yourself. <br /> <br /> It's definitely violent. Have a violent view of sex, almost no love confession. Even the baby turns a young child into a greedy sexual act of exploitation. But the script is very exciting and (God I'm very British) raises! Do they suck her breasts in her favor? This is exploitation. So why do I get wood? <br /> <br /> Are colleagues looking for an experienced older woman, or looking for a former narcotic? I do not know, I do not know. And ends up in a truly heinous suicide. I have described it to my friend G. B. Nelson, who suffers from cannibals' courage in the Holocaust, has gone! No mother's love for this film, quite the opposite. Distortion from where the boys started. Why do they shoot the girl in the leg? Why do you return to them? Should women be punished until they learn what is true of men? <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of two films, one of which I hope I will never see, and the other makes me wish this world to be cruel. Madonna / What a pile of insanity never calculated to be abused so badly that a woman punished for being a woman becomes a slave to man and maybe Madonna says everyone respects man Richie I am very angry and I can not use punctuation! Once in America / Leon God Why do noodles do it? It destroys the path to the joy we have followed throughout his life. Very close to finally find love with Deborah. Now both are destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but there is much sex and shame in the abundance of both sexes. Very honest, do not tickle. Do not shake the imagination, nor do a perfect move in Hollywood. Jokes, yes. But there is a lot of darkness, jealousy and deception here to call it sexual comedy. Forget to continue shooting the nude hairdresser in the cos leg that she will come back and tie her with his former ex-Vingant son con and you will learn how to cum him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand are rape films and prison films. Les Valseuses is not a movie of rape! God no one wants to watch it now! it is a wonderful movie!
