I loved it and smashed it to the point that there was not another season !!! I hope they do! It was the best show ever! There is probably no chance to make a decision not to cancel the offer there! Ha ha I wish I were there! I will be very excited! I really will! I miss him! Especially crashed for not knowing what is happening to Jason !! I think they have to do another thing .... I also think it's ridiculous that you have to write ten lines to post a comment .. Make your comment extended .. And will not read anyone !! I really want to know what could have happened between Jason and Nicole ... Maybe they could split up !!
