This is one of the greatest films ever made even the greatest film ever. I forgot the movie for 12 years. I even saw an addition on TV for the ADGTH and brought back dear memories of me I watched when I was a young child. When I saw him a few nights ago I became addicted to the film. I do not usually like moving family movies, but this is a special film, it's the perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the film always touches my heart and weighs heavily, but this is what makes this film better than all the trash that goes out for children's movies today. I mean the movie got G rating and that dogs are involved in gambling, and there is a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell in the movie. Which I think makes the film from good to great. I mean, the films today do not bring reality to the children and in this film they did it. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Parsi and Dom Delois
