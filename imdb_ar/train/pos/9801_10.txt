The original Dark Knight film in the adventure film ACE, which competes with the fantasy mask, is in his coolness. There's a lot of elegance and intelligence in the Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There is a new fighter on the streets of Gotham. She wears a bat, but she is not a batger. Batman denies any affiliation with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. But Penguin, Bain and Mob are making things a bit more complicated. <br /> <br /> I have not had much hope in this "since I failed but Batman is weak: Sub Zero (Robin isn" a lot has come up here!) But I was delighted with the innovative, exciting, clever and humoristic sectors. This is definitely a film that should not be a fan of Batman. Keep your ears open for a truly appealing song called "Betcha Neva" which is clearly visible everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that a DVD is not wonderful. Do not get me wrong, there are some great features (short Chase Me) and great Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but ... The movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: Batwoman's Secret was shot and shot at 1.85: 1 but this DVD was shown at 1.33: 1 compared to widescreen clips showing features there is a picture cut on both sides. I find this very annoying considering the display of the Fantas mask in a distorted widescreen image. Warner had to re-issue dozens of movies literally on DVDs because people complained about the lack of a ratio to the original content available in some titles. Why they chose to commit the same mistake here again ordered out of me. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR raises the total score to 4/5. It's a shame that the widescreen would have completed a great DVD package.
