I have read a little about Che before watching this movie and you want to know something. He has been a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for all and he hated what the repressive forces of his people are doing as well as all other Latin America in general! Now, I do not know about others, but for me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay his fair share. However, the strong elite obviously will not go for it. So, instead of understanding what Che Guevara wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to quell the revolution. This did not work because there were many of his followers who chose the place he left. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As much as I am concerned, as Chi himself said before his death: "If you kill me, that's okay, but you just kill a man, you will never kill the cause!" I could not say that myself better. <br /> <br /> But ... anyway ... that's why I give this movie 7 out of 10.
