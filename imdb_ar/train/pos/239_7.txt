I watched this on movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say I did not get the best time because I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story. <br /> <br /> But since that is a biography, it is important to at least know what to expect from a personality. <br /> <br /> I do not know whether the way events are listed is true or fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and fighter for justice makes me really want to believe everything real. I do not think he was portrayed as a backward criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> It is a Western film of its kind that suits everyone's tastes. The Heath Ledger is as wonderful as ever and the sexy Naomi Watts charms on the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance if it's streamed through the cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
