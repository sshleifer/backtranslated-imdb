Well, this film starts as a "life-long" movie with cheese and the film does not get even better. The scenario is full of "cheese" and "fluff" and the dice are not usually well directed. During the first half of the film, I became a little girl on my nerves. I do not think this is one of the best jobs you are working on. The only reason I bought the movie was that it was on sale and it had Ellen Burstein in it. They are fantastic but this is not one of the best vehicles they operate. The story is based on real events and helps the film. In fact, I did not like the film at first and I was disgusted when I saw the footage of the balloon traveling, I mean .. I get it. But everyone was tolerated as she reached her destination and the story ended. If this does not bring tears to your eyes, there will be nothing! It's cheesy and predictable but it also makes you feel good about the world again.
