This is another compelling and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This simple, fast-acting director has something unusual for his previous films - a group of stars. Star Richard Widmark, Jan Peters and Richard Kelly in this film about a group of communist clients who are trying to sneak out of the secrets outside America - and will not stop at anything to succeed. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents. They know it's a loop in a long spy chain. Not everyone knows the basic card in the equation - as there is a small train (Widmark) on the train is able to steal the secrets carried by Peters. Widmark thought it was just another wallet being looted - only later realized the gravity of what he had stolen. Widmark has now become single-handed - with the application of Commies and the FBI on his trail. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film runs from start to finish. Although they did not get the upper bills, they should be referred specifically to Thelma Ritter. Perhaps this supporting actress performed her life as a stool pigeon. She rarely gave her a chance to act, and she was affected by her ability to play an old sad and sad lady. <br /> <br /> With respect to text and output, they are very good - but with one small exception. At first, I liked the way Widmark and Peters interacted. It's one of the few times in the movie you'll see a perforated woman's mouth box! Now this is difficult. Later, inexplicably, I became surprisingly close - too close to believe. However, with a lot of great drama and film like Noir effective, this can be overlooked. Watch this movie.
