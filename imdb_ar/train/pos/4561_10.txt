I have watched this film three times now, and every time I see it, it has become more emotional and personal. <br /> <br /> The representation is amazing, not hard to believe because it is the day of Daniel Dae Lewis, an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker is a surprising surprise. It embodies your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy, unable to walk, or talk until he is in his late teens. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough good things about the film, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies based on real events, or only enjoys good drama in general.
