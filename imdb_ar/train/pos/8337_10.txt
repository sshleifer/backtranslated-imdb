Being a great fan of romantic comedy, and having seen so many of these films, it's rare for someone to hit me as completely unique. For this matter, it is also rare to crave laughter through many scenes. The story of love is a bit thin on the ground, but I say that this is probably the best, because this romantic comedy is heavily focused on "comedy" and in any case it stretches the limits of credibility a bit more than the most loved compact com to do. The four scientists presented some of the most momentous moments, not only in this film, but in any film I have seen for a long time. I hesitated in the shortest moments before finally choosing "10" on "9" as an assessment, where I think too many people use it randomly, so the maximum rating loses some of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan who helps, but this is one of the few films I've seen that I think I've covered in a comprehensive way. She and Tim Robbins are the lead, but for me playing a second violin in the alien of the petty intellectuals. Movie-type real loud laugh.
