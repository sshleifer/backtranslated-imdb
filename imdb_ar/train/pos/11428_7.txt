Thinking about this film, I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One relatively oblivious but covering the same geography, is the Coup de Torchon, and thousands of other miles and larger is Indo-Chinese unforgettable. Claire Dennis produced a film that contains some of the great foundations of Indo-China, and the complex and undeclared relationship between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the dignity of Bouti, with his struggle to preserve his dignity among his peers and with his white superiors. I was also struck by the love / hate relationship between him and Amy. He is the last to give the film his driving force, the latest to link this film to Indochina. <br /> <br /> No one is ever sure what motivates everyone, although some characters are required to remember colonialism. This cynical aspect of the story is linked to Coup de Torchon. Their story is the most blatant and perhaps most interesting story in a corrupt way, but Dennis gives us the memory of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The Growing American Black The French film at the beginning and end of the film presents another interesting aspect of the confusion we feel in the Western world when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone else. He was going home, but they thought he was just a stranger. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but do not fully understand what they are although they can remember how they were. <br /> <br />
