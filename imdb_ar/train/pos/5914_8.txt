MPAA: R rating for violence, language, nudity and drug abuse in short. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I watched Coonskin today. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to watch more Bashki movies I saw Cool World and I thought it was modest and I saw this. When it was first released, the film was very controversial. He was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted to ban the film, so he led protests outside the theater where the film was shown. The film was shown on VHS only under the title "Street Fighter," and is now a classic cult of African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the rap group The Wu-Tang Clan. I was told that I enjoyed this movie. I personally thought Fritz was a much better film, but it's also very enjoyable. Watch the movie "Bashki" or "Blaxploitation", where the film mixes live motion and animation such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit.I prefer you in full animation but wh the film begins with a reverence and another man races to save two of his friends from jail. As the prisoners wait, the older man tells the story of three men he knows. Then the film turns into animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man. They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem. So, the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and basically becomes a big shot. The movie moves while the Italian mafia turns it out. The mafia includes the godfather, his three sons who are gay and an Italian clown. Konsinkin is an animated cartoon worth watching, if you can find it.
