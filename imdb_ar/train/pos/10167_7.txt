I did not like watching this movie at all, but when I called my GF and she got a free advanced display permit, I just marked it to see Eva Longoria and laughed at the weird Jason Biggs. <br /> <br /> In general, it was actually better then I expected but not much. This was like a hybrid of how a man lost in 10 days and like heaven. A typical romantic comedy with its moments I think. The film was very short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some development characters and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a ghost chasing her ex-husband was an interesting plot to follow. Eva did a good job of maintaining the irony and Paul Rod, and the rest of the supporting actors (especially Jason Biggs) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace. <br /> <br /> I generally liked the movie just because I had a lot of laughter to keep me going or I would give this film a lower rating. What a flick chick I'm reviewing this movie from a fine persepctive guy, it would be more of a fair fight if the female reviewed this film and made there thoughts on it.
