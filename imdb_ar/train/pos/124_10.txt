* Contains spoilers because of my forced to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. Using the coloring in some scenes makes it look like an old picture showing up. I also enjoyed dropping people on the back screen. For example, in a scene, Leopold contacts his wife and is introduced behind him instead of a typical split screen. Her face is huge at the back and Leo is in the front. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses of this is when the young Ravensteins are killed on the train, a scene that has been filmed in an almost political style, with facial flips. It reminded me of the Butimkin Bargain, that hard, intense pattern coupled with red spray to transport tons of horror without much tampering. The same with the scene when Katharina found her father dead in the bathtub ... you can see the red water just on the side. It's one of the things I love about Von Trier, too little for his horror, which ended up making him more creepy. <br /> <br /> The use of text in the film was unique, as in the case of Liu's character, the word "the waswolf" was pushed. I have never seen anything like this in a movie. <br /> <br /> Black comedy has been used in this film well. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is as great as Leo's uncle. It brings the Snickers who got them from his role in the Kingdom (Riget). This humor makes the absurd analogue scheme of train conductors under the terrible background of World War II and all chaos, easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital manager tries to maintain normal life at the end of the first part when everything becomes crazy. It shows that some people are oblivious to the terrible things that happen around them. However, some people, such as Leo, are tuned in, but they do not do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> The fun sound, well executed by Max von Siddo, is very fun. It draws you to the story and makes you jump to Leo's head, which is sometimes a scary place. <br /> <br /> The film shows the point that one is a coward if they do not choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork does not talk about herself and ends up destroying it. In fact, at one point, Von Trier seemed to be hostile to women for me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his masculine characters do not do well either! I found myself in the same place at the end of the dancer, when she seriously wanted to get the main character to think about her actions, but of course, they never did!
