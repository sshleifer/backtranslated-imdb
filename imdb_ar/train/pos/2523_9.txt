When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I figured I thought it was real. The few reviews that I read that WERE NOT by screaming fangs were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I had the opportunity to watch it, I was quite ready to be careful and get rid of it, otherwise I needed to close my eyes to avoid tampering. <br /> <br /> I was too surprised, and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has moments of cheese, camp and general dorkiness - I think it's impossible to avoid that when it comes to Gackt Camui, a man of unknown mental health - but all in all, it was fun. <br /> <br /> No, it's not a movie genius, but it's very loyal and entertaining, with an interesting dances design, a moving score, and cheerful actors. I know very little Japanese cinema, so I can not really judge acting, but given the fact that the actors spoke an odd language or tone that was strange to them at one time or another, and that a couple of them had no experience in acting, I was impressed rather. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a great movie, good drama, or good comedy, watch this movie. At least she rented it since her arrival in Zone 1. <br /> <br /> In a side note, there is no gay / gay content in this film. I have not seen much of the subtext. Do not let people who read a lot of things ruin this for you.
