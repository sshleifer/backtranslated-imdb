Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan again angers his superiors with his dissident approach to working in the police. And his refusal to take a holiday, is given a simple issue to take outside of San Francisco. However, a link between the murder of a modern woman in the city and a murder outside the city is soon discovered, leading him to pursue the murderer of revenge. <br /> <br /> As an introduction to the Dirty Harry franchise, the film begins with some promising moments, including the legendary "Go ahead, make my day" line by Eastwood beautifully through the taut teeth before thwarting his own theft. He is very stingy and what fans expect from him. However, the film quickly changes the gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer is not completely mysterious because it is as distinctive as Harry is. This really detracts from the existence of the main character that ruled all his previous appearances in the film, pardon the pun, Magnum Force. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, this new scenario draws many similarities to Harry's unconventional styles and gives his character a dramatic depth that never existed before, but fans who were looking for a Harry Punch stroll would probably be more disappointed Hope to some extent. However, the tense climax ends the film in an exciting note, so if you do not mind something a bit different, it is a good film for the fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> R classification of violence and rape scene
