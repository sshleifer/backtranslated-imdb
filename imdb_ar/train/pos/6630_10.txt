This is an important film that challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There's a lot to admire here. The director seems interested in breaking up some of the most tired film conferences. Unlike much of modern American cinema, this film is concerned with what it means to produce a film in the first place. The DVD has a lot of bonus features, and there are two comments that explain the movie to viewers who are still stuck after the initial viewing. When the film was screened at Sundance, he made more than a few members of the audience uneasy and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night concert film. For custom scenes, it's a powerful treasure.
