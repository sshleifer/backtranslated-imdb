There is something wonderful about the fact that the 1934 film could have been a head and shoulders above each of Tarzan's subsequent films, including the oversized Greystoke movie in the 1980s. As soon as the viewer passes the first three scenes, which are recognized as tedious, Tarzan and his colleague begin to take off like a shot, providing a non-stop movement, a sense of humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful like Jane and launches with the film. Weismuller is solid as well. Highly recommended.
