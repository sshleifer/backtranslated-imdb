If you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy this. If you do not know who are Misty Mundae, Darian Caine or Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema, this is not the film to start with. It's cute, silly, and girls are lanes, and it's fun to see. There is no sex whatsoever at all until the end of the film which takes 45 minutes, but the triad result, the plot is not complete. Makeup Misty Mundae is bad in this film and her hair is in embarrassing braids, so she is not as hot as she is in others. But her panties are very nice (you'll just have to watch the movie so it does not look really weird). If you like this, you'll probably enjoy "That 70's Girl," "Vampire Vixens," or "Erotic Survivor" (a little more sexy). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual or more horror / exploitation films (but with a low budget), see the Factory 2000 website.
