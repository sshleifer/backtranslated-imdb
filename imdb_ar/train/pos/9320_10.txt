Theme MGM MINIATURE short. <br /> <br /> The editor of Cole County Clarion must decide what is the most important news for his readers: an impending frost could cause a disaster for their crops or the infamous collapse of the notorious gang on the main street of their small town. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little reel one, characterized by a good performance by Charles 'Chic' torrent. Today's viewers may be more interested in the unapproved appearance of James Stewart, as his nephew / assistant Sal√©. Stewart speaks slowly and fairly conversationally about the many qualities that would make him a great star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or overlooked today, the short and interesting themes were useful in that studios were important training places for new or thriving talent, either in front of or behind the camera.

The short subjects were produced economically in terms of both budget and schedule and were able to depict a wide range of materials, perfect complement to studio films.
