Born in Berlin in 1942, Margaret von Trotta was an actress and is now an important director and writer. It has been described, perhaps even in an unfair caricature, as an outlet that exceeds its commitment to bring women's sensitivity to the screen and its artistic power. "Rosenstrasse," which received mixed and even odd views (the New York Times article was one of the most negative reviews I read in this paper) is not an ideal film. It is a remarkable film and testimony to a rare merger of the successful opposition to the Nazi regime of genocide by all helpless Germans demonstrating on a Berlin street. <br /> <br /> Co-author Von Truta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother, who was never revealed as a child in the German capital during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> The husband of Ruth Wainstein (Jutta Lampe) died in a sudden rebirth of an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently even in a long time, Ruth is no longer "sitting shivah" only (a week-long mourning ritual for the Jews) but insists on Follow the strict prohibitions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the richness guaranteed by the wives of her deceased husband. Her daughter in the United States, Hannah (Maria Schrider) and her brother are somewhat upset by the mother's assumption of restrictive Jewish Orthodox practices, but they refuse. The mother reluctantly rejects the presence of Hannah's fianc√©, a non-Jew named Louis (Vidja van Huet). An internal crisis could erupt, with Ruth warning that she would be disowned if she did not give up Louis, the handsome. Stay with us. <br /> <br /> The cousin arrives to show her respect, and there is evidence that Hannah is interested in a wartime secret about my mother's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - inquires about her mother who resolutely refuses to discuss this part of her life. This is very realistic too. I grew up with my parents who fled Nazi Germany in time and knew many of the children whose families fled, in whole or in part, from the Holocaust. Those days were not simply discussed. <br /> <br /> So, after learning that a German woman saved Ruth's life, Hannah traced to Berlin in the hope of finding a savior who was still breathing. If it were not, it was a very short film. But Ruth, pretending to be dated, identifies the 90-year-old Lena Fisher, who is now a widow. As Lena tells the happy one to be interviewed, but it is shaken by her suppressed memories, her story turns the scene somewhat smoothly between present Berlin and the capital of wartime. (1943) Katia Riemann was a high-end pianist married to Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel), with the advent of the Nazi regime, he was required to use "Israel" as an average name just as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names (by the way, I hope that IMDb did not give Fabian's name in the list of false characters "Israel" included - it simply perpetuates the name used by the Nazis as a label of classification and degradation) > While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to "Aryans" were excluded for some time until 1943 When the regime decided to take them too (most of them were men, and a minority of Jewish women were married to non-Jews), the tour is presented here with all its frightening intensity. <br /> <br /> Lina tries to locate her husband. The other women are trapped in a building on Rosenstrasse, where a crowd of anxious women gathers, some seeking the help of German officers who are unexpectedly refusing to help, as well as verbal abuse of them ("a Jew-loving whore"). When Lena adopts a plot of eight-year-old Ruth's daughter-in-law who hid when her mother was kidnapped (remember, Ruth is now sitting in Shiva, Manhattan). The child Ruth is portrayed in an attractive way by Svia Lodi. <br /> <br /> Through increasingly angry protests, women are finally dominating. The men and a handful of women were released. As in the real story, the Nazis surrendered, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times, when madness admitted defeat to the killing agenda (the last of which was the end of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of chronic mental handicaps and disabilities). <br /> <br /> The tension between Von Trotta and the story of every woman is personal and universal. Hanna continues to urge old Lena, who slowly gathers up, and begins to suspect that she is not dealing with an ordinary historian, but someone who needs to know the girl she saved, the child who killed his mother. <br /> <br /> The contradictions between the 1943 Rosenstrasse, the collection, and today's Berlin street are bustling, reconstructed, uniform and provide a recurring thematic element. Berlin today bears heritage but not the scars of the past brutal. Von Trotta explains this point very well. <br /> <br /> Major actors are equally impressive. Lena's powerful husband shows that he is completely helpless in prison, with possible deportations (which have been clearly understood by all figures - including the local and military police - as a one-way trip to oblivion). Old Ruth was forced to face the long-held demons in her happy life in New York. Hannah believes her young woman raises her father's death need to discover the past of her family. These things happen (although the Times critic does not seem to know). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a wedding Enjoying a violin playing Lina is unnecessary and tempting. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, the most revered Hitler worshiper, to save her husband detracts from the astonishing achievement of couples and protesting relatives. Most of the German officers come from the central casting process and are formed by Eric von Stroheim's "copy and paste" school of Tutuni's difficulty. But that is understandable. <br /> <br /> Rosenstrasse's story has been the subject of books and articles, and some claim it is a typical case that many Jews would have been saved if more Germans had protested. Unfortunately, this argument is nonsense. The German woman who occupied Rosenstrasse was deeply and conceptually interested. Most Germans were somewhere between negative anti-Semitism. That's why the Rosenstrasse protest was almost singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were partners in collusion with the real killers, it can not be denied that pre-Nazi anti-Semitism turned into a severe strain of 1933. " Women were a "glimmer of light" in an evil time. Most of the men and women who set out from the nearby death march survived the war. So it was a "glimmer of light" and von Trotta is a beacon of light that shows that some have been cut off by the courage of largely ordinary women and each life saved an occasion to celebrate. And will always remain so. <br /> <br /> 9/10
