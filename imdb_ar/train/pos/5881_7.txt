This movie was a great comedy. She had a lot of comedian stars such as Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Parish Raval and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Remi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars' wife and she was all the flight attendants. Mr. Hot as Mac and Mr. Sam (John Abraham) are fashion photographers who love the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John deceives Abraham by his work, Akshay Kumar becomes great and Akshay Kumar is really angered because his apartment must be given to John Abraham and her beginner Dupia in admiration of John. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham until he finds an apartment and comes out with three different girls (Neto Chandra, Nargis Baghiri, Daisy Bubana).
