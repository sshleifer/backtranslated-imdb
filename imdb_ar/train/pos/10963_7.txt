I find it interesting that Lee Radzewell, the sister of Jackie Kennedy and the cousin of these women, will encourage Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" a movie theme. Surely they can be considered "skeletons" in the family closet. Additional features on the DVD include many contemporary fashion designers who attribute some of their ideas to these exotic women. I would like to say that anyone interested in fashion will find the debate by these great designers. (For example, "Are they nuts or am I missing something?"). This film is difficult. Netflix does not have it. No aspects, though.
