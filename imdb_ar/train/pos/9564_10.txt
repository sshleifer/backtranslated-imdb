This should be the best film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine great cinemas, stunning acting and intriguing plot, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog made me hold my seat edge through some scenes, shiver of terror during the others, and let me drown in my tears after the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The film has left a deep impression on me that it is a horrific violent scene that contrasts sharply with the scenes of "love" that is moving and giving. The film is not worthy of Cat III classification (nudity); there are no nude scenes at all, and "love" scenes do not even include kissing or "going out". <br /> <br /> The message that this film has given me? All human beings, regardless of their ability to violence or cruelty, have a thin side. Edison Chen does a great job of playing the deadly role of Pang. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie 10/10. It's an hour to watch.
