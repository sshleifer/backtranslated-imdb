Opening the film with Bach Toccata is a hint of what should unfold in this intense drama. All the Bach hardware is perfect for keeping his listener (and performers) intrigued and entertaining applies to this film. There is no mutual affection between the two main characters and the leading female in the latter scene, I feel justified to say that she was raped even though her victim feels she is warning that he was close. Mammet explores the radical gap in emotional and gender differences, but I feel that he is not ignorant about how to integrate them into each other in fact with a healthy sense of humor. If Mamit ever put a healthy sense of humor on the gender interaction I wonder how this work has ended? As it exists, it is very desperate and means soul.
