The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) loved it so bad that Lydia Reed decided to forget and not show up. They were excellent in the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was great as well as Tony Martinez. I loved him when he called Amos Se√±or Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and can not wait to buy seasons 2-6. If there are more offers on TV like this offer, everything will be better. This show briefly appeared in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. God bless all the members of the team you left, and please, Lydia Reid, make yourself known again to the public. You are loved and respected. Real Madrid will live Coys forever.
