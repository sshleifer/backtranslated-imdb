I think this is what this film wants to say at the end of the film! Or the Australian curse? I still do not know, but what I know is that I really liked this film but this could not be my favorite film! <br /> <br /> A wonderful story with great actors but a terrible ending ... make you cry and say "Oh, it's very good" ... yet, who made it? The reality of what happened? Who is this guy? No answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> A mysterious movie with a good sign in general ... I give it 8/10, it happens at 8.5!
