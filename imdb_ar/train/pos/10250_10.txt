Guinea Pig: The devil's experience is undoubtedly a ***** stars at first glance, a realistic creepy and disturbing look in the dark side of human nature. This movie gets right at this point, you might think of any point? The point is to please those who love violence and violence. This film contains some gaps, more or less than the violent torture of women. There is really only 3 scenery that can be considered a gorge. I'll tell you one thing despite Pig Pig: The Devil's Experience makes "hostile" look like Sesame Street. If you think Hostile was a wild and insane tortoise, you will not see half of it until you see Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experience (Uncut) ***** (7)
