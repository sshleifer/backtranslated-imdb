Think of Pierce Brosnan and believe that James Bond is intelligent and wonderful. In this film, Brosnan plays against writing - and has a lot of fun doing it (as the audience does). This is a movie about a hired assassin who endorses an arrogant businessman ... and he works! <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie, with very good scenes (a lively Brosnan film) good, compatible with "Off" - Kinnear Edge has some good fonts). My only one is that Hop Davis, who plays the forgiving wife ("Can I see your gun?") Does not appear more than once: it could have been a great frustration for these guys. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a matador: he plays with the audience, while "goes to kill". The end is great because there is a story (positive morals!) Showing up: it's a frantic, overheated movie, and deserves a wide audience.
