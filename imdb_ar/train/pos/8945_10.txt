This is an honest attempt to make a sweet and charming love story. The obvious inspiration behind the successful television series "Bewitched", this lovely beautiful rom-com is a treasure trove. Comparisons are clear. Jimmy Stewart plays unhappy but solid "straight". Kim Novak plays a charming blonde Hassiba picking him up using a love mascot. But when that spell is broken by a stronger witch, she sympathizes with the duties of managing her own shop and sympathizes with the fact that her beloved brides (familiar cats) are cared for by her beloved aunt. You will get to know the aunt of "Death by Death". This movie is fun and sweet, carrying some amazing intelligence and a beautiful charming feeling. Well worth a look.
