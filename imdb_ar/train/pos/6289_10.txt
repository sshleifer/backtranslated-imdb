This movie took a lot of stick. Was scheduled by critics when he came out and was blamed for smashing Nicolas Cage's life. The thing I do not think people get is that it's not supposed to be an epic, an Oscar competitor for a movie, it's just a great job in Bruck-buster. Fast cars, quick editing and great soundtrack - they do exactly what you say on tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars in a pure treat. She has everything: Ferraris, Mears, Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think it would be hard for you to find the best motion film, and the best movie character ever !! Then again maybe that's just me!
