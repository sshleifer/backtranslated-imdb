I really think I should do my case and get every movie (horror and / or worship) going to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> I did! <br /> <br /> It-is-excellent: the atmosphere is extremely annoying and scary ... <br /> <br /> Incredible how you can make such a jewel movie with too low (read "no"! ) - The budget they have .... <br /> <br /> A summary from the website: "One morning, an old man walks around in the forest looking for his fleeing cat, and instead finds a child without parents and a murder without a corpse ..." <br /> < On this site (IMDb), there is no trailer, but I will leave a link here to the movie site itself where there is a very disturbing video so please go and check it. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
