This is one of the craziest series ever! I laughed until my side split and rolled onto the ground. If someone is to be released in America. Area 0 or 1 - Not PAL Please. <br /> <br /> I know it was released in the UK but this is Region 2 and PAL besides let's give this series a fair shake. America must know this series. Moffat genius. I liked Tracy Bennett's mysterious role in this. Of course I loved Fiona Gillies! But Tracy is a treasure! <br /> <br /> This show was launched in America! Or show them back on PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please indulge us, please! please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
