As soon as you pick it up from the ground you realize it ... somehow ... I was able to quickly assemble this thing so it was released the same year that the case ended, you will find it not bad. The plot is attractive and interesting, and the speed of introversion, covered with many positions, thus often jump quickly to the next stage after the line has been spoken or two. Where this really stands out is acting. Offers are excellent. Neil and Streep are both impeccable. It is also wonderful to hear a lot of Australians speaking in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not come to him naturally at least try to tone. Cinematography and editing are nice enough, but they do not really go beyond standard things. The story of this film is compelling and the fact that it is real makes it more chilling. Although I have not read the novel or heard what happened outside this picture, I understand that it is very close to the truth. There are some temperate to strong languages ​​and disturbing content in this. It is, at times, a great courtroom drama. I would recommend this to any fellow fan like that. 10/07
