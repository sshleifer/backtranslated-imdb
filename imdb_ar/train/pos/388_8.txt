...I love it too. A lot of special effects, and for the film, which is not made with a huge budget, this film does a wonderful job in creating a fictional masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story at all, but this was still a flick to watch. Surely there are standards that outperform Bored of the Rings and equally with films such as Harry Potter. Who says a lot about film again, has been prepared on a small portion of the budget of these international visits. <br /> <br /> One of the things I really like about this movie is that it stretches out the adventure film envelope to come from Hong Kong. The subject is strange and innovative. The production quality is not different from anything being seen from Hong Kong to get a fantasy film, and the acting is superb. <br /> <br /> The fictional Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong is one of the best films, and I hope they will continue to work in this area, to surpass the Hollywood adventure films. <br /> <br /> Fantastic.
