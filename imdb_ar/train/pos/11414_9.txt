A wonderful story with a message. Joan Blright is as wonderful as "Vibe", Mike Kopsa Farhan K "Coach" and Richard De Klerk plays the role of "Carmen" superbly. Misha Barton as Frankie performed well, while Ingrid played the role of "Hazel" in her first lead very well. This film is directed by Joe Boyle Williams. Editing is the first rate.
