It helps tremendously if anyone is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place. First of all, these ladies are not Giesha, they are from the Yoshiwara type "green houses" around 1860, giving or taking.

In addition to obscene photography with hideous beautiful music, you can make a beautiful trip. Just plug in and suspend your disbelief and enter their world. You will not be disappointed.
