I really love this show. That is why I was disappointed when I learned recently that George Lopez was racist and that he had expelled Massila Locha from the show, just because he discovered that she was not a Latin immigrant, but was an immigrant from Albania. I learned this from the people at the show. She was really one of the best parts of the show, so she knows that even among those who think they will be sensitive to racism, they can also hate someone, just because of the country where they were born, really disappointing.
