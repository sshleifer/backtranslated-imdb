I enjoy all the versions of this story but this is my favorite all the time. George S. Scott is a depth of the mischievous character that others do not. The film shows more about the cause of bitterness. Changes in Scrooge gradually appear in the face of the various ghosts and incidents that appear to him. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Tiny Tim by far. It is a good age instead of being played by someone who is almost as young as in other films. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is as wonderful as Bob Crashit. He is a versatile actor. He portrays a man who loves his family clearly. He plays the role with dignity, not as a cowardly man sitting under Scrooges' thumb, but as a man who treats him safely because he has a family that guarantees them. Suzanna York and other actors do a good job of bringing characters back to life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas gift ghost I have ever seen. He is often played as the character of Julie Santa. In this anger shows the positions of Scrooges and makes Scrooge reconsider. <br /> <br /> Fashion and collections have really brought London Dickens' life time. Wonderful movie
