Have you ever wished you could escape your boring and stressful life at school or work and do your own magical adventure, with one of your closest friends, facing all kinds of dangers and villains, and uncovering a lost civilization puzzle waiting for someone to discover all her secrets? Even if you were not a lot of fantasy lovers, did you wish that you could simply experience what it was like to be a child again and not get cared for in the world for only a few hours? <br /> <br /> This is exactly what Miyazaki Castle is about Castle in Heaven. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives in rural life in a mining town until one day. A girl named Sheeta falls from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far from clouds, while all the time they have pirates and hot military units on their way. Simply put, it's just a wonderful adventure that every child dreams of at one time or another, and I can only feel that my worry melts every time I see her. <br /> <br /> From Miyazaki's old works and taking a big place in the everyday world, the film is not as spectacularly or deeply in his story as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, or even Princess Mononoke. However, I find it difficult to say that none of these films outweigh the other, because these three films, at one point or another, are so vague that they are opaque, if not puzzling, especially for the smallest film viewers. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky", on the other hand, does not try very much to be a symbolic story of any kind, and it is not a coming story either; instead, it may be one of the best imaginations from within the mind of the child that I have seen in my life. Not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of the perspective from the eyes of the children is amazing; whether it is a "camera" to see the huge trees or clouds above, or the amazing sense of altitude from the view of the earth or the ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I can not feel I'm here with Pazu and Sheeta, just a kid in another world, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children themselves have no complex relationship to indicate the need for hope such as Ashitaka / San or Shihiro / Hako; Chita is the angel of Pazo, has literally fallen into his life from heaven one day, the beginning. As the film progresses, more and more of their children's real adventure spirit emerges through their gentle words and beautiful facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be, but their beloved friendship is never left throughout the entire film, but even stronger to the last frame. For this reason, the two of them fell in love more than any other couple from Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is an easy-to-access movie because, regardless of the type of filmmaker, you may be sure to find your fix here. Mystery, motion, drama, comedy, suspense, science fiction, romance, and even some Westerners ... Everything here, just about everything people go to the cinema for (except perhaps horror). That's why I can easily recommend it as Miyazaki's first sponsor; it's perfect for those who have no expectations of having already seen the incredible moral magnificence of some of his modern works. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the film, when translated into English, conveys a sense of longing for the discovery of a kind of lost civilization, and a kind of soul mate, can not be found in our worldly lives. "The reason I crave the many lights is that you are there in one of them ... the earth is spinning, you are pregnant, and you will certainly carry us." Miyazaki has always been a lyricist to produce final songs from the wonderful results of Joe Hayasashi, but this is the only song I have seen, an impressive love song and inspiring dream. I found myself close to crying and I only listen to it. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky" may not be Miyazaki's most sophisticated, spectacular, or meaningful work, but perfectly perfect for what he really meant: a true vision of the childhood imagination, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adult who wishes to be They have the same wonderful sense of imagination that they enjoyed when they were just carefree young children. Relax and relax and love what it is.
