"The Seventies Show" is definitely the funniest currently on TV. I've been watching it for about two and a half years, and once I see it, I can say it's a great show. I love all the characters, but the personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Liu was also a wonderful figure while he was there, and I really hope to come back because he is hilarious. It's a classic thing when Fes goes "You're the son of a bitch!" , And when Kelso screams "Burns", that makes me always laugh. They are both wonderful characters and they always have something funny. Jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started to look really good but a curse, close to season 5-6 it became very hot. I've seen most episodes more than once, some of them like 10 times, and there's still hilarious. This is one of the few programs I can see again and again and I still laugh as I did the first time I saw it. Cast classic. Almost everyone is funny, so with many offers there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see this show end next year, but it will stop broadcasting as one of the best performances ever.
