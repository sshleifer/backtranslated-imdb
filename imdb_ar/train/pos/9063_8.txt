It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by the parents and their wandering children. I felt rather than getting a movie ticket, I should have gotten NAMBLA membership. <br /> <br /> Based on the respected Thomas Rockwell book, How To Eat Eat Worms begins like any children's story: moving to a new city. The new baby, fifth grade Billy Forrester was once popular, but must start over. Making friends is never easy, especially when Poindexter Adam is the only possibility. Or Erica, who is 4 feet tall, a giant. <br /> <br /> Adding to the complexity of things is the bully atmosphere. His freckled face and sleeveless T-shirts. It infuriates the children with the ring of death: the Crackerjack episode that is rumored to kill you if you're screwed. But not immediately. No, the ring of death unleashes the poison that will kill you in the eighth grade. <br /> <br /> Joe and his evil villain Billy are welcomed by smuggling a handful of white worms into the thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays a wonderful role, swearing that he eats worms all the time. Then cast them on Joe's face. EWWW! To beat them, Billy reluctantly bet that he could eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, spiced with hot sauce, poured and poured on peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is called a strange name, such as "radiant radioactive radioactive", in which children finally live their dream of a microwave in an organism. <br /> <br /> If you meet me, you will know that I have an uncontrollable heartbeat. I felt like I was breaking out when a little boy complained that Dili Dick was hurting me. But Fried worms are absolutely disgusting. Like the Farrelly Brothers G-class, he is very happy and delighted. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also a storyteller. To raise the risk, worms must be consumed by 7 pm. In addition, Billy carries a dark secret: he has a very sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a deep sense of perspective. With such precision, it depends on the insecurity of children and the tendency to exaggerate worldly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the focus of this film in the way children do their tragedies, you'll see that it's basically about war. Fighters for freedom and hatred for freedom use misguided children as tools in proxy wars, only to learn an important lesson in unity. International leaders can learn something or something about the preservation of world peace from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was relieved when two women looked back behind me and agreed. "That was a great movie." Great, now I will not have to register myself in any legal databases.
