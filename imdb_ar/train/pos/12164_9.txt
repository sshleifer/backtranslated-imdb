In a thrilling year like "Synecdoche, New York," a film that grew out of Charlie Kaufmann's indulgence, a movie that is equally difficult to watch, but three times as important. "Frownland" is a hard work by the crew, actors and film director launched by friends over the years. Tracks a man who can not communicate through his real world in real Brooklyn. The people you see represent a step beyond simply illustrating the movement of "mumblecore". They are real people, painfully trapped in their own nerves, unwilling to change, unable to change. The real world for them is their set of delusions, and because this is a film about people out of sight, it's hard to see. It is a 16mm film industry with no lighting, money or any other factors that make the film a "spot", but its honesty can not be underestimated. This fact may cause a room full of people to reject it and Richard Linklater to award it as it did in SXSW . This reminds us of films like "Naked" or better than "Mumblecore". It's a film that does not fit everyone, but it's a film that challenges you to watch and grow whenever you think about it.
