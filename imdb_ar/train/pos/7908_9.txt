You recently found a $ 5 copy in a video store, and we caught it eagerly. Although the music and graphics (obviously) do not live up to my favorite in the series, beyond the eye, I am still fascinated by one piece: Stanley and Stella in Breaking the Ice. Fantastic music, real feelings. The section on the site Odyssey does not contain the story nor the music, unfortunately.
