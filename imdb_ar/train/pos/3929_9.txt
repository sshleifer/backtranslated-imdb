My manager can bring him intuition on material that just needs to push in the right direction. Young Mr. Lincoln is full of some "old" values, which in the past, although photographed two-dimensional, are at least more respectful than one might see in the metropolis of the present cinema. What makes it work very well as you do, with all its simplicity and magnificence, is that the courtroom drama is really in the guise of history lesson. <br /> <br /> We all know that Abraham Lincoln is the sixteenth president who was liberated and after the Civil War was assassinated. But as a lawyer in his previous years, he was talented and funny in the most unexpected places and a gentleman. It is not some superheroes who can not make a mistake (which was Fonda's only fear before signing in), but a character with potential flaws beyond his inherent fitness and his clear vision of right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Enough to say that John Ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying. In fact, it is a lie, he tries, but makes it effortless in the studio system; he worked independently while satisfying Zanok at the same time, so he left alone his own practices in "editing in the camera" and not move it so as not to hesitate away from the story . It is the power of conventional wisdom that somehow works side by side with the materials, as a kind of companion accompanying the full-blooded Americans in 1939 as we saw in Mr. Smith go to Washington (here only the law and not politics). <br /> <br /> Fonda is fantastic in the lead - his first with Ford - and never lets us see Lincoln after the make-up and extra reinforcement in the shoes. The personal Fonda character, to a certain extent, as in Grapes of Wrath and My Darling Clementine, appears in the character of Lincoln. Although it is unlikely, there will be no other person from this period who could have played it afterwards: he is mature and wise, but he has gums to prove himself in this case of an anti-homicide and has already seen it as a case. <br /> <br /> Only in small parts and pieces, such as that final shot that installs Lincoln walks along the road with his memorial, and in some small cases during this great spectacle of early, looks pretty dated. As far as the goals set with Young Mr. It is not a big game as one thinks it gets a strong balance of humor and real cipher.
