The Plainsman is a western entertainment, undoubtedly a classic, and it is still up to date. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickock, the ideal role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, were the best actors who played Western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is as wonderful as "Jane's Disaster", no one realized that he played better than her. Even if this is not historically accurate, the film is able to capture the most important events about Hickok and about the time it takes place. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to explain your point of view, and that's what Demel is doing here. The friendship between Hickock and Bill Buffalo, the sale of guns to the Indians by a large manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have suffered because of the end of the Civil War, Custer and Little Beige Horn, the troubled relationship between Bill Buffalo's wife, a religious woman, Normal between Hickok and Calamity, all this makes The Plainsman film funky and fun. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, which actually shows what great actor he was going to be. Much attention was paid to showing the original weapons at the time.
