When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrill, most people think of a "basic instinct" and perhaps some of the "showgirls". But Verhoeven achieved his best thriller years before these two films: "De Vierde Man". This movie is enchanting and exciting to the mind - and above all the story is very reasonable, making the whole experience more intense. The performances by Jeroen Krabi, Rene Sutendik and Tom Hoffman were exceptional, and the direction of Verhoeven is the rest. The film "De Vierde Man" makes even "Basic Instinct" a great look ... it can not be much better than this, a true classic of dramatic nightmarish cinema. 10 out of 10, at least ...
