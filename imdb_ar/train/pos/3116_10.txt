The last installment in the exciting thrill franchise is probably the hardest hit for the three films. Go further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know about his foggy past. Everything about this film infects him from photography to choreography / painstaking work to the script to acting. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a frenzy while Bourne is Moscow police. The story seems to be moving to the right as the first film stops. Or is it? The time is a little confused here, but we know the fact that Bourne remembers things. The sudden flashback while trying to clean himself makes him catch him, but he makes him and does not kill anyone. They are not his goal. From there we get more curiosity about his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy is back with Nicky Parsons, who seems to have had a past with Bourne as well. <br /> <br /> The cinema in your face follows practically everything. The pursuit of the car will be more intense if it seems possible from the first two. The veteran casts a brilliant Bourne with a nice part by Albert Finney. They also have minor political references to clandestine extradition and other government policies, but this is simple and well integrated into the plot. All in all This is the best triple conclusion this year, if not the best trilogy at all.
