Mary Beckford ("Born on July 4" on behalf of Angela Moore) is a "small American" (for French heritage); she falls in love with Jack Holt (like Karl von Ostrem), who moved to America with his German father and American mother. The French Americans Raymond Hutton (Kontel Jules de Destin from Combat Fight) fell in love with Mrs. Beckford. Triple triple love ends in France in the end, with the complexity of the Great War (World War I, too late) their lives to a large extent. <br /> <br /> Cecil B. DeMille, often entertaining, is mostly amusing. The ship's sinking and sinking aboard a ship carrying Pickford is like Titanic. The plot takes place when Becford becomes a secret spy for France, while the Germans occupy the home of her ancestors. Of course, the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that it took them a long time to get to know each other as he moved to rape, but he was gloomy; the previous events had made them believe each other. The movie goes over-the-top WAY in its symbol. Beckford, by the way, was a Canadian - though, few would deny that she was not a "little American", for all intents and purposes. <br /> <br /> FUN to discover "extras" later became major stars Wallace Berry, Colin Moore, and Ram√≥n Navarro - in particular, watched Mr. Novarro as "star" quality during one of the most memorable series in the film: Beckford The wounded soldier who greets each other while taking her on a stretcher. So that Novarro made Mary Beckford write a letter to him; obviously he got a future in the pictures. Among the future entries are Ben Alexander, who plays the boy Bobby; becomes a reliable child actor and grows up to become Jack Webb's partner on Dragnet. <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
