As the winter approached, our radio station, ABC, decided, for some reason, to partially host the Jane Austen Festival on Sunday nights. This began with a 12-year version of Emma on Sunday; more recent versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" will come. <br /> <br /> The odd thing about this production of A & E television networks, with ever-reliable textual writing by Andrew Davis, is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much larger budget films, one from Gwyneth Paltrow, "Clueless", a "modern" version of the starring Alicia Silverstone, which transferred the plot to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsell in the lead, this production has fallen without effect. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, much is lost when the novels are reduced to match the long length of the film. The adjustments one tends to enjoy and remember are those that have enough space to develop both story and characters. A notable example is Brideshead Revisited, which featured 13 50-minute episodes in 1982. Just compare the very regular version of Pride and Prejudice in 2005 with the six-part mini-TV series of 1995 . It is not necessary to paint a page-page novel, and some novels (often not very good) adapt beautifully to the film ("Atonement" is a recent example), but Jane Austen's novels need some time and space to practice their full charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this production is fine. Kate Beckinsell gives Emma the right mix of self-confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong is the outspoken Mr. Lee (reminded me that Jane tends to recycle characters? Knightly is a clearer version of Mr Darcy's P & P mood). Samantha Morton Harriet was a bit awkward but Brunella Skells got a blabbermouth Miss Bates completely? Siebel Volti on speed. Bernard Hepton as Emma's weak father was also excellent. We have seen wet countryside, mud, poverty as well as luxurious interior areas, in case anyone thinks this was an ideal time for everyone. <br /> <br /> Although this was intense adaptation, it was strangely slow in places? Some conversations were fairly simplistic, even with the permissibility of the times. I have to look at the film again to make sure, but perhaps because of the lack of use of interaction shots. <br /> <br /> If you like the things that were filmed during the filming, this is a perfectly good example, and compares well with the Paltrow version. Anyway, there's more to come!
