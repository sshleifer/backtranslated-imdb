The most important thing in this film is the wonderful performance of Danielle Dee Lewis and Hao O'Connor as Christie Brown, an artist and fighter of Guinea who overcame all odds despite her physical condition. As a person working with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was shockingly convincing. Christie's enormous support for his family from the low-income working class Dublin encouraged him to do the impossible. The picture of this support brilliantly did not read the book, but the dialogues were wisely written to capture the clever arrogant Christie Brown. . I recommend this film to everyone, especially for classic film lovers.
