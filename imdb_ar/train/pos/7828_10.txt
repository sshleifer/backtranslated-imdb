This film is presented to college students in the field of speech and media law because its lessons are not valid. Why is speaking out against injustice important and can bring about the changes that the oppressed are seeking? Why is freedom of the press and freedom of expression necessary for democracy? This is a story to be seen about how to draw world attention to apartheid through the work of Stephen Pico and the Donald Woods press. It also provides an important lesson for freedom of expression: "You can blow a candle, but you can not blow the fire, as soon as the flame starts to catch up, the wind blows higher." (From Pico to Peter Gabriel, from shaking the tree).
