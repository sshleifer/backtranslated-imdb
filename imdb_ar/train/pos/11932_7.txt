I have watched this movie on TV for many years and I saw this movie when I got this tape. I thought this was done well. It was not the best in all the movies, but it was good enough. The film contains enough talent to inspire many people, especially young children. The acting was good, with Danny Glover leading the acting team. The plot was not very reasonable, but the script was well written. This movie can also be an interest for baseball fans. Does not apply directly to a sports movie full of motion. Applies directly to a beautiful movie you can watch with your family and learn some hidden messages in this movie. In general, the film was good, but not good. I give this movie 7/10.
