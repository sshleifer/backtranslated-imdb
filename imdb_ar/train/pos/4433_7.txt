Story: On Tyxell Island, the photographer Bob, who photographs a photograph of the magazine, meets with the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and lust for her life were Bob's machinations, which suffered a very painful experience shortly before. Her life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob gets involved in a serious network. Will Kathleen be able to gain his trust? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this film is very natural and the story unfolds well even though it remains on the surface a bit and it would be nice if the personality 'psychology' has been worked out a little more. People are the things they do, what motivates their choices, this is what gives the depth of the film and something to think about in my opinion The story never reaches its emotional climax, even though the characters are going through enough to justify it, so do not recognize the characters at this level. The actors offer good work and play in a very natural and "reliable" way, but I think it was from the Befitted be appropriate if the film played the role of a young actress Kathleen, because the naivete of this character does not work perfectly for the benefit of an adult even women. The camera work is beautiful, and there are some great shots of the nature of the island. I give the film 7/10.
