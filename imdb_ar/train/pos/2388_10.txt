I love Doodlebops. My son has been watching them for more than a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as a concert yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodles Do not learn alphabet or numbers but who cares? are you serious? TV is not supposed to teach your children the numbers or alphabet. Parents must. throw it away. Doodlebops actually can sing. Didi has a nice voice and at the concert you can tell each of them 3 nice singing voices and do not sing. Imagine, dance, jump and sing. They have talent, kids love them so I enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best show on TV for kids. And rock band for children. How amazing is that? Why do people say that Chad (Rooney) is abnormal? Where did you hear about it? Whether it is or not, it's great! Leave it alone. It's not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality for our children!
