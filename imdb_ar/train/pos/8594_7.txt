The guard who I wish was a good film and a boy I was right. A wonderful story first of all from a novel I think was an original story but I think it was not and was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keith Sutherland is very good, but it is very hard to ignore his role as Jack Bauer in 24 years, but in the end you are doing quite differently in The Sentinel in 24 years as well. Another person trying to overlook his television role but failed. Eva Longria. It was not good in the film and I had a rear seat in everything. After seeing the movie I had a lasting dream about Sentinel movie and could not sleep.Overall Sentinel is a good movie I would recommend it.
