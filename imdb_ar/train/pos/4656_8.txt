A clever and delightful romantic man who starred Peter Ostinov as a mixed-up career with his eyes on an American group in London. He was incited by Maggie Smith (and deceptively sharp) and threatened to be attacked by jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is a stealing film with a lot of minds. Ostinov exceptionally like Smith and Newhart very funny. The real surprise is Carl Malden, where the pills appeared as "Executive Vice President". Malden was rarely too loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Murley pop up in some funny engravings. The excellent musical score is Laurie Johnson. The direction of Eric Tyl is fast and the script written by Ostinov and Ira and the brother is first class and very intelligent. Good time swinging!
