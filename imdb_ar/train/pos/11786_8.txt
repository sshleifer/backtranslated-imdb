This is a typical Lynch almost. However, what makes this film somewhat unusual for Lynch is the fact that it seems too crude, or that it is almost amateurish. But I think Lynch does this deliberately to give a greater sense of realism, which increases the severity of surreal moments. There is a lot of typical Lynch formats, such as: floating camera action; long haunting music (loud); hanging curtains dim lights grow darker at a slow pace (almost indistinguishable); close proximity . Excessive enthusiasm, passion, and all the characters who know confrontation with stunned personalities, temporarily oblivious, in the dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The presentations are wonderful and short provocative. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything up to the interpretation. Many questions are left unanswered, and this ignites imagination. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful effort from Lynch. I just hope to make some of the shorts, more style-conscious commercials for Sony PlayStation 2. They were an inspiration.
