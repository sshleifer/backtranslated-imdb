Years ago I followed soap on television. So I was curious about this film, and I was very rewarded to find it. It's a wonderful parody of soap, with jealousy, insecurity for the usual actors, and all kinds of beautiful excesses. But more than anything else - amazing crew and amazing text. How did someone make all these first-rate actors to play in such silly films? How did this small film make the writers write full lines? I have never heard anyone talk about this movie or even admit it, but it is wonderful and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes, I'll meet them while doing house cleaning, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing, and enjoying everything wonderful. Many congratulations to everyone who made it.
