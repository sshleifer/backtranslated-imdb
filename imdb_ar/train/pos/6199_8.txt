As someone who has watched and watched Hartley's public work for several years, I believe that much of what was recounted through real stories has been promoted to mysterious philosophical mind games. <br /> <br /> While Faim Grimm is a step in Henry Fowl's line of thinking, the film reflects the quality of an object within the film itself. In Henry Fool, the object is memoir ... In Fay Grim, the object is an encrypted diary - it is stolen, falsified and transformed into something so mysterious that it can not really have any meaning - ie the process of text writing and filmmaking in modern times - where Most of the most famous films are just a mix of the past. This is, in the philosophical sense, what is going on around Faye. Perhaps the aim is the tragedy in which the trauma has now become vulgar and boring (as was hinted at in the opening scenes of the publisher's office). <br /> <br /> However, you lose many of the best movie points if you do not understand Henry's character and the importance of the notes you are looking for. Henry Demon is blocked, Simon first visits as Faust, and so on. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of the quality of Faye's plot and his plot is lost. <br /> <br /> Enough "details" expressed through verbal verbal recitations - Henry Bean's plot knowledge can not be compared with the "sense" of character quality as he did in Henry Fowl, so I think the person who enters into This cold film is about 10 minutes away from "What's That" in a highly constructed dialogue and then all this. <br /> <br /> However, Henry Bean was also my favorite Hartley movie until I realized it was bad - moldy and arrogant - precisely because Henry Falls confessions were bad ... not only wicked or dirty, but broken no escape. Henry can not be evil fit - perhaps this is a tragic mistake that makes him more likable ... Like Gollum in the works of Tolkien, Henry is pathetic. <br /> <br /> This does not happen in Faye, even though Henry's dialogue is excellent. What happens is that the entire film is built as a cryptography - a kind of plotting of another plot about what ends up being another bad story added to Henry's confessions. It's an interesting development, but it can not really be digested without watching the first movie. Perhaps Henry's earlier presentation was better than making the publisher describe the basic story of the first film - although this plot is also not what the first film is about - unless one is an ordinary observer. <br /> <br /> Part of encryption? Hard to say ... a bit disappointed in sex tricks though. cheesy.
