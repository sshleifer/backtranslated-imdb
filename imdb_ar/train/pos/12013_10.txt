After reading the comments on this film and watching the mixed reviews, I decided to add the two cents to say that I thought the film was excellent, not only in visual beauty, writing, music, result, direction, but in the presentation of Joseph Smith's story and the road traveled during the life of hardship and persecution For his faith in God the way he felt and he knew it was his way. I am really pleased to have a small role in the story of this wonderful man. I recommend to everyone to see this when the opportunity is available, regardless of the religious path in which it is going. This is only instilled with more determination to live in the life that we must receive with true values ​​of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do.
