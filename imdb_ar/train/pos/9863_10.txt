I thought Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a 30-year-old woman with no children, I still enjoy watching these funny and funny films. Sid is the best character I've ever seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really funny and did not think he could match his character or even overcome him) and even more spiritually than Melman in Madagascar. I have watched the film at least 15 times (I own it clearly) and quote the film at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says "Oh, oh, I love this game!" And Mr. and Manny continue to discover what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers" ... "Pack of Wolves, Pack Bears, Flea Pack, Pack of Capillaries, Nose Pack, Skin Pack? Pack of Lies, Pack of Problems, Wallop Pack, Pack of Birds , A pack of flying fish ... "or so go this part! This is the most entertaining part of the entire film, although I really enjoyed the humor behind "Lazy Mode on the Map" and many other parts as well. The only film comparable to the Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
