A few summer camps were accidentally sent to space by a robot. The oxygen in the ship was running out. They had to send someone to a space station to get gas tanks, and so on. <br /> <br /> First, the plot of this film is not possible in real life. But it gives warm feelings to anything possible if you put your heart in it. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see these young actors who are still searching for themselves after many years. (I saw this film for the first time in 2000, filmed in 1986) There are still a few people in this film still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The show was great from outer space. Does not seem unrealistic. It is about two hours long and works so fast that you do not notice it. You know it's not real, but you've refrained from it until the end. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
