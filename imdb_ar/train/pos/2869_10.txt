First, I want to say, "Thank you Disney, for launching the movie" Cinderella "on the DVD! Now you have all Disney animated movies on DVD (including limited versions of 1999) What will you do next? Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> In any case, Disney is still enchanting in his classic film "Cinderella" in 1950, a movie that put fairy films on the map We all know the story of Cinderella, its followers, its history, the glass slipper, the gourd that turns into a wagon just to say "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And, of course, tries to go home by midnight! /> <br /> What I like about this film: It's an old fairy tale that kids admire, now in the form of a movie (and also on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - Thank you Disney! 10 Stars.
