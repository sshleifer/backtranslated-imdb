I really liked this film, yes, I know it was brought away somewhat, and there was no way Shelby could stay on the road as well as the 540i with all the traction control and other tools but otherwise the film was put together well. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the actors were also good except for Brit Bad Guy, it was a bit "very much" do not you think? Anyway, a wonderful movie, great cars and great acting. I'm sure my car was locked and noisy in the remote control garage that night. :)
