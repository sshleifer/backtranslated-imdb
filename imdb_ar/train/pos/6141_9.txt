Angela Lansbury plays the role of a middle-aged lady in war-torn England during the First World War. She studied magic by mail and secretly learned it in her home, which is fine, until three children who had been separated from their parents from the last air raid were sent to stay at the huge house of Angela Lansbury. She is not happy to be there because of her secret. They just want to go home. It is very hard for the older boy to be naughty. The other two boys and girls are just curious about their new place to stay and the lady who hosts them. Children discover their secret when it starts to have fun. Fun and more. Family Fun. Laughter, fun, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are very good. This musician prepares an attractive pub to sing later like any other Disney movies. Add this to your family video library. You will not be disappointed.
