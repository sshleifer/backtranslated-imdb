Of all the reviews I have read, most people have been very hard on Alexander. Neither Marie nor Veronica has ever shown that they are too desperate to keep Alexander. He has a little intelligence, if not an intellect, because most of us, no matter how difficult it is for anyone to confess. Alexander moves away completely from life, takes full care of him, and gets what he wants. The girls allow it, Veronica loves sex, Mary is her patron. Is there something wrong with any of this? Is there anyone in love? really? I do not think so. Although French New Wave cinema is prone to pretense, etc., it is simply fascinating because it lacks the need for a conspiracy to create feelings. Ease is absolutely beautiful and anyone in the Alexandre location, in an urban area can ask for it. I am looking for a patron, anyone interested?
