I saw this movie twice in community shows and really loved it. I work in the Gene Finch community and I feel that the movie has really captured some of the essence and flavor of the community - sadness, determination, enthusiasm and creativity in your willingness with a dose of despair. Writing, dialogue and solid representation I have found myself in the story of a young banner who is struggling to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process. The dance sequence is wonderful and not just the objects that move smoothly and electrically but the camera moves smoothly and intelligently as well. All characters are multidimensional - nothing good or completely bad and women's figures are impressively strong. It is a powerful spring-hearted movie celebrating the spirit of young people, hip-hop and communities like Gene Finch.
