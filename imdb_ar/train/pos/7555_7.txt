Gender Binders are little things about x files. This episode has an interesting hypothesis, a good story, but the ending you want. Gender Bender is also the first x files of Nicholas Lea, known as Alex Krycek. In this episode Michael plays, a man attacked by "The Kindred". You need to see this episode just to see the beginning of Nic Lea less than the startling start. An interesting thing about Kindred Power of Kindred. When Marte does his victims, they are turned upside down. However, when Andrew Skole seduces, they are only because of the chaotic and thirsty, and are not attracted to Andrew. Maybe that's because Marty has more experience with that than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why it is sometimes difficult to film in British Columbia. Throughout the episode it was wet and full of mud, and could not be very enjoyable. Despite the disappointing ending, the gender bender remains a good episode to watch.
