David Zucker directed one of the most fun comedy films of the year with this hideous farce. Yes, it is a matter of acquired taste and relies on a wealth of Senorian gags, but it is constantly funny unlike some recent comedy efforts. The movie is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from clear clarity to the most subtle kind of thing that you have to pay attention to everything in the frame or you are likely to miss. Such as his previous efforts include "the plane!" , "Top Secret!" , And "Naked Naked", flying humor almost every second. There are a lot of moments that succeed, easy to overlook the few that fall. What distinguishes this film from other pale imitation in this kind of parody is that it contains an actual story line. While others have relied on the irony of many famous scenes in semi-random films (take the movie "Mafia!", Please), this film tells a new story with beloved characters. Touches sports movies in general as well as mocking the real sports industry rather than dispensing with any specific films. Even for people who do not care about South Park, its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good group of leading natural chemistry actors. The film also benefits very effectively from the crowds of athletes, sports announcers and other celebrities, especially a little funny with Robert Stack of "Unstoppable Mysteries." By the way, keep the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker achieved, with words that may apply to the mix of the sports film, Dunk.
