Sea Is Watching was made from an original text by Akira Kurosawa, which is actually a rich and warm film. Watching it would be fun! <br /> <br /> Kumi Kumai as a director is certainly not equal to the old but eternal teacher (especially the mass spectator at the beginning of the film has some terrible acting), but the mood and scenery are very enjoyable. Another thing that has not been missed here: Kurosawa has always been able to allow characters to be much more, then what he actually does and does. <br /> <br /> Maybe that was his charm during filming. Perhaps this text has not been fully yet. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we miss the teacher's eye. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and wonderful film, but it is not Kurosawa. To expect it may be very silly ...
