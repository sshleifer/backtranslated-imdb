Steve Pico was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority that ruled South Africa in the same way that Gandhi tried to resist the colonization of the British Empire in India. Richard Freedom is not about Pico or apartheid as much as Donald Woods, the editor of the liberal white paper who risked his life trying to tell the story of Pico. The film has a tense view after Pico's death in prison because of thorny behavior at the hands of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Klein, has to choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about Pico or let his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, press him to forget the books. In this case, Pico dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Pico and Woods turns into a level through the figures that escape the border-crossing after the death of Pico. Denzel Washington is the Oscar nominee in his fourth film, Biko, but there is a mistake in a film that tries to portray the struggle of apartheid by focusing more on the experiences of a white family for more than half of the film. Ateneboro had served his theme better by focusing on Pico's rise to prominence instead of the beginning, where Pico became a Woodsman. The black actor may not have been a leading role in a two-and-a-half-hour film, leading to the big box office, but the film was a huge box office anyway. Apart from film politics, the film still entertains and sends a letter or two messages, though, in a PG-sanitized manner. *** of 4 Stars.
