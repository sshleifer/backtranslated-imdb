A sharp-made documentary focuses on Mardi Gras. I have always liked this approach in filmmaking - communicating ideas about a larger, more complex and often mysterious phenomenon by dividing the case into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people have heard stories about workers' factories and understand the underlying motivations behind profit and capitalism, and the impact of globalization on poor countries (yet people feel it). Instead of explaining these topics and waking up from the soap box (there is nothing wrong with that, unlike those documentaries that are usually directed to the transferee), this film simply shows Mardi Gras beads, and how they are made, by people, under any circumstances, Then how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. It explicitly and explicitly discusses the motives of all participants in the process, including workers, factory management, American importers, and finally the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt nauseous about this. Equally by revelers in Mardi Gras, but also by the way, before the workers in China put them as usual and equal to the session (even if they have some objections to the details of how their management). The street sweeper shots to clean the beads in the streets finally left a special impression. But that was just my reaction. I can see how someone else can read this documentary in a slightly different way. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I do not think you have any specific political opinion affected by this. This is ultimately a story about humans and our relationship to the goods we produce and consume. If you've ever purchased a product manufactured in the Far East, it should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Wonderful and highly recommended. You need to see more documentaries like this. Glory to all participants in making this film.
