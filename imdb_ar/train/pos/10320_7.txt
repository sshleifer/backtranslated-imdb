Potential spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and I was glad to see him laughing in the right places and was delighted with the series of events. Ron Ellie is just as right as Doc. Cool, quiet, always under control (with occasional flash in the eye). What more can one ask about? I have never read Doc Savage, so I do not know if I'm loyal to the source but I enjoyed the light tone. Many people compared this movie to the Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is fair. The budget difference is staggering (Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not contain the extensive work site owned by Raiders. Special effects are also minimal but come on people, the story is very enjoyable and the humor is absolutely correct. Sosa's attractive music (I love the song song - every time I watch the movie, I end up humming the subject for days). The best way to handle this movie is to just relax and enjoy. Highlights include the intriguing opening sequence where the five terrific and the Indian Sniper Doc hunt across rooftops in New York and a very funny battle sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not as good as the villain who sleeps in a giant bed (really!). Overall a wonderful movie to watch on a rainy day. Give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... Thank God it's here!
