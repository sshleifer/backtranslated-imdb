This film is one of the most provocative films of Jesus I have ever seen. It does not seek to recount the whole story, but only to portray an interpretative expression from the last day of Jesus Christ. He is a brilliant, playful and faithful artist of the elements of Jewish tradition and modern biblical interpretation. Judas is much more ordinary than the other images, not the dark and evil evil we sometimes imagine, but he is a terribly mistaken man, terribly misleading in his enthusiasm. Jesus Christ Sarandin is playful, serious, faithful and committed - a very human being while also divine. The final dialogue is conducted in a thoughtful manner and serves as a kind of little talk that two strong men might do when they have just committed a atrocity. I was watching this movie again and recommend it to others.
