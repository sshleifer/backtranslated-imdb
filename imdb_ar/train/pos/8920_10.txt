I did not know Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew I was too afraid of going to watch this movie. ("Trantula" destroyed me at the age of seven ... but I was 10 years old). The first scene in which Blob crawled into the farmer's hunting stick and swallowed his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I survived and suffered from all the attacks and monster. I was terrified when Steve and his girls barely took him out of the doctor's office (the bad document), and even when The Blob came into the cinema and ate a large part of the audience. . . Many actually have IT out of the front doors, now too huge to fit just one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when Steve Steve was caught at dinner like a sieve, he looked like a sure supper. <br /> <br /> Saying that Blob was cool would be a modern description, but in the end, it would be better than icy and destroy young children. <br /> <br /> I remember walking to the house that evening with my uncle Nick, trying to act brave. I knew I was in trouble, and when I went to bed that night, I could not just feel the bloop in the room, but when I summoned the courage to look at the ground, there was a red pulsating man, heart-like sat, waiting for me to try to get up And go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 now. . . I made it. <br /> <br /> Of course Blob has not been destroyed.
