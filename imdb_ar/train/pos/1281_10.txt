This movie is as good as hard to find. The film's protagonist (writer and director) is Simon Geist-man "with an agenda." He creates a fake magazine simply because he has the power to interview Los Angeles pigs - actors, models, and musicians - who think their defecation does not insult. Through intelligent dialogue, Zukovic succeeded in doing so. Sure, the budget of this film may have been what he paid for a used car, but the film is so strong and well written that it works very well. Anyone who can re-represent The The Scream should be nominated for a silver trash basket reflection at a local coffee shop for a kind of award. Give this film a chance and listen to what it says ... because they have made the same car since 1986 ... called the "car". Bravo, Zukovic, Bravo!
