I just came out and can not believe any wonderful documentary. Rarely walk from the cinema theater in such awe and surprise. Movies have recently become so exaggerated that the excitement of discovering something unique and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when he first appeared and this film is doing it now. I did not know anything about this before entering it and what a surprise. If you hear this concept, you may feel that this is one of those successful films about a stunning victory covered with the highest music and trying to convince us exactly what you tell a wonderful story but do not allow us to do so. Fortunately, this is not the film. People tell the story! This does a good job of capturing every moment of their participation as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is a lot behind climbing that makes everything that passes by it more tense. Touching the Void was also a wonderful document about mountain climbing and showing its intensity in an attractive way but this film is more than a human story. I just saw him today but I'll go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.
