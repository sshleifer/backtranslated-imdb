Although it is not as creepy as the classic predecessor of worship (ZOMBI 2), I only love this game better. This is due to faster pace, better settings and great music in the eighties. It is full of excitement and has a sweet gore effect by Lucio Fulci. Zombies do not look as bad as in ZOMBI 2 but they still look good. It has been well made but it certainly contains a slice of cheese. For example, some zombies move very slowly while others are as fast as ninja. Some go forward while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How do you run this? Surely you should see for the horns and zombie masses. Most movie enthusiasts may also be satisfied. Check also from Zombi 4.
