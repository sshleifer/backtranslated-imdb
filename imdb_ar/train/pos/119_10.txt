The best way for me to describe Europe, which is at the top of my favorite film list, is the exclamation that came from my post-film facility: "I did not know films could be made that way." Completely original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It is far from the "main and cover" mode of photography as one can get; perfect integration of many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice expression, performance, editing, lighting, etc. ... all are equal, uncommon. Despite the shortsightedness of the Hollywood "dialogue", cinema is not about dialogue, nor about beautiful lighting, movement or music. It works best when all items are equal, by mixing only those elements, in the order or group they are presented with, by conveying the idea. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element, the film is meaningless. "Europe" is what cinema should strive to achieve.
