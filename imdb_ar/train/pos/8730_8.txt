Will say a lot of the American people ... what ??? For my opening comments. Yes I know that my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to Master Akira Kurosawa's fans, but if you analyze this film, my comment is right. We have a farmer who goes to the city in search of help against a group of locusts who want to steal village harvest. The big difference is how the story takes. Our samurai, a group of circus artists as in the original is a very complex mix of characters but in the end is what you need village, heroes. Please watch this amazing film (the seven Samurai, clearly) and find other movies stolen from the story and try to get the same magical effect from Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa. A tip is the 13th warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write his best-selling book, but did not find the foot of the third cat.
