Breathtaking, this is by far the best anime animator ever. I first saw a castle in the sky in the late 1980s when I was a kid and left a lasting impression. Years passed and I forgot the title of the film, and just by chance in browsing the Internet, I found this masterpiece again. After reading the reviews and analyzes of other peoples, I am not surprised that this praise and touching a lot because it does not leave an impression. A real fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. It is best not to give the story away, so I say that watching this film will have a clear and open mind. If you have children to treat them with this, I promise that they will love him. There is not much to say about this piece of art, but if you do not see it, enjoy it.
