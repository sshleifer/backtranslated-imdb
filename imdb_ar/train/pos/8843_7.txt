The humor contained in the full parable of the title is derived from the Sunday School saying that it is better to prepare before you die for Satan's examination, that is, Satan does not care when you die. There is no percentage trying to beat the devil. It seems that the personalities did not care at Sunday school, and found themselves forced to manage crises, having avoided avoiding crises. But even the experienced CEO will have difficulty managing these crises. Throwing dice is much more unpredictable than flipping a coin. When people share, the list of possible results becomes longer than the long list of memorable Sidney Lumet movies. So far, Hawke may not be an unforgettable representative, but maybe here he was looking to win bills between Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino.
