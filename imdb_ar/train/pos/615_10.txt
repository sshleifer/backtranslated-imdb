This is an example of the novel! The wicked are absolutely evil and the heroes pure and refreshing. The Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are fantastic as well as the new actor who plays Tristan. The wonderful performances, the nice humor, the funny, the dramatic, and the perfect fairy tales make this movie absolutely wonderful! I'm not quite sure that all content is appropriate for younger children, but for an older audience, there are lots of fine details! Previews do not do this justice movie! My fianc√© and I were very skeptical, but I was thrilled that we took a chance in this film so much that I only hope to reassure anyone on the wall about this film to try it out!
