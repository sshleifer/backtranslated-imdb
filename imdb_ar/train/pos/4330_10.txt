<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" puts the best adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel on screen. Always one of my favorite novels, I was very pleased with this simple TV series. The late Dean Elliott Elliott was wonderful, as both the noble John Gardis and Diana Reg were just as perfect as Lade Diddleock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is very loyal to the book, reducing the number of simple plots that do not affect the story. On each film is wonderful, moving and atmospheric.
