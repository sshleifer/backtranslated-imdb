I absolutely love this movie. I bought it once I found a copy of it. The film had a lot of feelings, I felt realistic, and I could empathize with the characters. Every time I see her, the end makes me cry. I can really get to know a busy Philip figure, and how I would feel if the same thing happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all high schools should show this film, maybe it will prevent people from wanting to do the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone else. Especially those affected by any shooting at school. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the greatest movies of all time.
