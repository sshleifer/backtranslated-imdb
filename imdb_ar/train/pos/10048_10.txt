The conversation will change from time to time to "Favorite Movies". I will mention Titanic, and at least a couple will snicker. I do not pay them any consideration because I know that five years ago, these people were moved to tears through this particular film. They are now very embarrassed to admit it. <br /> <br /> I saw Titanic for the first time in a long time. I was expecting to enjoy the story again, I was surprised when I found that the film had not lost its strength during these five years. I cried again .... in all the same places. He brought me back to 1997 when I remember how a film no one thought would turn into the most popular film ever. A film that captures public awareness does not resemble any other film I can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). Today, many people will not recognize that they enjoyed it. People, let's be something straight - you do not seem calm when you spoil this movie. You seem very cynical. <br /> <br /> There is no perfect movie and this film has several errors. Some dialogue falls, and some conspiracies surrounding the lovers gather together. However, none of this distracts attention to the degree that it spoils the film. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are awesome. Liu is one of the beautiful actors of his generation. Wait until you see it in the Gangs of New York before you call him more than just a nice boy. Kate Winslet was very strong in this film. The film was really her pay, and it was brought together beautifully. <br /> <br /> James Cameron managed what many thought was impossible by reproducing Titanic completely believable. The sinking was as horrific as it had been that night. How can anyone say the effects were bad outside of my will I was completely confused. <br /> <br /> This is an unforgettable scene. Titanic leave port in Southampton. Rose and Jack in the bow, "flying." "Glacier, straight forward!" The nails hang incredibly outside the ocean. The cries of her fate after her fall. And that end that even led the tears of most men tears in the theater. <br /> <br /> Music, which was also a victim of film success, was a major component. James Horner's result was perfect. The theme of love was beautiful and tragic. The very bad pop song of Celine Dion had to destroy this great part of music for many. <br /> <br /> I admit, I'm a Titanic buff. As such, I enjoyed the opportunity to see the ship because we never saw it - with all its beauty. I may have seen it sink more than some because I have been interested in the ship all my life. However, I doubt that many of those who saw them cry were Titanic aficionados. I salute Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that has never been a tragedy. The film was produced with such humanity. <br /> <br /> One of the reviewers said it's better than ever: Open your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
