This film, with a low budget, may be one of the best psychological thriller I have ever seen. If you agree that it is a low budget from the start, you can estimate the quality of the story, the quality of script writing, and the output of the production to produce something very cool with little money. <br /> <br /> All the wonderful movie elements are here. The visual images, though digitally captured, were fascinating in places. This strange scene and dream of the film was captured well in the scene with the modern dog, and this scene was wonderful. It's a three-stage action, but it's not done in a false way, which is why I have a lot of respect for this film. It is highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and attractive, and different from the many recurring movies that are there.
