This may be the second best PPV in the WWE contest of the year after Wrestlemania has been a good surprise! John Cena was an excellent match as Chris Jericho was upset. Jeff Hardy kept the IC title in a short match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a fairly violent game on Benoit & Guerrero. Jimmy Noble's game was really good with Kidman which was a surprise to me. Poker T won the big offer in a no-knock match, at one point gave Booker T kick scissors for Big Shaw and sent him straight through the table. In a stupid decision by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, the anti-American enthusiasts defeated Hogan and Edge with great help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had a game of the night that was full of great heights and RVD got his title through the DQ so I was happy because he kept the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Rau, meaning little to none. At the main event, Rock became the world's first world champion in the World Series of Poker 7 times to beat Kurt Engel & Andtteker in a triple threat match. Overall this is probably the second best PPV for 2002 from the WWE! 10/07
