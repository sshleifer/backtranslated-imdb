This show was awesome. It was complicated and well written and all the characters loved without being terribly sweet. Even Jonathan Kick was a beloved friend loved. Because our airwaves are full of waste like American Idol and dancing with the stars, it was good to see a drama that was not like the soap opera. It was always interesting to see how each character would be linked to the next. It's really annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a bit and get out of it because of a mysterious number that most of us do not care about. Some of us are not sheep. This offer will probably be missed by not many people but by some loyal fans.
