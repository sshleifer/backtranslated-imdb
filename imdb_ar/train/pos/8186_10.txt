I love devil pit! David Tenant is a great actor as well as Billy Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorpe to cut ?? It's very cute, right? She hated the bits where Satan got him and ordered him to "go to hell," Rose said bluntly. It was in your mind that it was very funny when he said, "Rose, are we known, will you be silent?" Mr. Jefferson was very brave, right? Death to save others. I felt very sorry for Toby (Will Thorpe) when he came out of possession for the second time because he was too scared. You're like "My God if you're Rose, I'll be too scared for him." And when I hugged you like "grrrrrr, it's me! Your hands!" But I thought it was really solved. And the doctor ... well, I thought he would tell Ida "Tell Rose I love her" but he did not. Oh, okay.
