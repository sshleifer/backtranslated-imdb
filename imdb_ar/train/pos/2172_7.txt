"Mad Dog" came back Earl, with his sad misfortune Mary, and that fickle foot film. As well as Babe, Red, Doc, Big Mac, and even the scene chewing. The only thing missing is a good reason to reshape Raoul Walsh in Hi-Sierra after 14 years without rethinking the line or frame, and doing so with remarkable talent inserted into a ladder or two of the ladder originally. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, and for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, Ida Lubino and Shelley Winters, etc. through credits.) The only change is, this time, instead of black and white, at Warnercolor. Unfortunately, there are those who consider this an improvement. <br /> <br /> A thousand times dead may not be necessary? And low? But at least it is not a farce; the story still works on its stunning terms. The new Earl Balance, outside the pen near Chicago, leads the West to lead a major mission led by the sick King Lun Chani Junior? Another mountain resort knocks. On the way, he almost collided with a family of Oakies, when he was delirious with their granddaughter; beatings carried him even when he discovered they were lame. When he arrives at the rooms with holes in the rest of the gangs, amateurs find passers-by on each other's throats as well as in Winters, who throw them himself (as the Bush does). After spending time until they get a call from their inner man at the hotel, Balance (to Winters Sagrin) offers to pay for surgery to treat the girl's deformity, which is counterproductive. Then, the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath. On the lam, Ballance moves up in the cold cirrus .... <br /> <br /> It's a story that sucks enough, was performed efficiently, and lacks the distinction that Welch brought in 1941, the year of Bogie, with this role Sam Speed's role in Maltese falcon became a star. Finally, a heretical observation: these mountains look magnificent in color. <br /> <br />
