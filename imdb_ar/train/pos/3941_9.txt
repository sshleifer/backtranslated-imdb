Mr. Lincoln is the first director / co-star of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember years ago that Fonda told him that as a young actor he was clearly nervous about Abraham Lincoln's play and feared that he would not live up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford before the shooting began to rest in comfort, saying he would not play the role of great editor, but merely a defender. After Fonda settled, he led a team directed by John Ford in a classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not a Lincoln biography. This was achieved in the era of sound with Walter Huston and a year after Mr. Young Lincoln, Raymond Massey played Pulitzer Prize by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey is still the final Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda was not only playing the great editor as a lawyer in a small town in Illinois. The film includes about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him lurking in a public shop, getting some law books from a leading immigrant family who would cross her way back later in the story. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her premature death, leaving Lincoln a more sad person. <br /> <br /> Fast forward about 10 years and Lincoln now has a lawyer practitioner who started receiving some notice. He has served several terms in the legislature, but has returned in private practice and is not really sure whether the policy is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where the bulk of the procedure occurs. The sons of that family got the law books from the back when they were accused of murder. He offers to defend it. It is not an ordinary murder but one of the deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The trial itself is fictional, but the maneuver used to defend Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played the role of the boys, is based on a real case defended by Lincoln. I will not say more. <br /> <br /> Unlike performances, the great power of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford picks up the mood and atmosphere and creates a small town in Illinois in the prairies in a quarter of the July celebration. It looks like you're watching a news bulletin. The country's mood was the same, a young man running and growing. <br /> <br /> John Ford's film fans will get to know two music themes here frequently in subsequent films. During the romantic interval at first with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Anne Rutledge music in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. In a dance, a beautiful melody of Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver who plays the role of Mary Todd is the same that Fonda danced with Cathy Downs to, in my Darling Clementine dance to raise a church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject for biographers because of two reasons, I think. The first is that it is a living embodiment of our American legends of people who rise from the bottom to the top of power through their own efforts. In fact Mr. Young Lincoln appears graphically as the background Lincoln came from. Second, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a good moral and unique decision to liberate slaves during the civil war, albeit for some political reasons. His assassination confirmed his place in history. <br /> <br /> Besides Fonda and others I have referred to your praise you should also go to Fred Koller and Jr. Ward Bond, two town towns, Kohler is a victim of murder and Bond is accused chief. Also Donald Mick as a trial attorney and Elise Brady as she turned out to be her latest film as a leading mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very impressive performance for Spencer Charters who specializes in rural characters as a judge. <br /> <br /> For a movie that captures drama and romance on time, you can not do better than Young Mr Lincoln.
