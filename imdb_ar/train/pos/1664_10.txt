I thought this film was amazing, as Artemisia Gentileschi made great performances. <br /> <br /> Cervi Artemisia portrays beautifully, with initial but convincing behaviors, drawing the idea before moving its models to a place. Artemisia's passion for her art is just a wonderful sight. <br /> <br /> Although each character was not explicitly beautiful, this made the film more realistic because the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought this movie was fantastic.
