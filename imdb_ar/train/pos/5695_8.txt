Some films have managed to survive almost exclusively on originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those films. The text managed to throw everything on the pitch near the fever, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this excitation is not chosen to cover up a weak scenario, but to accurately reflect the added reality of the drug. <br /> <br /> As director, James Cox is a very strange way of working with his representatives. Most characters are always on the edge of the abyss, often very ugly characters. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a fraudster, capable of manipulating and controlling. He does not represent any attack on Kilmer, but his version of Holmes appears to be able only to control weak weakness. However, it is an amazing performance. Comparing it to the roles of Hollywood's most famous "The Saint", he seems to prove that he is at home in large numbers. <br /> <br /> Representatives are the main force that is holding together. There are many small shows that stand out - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudro have a limited time with their male counterparts, but they are all wonderful. Regardless of Kilmer, Ted Levin and Dylan McDermott give strange and amazing energy to their roles. <br /> <br /> I was originally late to watch Wonderland because I assumed it was a film about a pornographic actor, in the most delicate sense. Yes, the story is about John Holmes, but it has nothing to do with his career. Basically, this film is a murder mystery, and as such - it's excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 out of 10
