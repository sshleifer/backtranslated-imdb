When I was very young, on a local TV station, they were showing Kung Fu movies of all kinds on Saturday. I watched a lot of Kung Fu movies on weekends. I remember many of them. I saw great clicks like Crippled Masters, Blind Fist from Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Rage of the Master, Tattoe Dragon and ... Five Venoms Deadoms. I remember the day clearly. I and my parents have just eaten lunch at Burger King.We watched the movie which will be on Saturday. We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch, and we ran the group and slid on 56. The usual introduction to many of the kung fu movie clips in the background with the words "kung fu saturday" under that title was the movie. Five Dead Venoms. Then the film began. I was feeling a burger in my mess with a pre-credit sequence. I loved this movie the moment it appeared. My favorite character was the poison frog. The plot was hard to follow in that age but that was not what attracted me ... I've been fighting. The battles were so ... Amazine g. I was whining every time a commercial was shown and soon two hours passed from the best movie I ever saw.
