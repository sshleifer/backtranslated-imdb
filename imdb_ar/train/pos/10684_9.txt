In watching this early work for DeMille, I was once again promoted to early that DeMille was much better than DeMille's late. His interest in using light inside the scenes is striking. Its speed is very good, allowing a lot of information within an hour or so. It is unfortunate that he was not intuitive about the style of his subsequent vocal films as he appeared in his silent films. <br /> <br /> This was the first film Clio Ridley saw. They were wonderful, self-controlling, but then moved a wide range of emotions. <br /> <br /> The end is great.
