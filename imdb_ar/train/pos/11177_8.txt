***** spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What really frightens you? Deadly sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to re-message? Maybe a chainsaw suffering from a mentally ill? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears are not even compared to the horror that people do not dare even talk about or think about - that is the death of their child. "Pet Sematary" taps this rule, fear primitive adults, and then take them to places where most can not afford to explore. <br /> <br /> I have read comments about this movie that include misrepresentation, characters making stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. Acting is actually first class for a film like this. It may be impossible for many to imagine the desperation of such a scenario. But the events of the film are not only logical, but may be absolutely inevitable if this scenario is possible. This is the real horror of "Pet Sematary": It is not that pets and people come back from the dead as a vicious killer who hunt with knives and snakes. Anyone who has lost a child may become desperate to the extent of the crimes committed by Louis Creed. Despite the warning, or even past history. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who want to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of the protector tries to compensate for his inability to protect. The results are terrifying. In fact, when the film dips into a tilted area near the end, it is almost a loser, although I think it makes perfect sense how it got there. <br /> <br /> I am a real fan of horror, and I stress that this is one of the most horrifying horror films ever. If you do not think so, check it again after having children.
