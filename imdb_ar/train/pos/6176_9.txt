1986's The Spirit was a pioneer in a possible series. However, Creator Will Will Eisner did not like the movie, so no series was produced. I thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit (sorry) comic with a modern twist. I'm sorry it was not achieved in the series. Sam (Gordon's Flash) Jones was a perfect spirit. Nana Fitzur was nice Ellen Dolan and of course she would go to Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Perhaps with the release of the large version of Frank Miller from The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare jewel from the history of Spirit. It seems that when Hollywood produces a movie of a character or idea that has already been established, someone will inevitably look for previous versions of the property and issue them to the video for a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas wore the Zorro mask, we were able to get previous versions of the convincing hero on DVD, such as the great version of Alain Delon in the 1970s (although all the copies I've seen have been badly modified). Heres the hope that someone will launch The Spirit's TV adventure on a DVD soon.
