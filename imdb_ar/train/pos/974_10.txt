One of the best directors Mike Takashi. It's very good hard to put into words. In more than fifteen years of target audience, I was thrilled from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You remember similar films for children since the 1980s, meaning that these films (unlike today) were not afraid of fear - there are a lot of bad details here that initially found a scream but soon I realized that there was nothing different from I grew up on it. The film is a collection of 80th child film conferences. You name it, there is: a young boy hero moves from his unhappy / misguided world to another world, inhabited by legendary and mystical sprites; a quest to save the worlds from evil power; a beautiful heroine has a crush. (Go-Go Yubari of Kill Bill Vol. 1); and the fear of bullets, whose evil power derives from something that everyone in the world can relate to. But all these types of conventions are given new direction and depth. <br /> <br /> An IMDb review starts, "Where was this movie when I was a kid?" This is a feeling I agree with wholeheartedly. Even while watching it, she regretted the fact that I did not grow up; it was not part of my childhood like Labyrinth, Masters of the Universis, and, to a lesser extent, The Neverending Story. These movies and other films such as The Goonies are called but never copied - Miike relentlessly presents a new show about things. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is a key element in many of his films, sometimes because of budget constraints but just as often the technical choice - the desire to present things in a strange way. Here the CGI is mostly average, just because of budget constraints, but it nevertheless does a fantastic job of putting a scene. CG's effects combine with traditional dolls, animations and really extraordinary makeup to create a world full of rich characters (and characterization) that often limits insight. <br /> <br /> This is classified as one of the greatest children's films ever. Not for younger children or the most sensitive though. <br /> <br /> Just awesome. Look at yourselves and if you think your children can handle them, you should show them to them. Let them grow up in the Great War of Yukai as a small compensation for the fact that you can not.
