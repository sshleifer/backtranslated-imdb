This is a wonderful movie, I've done the play a while ago. He had extra zing for it. Vanessa Williams loved the role of Rosie, as well as Jason Alexander had a good voice was great. The setting was also very good. Except for the fact that two hours and 50 minutes, makes them very long. Overall I give it 8.5 stars. They also added a few parts, but they were still cool.
