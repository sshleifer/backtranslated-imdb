Batman is not as good as the Batman of the Phantasm, Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero, but it's still a good part of Batman's cartoons and I say it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons. The good story is not as good as the other, but it is still good where there are lots of actions. The effects of good animation are really good voice actors such as Kevin Conroy like Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbara Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., and Elie Marinthal as Robin. Bad guys are good like Kyra Sedgwick, Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers, The Pequin and Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with Batman's Secret The Batwomen. So be sure to hire or purchase Batman Mystery of The Batwoman for the movie because it is really good. <br /> <br /> Overall Score: ******* out of ********* * <br /> <br /> *** From *****
