I recently got a chance to view "The Waterdance" and I absolutely liked it. I do not really understand why this is called because there is no dance actually happening, except perhaps for dancing at the nearby induction club. We met the main characters throughout the film, disabled in the hospital. The story shows an affair between a physically disturbed person and a healthy woman, a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can not watch movies like this today. I'm not stuck in a time marvel. I do not say that everything during the 1980s and early 1990s was better than today, but I really believe that the film industry is deteriorating, and there's a lot we can learn from old movies through old movies, anything from 1920-1998.
