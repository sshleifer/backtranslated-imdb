This bottle, which was filmed in Hong Kong, contains packages of melodrama worth more than the weekly The The Young & The Restless. This is more than a rebound to the original "Emmanuel" trilogy (especially "Goodbye Emmanuel") of the sleazefest D'Amato. Chai Lee (Amy Wong) passes through a stunning transformation from nurse nurse to hot infantry actress. The future Italian star / politician, Illona Staller, later known as Ciccolina (who has sex with HIV-positive John Holmes), plays the role of Emy. The exotic places and some basic soft scenes revolve around. Recommended for fans of the original version "Emmanuel", which I am one!
