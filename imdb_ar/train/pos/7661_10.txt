Scanners II: The new system is as good as David Cronenberg's classic scanners. The scanners were manufactured in 1980 and the second scanners in 1991, so they represent a gap in eleven years between the two films. The film captures the pattern of scanners, which is good. It will not be scanners without a head blast, so Scanners II has a head-burst scene that is just as magnificent as the first. Scanners II: The new system contains some of the other fantastical fantasy scenes that have been made well. Scanners II: The New System is a new series of serials that use scanners as a security guard for the police chief and a group of scientists to discover a young scanner named David Kilm is in use and decides to get revenge. <br /> <br /> Scanners II: The new system is a wonderful complement to the classic science fiction scanners of David Cronenberg and must be seen. Check this out. 10/10
