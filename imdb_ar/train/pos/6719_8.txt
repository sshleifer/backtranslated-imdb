I like this film because it's a great film work, made by people who care enough to make it and not just home movies. It's full of super-surfer Greg Noll movies, and loads of amateur videos from others that match his 50-year-old passion. However, it has been expanded to such an extent that it approaches aesthetic glory. It's full of artistic talent, sporting talent, no matter how trivial you might think surfing is a sport. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. Nor are they surgeons (perhaps) or a doctorate (again, perhaps). She believes in seeking from Surfer. It believes in the beauty of human saliva. It believes in the great gift of peace that comes from stopping the war. Waves are celebrating a halt to the war on the island's northern coast, which was attacked by Japanese zeros 15 years ago. It celebrates the stopover in a country that fought a cold war - rather than a hot war - with Russian socialists. Surfing is narcissism in the end. It is dangerous, but somewhat historical. I think Alexander the Great will not be celebrated because of his style of surfing. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he received. This film has no military heroes. He has no guns. The Sole Surfs theme park has a beer stand and a windsurf shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not hopeless. It is the joy of exhale.
