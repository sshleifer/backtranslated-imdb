I watched this video for the first time in 15 years. I thought it was excellent at the time and I still do it. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and one of the lovers of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge is very discriminating. Anything that detracts from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story will not get my outstanding vote. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated to a generation that grew up on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave adds a sense of originality and power. Well, so there was no big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there was no CGI. But who can exclude Gustav Dore's illustrations as part of the show? The above comment, which rejects the video in only four lines as a piece of waste, is quite unfair and unconscious. I'm a friend of the product, but that's not the reason for this comment. Instead, I defend a work of art that I think has value at all levels. It is well suited to bring Coleridge's poem to students in a way that awakens their appreciation and awakens their sympathy for the lesson of the ancient Navy.
