It is shameful that because of his title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it like Beckham is more than just a sports flick. The story line is moving and clever without being vulgar, jokes were laughing loudly, and characters acted well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are as great as Jess and Jules, who have done great on and off the pitch. Anupam is a wonderful guy like the father of Jess's anxiety, and Jonathan Rhys Myers, who was so sinister in the film "Ride with the Devil," meets the beautiful guy for once and takes full advantage of his brilliant Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, go watch this movie. If anything will make you smile.
