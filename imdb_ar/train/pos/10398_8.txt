Although the time has revealed how some effects were implemented, the story of love and adventure is still special. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie at all before you are shocked at how much later the filmmakers stole it. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at the size of Aladdin from Disney. They loved the film and enjoyed it as a touchstone for many other films and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The movie has been given 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of ten, which is where a large portion of this movie resides, because in the last 15 minutes the movie breaks down at a pace. Everything rushed as if they suddenly had to get to the end. From the point of the departure of the jinn to the end, it seems to have drawn more then finished painting. The film does not kill, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> It's still needed for anyone who likes a good fairy tale or even a great movie.
