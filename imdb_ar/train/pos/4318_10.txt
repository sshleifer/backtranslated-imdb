One of the yardsticks of the movie's grandeur is, "If it's on TV now, do you want to sit there and watch it again?" My answer to the Grand Canyon is as strong as "yes" as it was to almost any film I've seen. And impressive, such spectacular performances. <br /> <br /> It fully embodies the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early 1990s, but it also strongly confirms the ability of individuals to love, think and care. The community partly felt that the balloon was about to explode, because the country was in a recession and free from Q Birth, this was true at the time. But the film is also timeless. I think it can honestly stand against any film produced at all, which is the most of all time omission film.
