This film was for a while in my collection, but was not it before my friend reminds me of it? So I decided I should watch it. Did not know much about Liu's close? Just that he was supposed to be excellent at getting out of the movie Age and that he was dealing with a very serious subject? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has AIDS? Is Liu? The scenario surrounds the way in which Marcel (the younger brother of Liu) turns over his relative's illness. At first everyone tries to hide the truth about Marcel? Think he is too young to understand his brother's illness ?? The fact that Leo is also gay contributes to parents' reluctance to discuss it with young Marcel. I know through experience that most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes, even when someone is young, this does not automatically mean that they will not be able to accept reality and behave in a way that is even more appropriate to themselves. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide the truth about Marcel, they left a great impression on me ?? The way they supported their son ?? Even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and illness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his former friend was a big gesture of them? Most of the families I know will be reluctant to do so. Is there a lot of warmth in the scenes where the brothers spend some time together? You can see them as real friends, and worry about each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama, highly recommended
