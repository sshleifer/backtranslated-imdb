Curly Su is 6 years old with an abundance of hair and life as a lost man. She and her father Bell (Jim Belloschi) try to survive on the streets by being small artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in a parking garage while Curly will scream about lawsuits and haul to the intended victim. It happens that a top lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch) is horrified at what she has done. Not only do scammers make some money, they spend the night in Gray's luxury apartment. Even so, Gray feels she is a city to them more, so the three of them flock together for spelling. Gray knows only lucrative business law and nothing about life. Who is the best to teach them from Bill and Corelli, these clever experts on the realities of life? But, all good things must end and there is no life for a legal expert and two scammers. Or is there? This is a sweet and funny film about what's unexpected. Curly is certainly amusing like Shirley Temple but a lot of wisdom, of course. Belushi offers a rare effect, as Luck lush and lens lush is snooty but soft. John Hughes, as a writer and director, shows us a magical touch again, as the text is written in a lively and unpredictable way. Just watch Curly and Bill come out Gray for a night, without money, and see the comic results. Do you yearn for the happy, long-promised, and finally delivered endings, with uncertain moments between them? This is your custom movie.
