I was young to know a lot about the prince, but in the past few years I have seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee and I think it was cool but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know anything about. Until Saturday came on the fuse and decided to watch it. I did not know what the film would be before I saw it but it was wonderful when I found out. In the film, the Prince was not known as the Prince but the "Child". All the performances were fantastic for me but it was my favorite Purple Rain, Darling Nicky, and I will die for you. All the songs are linked to what happens in the film when his mother and father were always fighting the song when the doves were described crying what he felt. I also loved how clever the prince was in the way he was spoiled by Apollonia. I was impressed when the Prince and Appallonia met for the first time at the club and stopped behind them and then disappeared! Fantastic movie Now I can not even find one of those tee shirts :(
