These are chilling, and most likely, a thoughtful drama. I am very impressed with the film, not just for plot and great acting, but a unique film was made. Most of the films involving a British spy or war are filled with quiet talk or a strong battle, but not this. It's not about this kind of war, it's about the war between a man and his place in life, an American spy in Germany, pretending to be a pro-evil person who will never forget. When the war ends, Campbell believes he will return home as a hero, but his true heroic attitude must remain a secret to the government. Returning to America, Campbell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi hooligans, providing exciting conflicts, both internally and externally. Nolte is more than just pulling the role, and the plot fits very well for what he asks.
