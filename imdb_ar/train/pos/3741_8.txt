The war in Louisiana takes place in 1971. It follows a handful of recruits through basic training and then Tiggerland - an accurate picture of Vietnam on American soil, before being shipped. He focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davies) ... How to meet and become friends and deal with the leader of a metaphorical swarm (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a borderline psychologist (Xia Wingham). An amazingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. A handheld camera is used in most parts of the film and digital video is used for combat scenes. It works very well - the film seems to be angry (as it should be) and unrealistically uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covered his Irish compatriot and adopted a very convincing southern accent. His performance is wonderful - he is a very talented young man. Davis, alas, is not good. He's tall, muscular, very handsome - very cute. However, the rest of the actors are very wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie was thrown away by his studio. It had no stars, a wonderful story and was considered "just another war movie". I just played for a week in Boston! It's worth watching on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Farrell and Davis also have a long-standing scene.
