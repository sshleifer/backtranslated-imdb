This film may be the only film that is actually close to filming the non-experimental American College film in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Go ahead, naming another movie so approaching this one: "get straight"? "RPM"? This is the fee. Moments "Secaucus Seven" returns her moments, but this film retrospectively about individuals (particularly obsessed) is more than a film about the time and place filmed in this time and place. The film "Drive, He Said" - accurately and accurately where it should be, and a quick kick in shorts where this is the only appropriate way - the anti-drag movement, the mystery of the big college sports (especially when there is war on), the sexual revolution in this period , And the general realism of the day. Believe me, it is. <br /> <br /> The entire staff deserves praise (as the manager does of course), but Bruce Dern, as a basketball coach, and Karen Black, a very unusual hero - except for this time - should be especially praised for the benefit of love. William Tiber, as a leader, classifies a real round of applause both for the ideal capture of a student athlete in that period and for playing real college basketball in the film (remember Anthony Perkins in the film "Long Story"? <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic of some kind - and another film in the sixth grade must write comments on ("boring", "repellent" - mother, right, Sony, please return to your movies Arnold). Why is this movie not available from imdb?
