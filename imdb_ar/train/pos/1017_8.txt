I started watching the show from season one, and at first I was skeptical about it. The original film was childish, and I was just looking for some science fiction programs while waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes she became a fan. I loved the characters - not as stupid as you think - Jack O'Neill, Samantha Carter is not only smart, and Teal'c glorious, women and children favorite, and wonderful Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course, stories are not serious, sometimes silly, but often not about technology or fighting in space - it's about helping your friend, and even risking your life for it. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind." Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About free will, all the good qualities that make man - human. <br /> <br /> Now she's broken a record, she's going in season 10 and she's still doing well.
