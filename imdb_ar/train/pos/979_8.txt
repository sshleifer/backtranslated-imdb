He soon begins to go very far, feeding a sense of unease in the pound, especially when his son begins to cling to the terrible criminal. <br /> <br /> The Sundowners are a bit of an incredibly tough, brave and difficult rhythm. Picture with a wonderful performance by Preston. It appears here as an evil version of Shin, until the true nature of cattle and the relationship of outlaws is revealed. Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise! <br /> <br /> The actors' tour is Chill Wills, Jack Elam and, for the first time, John Drew Barrymore, who is more famous for his prowess.
