I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The title of the work was Dog Days. The public's reaction was mixed. Some people found that the sex of the photographer and the real violence was too much for them. Others seemed to appreciate the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for the faint of heart. It's like "happiness" with explicit sex and a less optimistic look at humanity. There is animal poisoning, a tease from the tape of an elderly citizen, an Arab bathing party in a shopping mall, penetration of anal candles, and sexual harassment by a mentally ill. <br /> <br /> If any of this seems too much to deal with this movie is not for you. This human film is most desperate and compassionate. The vanity of our presence is rushing in our faces with great joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in retrieving humanity here. And why is it? This film features excellent performances from all participants, and is always interesting, and may be the most intelligent social statement that is presented to the film in an instant.
