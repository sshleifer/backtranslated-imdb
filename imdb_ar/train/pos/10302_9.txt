This film is the best film made by Jim Carrey. Carrie did not have the usual face to make things in this film. It was funny and sad. Carrie played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan God (Morgan Freeman) blames everything that happens in his life. Then, God descends from heaven and gives Bruce His powers. As I said before, Carrie did an excellent job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were fantastic as a representative's support. The plot was good because it contained many sub-points at the main point. This movie can be funny (dog Bruce) as well as sad ("disintegration"). The script works fine, too. I'm glad they made a sequel to this movie. I appreciate this 9/10 movie.
