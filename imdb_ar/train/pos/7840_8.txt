"BORN TO BOOGIE" is a real "discovery" - although it has been a rock lover for nearly thirty years, I only saw the film for the first time a few days ago and rated it as the best rock movie ever. The wonderful music (Cream T. Rex) and the videos are constantly exciting and extraordinary, leaving this viewer looking to do more to guide Ringo Starr, who did a good job here. If you love music, you'll be in T. Rextasy all the time, because Marc Bolan is really the star of the piece and front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter a little: different places, fashion, musical arrangements, and visual concepts are all used to impart different forms and a sense of humor that could end up "just" a concert film in the other hands. Rich and full packed like BORN TO BOOGIE, the film is only about a long hour, but what is completely present. Here is my only criticism - the video package contains a 71-minute feature, and one online source claims the film is 67 minutes long, but looks like 61 minutes of fun.
