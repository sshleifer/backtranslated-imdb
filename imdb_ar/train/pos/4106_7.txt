Surely this is not an intellectual film that has a profound task, so I do not really think that there is not much to understand if you are not a Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. Humor is simple, very funny, sometimes, maybe, a little sick. Some actors and personalities are similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý) to these authors as well. But it does not matter, this type is completely different and these two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to give you a lesson, and will try to make you laugh, there are some possibilities for his success. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad film, not a creative film, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes are really worth watching.
