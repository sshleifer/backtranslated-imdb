In "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small Texas town that sings "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in a local contest and is accepted to the prestigious Philadelphia School of Arts. From there the film grows to become a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie was full of singing, acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. The acting, of course, was wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsay Mort were adorable, as was Nick Roth. The camera work was really good and I was very happy with the result (the sequel seems to be in the making). Glory to the director and all the others who participated in this production. The essence is entirely in the film archive.
