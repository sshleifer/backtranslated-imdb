When "Good Times" was first introduced in 1974, it was the first black family sitcom. I focused on the Chicago-based poor Evans family and their struggle to achieve the goals. Most of the early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide the family. John Amos and Esther Roll were the best part of the show. They were great actors and they had great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: JJ, Thelma, and Michael. J.J. He was the teenage son who was chasing the skirt but good faith and who was compensating for his lack of craftsmanship. Thelma was an attractive and bright girl who was constantly insulting with J.J. Michael was a miracle near the child and was well educated in social issues and was due to become a lawyer. <br /> <br /> In 1976, the producers made a serious mistake when they shot John Amos, literally killing his character. This has really changed focus, not for the good that I might add. The presentations began to focus more on J.J. And his cheerful behavior, which angered the black audience and star of the series Esther Roll, which left after next season. Instead of a show that focused on the major US-African issues that existed in the community at the time, viewers were overwhelmed by the chases of fat skirts and jokes. <br /> <br /> Once Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered more. Although he was still windy, he was no longer the leading pioneer show he had been in before. <br /> <br /> Despite the return of Esther Rolle for the 1978 season, it became clear that the show was at the end of his legs. All the loose sides were tied during this season and the show faded quietly. <br /> <br /> The first three seasons: a. The last three seasons: C +.
