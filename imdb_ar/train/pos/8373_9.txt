Note to previous references: This film is "adaptation of the science fiction of the Iliad" according to the scriptwriter. Whether the references are painful or not, no apology, they are the basis of the film. They admit that they stole ... although adapted is P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Big flick but very short. Maybe did not come out as well as wanted author, director, or studio, but fun damn pretty. The fact that the studio itself exploded while making it helps only add to its legacy. <br /> <br /> The new version with a large budget will not be fun, and it may not lead to a more equitable scenario. But it's fun to dream there. The DVD version seems to have some tiny plugins available but I do not think it will run on NTSC players. I'm not an expert so I'm still trying to figure it out. Now, I live with VHS Incarnation.
