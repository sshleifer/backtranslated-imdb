I have to admit that this film moved me to the point where it burst into tears. However, I always think of things twice, and instead of writing a poem that would define the film as flawless and flawless, I would risk taking a closer look. <br /> <br /> First, what is first: The film has an undeniable effect on the viewer simply because it starts and continues as a slow-motion movie and does not try to miss the actual scenes of 9/11. Excellent for this stroke of genius, because, unlike the World Trade Center at Stone, this film, fortunately, focuses not on the attack itself but on the repercussions that, like the consequences of a nuclear explosion, are hardly visible but dangerous and destructive. The psychological impact, the massive destruction caused by the events of September 11 and the devastation it has caused to the American people is almost evident in this film. I think Binder has managed to monitor the intelligence beyond the events of September 11, and Sandler in my opinion sky rose from a mediocre comedy actor to a real talent that delivers Oscar-worthy performance. <br /> <br /> However, in BLOOD DIAMOND, the character of Di Caprio says, "Ah, these Americans always want to take their feelings." Now, I do not want to minimize their suffering, but I certainly want to make a comparison. Since 9/11, the entire world has been facing souvenirs, memorabilia and the commemoration of September 11. Hollywood industry writers such as Safran Foer are hinting more than 9/11 in their works. Now, this huge amount of cultural products, dealing with the events of September 11, has turned the death of 3,000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century. The number of written books on this subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and I say this with all due respect, lose the importance of this heinous crime to some extent. <br /> <br /> The truth is: people die every day for unjust acts and terrible crimes committed by bad people or simply lost. We have a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Perma and many other countries. We forget the daily poverty of the African people and tend to be less sympathetic to them than the American victims on 9/11 because they are black and because their lives have little in common with our Western life. Africa has neither the money nor the ability to commemorate its national tragedies in a way that America can. So what I am saying is: why we have more than 3,000 victims on 9/11 and their families because we are constantly remembering the events of 9/11. Not a day passes without an article in a newspaper, film or book discussing the events of September 11. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I was a collaborator with Charlie Veneman, but I was not sure if I had the right to feel more than the Hutu who lost his whole family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> Are you in the dark?
