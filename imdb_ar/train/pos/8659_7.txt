Somehow, this movie reminds me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Remember Wobbie Goldberg's Chipping Machine? And Poe sprang from sedatives? The lobby is also blind to the lemon and imitation of Mick Jagger? Great moments were definitely taken in the film but the film is still fun, right? That's what I feel about "Rich in Love". A man hears his wife sing for the first time. Teenagers talk after marriage about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from a bucket, and in another scene, he has a beautiful waking moment with regard to his absent wife. Alvary Woodard adds another color character to her acting wardrobe. But there is only a hush plot here and you can not wait until you get moving. Only when the song "The Graces" precedes "Go-Gos" for "The Graces" for the wonderful pop song, wake up the picture ... and then it ends! <br /> <br /> This image is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the deep South.
