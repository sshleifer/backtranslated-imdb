I love this movie because I grew up around racing harnessing. Pat Boen reminds me of the gorge of my father who has drawn his attention to jars because unlike the original knights, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 film in Indiana is a better film, but it's also a completely different film. April Love is light and easy to watch, it's a wonderful movie. (Although the religious / moral views of Pat Bunn are disappointing, they have prevented him from kissing the girl at all! It has completely changed from standard fare today) embodies stress and struggle better, making the final achievement more satisfying but requiring a more emotional investment.
