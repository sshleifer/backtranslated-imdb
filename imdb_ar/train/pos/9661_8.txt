After losing Amy for her performance as Mom Rose in the GYPSY TV series, Bette won the Emmy award the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a special concert filmed for HBO from Las Vegas. Midler, who has been on stage since the 1970s, is still one of the most accomplished performers in business. From her opening figure, her classy "friends", descending from the wings on the top of a beautiful cloud, lead the stage house elegantly and attractively from a rap-designed number called "I Look Good" and then prove that she has a joke like a few other artists In this work they express their way across a variety of musical selections. Her show has been a long time running but she manages to combine her old jokes with Sophie Tucker here to achieve a good feature (although she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling her, but her ad even remembers that she is hysterical). Bette also treated GYPSY's "Rose's Turn" and sung her title from "The ROSE" as well as a shameless plug for her successful film The FIRST WIVES CLUB. I brought the house near the end with "Be with Me, Baby" from The Rose and her only single record, "Wind Beneath My Wings" from BEACHES. It's a spectacular evening for comedian entertainment and Midler fans, it's a must.
