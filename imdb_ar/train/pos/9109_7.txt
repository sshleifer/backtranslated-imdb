It is basically the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but usually the directors start from a historical fact to talk about something else, or they also show the period before or after this fact, and here everything happens during those two days of the revolution. It can also be seen as a kind of documentaries. The film focuses on these two people, appearing as usual, not like ordinary heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although they are made from the military army of the title, you can understand that they were just "individual" as the main characters. Beautiful colors and lights throughout the film, an excellent work for the director as her first film, she does not walk the familiar way. Show the emotions and passion of people and crowd. The Maya character (the main character) is well-made and there is also a good explanation for Stefano Akursi, able to show the limits of Maya, and this is not a hero.
