This was my first introduction to the Bollywood world and I am now hooked! Well, you need to adopt a different mindset to watch American movies, but once you allow yourself to enjoy it for what you are, you will not be disappointed. The songs are wonderful, very charming and charming. The actors are visually compelling, especially Charisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the world of cinema. Locations, color and spelling. If you want something different and look forward to elevation, welcome and motivation, I recommend you take this film.
