Amazing effects for a movie of this time. The primer is about the futility of war and how war becomes a nanny for itself. <br /> <br /> The wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now a public domain and available on archive.org. No charge, no subscription is necessary. Watch it in one session and you will be paid. <br /> <br /> I plan to share this click with as many people as I have never heard before, and I'm a fan of hard science fiction. <br /> <br /> I would like to see how others interact with this film. <br /> <br /> Watch it. <br /> <br /> Rate it. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
