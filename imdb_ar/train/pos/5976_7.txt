The film revolves around the 1980s culture of heavy films, metal and horror films, two things I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this film is appealing to me quite easily. In addition, for whatever reason, Ozzi Osborne plays the role of preacher. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around a young man in an unpopular high school who, like all of us losers, ended up in a world of "evil" heavy metals. His favorite death, of course, was miraculously revived - by running his latest album, which has not yet been released. This allows the wet singer to roam to kill people using demons and not help them. <br /> <br /> Well, it's sometimes very cheesy, but you know what? I've got an amazing number of good qualities. Decent representation (including Jane Simmons KDE Radio), good special effects, very short nudity, a decent atmosphere ... all in all, it's actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is music. Oh my God, huh? Well, this guy "uber-evil" Metal is one of the most obnoxious men, they reject Motley Crow on this planet - and "Metal" is more than just Pop / Hair Metal in the 1980s. He hits all the cliches here, from clapping like a gay gay, to a beautiful look, to the scream of "Rock and Roll !!!" In a high enough grade to make the diamond king retch. Apart from this hideous musical representation, it is actually very good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
