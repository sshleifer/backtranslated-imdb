China's O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This golden product of Harvey was produced by veteran director Robert Claus. Sadly he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost his connection because it is not great for the director. The only reason to watch this film is to see the combat skills of Lady Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been a classic film instead of a direct flick of the video. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns home to help her father. He has a problem with local mobs and needs help. So go back home and restore the system (with the help of two people are unlikely). But would it be enough to oust Mister Big and his evil companions? <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock, this movie is right for you. I just enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. Why did not Raymond Chau throw out a few shekels and hire a first-class director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
