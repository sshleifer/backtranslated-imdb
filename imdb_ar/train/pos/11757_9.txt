Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play the role of 30-year-old players who jeopardize their marriage by making a decision (Russell reluctantly to some extent) to restore their startling draw with Bakersfield after years of reality. Williams is fine, but Russell is gorgeous outside like Taft quarterback Rimu Haituer. Holly Banks plays a beautiful and attractive role as Williams' wife, who can live without this match. The film is worth seeing just to see the famous Remo at work. Highly recommended.
