Although it is politically uncertain to enjoy it drunk, there is a fascination to portray Dudley Moore as a fertile, beloved, Arthur Bach can only feel this unique and wonderful personality. How can you not enjoy this infectious laughter, laughter and absolute absurdity. Although I am not a fan of Liza Minnelli, they were really wonderful like Linda Marolla and I could not photograph anyone else in this role. Sir John Gilgod was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also excellent and a great melody "Theme of Arthur", F. This was really one of the best comics in the eighties. Great movies are getting better with every watch and this is the case with Arthur.
