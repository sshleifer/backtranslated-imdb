This dolph lundgren is a fun flick in your reply game, winning no prizes and not very original but offering the goods you might want to see from dolph lundgren. Our man dolph is a former soldier who now works as a high school teacher in the difficult city and when the terrorists take his order to save the day. Surely the script will not win any Oscars for its good humor and fair activity. Dolph lundgren is doing well enough, but he is more alive in motion scenes, and the rest are not the best reps but they keep him well. All in all a fun flick arrest action, but you've seen it a million times before.
