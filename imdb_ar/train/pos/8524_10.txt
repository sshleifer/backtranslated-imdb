The children, ages 7 to 14, got a huge kick from this film, where we gave a copy of all the other children on this year's birthday list. They all loved it! Children watch it 2 to 7 over and over, and we start watching it with them. <br /> <br /> It is rare for children to enjoy the film for a long time, and it gives laughter to adults, too. Most enjoy more than one. <br /> <br /> High-quality production and excellent actors, led by Christopher Schumerman as a superior George - sporty, active and fully credible, with a gracious innocence and especially the ingenuity of taking a tree in the face - well supported by Christina's exquisite pickles as the guardian of evil, Thomas Hadden as an evil competitor, and everyone else. this is funy.
