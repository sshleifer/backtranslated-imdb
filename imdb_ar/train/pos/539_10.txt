The first was good and innovative. I was not a horror film / a bad comedy. So I heard that a second copy was made and I had to see it. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie really works is the character of Good Nelson and the sometimes intelligent text. A good script for someone who wrote Final Destination movies and the direction was fine. Sometimes, there are scenes that look like they were photographed using a granular video camera. <br /> <br /> A great movie specially designed for television. It was worth a lease and maybe worth buying just to get this nice and strange feeling and watch Good Nelson Stanley do what he does better. <br /> <br /> I suggest the newcomers watch the first one before watching the sequel, completely you'll have an idea of ​​Stanley's shape and get a small historical background.
