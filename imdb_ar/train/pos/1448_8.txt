Throughout the country and especially in the political scene, people who have any kind of political ambition, should spend some time watching this film. The film is called "City Hall" and, with little imagination, can be summarized anywhere in America. It only happens to open in New York. Here we have a famous political story named Mayor John Papas (Al Pacino) with enough intelligence to manage a large urban city with little effort. His right-hand man is only deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Kozak), a similarly bright person whose aspirations are tied to his teacher and both seem to have been heading for a higher position. Everything points in this direction until the police set fire to the investigation led by Maribeth Kogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes the guilt refers to the municipal building and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and the killing of a police officer are blamed for a professional criminal whose dubious freedom leads to clear concealment through political rewards and corruption in the city, where trade union leaders like Danny Ailu, played by Frank Anselmo, and corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and Mafia bosses such as Paul Zapate (Anthony Francusa) who are deeply involved. They are also involved, they are party officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works at the New York office of surveillance. But it is the association between the mayor and his deputy that takes over the casual shooting. A great car for the Cossack and a sure bet candidate to become a classic. ****
