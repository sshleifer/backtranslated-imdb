Japanese film is confused and graphically dictated by small beings that move people into zombie-like machines like zombies that beat each other and snatch each other so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of it, a couple of lovers get injured. <br /> <br /> A technically terrifying comedy (?) is only for those who suffer from a strong stomach while flying blood and body parts. Taste prevents me from describing what is happening here, but let's just say that it is very shocking. If you like this kind of stuff with several steps shaping up the content by all means, watch this movie. Personally, I'm not used to enjoying movies like this in anything other than how sick and twisted they are. I was intrigued enough to suggest it to people I know who really like great movies. It's also a movie that has enough detail that I want to see again now and I know what's going on. Finally revealed I want to go back and see what I did not have to. There is a rare inner logic in these films. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 For those who love blood and limb limbs, it is a whistler or more accurate on alert to jogging and hiding for anyone else.
