I had put this on TIVO for a rainy day because of the cast, some hardworking people in the industry, and when I finally saw I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film has a flavor similar to Altman (eventually mentioned credits as a "thankful" person) using seemingly unrelated plot lines that intersect as the film approaches its climax. Messi is pure, clean and honest as a man can not seem to escape his "destiny", Sutherland plays and photographs a few pictures, adds a denial of a splash to an in-depth toned environment. Add Tracy Ullmann, Barbara Payne (Mission Rememberable) impossible on TV?), Not to mention John Ritter Hard and you have all the ingredients to get a good movie. The script is tidy, the dialog box is free of clues and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspend belief and enjoy, this is really time spent well.
