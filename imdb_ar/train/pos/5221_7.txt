I did not have much interest in watching The Flock.Andrew Lau co-directing the Inferno Trilogy, but was fired from The Flock and replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I felt that Lao had made a good film but did not like the study, so they shot him and hired another director. This usually does not work well (let's remember the invasion). But the herd got better than I expected. A wonderful movie but a movie exciting, fun and fun. The personality evolution is very good and I can know the characters well. Also, the relationship between the main character is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danis bring appropriate performances. , Let's go to the negative points. One of the elements that really bothered me (there was a moment where my anger was aroused) was an excess of version tricks to give the film more "stances" and elegance. Those scams feel out of place that their presence is arbitrary. I think, that the film should have been more ambitious. Nevertheless, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It is absolutely unforgettable, but entertaining.
