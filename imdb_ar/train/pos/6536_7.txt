Nancy Drew was never a great writer. It is in the same category as Club Incubator, Magic Tree House, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original version stories. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "nice", no internal conflicts at all! It never changes. Ned is pretty much the same. The film was true on this style and I have to say, I loved it. It would never be a great movie, but it had the same flavor as the books. He only had the appropriate amount of suspense for my kids (8 and 10). There was almost no offensive language. I loved the pressure for a more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Korky was a bit upset. He has had little of his place on the high school campus. I never understood why he was there in the first place.
