Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie Hugo Weaving and watched it till the end. It is one of the films "Drama of Life", where my mother used to call a film that depicts a real life story without unusual events, often descriptive. <br /> <br /> I loved the light and the girls. The rest was without too many mistakes, but without much merit either. I longed for something like The Interview, or at least some evil elements arrayed here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. The story tells one's story about confronting one's fate and liberating it from the environment that others build for you, but that happens when the life of the peach plant in the region is nearing closure, so much effort is not needed to change things. <br /> <br /> It was possible that the song "American Smart" that resembles the sound in the background part of a larger soundtrack, but the music that was played repeatedly became disturbing after 100 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think he did his part of Australian life, but to me it did not look exactly Australia (he could be put anywhere) and did not seem attractive as the story. <br /> <br /> I think one has to be in a certain mood that the film likes.
