So this made the scores of only 7.6 TV movie on this site? Bah! Bullshit! This classic version of Dickens' 1984 is undoubtedly the best. And yes, Hound saw the 1951 version which was also good, but it was not good enough. Perhaps the lack of color is the biggest flaw in this version, although the representation was great. <br /> <br /> George S. Scott is just as wonderful as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of a miserable businessman hunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then three other spirits later that evening. Scott is gagging properly like a scumbag. In fact, it is very terrible for some critics who claim that he is unable to highlight the new joy he wakes from on Christmas morning after the spirits have learned a precious lesson. But hey, this is George S. He will never go dancing in the street in a fit of joy. He has a lot of dignity, and Scrooge presents his feelings in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The supporting performances are uniformly excellent as well as fashion, music and landscape. Life dates back to the 19th century in London in the style of Cliff Dunner. The film even borders on the scary scenes in many lives that involve. The story of the important morals is reflected in every frame, <br /> <br /> Most often this version will not be broadcast on television, which is disappointing. The 1984 version of Carol Christmas must be a part of every family's celebration of the feast. When the decorations are removed from the basement, the film must find its way to the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
