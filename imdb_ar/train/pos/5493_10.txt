It is rare to have an inside view of media fraud that has been widely publicized as an official "reality" and many "news" agencies have discovered with their pants. This film, in my opinion, deserves all the price in the press - it is objective (yes!) And brave and a real "scoop". You can do it without comment or fake scenes or prominent questions - everyone, including Chávez gets just as much to fool himself with his own words. "Only" filmmakers had to follow events and keep their cameras going. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite has learned "how to take off the president and sell it as a victory for democracy." It's amazing that they finally lost - so far. Based on what I know, the only major television station that has been canceled is its terrestrial license, which is still broadcast via cable and satellite. I strongly doubt whether George W. Barack Obama will be that tolerant after a coup attempt. But then, do not worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that "Chávez's supporters shoot innocent civilians" has been repeated willingly throughout the world and reveals the extent to which the so-called "freedom" of the media has been (really) created or has always been, Just more. An important lesson for anyone interested in what is happening "truly" in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous "objectivity" challenge always starts when journalists dare to oppose mainstream opinion or reveal undesirable facts that "we" accuse - this was true with the effects of the atomic bomb or the American secret history of spreading "democracy" Worldwide, or the Iraq war, which, according to John Hopkins, has killed 1.3 million Irakis now, not to mention 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) never mentioned. To be the target, Saddam Hussein was less harmful to his people than the United States. The United States is willing and willing to be more insulting to the Iranians as it was. <br /> <br /> I am very curious about the upcoming trial of some of the Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague, whether or not there will be any mention of our involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot fighters in the 1980s when the Vietnamese largely defeated them. Maybe not. <br /> <br /> An additional reason is to resort to independent media to achieve balance, if not exposure to fraud.
