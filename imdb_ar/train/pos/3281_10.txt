Who would have thought that such a mysterious little movie could be painful and touching? I'm really impressed. It is a shame that many people have not seen him. I liked, as always, the degree of Hans Zimmer. Waha his debut directed by Bernard Rose! Still, I wonder if I should call this film a horror. It can easily be said that it is just a fantasy or a drama. Well, regardless, I like the explanatory potential. The dreams of everything and everyone in Anna (played by Charlotte Burke) represent a real struggle in her life ... the house itself, the tree, the Mark, the lighthouse, etc. These are the many details that make the film good for repeated viewing. I hope to face another small film full of emotion and psychological meaning soon.
