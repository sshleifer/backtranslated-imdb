Artemisia tells the story of one of the earliest illustrious painters to tell the true story of a young Italian woman's quest for artistic expression and the vicissitudes she faces. The film is characterized by costumes, luxury collections, actors and good actors. However, they are confused in their attempt to portray the mysticism of art and time and are unhelpful in their representation of the artist's passion as depicted on canvas and explored through its association with men. A good movie for those interested in drawing Renaissance or period films.
