I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning in the movies or consider it useless. <br /> <br /> What about just having fun? Something that excels Morgan Freeman. He has a chance to show a little. Baz Vega, his co-star, got professional support, and Brad Silberling got a name to attract people to watch his film. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some lament, some bitterness but nothing on top. I got a special kick from Jim Parsons as a receptionist at a construction company. When Freeman is seen with love and says, "You make me want to be a woman." It's just hilarious. The scene of fighting between Mrs. Vega and her ex-girlfriend is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a charming and charming film that makes you smile. You could do a lot, much worse.
