In a poor village in Mexico, colonel Fernando Lugan lives with his wife Lobo (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lula still grieves the death of their son Augustine some time ago. The colonel is expected to retire in a war against the Catholic Church some 27 years ago. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old battle. Without owning any possession or money, but a game of heavy value, they struggle to survive with the expected letter of recognition from the government, recognition of the law and payment of late pension. This slow and influential film reflects the social and financial situation of most retired senior citizens in Third World countries. In Brazil, most retirees have to survive about US $ 80.00 per month. The Colonel's debt in the story was paid for a cemetery for his son, otherwise he would be buried as a goat. Outstanding performance of the actors, in a very sad story that is the reality in poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Address (Brazil): ("NÃ£o se Escreve ao Coronel") (Do not write to Colonel) <br /> <br />
