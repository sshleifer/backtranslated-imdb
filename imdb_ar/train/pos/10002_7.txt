This is easily the most contemptuous movie inn by Brooks. Definitely, flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (for example, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic vision to the concert singers, or gave Titanic a realistic view of the Italians YOU IDIOTS). Many jokes fall down. But this film is still very popular in a way that many comedies do not enjoy, and to raise it in a story about some of the most traditional community members in society is truly impressive. It is not Fisher King, but not crap, either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have been someone else in the lead (I like Mel as director and writer, not as a leader).
