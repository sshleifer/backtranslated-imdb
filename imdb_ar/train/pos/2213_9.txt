Wow, it was quite a movie, and I could not believe I was getting up late to watch it, but it started late so I started watching it and could not stop it, and I had a whole bunch of very good team members. Robbie de Forest Whitaker, James Earl Jones and many well-known actresses and actresses were more than just a glimpse of history. It was an opening to another part of society that people do not know and may even be embarrassed to talk about. I have never heard of a book or a film about this before, and this is something that Black History never treated because it was a mixed race, and I highly recommend this film
