I love this show. Now, I'm not a fan of many science fiction shows, so if there's any similarity, I will not notice it. I love the quality of short stories in cinema. I love the story of love, although I enjoy it, but I wonder at the back of my mind how can I see this part of the story really evolve because Ned can not touch Chuck or otherwise ... you know. I even love Chuck, do not find it annoying at all, and I generally hate pretty, sweet and beautiful characters. I love the narrator's voice, even if it bothers one of my family members and prevents some similarity with some Walgreens commercial ads. I could talk about all the other things about Ned's predicament and how the book will deal with it in the future, but I'm watching and waiting and seeing what the story of the book is.
