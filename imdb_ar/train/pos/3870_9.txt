It is a very thick, distressed and complex film that unfolds very slowly, revealing horrifying details, such as the attention given in a novel, watching this movie "IS" like watching a novel unfold. Although I did not care about the narrator, as I felt unbalanced with the rest of the shows, this film shows some of the best acting groups I have ever seen, and the pioneer is the fabulous Summer Phoenix. You may find her innocence and the naivet√© of some an unacceptable conflict, a kind of intersection between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this cash, but it is still wonderful, partly because it does not resemble anything I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is unbelievably beautiful, filmed by Eric Gaultier, and part of what is unique about this film is how it never shows what you expect. It is always surprising, and despite its length, the film never reveals more than it needs. In 163 minutes, it's very concise, to some extent, say, one of the wonders of this film. It is full of simply amazing short moments, some of the best you may see throughout the year, and all these moments add to the experience of an extraordinary film. The family moments are unique, Ian Holm is wonderful, and what this movie has not said about the theater has not been seen in films since the "opening night" in Kasavet or perhaps "Limelight" for Chaplin. But, believe it or not, this is a much less traditional film. I never knew where this movie would go, and now that I've seen it, it still has multiple possibilities. This is a powerful and impressive film.
