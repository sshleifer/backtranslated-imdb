The film was the first British teenager to address the reality of the rock-and-roll community, rather than a clear parody of adolescent life in the 1950s. In an attempt to celebrate the work of young liaison officers in Liverpool, the inaugural title indicates that 92% of potential delinquents who were dealt with under this scheme did not commit a second offense. However, this becomes just an excuse for the next adolescent drama until the film ends where we are directed that we should not feel responsible or regret for such delinquents whatever they are mixed. <br /> <br /> Stanley Becker plays a tough detective who reluctantly assumes the post of juvenile liaison officer. This stolen character is a typical role for Becker. After I was currently on the trail of a fireman known as firefly and does not enjoy the splendor of the transfer. However, as in all good police dramas, it has been returned to the full circle through a marked turn of events, back to its original achievement. <br /> <br /> The first case brought to the house of two small children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by the brother of real life and his twin sister), who committed a petty theft. Here, Cathy (who was portrayed by Ann Hywood satisfactorily) meets their great sister, who eventually becomes emotionally involved with her. It soon becomes clear that the miserable environment of these properties within the city is fertile ground for juvenile delinquency. <br /> <br /> The older brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the gang leader of rock and roll. The thugs. McCallum turns out to be striking when he was a mixed-up American child who owes more to Marlon Brando than any former British star. One is reminded of the character of Brando Johnny of Wild One, who led a gang dressed in leather clothes from rebellious motorcyclists the same way Johnny leads the movie to his gang. <br /> <br /> Thankfully earlier crime drama dear like "Blue Lamp" is not very clear. Instead, many well-drawn characters are presented on both sides of the law, leading the delinquent drama and romantic interest between Heywood and Becker. <br /> <br /> The plot, while unpredictable at times, does offer some memorable scenes. The turbulent effect that rock and roll was thought to have had an impact in a scene where Johnny gave up on music, leading to dangerous progress on the police sergeant. Yet the most memorable film is the climate classroom scene where Johnny is being held by a group of frightened schoolchildren, including Mary and Patrick. It is clear in the light of the real massacre of Demblin that this scene looks appalling. It is understood that this film is rarely broadcast or made available to modern audiences.
