Jim Henson's puppets were my favorite since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a child again. Well, Muppets returned with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get Broadway in a musical show anywhere else but in New York City. You will see the inscription by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film is 25 years old, and I hope today's children will learn their appreciation for the heart of Mapets. The problem with the show is that Kermit's disappearance and the gang must be found in New York City. It is worth watching for children and even emotional adults like me.
