(4); four prisoners sharing a single cell: the domineering transvestite, Marcos (Clovis Cornelack); the foolish and devout Marcos colleague, Beckett (Dimitri Rathud), who will eat anything on the horizon including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; The smart library that killed his wife; Carrier (Gerald LaRouche), the new man who has fallen victim to corporate fraud is now focusing on escaping. After the fall of bricks from the cell wall, the men discovered the hidden magazine written by the killer of a maniacal series of "Fountain of Youth" occupied the cell in the twenties of the twentieth century. Is this magazine the secret of their escape? Or is there something more evil behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a bit tired about getting into this film because the only other experience I had with Eric Vallet was Lost Missed Calls (2008), which is the worst film ever made. However, much of the error in One Missed Call can be attributed to the terrible scenario Klavan did, because (as I remember) Valette's direction was not the worst part of the film (unless he chose to include the child). Anyway, Maléfique was a good way to regain my respect. . . It's a French film (obviously I love something), and it happens in prison (the second preparation of my favorite horror after wrestling). This is two points for him before the movie begins. Luckily, I had Valette when the film ended as well. Maléfique is a fairly deep story, somewhat complex, convincing of mania and despair. . . Desire and need to bring fantasies into reality. While it is not a terrifying film in the traditional sense, its strangeness makes it very frightening. The period between its climax and its closing was among the best films I ever saw, and I would warmly recommend this to anyone looking for a decent psychological excitement with some wonderful dresses. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. A great deal of respect is earned by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has the rights to make a new US edition (surprise). It's due to end in 2009. I'm not sure why, to be honest, because this does not seem to be something that would be a big winner here in the United States. But I was surprised before. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
