I'm someone pedestrian, with somewhat lowbrow tastes. However, I sometimes try to raise the level of cultural awareness. This film was one of my attempts. I was in awe throughout the entire film. I was so impressed that I got my tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally moving film. I saw this as a big question for the viewer: How deep is the sacrifice of a duty one can accept, one that can be accepted, one must accept it? As a military member, this of course is an important question for me. This question greatly affects the viewer for this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
