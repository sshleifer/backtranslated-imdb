I realized two days ago that the makers of this film put a play on the words in his title. This film is not primarily related to the "riding the Giants", but is mostly related to people who are sports giants, ride giants, to change focus. <br /> <br /> In my youth, I lived a block of Wedge, one of the hardest and best bodysuring sites in the world. I have been abroad between 15 and 18 feet and have been hit by waves 10 to 12 feet on many occasions. This experience is why I am in awe of the surfers of this film. The idea that Jeff Clarke, by any standard human standard, can get away from the BY HMSELF for more than a decade, has become beyond my scope. The first rule of safety in any water sport is "Do not surf / dive / swim on your own". He went to where the sensible people were, and lived to tell about it. I would not go out there if the water was 75 degrees and left all sharks. <br /> <br /> In a warm water world: the first shot of waves in the jaw makes the skin hit my whole body. These are not just scary waves, they are uncontrollable waves to evacuate the intestines. When we see Laird Hamilton not surviving waves of 40 to 60 feet (I can hardly write these numbers), but actually I work on faces like a fun day at Rincon, it has exploded. There is dedication and concentration in the large wave knights that are similar to those in anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave it 9 instead of 10 just because I neglected to mention that there are big wave runners in the world outside the Hamilton / Calama crew, and I think they deserve mention. Paste in the Bradshaw Ken in the outside log cabins and 10 is!
