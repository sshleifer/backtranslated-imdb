This was the first Panahi film I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I have completely absorbed the different personalities he creates and how their reaction and behavior have been different compared to Australian children and on other levels how they resemble. I think if more people can watch movies like this, they can see people as individuals and avoid racism, often fueled by fear of the unknown. There are significant political differences between the culture of Oz and Iranian culture, but I found the most subtle differences between the characters, which this film successfully embodies on the screen, very fascinating. There are peculiarities in characters that seem to me unique. I found it made the characters convincing.
