This has always been one of Austin's best edits. Although not necessarily in the same category of "Pride and Prejudice", Emma is a relatively faithful television version of Austin's novel - especially given its length. The biggest change between the novel and the film is a good change, where the unnecessary banditry offered by Austin is removed at the end of the story here and replaced by someone closer to Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters selected for the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsell excels on the line between the girl and the social girl with an entirely lost blessing in Gwyneth Paltrow's '96. Samantha Morton locks the annoying blonde with her position and personality as she replaces the samer that accompanies her role in previous descriptions of Harriet that we know from the book. Mr. Knightley's role is played very well in my opinion; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero has painted in the novel are here in this largely neglected film.
