I saw a long day die when the film first came out, I thought the film gave a good view of the soldiers, gave a realistic account of the men in the war. The scenario moves at a nice pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, trying to return to their ranks with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemings is a good actor and plays a prominent role in the faith, as did Alan Doby (like German Helmut) I was surprised by, and I could not find this movie on VHS or DVD, , Which is sad, because it is superior to many other war films I have seen.
