First of all, the only reason people continue towards him about this film is that they can not afford a few parts of the real story "to be switched". Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect film either. Well screaming enough. This is a very nice film. The backgrounds are wonderful and are taken from famous artists from Tolkien. The film covers about half a trilogy (track fellowship and even the Battle of Helms in the Towers) and moves at a good pace. The sound is first class and most characters look as if you imagine. Samwise is extremely ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks awesome. The movie has a great degree that fully supports the movie. If you enjoy good fairy tales but you hate reading (the books are better), try this movie, considering that it was produced 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> It is also worth noting: Peter Jackson adapts the fellowship almost as much to Ralph Bakshi's thoughts (Jackson often said how much he liked Bakshi's effort).
