"Big Farewell" introduces us to the first hollywood adventure, in which case Captain Picard pretends to be a special investigator, Dickson Hill. These rings create a kind of standard pattern, repeated several times on TNG as well as DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, an error occurs and the characters must deal with the program under different conditions besides playing the game (represented by the failure of the holodeck safety program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend the possibility of Star Trek and enable a type of blended type. Pixar's Dixon Hill stories are examples of crime fiction in the 1940s, and their screen representation in the name of Film Noir often has the stereotypical antihero in the foreground (see, for example, the classic Chandler's Marlowe or Polanski stories "Chinatown"). Star Trek never focuses on the story (it's often a simple "how to get out of here" scenario) but it enables actors to adopt a different approach to their characters. These Holodeck games are commonly used for entertainment and reflect the special interests of crew members. So the artistic side is always ignored. From this point of view, the stories are never sound (but did Star Trek ever have a technical and scientific point, in addition to some trivial concepts?). <br /> <br /> The "Great Farewell" features Patrick Stewart, a comfortable McFadden who barely looked better than ever in the Star Trek episode (at least the early ones) and the data has some great sights too (although I find it difficult In the belief that pulling the lamp was supposed to surprise him from the wall, because he conducted research in that period and customs). Wesley continues to transform the peaceful Trekkies into potential killers (why did not they take him to the Huldik and allow gangsters to end him?) But all of this is fun ...
