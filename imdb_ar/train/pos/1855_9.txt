Having not seen all the films released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best film of the year. I can say it's the best film I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most of the American films that show black people either capture the United States' interest in "ethnic relations" or fall into the cliches of the city's inner ghetto, with every conceivable stereotype speaking in a literal language With electronic translation. Antoine Fisher stands alone in this regard: Sex is irrelevant, except for one battle that may or may not have been provoked by racial insanity. <br /> <br /> The story of Anton Fischer is a story that must be echoed by any sympathetic individual. It is understated, and thoughtful, portrayed by Derek Locke. While using Denzel Washington clearly for its astral power to make the film, he sticks to the background in the largest part, allowing the film to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture generally want to preserve the great divide of a number of Americans (and also Canadians, you know), this film speaks to humanity in general from us. I only hope that the non-black audience will go to watch this film for that humanity, rather than avoid it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the film who can recognize them. It would be a sad comment on racial relations in North America as such. <br /> <br />
