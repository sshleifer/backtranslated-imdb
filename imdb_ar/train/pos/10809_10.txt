Russell, FSA, is wonderful in this film. But even more, the film covers a vast array of human emotion and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is handled and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that the tolerance of other humans provides the way to save humanity. A wonderful love story between Lachin and Lil. I repeat their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever been in love will sympathize with these people. All characters are cast and photographed in an excellent manner.
