Hollywood North is a cynical look at the time in the history of Canadian cinema when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada. Most of the time, it has been treated as a tax haven or a cheap way to produce American films. For example, Burke came out of it. However, Matthew Moden plays a beginner producer who wants to modify a beloved Canadian novel. However, in order to get the money needs to star American name. He gets a loose cannon and learns that he has to reach a compromise so that the film no longer resembles the book on which it was originally based. It plays well in Canada but may not be understood outside Great White North. The Americans will believe that we are mocking ourselves, but we will miss the fact that we will actually mock them. Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
