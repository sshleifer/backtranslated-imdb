This is one of those movies that, after watching them, will still think of returning and coming back to the months after viewing. The acting is great for a two-star tournament (I usually hate movies with a little kid acting). Bill Paxton is awesome, and for the first time the director is better than I expected from his memorable line actor "The game is over, man! The game is over!" (From the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the split between those scenes where the actors play a family, and when they "do their work". It really makes the film reasonable and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Keep watching, Bill. I'll be waiting for more movies I'm sure love!
