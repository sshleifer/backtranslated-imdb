Sex spoilers huh? It is one of the most basic parts of human life. However, have we already taken it seriously? People always want more, even those who get it daily, and if you're lucky, there are potential consequences for changing life. Paradoxically, people claim that we all started having sex at a younger and younger age (despite Victorian marriage and having children in the early teens), so it must be increasingly difficult for those who reach the level of virgins. In the first big appearance of Steve Carell's screen, the 40-year-old man plays without his management. We have dealt with innumerable extreme and extreme sex-related incidents, not to mention the most offensive epithets of the episode "Eurotrash", does not seem to be the general plot of the film and its funny principle. It is a pleasant surprise that for all the failed jokes that are not appropriate, there is an unbelievably large number of jokes that afflict the mark and leave the audience hysterical. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Karel) is a nice guy with a good job and a nice temperament. However, at the same time, he takes life very seriously, and after his invitation to poker as a necessary fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At forty, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for various reasons, but unfortunately most often, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) offer Andy's advice with one goal in mind. To get him out of his misery and place him in his place. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about the "Anushurman" was just a matter of time before Steve Carell got his own. In the film "The Old Year of the Old Year," Karel, who shows poor, timid virgins to perfection, shows inspiration because he gradually grows more confident as advice begins to help. <br /> <br /> Karel is not alone in his performance. Rod, Rogen, Malcolm, and Katharine Kenner as a love interest are all wonderful. Rod is a favorite personal figure such as David's love patient who collapses several times and shares the coolest scene with Rogen where the two argue about homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The big surprise about this movie is not how many brand jokes are hit, but in fact the smart way that the letter rotates on its head. It is clear that the entire movie tone is specifically designed for conservative America, and turns from a simple story of sexual conquest to a story of safe sex and abstinence. Virgin does not need to have sex to complete his life, he only needs to trust and true love. A message worthy of preaching, and a great improvement in the letter you expect to see at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Strange to see a funny comedy and a well-represented, but low-ha, "40-year-old virgin" is quite so. Also throw a good faith message and you are on the way to a top notch comedy. A sudden joy.
