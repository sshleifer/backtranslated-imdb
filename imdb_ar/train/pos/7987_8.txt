A man on fire was hot. I love the classic story of good revenge, and what is the best reason to avenge the kidnapping of a innocent little girl. <br /> <br /> The book has done an excellent job in this film to build the relationship between Denzel Washington and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer understands and actually feels the Creasy engine to save Pita. It was also good that Crissy was not one of the young choirs who were trying to save a house through "proper" channels, but instead used methods of torture and intelligence in the streets. Some may say, "Wrong torture regardless", may be right, but when you see the pain that Chrissy undergoes because of the loss of beta and the immense passion he enjoys to regain, you can only stand aside with Creasy and pull him to be more cruel. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with various evil gangs and criminals and he knew it. <br /> <br /> Search for Creasy returns Pita to her mother and Creasy dies in the bad guys car. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, but actually reinforced it by showing that Creasy was ready to die to recover Pita. His death was indeed noble. <br /> <br /> Denzel works as well as the book does. This film deserves good marks because it was definitely a good film.
