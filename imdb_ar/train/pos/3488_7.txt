WWE was in need of a savior as it revolves around WrestleMania 14. The departure of Bret Hart and the subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation has left the Vile D-Generation X stable without a challenge in the WWE. Their despicable leader, Shawn Michaels, stole the title from Hart thanks to the intervention of Vince McMahon, and with the help of fellow Triple H and Sheena systematically took on anyone challenging his superiority. But in the Royal Rumble a new competition emerged. Stone Cold Steve Austin. McMahonagement hates, Austin was worried DX. They are actually very worried that they have enlisted to help "the worst man on the planet" Mike Tyson as a special outlet. Austin will face strong odds against him in his title game with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there was a basic battalion to get them through which the Death Corps began by winning fifteen memorable team matches with Royal to become NO.1 contenders for the title titles. I forgot that this match was there until I watched the PPV. Not very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the cards section in that time period. <br /> <br /> The next game saw the title heavyweight defended by the hero Taka Michonoko against Ogila. WWE has established a heavyweight title to compete with WCW's heavyweight division. This was not successful and this was the only time that the title was defended in Wrestlemania. A short game, lasting about five minutes, is actually too short to achieve much. The little thing they did was exciting and this was a nice little game that saw Taka retain his surname. <br /> <br /> Well, our next game saw a DX Triple H member defending the WWE European title, which he won in a comic strip of Sean Michaels on RAW in December and did not defend PPV, against Owen Hart, the only survivor. Triple H got a big entrance with the DX band there to perform his song. Chyna Triple H was accompanied to ringside, but was later restricted to the WWE Sgt Slaughter Commissioner. Triple H and Owen had a nice try to take the lead, as Chyna took a soft shot on the left, leaving Triple H up the table. A good game, it would have been fantastic if it had gone a little longer. <br /> <br /> Of course, we will not want to spend time away from our next match, which saw a real pair of Marc Miro and the defeat of Sable Jolsted and Luna Fashion in the first mixed match in WrestleMania 8 years ago. With all honesty, it was not worth waiting. Although it was not awful, the match was by no means memorable. These were approaching the end of the only Miro race in the WWE and its main purpose was to continue to break up its relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> After that, we saw Ken Shamrock come out and charge himself the Intercontinental Championship. When IC Champion The Rock was destroyed, but then refused to relinquish his ankle suspension, resulting in a reversal of his decision. It was a short game, but it was a match for what it was. <br /> <br /> Next saw their first good game of the night as WWE Tag's New Age Outlaws lost their titles to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in the fun of the garbage match. The decision was overturned the next night as Cactus and the saw threw lawbreakers into the back of the trash, instead of being used in the game, but the game was fun. <br /> <br /> It is not too late. For the first ever encounter between Ken and his brother, the Undertaker. Kane had assigned the Undertaker to WWE in the Royal Rumble and then "killed" him when Shawn Michaels helped secure the Undertaker in a coffin and set it on fire as a ruse to burn the mortgagor's home and leave him terribly disfigured years ago. It was a good game and I told a nice story where Under Underaker absorbed everything Ken could throw at him and then took him out with three tombstones to finish the game. <br /> <br /> This main event only saw WWE Champion Steve Austin face with Mike Tyson as a guest outlet. Michaels suffered a back injury in his death with the Royal Rumble Undertaker and was notable for the game despite physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were banished back at the beginning of the walk after intervention from outside. The match ended with Austin's attempt to try Sweet Chin Music and hit Stone Stone Stunner down. Then Tyson came to the ring to count three, celebrating victory with Austin and then Michaels came out after the game. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were both together and the cat was playing with the mouse all the time. <br /> <br /> This was the last match in PPV for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. This helped establish Austin as the biggest star in wrestling and the prevailing publicity gained by Tyson's emergence became a crucial turning point in the WWE battle with WCW. Austin will continue to become the biggest star in the history of the WWE, along with Rock, Mick Foley, Undertaker and Triple H, leading the WWE during the period when they gain the highest level of cultural significance. Everything started here at Wrestlemania 14.
