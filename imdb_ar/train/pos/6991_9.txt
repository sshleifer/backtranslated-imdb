This is an excellent film. The cast is a wonderful mix of characters and a decent story. The film basically revolves around a good-performing doctor who steals the bodies of the dead brides and takes them home. Once the bodies are in his house, he removes things (I hate to use the generic term, but I forget what has been removed) and put him in his wife to keep her young. After that, Reporter Patricia Hunter investigates the situation and begins to find answers to the cause of the death of the brides. She is making a trip to the doctors' home and things start to get interesting. Definitely watch this lizard enemy, but the good thing if you can.
