"Silverlake Life" is a documentary film that was clear and direct. In fact, it was like a home movie, and if you want exciting lights, look for something else. It is by no means a tearjerker. But I mean it in positive ways. It shows two men who love each other and how AIDS affects the quality of their daily lives. It is almost hard for me to say whether this is a good film or not, because it was so crude that I had to look for other ways to respond. It's an impressive film, and it's actually one of the most amazing and honest documents I have ever seen. These two men enjoy incredible safety as their lives are confined to the basic parts. It makes products made of hollow wood on AIDS look hip and heartless. These guys made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. Tom's scene "You're sunny to me" and tell him goodbye is the real thing.
