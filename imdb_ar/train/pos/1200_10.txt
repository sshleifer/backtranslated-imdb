They have no illusions, this is a moral story. Granger is a troubled former buffalo hunter, and again tempers into the plains again by killing Taylor. Granger can see the close end, and feel deeply at the cost of searching for herds, Indians and the earth itself. Taylor, on the other hand, is equal to killing buffaloes, or Indians by "being with a woman". While Granger's role as a tormented fisherman is wonderful, it is Taylor who steals the show, as "every man" is deceptive and immoral in order to get the first payment and the good time. There is not much bang here, but the story is moving fast, and we are dealing with the wonderful performance of characters by Nolan. The subject of this story is quite influential today, as in the relationship of nineteenth-century man to land and what it is, and racism. Looking at the time when this was done, the sergeants must be involved in maneuvers during the scenes in the "noisy house", Taylor's relationship with oysters, and a lot of dialogue. Despite optimism, this is a truly fantastic Western image.
