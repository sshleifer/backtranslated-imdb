My, Casey Lemmings is definitely a fair-looking woman. This film is a lost gem, a comic "scorn" of the hip-hop scene in the early 1990s, when MC Hummer just started to fade on that good night. We follow the three NWH members embarking on a strange journey of potential fortunes and fame. Nicholas Niclibe, in the end, ends their journey not far from where they started, but at least more wiser and less na√Øve. This is one of the best films that has never been heard before, but it's a kind of movie you love or hate, like "Company Man" in this regard. Take this movie like 1000 Islands in New York State, it's a great little secret you want to keep for yourself.
