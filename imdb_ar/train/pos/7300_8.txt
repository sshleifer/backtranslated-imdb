Like the cute Giants who make up the last half of the title, Michael Opelowitz's latest production is graceful, but also slow. Another picnic of the product, "mosquito-3D" has the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark film, but somehow they managed it. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was an acceptable cartoon, which is always fun when dealing with fantastic worlds under the surface of the ocean. But even this was only acceptable. Poor focus in some scenes make production seem amateur. With dolphins and whales, technology has become wasted. The cloudy viewer and many of the film's great subjects do nothing to take advantage of the amazing 3D IMAX capabilities. There are very few scenes of any depth or variety. The close-ups of these wonderful creatures seem only flat and there is often only one object in the field of cameras, so there is no variation in depth. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you have Shark-Week on the cable, his ambiguous treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
