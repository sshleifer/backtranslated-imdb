I saw this movie on television and charmed the beauty of Jennifer McComb. It was a great film and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb. At that time, I was thrilled to watch this movie and from then on I try to get a VCD from this movie but I cant find it. The huge African black appears in his film and we will commit ourselves to expressing the size of these animals and the grace of those animals. All audiences can watch this movie, especially for children. But some scenes involving Mccomb require parental guidance for this film. It's a fun holiday movie for everyone.
