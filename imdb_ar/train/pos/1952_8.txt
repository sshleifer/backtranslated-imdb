I got to see the movie "On Thin Ice" on TV in India .. I must say that the movie was really good and sent the chill down my spine .. The basic story makes me think of what makes some addicts decide to go off where the others are still addicted ... <br /> <br /> However, I felt that Diane Keaton was at her best ... the scene in which she craved, and started looking for her home in search of cocaine ... was the best ... the boys are good, Linda Boyd also showed what a good actress is ... The text has been well executed as in cinema and trend .. Casting <br /> <br /> You should see the movie ..... for all
