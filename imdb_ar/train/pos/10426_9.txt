I love it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is limited. The characters in the company did not really enjoy their "real" lives, but they enjoyed it, whatever they were. The film did a good job, making this simple day a good memory. Not only does good memory include romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but certainly include a deeper debate about the values ​​of their lives. Many films like this in terms of discussing definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some kind of such. Before Sunrise treated her in a nice way, making the viewer pause, think, adjust her breath and continue watching the movie. Before sunrise did not try to instill a certain thought in your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in everyday life and give you some alternative possibilities. Make these conversations between characters interesting, not just ordinary whining complaints or stupid thoughts flowing. You are still pondering these issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not very important after all. You can get something out of him and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be fun. It's a fun movie worth your time watching. I'm on a trip too. The film somehow represents part of me and answers some of my questions.
