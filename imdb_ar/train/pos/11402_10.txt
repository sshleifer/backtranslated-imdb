I saw "An American in Paris" in his first release when I was still in school and signed up right away. I went back to see her again the next day and I lost the number of times I have seen it since then, either in the cinema or on television. She uses some of the best music and songs by the greatest 20th century composers (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male dancers (Jane Kelly) and Leslie Karon (Hollywood) in the history of Hollywood. The Oscar-Levant support team (as ever strange), George Gokic (why did not he make more movies?) And Nina Foch (the star in an unsympathetic role) are at the forefront of their form. The closed ballet, superbly designed for the title music, makes a great use of Parisian views and sounds, and of Impressionists and post-impressionists. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully presented, but the most memorable ones are "Very Obvious" (Karon and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and "Got Rhythm" (Paris children join Jane Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine"). If you love Paris, watch this movie. If you do not go to Paris in your life, look for it. But see!
