This was a great show, and I always look forward to watching it. All the characters were funny and wonderful in their own way, each episode made a non-stop laugh, was completely entertaining and different from many other programs. Everyone was totally crazy and funny, she could only love this show. There were some low-weight episodes, but this 1970s always managed to create a kind of loving atmosphere, where it did not really. It was one of the best programs to be broadcast at all, and I will watch this show anytime I can, because it does not get old , Never laughs, never gets attention.
