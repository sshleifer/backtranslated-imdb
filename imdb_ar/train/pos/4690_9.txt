25 years ago, this film was shown in some children's classes in entomology, and I still remember the excitement of children; they were spelled out! It is not only about the termites that are built and live in "mud castles", but also about other animals that use the hills. There is a wonderful scene where the Cobra fights the screen lizard while you see a colony of Mongos. It is not only good for the categories of insect science, but also for teaching about ecology where there is much about interactions between termites and other living organisms and the complete ecology of all living organisms that live within and around the hills. <br /> <br /> I hope it is available on DVD, so I can see it again and view others.
