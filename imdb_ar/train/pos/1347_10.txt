A huge, comprehensive and passionate summary of American cinema as seen through the eyes of Martin Scorsese. Needless to say, there is never a dull moment every time they run 4 hours. Many species, periods and managers are examined, and discussed more than the Sinel perspective instead of the contemporary director. For anyone interested even remotely in American movies, or cinema in general. Masterpiece, and best of the BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
