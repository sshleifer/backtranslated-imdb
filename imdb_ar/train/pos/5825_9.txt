Most Stoogphiles consider this the best short bar of Stooges, and they are right. Curly is screaming in the clouds as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Mo and Larry are at the forefront of "Mucho Senor" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Christine McIntyre's voice is given a completely beautiful opera - she was actually a trained opera singer - and it's wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is a hilarious Italian singer as a stooge at a community ceremony. Some really ridiculous gags, good direction, and very narrow editing make this climb to the top of the Stooges production company. Surprisingly, Corley had severe health problems at the time. In many of the shorts he made during this period, you can see that he is clearly ill; his timing is too long, he speaks very slowly and hard, and he has a problem getting around. Fortunately, his health was in a big boom when he made this film, and this shows. A classic comedy of Stooge, enjoyed by even fans of non-Stooge (I had a girlfriend I can not stand on Stooges, but I even laughed at this). Must see.
