Michael Kallio performs a strong and convincing performance, such as Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who has been horribly abused as a young boy by his abusive, brutal mother-in-law Barry (a truly horrifying photo of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a sweetheart (beautifully played by the beautiful Tracy Newberry band) and a post-autopsy report in a local morgue. Embarrassed by his dark past, bald-eyed, jubilant to Jack Demon (Michael is really a creep Michael Robert Brandon), and sent across the edge by his mother's recent death, Erik eventually begins and begins a brutal murder of a spree. Directed by Kallio (who also wrote the narrowest and smartest script), with a well-orchestrated representation by an unnamed vocalist (Jeff Steiger is particularly good as the loyal guardian angel Michael Loyal), rather not, but the cameraman George Lopez, The unbelievable end, the Detroit and Michigan locations, a grim and serious tone, and a serious tone of horror story that remain on a constant course all the time, this horror The psychic is very strong and courageous makes sense Watching fun and annoying often. A real sleeper.
