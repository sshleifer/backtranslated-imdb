My classification marks the first 4 seasons of the Stargate SG-1, fresh, fantastic, creative and addictive. When you step up the portal, you never know what lies on the other side! Starting from the fifth season, the exhibition focused on a different focus - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one foreigner) who regularly venture into a planetary transport called Stargate. The background story of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the device was discovered during an archaeological excavation in Egypt. <br /> <br /> Loops are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. It was easy to turn many creative stories into their own science fiction films. What will happen next was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the show is based are well defined and perform well. Their dialect is serious, but the dialogue is cleverly flowered and a ghastly spirit. It's just fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Starting somewhere around the fifth season, the series began to evolve into an ongoing story based on fighting one enemy (Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (more political / strategic) and interrelated. The characters were still as wonderful as they always were but the show was different in nature. <br /> <br /> One of the things to mention is watching episodes that celebrate the rings 100 and 200. They simply can not miss the shows. They show the creative genius and humor that has brought the series through ten seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a science fiction fan, look for a few episodes of the first 4 seasons, and you're likely to be hooked. If you want to develop story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to.
