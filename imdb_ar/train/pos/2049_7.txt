This film is beautiful, but I consider it a credit to try at least to give some descriptions of its principles. There are some wonderful moments in the film, and the dialogue has some wonderful moments as well. <br /> <br /> Air attack sequences may be the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> I think I really like the idea of ​​how long the veteran will go for a veteran colleague. It is certainly not good, but the hypothesis is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Tom
