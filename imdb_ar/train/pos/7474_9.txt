This is one of those films that is difficult to review without giving up the plot. Suffice it to say that there are strange things and unpredictable vicissitudes, along with Tom Cruise's initial surface plot with many women. "<br /> <br /> The high-quality cast casts this film higher than the standard, and all actors are perfectly suited for their parts : Cruise is an irritating playboy who has everything - and then loses everything, Diaz as an attractive lover but a little confused, Cruz as a strange new girl in the scene and Rochel as a patriarchal psychologist. An entertaining trip. <br /> <br /> I would like to add that photography is also excellent Each uniform and the inclusion of different visual metaphors will be beautiful once you realize what is going on. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy good-acting movies with twists and suspense, and you are willing to accept the accuracy of Philip K Dick's style, it is a must. <br /> <br /> 9/10
