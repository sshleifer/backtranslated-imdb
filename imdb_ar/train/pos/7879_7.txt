As with most Eleanor Powell films, this film is shown along the most conspicuous conspiracies. For some reason - make it clear! - Elected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. The wicked and the wicked are competing for the mine, and who is the one who confuses. But, as always, Powell's dance is fantastic and deserves the price of admission. In this film, he plays the cowardly lion, recalling the warm memories of the Technicolor film of 1939. It is important to hear Frank the young man, with this wonderful voice and soft wit that he gave up because of his wise personality later on. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time to show his talent. He particularly witnessed the unique duo with the trumpet man in Dorsey, Zegi Elman. I say "unique" maybe in ignorance, but I do not know any drum / trumpet sequences like this in the film or records. This movie is interesting even the hateful Skelton characters are relatively restricted. Powell once again shows that she is the greatest film dancer ever.
