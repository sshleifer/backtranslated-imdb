I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it a lot. It gives insight into the creativity of filmmaking and the amount of work it really involves when you have a low budget but you need a representative / actress to get people, and any people who come to see it and show the film. Maudin's Bobby Myers and his partner Saul Paul Linder made an excellent mix to find the odd-looking Miachel Bates, and Alan Bates's "NAME" was an ideal choice for the film and film. My favorite friend was Sandy Ryan, played by Debra Kara Unger and presented with her own performance again in the movie. If you enjoy thinking about watching a comedy, it's right for you. A low budget meets a lower budget with high laughter content.
