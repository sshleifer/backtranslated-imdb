This small / comic horror comedian displays Cassandra Peterson and is known as Elvira: Mistress of Darkness, the most famous horror host of all time. This was supposed to be Elvira's flagship vehicle and was very successful as it was captured by NBC. They filmed a television series pilot showing a busty babe in black, but unfortunately the sit-in never missed the experimental stage because of his sexual references. This film however, is very entertaining. Elvira is a contemporary Chesty Morgan and Queen of Steamboat. This film was followed a few years ago by Elvira's "The Hills of the Abyss", which was supposed to be part of the old Roger Kurman films, but in front of her. Watch this movie instead for a more entertaining experience!
