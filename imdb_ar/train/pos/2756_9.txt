This film was picked up based on the plot summary and critics' quotations at the back of the box. I'm not big in foreign films, and I did not know what to expect. I do not really care about translations either. But I loved him perfectly! It is a simple, gracious quality that makes you feel good about life. I found myself laughing loudly again and again. I recommend this picture to anyone, even those who hate foreign films with subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort.
