For those who think that Dame May Witty is the gentle little old lady of Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this film requires an adjustment. Here, it is anything but gently or patty. Instead, her son, George McCready, is the only son. Do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes will light up and there is no cushion furniture in the house safe. Now we know what is going on in his mind for Nina Fuchs trapped if he can get out of under the mother's autocratic hand. <br /> <br /> A very narrow and grainy film of a woman in danger keeps doubts high. The script never bends for the Fuchs dilemma. I was imprisoned in a large Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea. They will kill her, but why. Its impasse is meaningless. Tension mounts as she tries to escape from one trick after another, but even outsiders are against her. We are beginning to feel helpless and insidious madness as the world moves away from them. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis is a great step towards putting the worship into this film and understandable. Then also, Foch watched as he ran skillfully through a series of emotions without passing back on top. Witty also stands out as a really stressful mother who knows what she wants and how she gets it if she can keep her son in a row. My one reservation is a climax that seems very contrived given the timing of events. However, it's a good and exciting way to spend just over an hour at Columbia's complimentary studios.
