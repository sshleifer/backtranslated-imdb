When Braveheart came out for the first time, I felt enchanted, and was recognized as one of the most terrified fans in the film. When Rob Roy came out, I was fascinated, and although I enjoyed the film, I did not think it was a great movie. However, over time, my appreciation of Rob Rui grew, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart dwindled. The Braveheart Entertainment is wonderful, certainly, but there are drawbacks as well. Most important, in my opinion, is the portrayal of Robert Bruce who was undoubtedly Scotland's greatest king. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which distorts the film in proportion to many historical distortions. I think I am also troubled by the fact that in this film, which I have only seen (at least before me) in the past, the beginnings of Mel Gibson's significance can be seen clearly for the first time. In contrast, Rob Rui has grown over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the mistakes that are most reluctant to Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy looks like good wine, and grows more mature and complex with every show.
