I think every time I watch one of those old films from the 1980s, it brings me back at a simpler time, regardless of how much they can appear today. This film is a good idea. I remember seeing him as a small child and I think he was the greatest film ever. He has all the heroic characters that young cowboys want. Now as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I know what is really going on. I found one strange thing. How many people can move to Houston and get in touch with Sissy, get married, move to a trailer, fall, cheat, die their uncle, and then come back together, all within a month? Only in America.
