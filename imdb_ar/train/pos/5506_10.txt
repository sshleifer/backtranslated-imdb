I can not quite understand why any of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0" other than political reasons. No, the film did not achieve the "side" of the story, but certainly one film must be seen in favor of Chavez against the tide of propaganda against him as an attempt to balance the comprehensive narratives (especially given history A. CIA involvement in Latin America in fermenting civil unrest - google National Security Archive and B. Coverage in that country and elsewhere in the scenes clearly counterfeit to Ch√°vez's supporters who shoot opponents who do not exist). The most amazing thing about this film is the fact that filmmakers have stayed in the presidential palace all along the way although the coup - certainly the first in documentary filmmaking - is a coup for both sides !!!
