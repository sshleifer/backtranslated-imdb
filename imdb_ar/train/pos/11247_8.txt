I watched the movie for the first time when it landed on the US cable a year after its introduction. My little head exploded away. I was 16 years old and the first new wave music I heard about, after I was a very strict classic child. The music mesmerized me, as well as the stunning appearance of O'Connor Hazel and the attractive voice presentations, and the director of the Dan Daniels Cockney stole the strong but soft-hearted. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Price, who was anesthetized from Saks. I was out of place in the band and was harmless and pathetic, I just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, performance when the lights go out, the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Well, so the movie is not the rose! But it was really excellent for its limited budget and its portrayal of Britain in the early 1980s, where it exploded with rebellious youth, searching for a way out of the waiting list. I went to Britain only two years later, and found that the film was reflecting the atmosphere I discovered when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, look for it. It's a great movie, with some great performances, and it will melt music. <br /> <br />
