This was the beginning of everything! Granted, these are not friends at their best, but this was a pilot program, let's not forget and not bad at it. We have known the gang and the middle of Burke, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we got a sign of Russell's relationship Rachel that will come over the next ten years, when Ross says: "I just want to be married again" and Rachel inclines with a wedding dress ... perhaps not as intentionally as it was The time was the writers go to the Monica-Joey relationship but they now fit well when looking back. Something else .. In this episode, Rachel was introduced to Chandler as if the two had never met before but in subsequent episodes, contrasted with the so-called "memories of the past" where they met on three previous occasions. However, this point is a good start to a great show. This episode may not be the usual friends because we are used to it. The cast is still very experienced, but during the next few episodes, we see why the show is what it was! Watching, the first season is a blast!
