Watching this again after a gap that lasted for many years and remember the flipping that happened at its original release, I am amazed at how steadfast it is. One of the reasons for her failure was that one generation thought it was over and that the younger generation was disappointed because it did not show the full glory of Hippy. It is now clear that Anthony was already aware and enchanted by the amazing combination of intense enthusiasm for change and the lack of any clear vision for the future. The leading couple are excellent and it is a shame that they were taking a lot of frustration because of the remarkable failure of the film. It is perfect and conveys quite different contradictions and shows pure joy in the practice of love. I blame others on the excessive focus on the student rebellion sequences at first, but I must say that from then on, this is one of the most beautiful directors' pictures and it certainly has the best of human nature made by man. I did not mention until the very end of the explosion.
