BASEketball is actually a really funny film. David Zucker can make us all laugh again, in a really silly comedy, but often. <br /> <br /> The new creators at South Park, the lead actors in this film, are doing very well, surprisingly good in fact, but this is the first time I have seen them. The film often reminded me of South Park - one of the shows of Arab Free Voice. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and really funny, so do not miss it. Rating: 7.5 out of 10.
