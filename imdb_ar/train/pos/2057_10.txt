There was no day in 2002 when I was not bothered by a scarecrow I felt that this film dealt with a very serious issue. <br /> <br /> It brought back a lot of memories because it was very realistic. <br /> <br /> Even today, I have nightmares I can not even get close to canned things in fear of my life. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, at some stage in the film I had to turn him off because he arrived very close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by Scarecrow, by watching this movie, you can learn how your feelings were for us victims <br /> <br /> This movie teaches us not to take a shot As a given or mess with corn, and believe me, I've been there and I have scars <br /> <br /> See the film, her amazing and educational
