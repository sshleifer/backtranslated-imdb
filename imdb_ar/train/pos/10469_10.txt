I remember watching this show before it appeared in 1993. I was eight years old, and now at 22, I feel it's strange to see the beginning of this worship begin and end and look back at it. Suddenly it seems too far, what a great contract. Anyway I've been watching MonsterVision all the time, I'm a big fan of watching monsters and horror movies. It was like the 90 version of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs, why not show Joe Bob, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. It was a lot of Joe Bob's comments and his information about Farhana movies. Most of the films in the show were from B or C, but they showed a lot of A House movies as well as first-class Hammer movies from England and many other films with Ray Harryhausen. Many of them were strange clicks you could not see anywhere else, like Japanese science fiction movies, along with, of course, the almost familiar Godzilla and independent films such as Metal Storm and Motel Hell. While maintaining a new decade of cinema and directors of more independent ideas, I think MonsterVision will be a good show for IFC to be picked up, since it already has a great success at the IFC Grinding House Show. I'm sure this show will be picked up again for reasons of nostalgia to some extent someday, I think we'll have to wait and wait. So then "this great TV"!
