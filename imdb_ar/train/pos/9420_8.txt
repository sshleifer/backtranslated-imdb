The Man in the White Suit is one of those exhilarating comics that Ealing's studies did well in the 1940s and 1950s. This conspiracy follows a man inventing a cloth that does not get dirty or break. Of course, this is a great achievement in the textile world. However, things are not that simple because cloth will threaten the way people live, including clothing manufacturers, labor force workers in the cloth factory, and even an old lady who is washing them every week. "The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific progress and the way they do not always help," says the old woman at some point in the film. "Why can not you just leave the scientists alone?" <br /> <br /> Like many comedy films, Elaine Guinness. Alec Guinness is a wonderful actor. He has the ability to light the screen by his presence (he does it in this film, literally), but he is also able to portray his characters on the ground in a believable way. It is appropriately creepy in this film, and captures the right atmosphere for his character. Intelligent and ambitious, but a naive little world. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit also features Joanne Greenwood, the deep-seated actress who co-starred Guinness in "The Kind Hearts of Crown" and Michael Gough, the man who will continue to be Alfred's role in Batman films. Acting in the film is not always wonderful, but it is always decent, and fits with the film. <br /> <br /> The Man in the White Suit is a smart, thought-provoking, smart comedy with a moral twist. Comedy is not always clear, it does not always work, but the film is not intended to be a film that raises the belly laugh, which can be tolerated. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies.
