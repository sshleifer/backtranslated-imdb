Abby Lincoln's early career was introduced by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen the real Lincoln footage, but Fonda, wearing a fake nose, is not as strange as Lincoln, with sound, delivery, walking and other behaviors - just as one would imagine Lincoln. Ford, in his first three consecutive films with Fonda, is at the top of his career, evoking America in the early 19th century. The story focuses on a Lincoln-accused pair of murder and scenes of the courtroom well. The support team includes many Ford regulars. This was the last film of Alice Brady, where she died months after it was released.
