Jack Frost is really a wonderful film. I mean .... it's funny. Violent. And very fun. Most people say that they have been classified as B, but this can not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good representation. The only strange thing is of course, The Killer Snowman. I think this film was actually one of the best films of the late 1990s. Most movies today lack A Clive Barker Master Piece standards. That is, be original and give the viewer what they do not expect. Jack Frost is so wonderful. 10 of 10. Grade: A +. Ed also recommends Uncle Sam's film to Jack Frost's fans.
