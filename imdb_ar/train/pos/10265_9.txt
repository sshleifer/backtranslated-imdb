A unique film about a confused woman (Lindsay Cross) gets involved with the fraudsters. Joe Mantegna offers an Oscar performance as the best in the group. The first hour is absolutely charming, so the manntegna crosse presents "ropes" in his games. The story of the story unfolds a little later, but it still stands as a unique image of an evil in a dark world. Definitely worth a shot.
