This documentary was broadcast on RTE and BBC in the last month. After watching it twice now, I recommend it to anyone interested in media production and documentaries. <br /> <br /> Initially, this documentary was intended to illustrate the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew embarked on these intentions. What happens when they arrive in Venezuela is astonishing, as they see directly the attempt by the rebel factions (especially Venezuela's oil fears) to oust Chavez and his government. What the public is seeing is just how the media deal with the situation and actually support the overthrow of Chavez by distorting events that are increasing as the coup rises. <br /> <br /> It's a really wonderful documentary. Work by two novice directors. <br /> <br />
