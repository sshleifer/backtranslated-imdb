A unique animated film special for science fiction, frankly I love exclusivity no matter how you tend to be better or worse. This French film is very interesting to watch, and the art part is innovative, such as "Waking Life" which I recently saw. <br /> <br /> It took a very long time to get used to the Black-White style, but in the end I like it, the pictures that look like a graphic are really fantastic! The contracted world of the future is a symbol of the ultimate destination of the human race that I love so much. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is fine for science fiction, not interesting but good, like some Hollywood products, a giant plot about human immortality, small clich√©s and twisted end is not very convincing, some development is very simple and unattractive, The entire film is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think I'm in love with the way that this movie shows, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> About the eternity of life, I think most people have reached a consensus that we do not want eternity because it destroys the meaning of life, we cherish our lives because it is limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, And chaos. Leaving someone you love is difficult and sad, but it is also a way to show our lives, and all feelings satisfy one's life and make the world colorful and vivid.
