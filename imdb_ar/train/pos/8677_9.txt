This film seems to be well remembered when Tom and Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are poetic for a while, but, as expected, they are tense. Perhaps the most memorable moments were the endless battle involving a pipe, a frying pan, a baseball bat in which the two participated in addition to a dog butch at the beginning and end of the short. I enjoyed one and you should try catching up with them on Cartoon Network.
