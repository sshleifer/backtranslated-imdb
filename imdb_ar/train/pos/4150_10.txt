I watch the cold situation because of the real life experiences that were filmed. This person was very close to me and deeply touched, so he was treated beautifully, thank you, Meredith. All characters were developed in 3D, especially Coop. It is still difficult to deal with materials, the United States is far behind the developed countries of the world. Only this kind of sincere experimental imaging and sincere treatment has an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way, but I'm glad that 3/4 of the men polled in less than 30 people voted the same way I did 10. You reach the toughest of them - I'll never keep the "best episode" place for this episode. Please continue to take the opportunity and accept my sincere gratitude.
