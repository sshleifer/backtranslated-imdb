Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T? I'm more like mid to late 70's Ford. This film is my favorite as well as my wife. The first memorable film we saw was as a couple. The car is important as it resembles the first truck that drove it and I recently found another one like it. I want to restore the receipt I should like in the film. The music was fantastic, and the acting was fantastic. Where and what is the lady who photographed John's aunt? Did John also have a double trick for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year Mustang did not Debra W campaign in this show. It looked like the 1960s model. thanks,
