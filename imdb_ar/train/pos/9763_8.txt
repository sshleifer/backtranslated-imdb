Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first film I've ever seen in theaters. My father took my sister and I and the funny thing is - when we got home, we asked my father "What do you want to do now?" We said we wanted to see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! Lol, we actually took my father to the theater to see him again - at least that's what I remember. I was five at the time. <br /> <br /> This film was very scary for a five-year-old. The landscape with the giant ocean of sweets, the scene of hypnotic beauty .. I do not remember much of this film, of course, the beginning was magical, some scenes - I hope to find it again, I will probably look for it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
