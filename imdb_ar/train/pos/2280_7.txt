Hard to categorize the film - perhaps it is a vanguard spy film? Mother Mother is a very good Vonnegut novel, and certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt to a feature film. The film adapts to the very fulfillment of the original book. The "independent" approach to how this film is produced may be more effective than having a large, funded Hollywood studio. These days, I doubt that a smart novel like the Mother of the Night will get the green light from the big Hollywood mills. This is usually very bad, but not in this case. Mother's night has a narrow and solid solid direction. Nick Nolty, who seems to get better roles as he gets older, still has the character of "every man" that allows him to have a wide range of different characters. Cheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought it deserved better than I came out of the entertainment industry. I think that your first appearance as a dead girl (Twin Pix) with little airtime is not the best choice for roles, even if the TV show becomes a simple phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is quite enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the film. In fact, in the light of today's geopolitical realities, the hypothesis of the novel may be dated, and some young viewers who have little knowledge of history will be completely confused by the unfolding events (I talk to you, my American students and the lowest grades in the industrial world in geography and history) Mr. knows what other subjects are!).
