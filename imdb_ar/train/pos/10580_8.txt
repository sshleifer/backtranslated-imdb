Watch this wonderful film knowing that millions have collected 10 cents to see it and forget about the bleak economic conditions of the 1930s. Remember that 10 cents I bought a loaf of bread at the time, so this was a simple luxury for many people. It is a testament to how Hollywood has done its best to make the United States feel better about itself. You will notice that with the studio system in Hollywood at the time, many actors and actresses were represented in similar films, for example James Kenny, William Powell, Robbie Keller, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell, and Guy Keebe. Also, the US military branches were always respected, enthusiastic and patriotic, as was the military precision of the great dancer, Busby Berkeley, in the end.
