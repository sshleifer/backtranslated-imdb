Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people sit (at least people who might do something like that) and talk about Noir. <br /> <br /> However, some of the best films of this genre, "From the Past", "The Killers", "In One Place" and "Night and the City", run a level of sophistication . Which lifts them beyond the words of the catch of moods and their delusions of shadowy shadows, fedora, and dead women. <br /> <br /> "Where the Wharf Ends", a hard-to-find movie - the only version in Manhattan's best video store, largely from the AMC cable channel - belongs to a class with these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black cloud passes through the opening credits, a curtain roams the decaying world of rogue Mark Dixon, and as the moments pass, they grow more intense and choked. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he is "a cop with the dark past", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a dark smile and a turbulent intensity that makes you seem uncomfortable. And yes, he has been wandering around the suspects for too long, being warned by the newly observant president (Carl Malden, a strong walk and leader usually) "for the last time". <br /> <br /> However, Dixon hates these thugs so much that he does not stop now. And the boy did not have them coming? <br /> <br /> "The caps, dust, cups, nickel-machete machete" smiles when that tough nut is eased from the boss and spreads all the complaints the office receives about Dickson's right hook. The advice is to calm down for his own good. But instead takes things into his hands. <br /> <br /> What is the world of hardships he finds when he relies on his instincts, and returns to the nature that may or may not have passed from a previous generation. <br /> <br /> He immediately goes into depth with the police, the union and his partner. Dixon's dubious involvement in the "investigation" of the murder threatens his job, and makes him wonder if it is just a base like those he swore to bring. Like Bogart in Lonely Place, can he "escape what he is?" <br /> <br /> When he has no other place to go, he discovers that he is actually doomed to his unexpected relationship with the beautiful Seraphine (Jean Tierney) who seems to be able to turn the bare-bones into something worth returning home to. <br /> <br /> The speed of this wonderful film is tight and tangled. The group of writers who contributed to the production refined the text in a highly flamboyant style - a stinging dialogue without disintegrating into a dated, passionate, parody spoof without becoming melodramatic or happy. <br /> <br /> All this trend and first-rate acting are not very clever or compact to ease the emotional grip of the film. Jamal Terney's soft angelic beauty is used to focus heavily. She shows herself to be a large-scale actress, and her gentle, gentle nature is as limitless here as psychosis in "Let her go to heaven." The scenes between Turney and Dickson from Andrews are intensely intensified and the closest it seems to destroy himself. <br /> <br /> Near the end of his rope, Dixon cut, bruised and overworked: "Innocent people can get into the terrible bottlenecks too." "One wrong step and you're in your head." <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes this movie quite convincing is the feeling that things can go badly for almost everyone - especially for someone trying hard to do it right - with a slight shift in the wind or one wrong decision or Punch, or, frighteningly, because of factors you do not have control over. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. "Where the pavement ends" does so in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (Select one from the side: This movie contains a bright blonde from a blonde model that does not appear in the Mystery Science Theater. heck, any of the movie lovers - who have never seen this one in great fun.
