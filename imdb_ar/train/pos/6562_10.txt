Simply the best reality ever made. The first two seasons (the only one that matters) are in Hulu. I challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of Season 1 and I do not like it. I guarantee you will finish watching the season. And then make sure you watch Season 2. <br /> <br /> There are other quick reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is fun 2. Locations in Europe are great 3. Games are full of mental challenges 4. It's very difficult to interact 5. In one episode, The player responds to another player's desperation, "I try as hard as I can!" With equally desperate, "not necessarily". <br /> <br /> You can tell ... Who is the mole?
