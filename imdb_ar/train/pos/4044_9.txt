I found this movie to be in very good shape. The premise is quite innovative, and as a viewer, I was drawn with the evolution of characters. The steps are performed very well for those who like to think - a sufficient number of scenes are hidden early, questions remain fresh and are answered later, producing a very thoughtful and satisfying film, both mentally and from a point of view. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to be looking for a nonstop flight with this movie - one of those who come to ship out the gate. This will be more like one of those coasters that takes you slowly up to the top of the hill - creating a wonderful sense of expectation - and ultimately, in my opinion, more pleasing to the institution initially set up. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
