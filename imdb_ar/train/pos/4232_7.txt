At 60, I learned that when we watch a film, there is a definition (whether we want it or not) implicitly for a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because a person performs a certain gesture, sometimes because the person speaks of a word or phrase? Which we use or would like to use? In determining the situation. <br /> <br /> The movie in question should be viewed from this point of view. Who now find a place to park? In a mall, in the city center or on the street - was taken by a car whose driver can not remember that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who did not want to? "Heven said:" A malicious spit? <br /> <br /> Haven said I was asking: Did you deal with Della (played by Kim Basinger)? If your answer is: Yes! , Try not to find ridiculous details? Relatively with real life? In the film, you will surely find the film ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Abstractions, you will see that the movie has sudden moments, such as: 1 - in the sequence in which Dila holds the box of tools in the box (does this box contains a pistol, and does it stimulate the courage to use it?); In the sequence in which Terry dies during the fall; 3 - in the sequence in which Della is attracted to the "Mermaid Appeal" of Chuckie. <br /> <br /> If you've already watched the movie, or are planning to watch, keep in mind that there are "real" movies, "fiction" movies, "political" movies, and "wash your soul" movies? To illustrate the latter example, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the newspaper, there was unanimous applause when BOPE officials took certain positions. (As I saw the movie in the DVD, I could not confirm the public reaction)? <br /> <br /> As for the direction part (Susan Munford), interpretations (Kim Basinger, Lucas Haas, Craig Schaeffer, etc. William M. Anderson? 'Dead Poets Society', 'Green Card'? ? Exceptional edition, 'Robocop 2', etc. It is well positioned in context. On a scale of 1 (awful) to 10 (Master Piece), I rate "when I was outside" 7 (regular).
