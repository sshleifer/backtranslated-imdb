This episode of the first season is slightly trending towards disagreement with the angle of bending between the entire sexes. I imagine that there was a lot of editing before finishing this to appease censorship. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and completes the output through good acting. (Nicholas Lea X-Files debut though not as a Krycek client but as a victim called Michael) I particularly enjoyed the end and end on her own. <br /> <If it's different and fun, ignore any bad notes you might hear. See it yourself and make a decision
