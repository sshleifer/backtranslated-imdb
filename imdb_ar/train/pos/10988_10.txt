Do not read anything about this movie (especially anything that can contain any spoilers). Watch this great movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll get a really great experience. If you want to see a clever twisted story: Go and get a DVD and you will not really be disappointed. The film "Cypher" is not a fictional film in fact, it is a self-centered horror film in a globalized business environment. It's about company secrets, how big companies spy on other research departments and the methods they use. The actors perform wonderfully and provide the overall visual style of the film an ideal setting for cold. Cypher is much deeper and more complex - what is the story and the end - and also much more satisfied than other Vincenzo Natali films "Cube" and "Nothing". In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I'm not really saying about every fifth click made well). Sorry, you can not tell you anything more about this movie without risking harming your experience. Just give him a chance. ;-)
