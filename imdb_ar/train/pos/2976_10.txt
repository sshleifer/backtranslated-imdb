For comedy, this contains a decent and innovative plot, and the timing of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments for this wonderful movie. I especially like the many colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes. Robert Stacks Mysteries Secrets Parody is also very entertaining.
