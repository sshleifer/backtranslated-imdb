Although it was designed quite differently from Tim Krabb√©, who wrote the original "The Vanishing" (Spoorloos), he has the same general feeling, except that Koolhoven's style is less businesslike and richer. The starters are fantastic, the middle is okay, but the sting is at the end. Emotional surprise ends. As you can read in many magazines, there is some sex in the film, but everything is very beautifully done. Never express, but with a lot of warmth and sometimes humor. It is shameful that American films can not be as open as this one. Where Dutch films tend to go beyond the edge when it comes to this subject, "De Grot" always remains within the limits of taste. "De Grot" tells an amazing story spanning more than 30 years. When you leave the cinema, you will be taken. What can I ask more than a movie? Anyway, this movie gives more ....
