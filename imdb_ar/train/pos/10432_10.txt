I must admit that at first, I was reluctant to watch this movie. I thought it was this stupid and little romantic film about a French woman met on an American train and decided to visit Vienna with him. I was not fascinated by this kind of text, because it kept making me believe it was just a film. Still, I watched it! I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dared to speak in a somewhat philosophical way. I wonder about the fact that at the moment of our birth, we were sentenced to death, or an intermediate idea of ​​the fact that the couple should settle together Forever, or that, we humans, we can sometimes bear to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was nicely chosen (we do not know if they will meet again within six months, at 6 o'clock, at the Vienna station) - in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. The actors acted very well, so I began to think that I personally could live a love story like this.
