This film revolves around the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first years as King of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> "The Young Victoria" has an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated for pure details. Luxurious costumes, luxury sites and landscaped gardens all make "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was more than amazed by the studied cinematic photography. How each person is placed in relation to the background or foreground, each scene is prepared well. The most surprising scene was when Victoria spoke with Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the middle of the door frame from the corner of Victoria, while Melbourne's angle was between the space where Melbourne held his arm on the hips. <br /> <br /> The story is wise, so compressed that it is followed and understood by a person without the historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or even clearer. I was expecting a great sight for the coronation, and the disappointment that it lasted only for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In general, "The Young Victoria" is a good film, and it would have been better if it had been longer, so that events can be properly explained without the rush.
