This is simply the most amazing film you'll ever see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it's really something else. Do not try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the quality of the images, because you clearly know from other comments that they are unmatched. <br /> <br /> The land is funny, tense and sad. Can make you laugh, can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first film that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you have realized how fragile our planet is and what treasure we have blessed, yet we do not appreciate it a bit. /> <br /> This movie must be mandatory in schools. It's the best movie you ever see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe the last time we see our planet like this ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I'll set it up more easily if possible.
