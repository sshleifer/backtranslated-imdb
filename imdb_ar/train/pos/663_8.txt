I've seen this episode more than any other TFTC episode, it's very fun. This is very scary, but all in good fun. A woman kills her second husband but faces a problem when the frantic freak decides on one of Santa Claus's distressed clothes to pay her and her little daughter a visit at that very moment. Mary Traynor, whom I seem to remember from the SNL or from a comedy sitcom, is the evil wife, and Larry Drake plays the role of madness in Santa's huge clothes. You've forgotten Santa played by Drake over the years. Santa is an unstoppable and very frightening force at times. Maybe you can guess how Santa finally enters the house. The loop is played for laughter, but it may be severe at times.
