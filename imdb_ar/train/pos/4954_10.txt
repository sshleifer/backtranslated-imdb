A wonderful and funny film with Morgan Freeman (playing) and meets a Spanish girl called Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while searching for a possible independent film. I was a bit skeptical about the film in the first 10 minutes, but once I was in the store, I really started to enjoy the film. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not contain any complex pieces and is easy to follow but it upsets the mood and makes you smile all the time without the need for a trivial romance. It includes many scenes along the way that make you cling to your side with laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
