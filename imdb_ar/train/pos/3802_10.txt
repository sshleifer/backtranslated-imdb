Dragon Hunters must be the best animated film I have ever seen. It was the jaw drop. The movie revolves around a couple of scammers who are looking for some cash, and the strange angry blue dog that ignites the fire, and a girl dreams of becoming a knight, and is sent to try to go to the ends of the earth to kill the gobbler world, But frankly, it does not matter what the film is about. Because it's gorgeous jaw. Gravity in this fantasy world is different, so the architecture blocks and land areas float amidst cathedrals, castles and villages alike, and there are forests of floating lily pads. The world is very creative, uniquely beautiful, with a kind of silent short stories. The world is like a collection of wonderful paintings. The monsters are also amazing, like a fire dragon which consists of a group of evil red bat. Some conspiracies are not very original, like the main protagonists who want their farm from mice and men and do not seem to be able to make them in the world; but the wonderful graphics, some seriously evil scenes, and emotional dialogue make this film amazing.
