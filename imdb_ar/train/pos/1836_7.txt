Time for defeat! <br /> <br /> Time of Deir-Vibol Amirtalal Shah Cast - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shivali Shah, Rajbal Yadav and Booman Iranian. Written by - Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We've got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, in the film "shameless" for Vipul Shah, we probably found the first big success this year. Filled with all the necessary ingredients for a Bollywood commercial fare, the "time" has everything it takes for a movie to click with Indian audiences. It's a kinda movie that makes the distributor feel happy and think about his next visit! In this "Indian sentiment" then, we have a happy family (not always) of three. Ishvar (Amitabh Bachchan), a postman who turned into a millionaire (do not ask how! ... There is something about selling games while delivering messages and all that seriously - which gives damn!), Married to Sumy (Shivali Shah) Drips to Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishvar must make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude toward life responsibilities. His love for Aditya leads to procrastination for the serious cause. However, when faced with a situation that will test its race against time, Ishvar has no alternative but to get Aditya out of the house in the hope that the new predicament will make him more conscientious than his life. But this supposed solution becomes a problem in itself, where the dispute between the father and the beloved son grows and the walls continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story offers great opportunities for both comedy and drama. So, before the interval, you initially had a funny comic track and later annoyed Iranian pomegranate and Rajbal Yadav; and the post-interval period there are handkerchief moments between Abby and Aki! The writer Aatech Kabadia (who also coined the original Gujarati play "Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu" on which the film is based) does a good job of preserving narrative fluids. Dialogues sometimes tend to conflict. It does not help to show songs such as acne on the face of a teenager and deformation procedures. Obviously two numbers have been eliminated. On the front of the output, Vipul explains that he has a natural taste for storytelling. 'Waqt', as well as his first effort earlier 'Aankhen', managed to keep you interested until the last reel. In a personal note - the swing of emotions was jerky for me. But through public reactions, it worked to the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, "time" is all about its performance that reaches one point in the total rating! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable as always. His energy is clear as well as his age! Shivali is characterized by its precise performance and matching the star at every step. Bowman and Rajbal bring home at the bottom of history. Priyanka does not have much to do to achieve the heroic role of the heroine. When it comes to the whole thing, "pause" is the Akshay car. I have always stressed that Akki is as good as his role. Put it in "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" which is wonderful, but in "Bewafaa" it is very bad. Here, Aki may be at his best. Whether it's humorous timing or emotional behavior, it's almost perfect. There is also a scene of movement for his fans! Ironically, his best previous endeavors were in "Aankhen" with the same director and Big B next to him! <br /> <br /> "Waqt" is by no means an unforgettable film. It's not the one that will showcase the best films in our industry. But it is one of the masses. While the industry is desperate for global success, Time may do the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia - This is the second sequel to Akshay Kumar's sequel after "Bewafaa", which leads him on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Rating-*** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> 22 April 2005
