The main problem I see in this film is its result, which screams every note, "This is a cheap film." There is not much to say here. The result is only absorbed. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I see as very intense, and involves deciphering the plot near the end of the film (one of the financial shots, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrian Barbo) ), Where it turns out that Martha is the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue, the viewer realizes that he is listening to a film dialogue. In other words, the suspension of infidels collapses here. A reasonable dialogue between two people is sacrificed to fill the information that filmmakers want to convey to the public. <br /> <br /> The third problem is the casting of Adrian Barbou. While I honestly believe that she is a wonderful actress in her sorrows, I feel that this part may be too much. The main point in her seemingly unconnected performance was the spectrum in which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to a woman who resembles Rambo almost on a mission. Obviously this aspect of the scenario may be an extension of any actor, and Barbie can not be blamed. To the extent that it did its part fairly efficiently, however, I would like to call this film only a fairly moderate problem. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film did a great job in the first half building. The creeping factor, most notably during terror flashes. I feel that the film would have benefited more from adhering to these donations as a mechanism to prevent the creep from stumbling in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> What is my overall assessment of this piece? I will give it a solid C + B mark, depending on the amount of credit you tend to give filmmakers to this film with a limited budget. Even with two serious problems and rather severe problems, the film is based on a solid foundation of the Ghani side of Nazi mysticism. I do not see any problems in developing plot or cohesion; dialogue, with the exception referred to above, is absolutely wonderful in places, especially the important cornerstone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the film; as we mentioned, the crawling worker was well made, Second; Nicholas Brendan, who also participated in the production, gave a wonderful presentation. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie deserves to be seen for sure - see it with a Nazi you like. :)
