Brian Yozna has worked on an unequal career in this kind of horror, creating masterpieces such as "The Return of the Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator," but at the same time he made horror films such as "Faust: Love for the Curse" or " "He said. He is clearly the best in the product seat where his work in the production of Stuart Gordon films was wonderful. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is one of his less important works as a director, but the low character of the film and its lack of excuses make it a very enjoyable experience. The film tells the story of Dr. Alan Finston (who played brilliantly Corbin Berenson), a successful dentist who once discovered that his ideal life is not as perfect as he thought when he discovered that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) had an affair with the boy pool. This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree and he avenges the world for being "dirty". <br /> <br /> Hypothesis is very well enforced by Yuzna, because it takes us on a journey after a day of revenge. What makes this film different from most replicas is that we are not in the victim's perspective, we follow Feinstone because it is the main character. We see how he moves from professional respect to psychological killing in a day. Yuzna was able to give the film a certain amount of suspense, but it adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the success of the hypothesis lies in Bernsen's performance like Feinstone. It can make you feel sympathy and hate at the same time, and the nice humor of his character is another aspect of the film. The rest of the crew is not good, and I think their sub-representation hurts the film too much. The notable exception is Ken Furey, where the detective tries to catch up with Fenston. Although his role is very small, he does a wonderful job with him. <br /> <br /> With a dentist as a killer, the famous scenes are expected to be presented, and Bryan offers a large SFX weighing in the right value. It's good to see that it does not outperform as it usually does, and I dare say that this is the highlight of the film. It contains an accurate amount of expected, neither less nor more. Yuzna himself adjusts to his common transgressions and the result is brilliant. <br /> <br /> Although this is not among the most famous Yuzna films, I would say that it is one of his best films. Certainly, it is not a classic material like its masterpieces, but it is a movie that is entertaining, never boring and never boring. It's a simple film with a low budget, but for what it is, I think it shook. 10/07
