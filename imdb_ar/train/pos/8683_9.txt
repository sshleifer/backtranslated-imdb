"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the early episodes of "Columbo" that helped define the show over the next 30 years. This marks the first appearance of Robert Kolb (three as a murderer), playing the same role in every show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Colp plays the role of Bremer, the head of the large private detective company, who asked him to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper tycoon, Mr. Kennicott, was having an affair. Although it is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, hoping to be able to blackmail his wife in exchange for extracts from information about her husband's business partners. She is reacting badly to this proposal, an argument that quickly turns into violence as Bremer strikes her across the face. Because he is wearing a large ring, hit by a blow to the ground and killed. <br /> <br /> There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is where Colombo pretends to be in palmistry, although this is actually a trick to discover the shape and size of a Bremer ring without acknowledging that he knows the killer was wearing a ring. Being Colombo is Colombo, it only reveals what it really knows when the time is perfectly right to turn the noose a bit. So initially, he plays an unpleasant role as a somewhat simple man, somewhat excited by the "lifeline that passes over the moon hill", or some mumbo-jumbo that ridicules palm reading. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful sight is when Bremer tries to offer Colombo a job for his company, effectively bribing him to stop crushing his nose. Once again, Colombo does not know that he knows what is going on, he pretends to be proud and excited by this work. <br /> <br /> There is another Colombo saying to Kenecott, in front of Bremer, that he wishes the killer to hear their conversation. He wants to point out to Bremer that he is his own, without accusing him directly, so he decides cruelly (but understandable under these circumstances) to play the mind on Bremer in order to push him to panic and do something stupid. And of course he does! However, the sad Kenicott does not know about the sub-text of this conversation. It is only close to the end, Colombo explains everything to Kinyakut (not on display). <br /> <br /> I will not reveal how Colombo finally brought out the killer for rights, but let's just say there is a potato in question. .. <br /> <br /> A really good episode, probably the best episode in the first series. If you like this, you'll also experience Double Exposure, as Robert Culp shows.
