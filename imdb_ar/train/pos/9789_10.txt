The story is listed seamlessly. There is no break. The appearance of the flash is now seamlessly woven. It was a wonderful casting. Yara looked young like Yara looked at this age. Filmed for a blindly disguised person. Director Daniel Serkin has done a great job in urging various actors to work together in this story. Cinematography is very good. You feel with Y'ara and Talia walking towards the ocean to the edge of the abyss. English translations follow the Hebrew text closely. It is interesting to note that although "out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin", both names are very appropriate for the story.
