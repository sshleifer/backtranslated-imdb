A wonderful comedy starring Marianne Davis (with the kind William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood seeking stardom. Cameo shows "All Stars in the Sky of MGM" in the famous delegate scene, as well as many old films that provide details for the researcher. Pick also picks up the image of the famous, cynical actors from Davis for the best stars of the day (her Swanson is beautiful!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy", until she catches herself facing the famous star Marianne Davis in tennis, lifts her nose and hangs up, "Oh, I do not like her!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. Story, direction, representation and real magic are necessary for all silent afficinados.
