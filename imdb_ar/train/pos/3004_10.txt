Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve the many murders among wealthy people after showing dogs. <br /> <br /> I usually hate very complex puzzles (like this) but I like this movie. He moves very quickly (72 minutes only), beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (uses tons of camera tricks that speed up narration only), has a very ingenious story story (including a solution to kill a closed room that was just incredible) and has a very good team . <br /> <br /> Powell was as polite and wonderful as Vance - he does not seem to be acting - he is Vince! Mary Astor did not get much to do but added class and beauty to production. Everyone is also very good, but most of all is Eugene Pallet as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice, and some of his lines were joyful. <br /> <br /> Basically, the Hollywood homicide mystery is excellent in the 1930s. deserve watching. <br /> <br />
