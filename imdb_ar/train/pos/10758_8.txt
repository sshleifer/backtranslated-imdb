9/11 is a classic example of real cinema, a kind of realistic documentaries, in this case a firefighter in New York fighting against one of the most unusual events in world history. All these are small, unobtrusive and portable video cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most movies (and on the part of the director, Naudet scans the screen frequently). <br /> <br /> In this film, you know most of the firefighters - Tony Benatos, the rookie (or "probie" in the New York firefighter), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who later found his brother lost) Few others. There are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasize the personal nature of the events. The compositions are very exciting and well done, especially the liquidation ceremony in the fire department, with a few interesting catapults and a kind of controversial editing of fairly limited cinematic works (just like Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men). Tony seems proud. <br /> <br /> The view and the camera angle are usually from the middle of the firefighters. This is interesting and there are some excellent shots from within the WTC1 lobby, while Beverly and his team plan what they should do next - this is really classic cinema. There is also a loud noise that strikes the casual human body that collides with the outer hallway. Then Fifefer Fire Schiff realizes that his job is desperate and perhaps desperate - and this is before the collapse of WTC2. You should give credit to Naudet to see which faces will be photographed at any moment. <br /> <br /> The sound of the nearby WTC2 collapse is so sad, painful and terrifying that you realize what this firefighter is all about. From the lobby, it looks and feels like the end of the world, and the poor firefighters seem quite perplexed and scared. You hear a huge, trembling drug - like that giant, interconnected monster slowly falling to the ground after a fatal injury - the nearby tower collapsed, but the remaining WTC1 fire brigade is oblivious to the event. Where is communication? <br /> <br /> This captivating film however, the narrative is amateurish and should be avoided - the cues like "This was really unmatched" or Naudet's often familiar statements such as "You can see fear in the eyes of everyone" and "I knew Tony was afraid!" The film is a long video diary. There are no pictures from the top of the building where some firefighters went. Imagine this movie mixed with CCTV cameras from some of the higher rooms or some news coverage of the day. The effect will be greater. You can even combine this story with the story of Mayor Giuliani and perhaps the famous Riccardella Corniche who was literally composed of several floors acting as a hero. <br /> <br /> I do not see much of the publicity element in this film, as some critics suggest. This film is not a triumph of will, by Rivensthal. Shortly thereafter, firefighters pulled the American flag out of a nearby building that overlooks what became the land of zero. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also some moments of dubious photography; for example, who holds the camera when Naudet's two brothers are gathered at the fire station? Was it displayed? <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful ending, largely in the tradition of the excellent French director Alan Reynes (Hiroshima Mon Amor), with two strips of light reflected in the water, sparkling.
