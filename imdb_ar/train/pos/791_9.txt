With no knowledge of this film before watching it on Rialto, I found it a wonderful, moving and enriching film. <br /> <br /> The casting process was excellent. I loved all the characters, I was a little overrated in some places, (but this is a movie). The way it looked and the fun ride taken by the main character even turned out badly, as real life can do. Yes, I thought Andy McDowell was fantastic. I was particularly interested in watching this film as soon as it started because people often flirted with their acting abilities (I find this very strange because they are always a strong actress in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I liked that ending when Andy's character said, "Sometimes I feel like he's never been here." And so, it was exactly like this (which I can personally identify), and then there was that classic piece Brilliant "quiet music" I think through Chopin, which was a nice way to finish (preventing the light comedy in the end, which probably was not necessary). <br /> <br /> I say "well done" to filmmakers - I've seen 1000 s of the worst movies!
