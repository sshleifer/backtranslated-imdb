Plot: The crime master unites 3 different mafia in a trading company to buy an island, which would serve as a money laundering facility for organized crime. To thwart this, the FBI is trying to bankrupt a mafia boss. Something went wrong, and with some possible twists and turns, a "Policeman's Friends" do not like each other. One is an FBI agent and the other is a former drug control officer. <br /> <br /> So far, very stupid. But the power of this film does not lie in his story - a poor joke, at best. It's funny. (At least the simultaneous German version is). The work is good, too, with an unforgettable scene involving shotgun and rocket launcher. But focus directly on humor. Not a smart spelling, not a quick hymn, but somewhere, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. Substantial drug abuse appears prominently, without criticism, and is so well presented. This is part of the film that annoyed me very much, and made it unsuitable for children, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, to spend a nice evening come with an acceptable procedure with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: In this type, it is common to leave your mind at the door when you enter the movie / TV room. Then you will have a good time. 10/08
