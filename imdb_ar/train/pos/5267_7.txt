Apparently, Rogoiro Diodato, early on, discovered that his story would not work if he approached her very seriously, so he decided to hide it. The result is a film that can be seen either as an exciting epic for the sword and magic or as a very entertaining comedy! I think I'll go the other way. Short moments of good gravitation, Paul Brothers mocks the material openly (even barking at each other in one scene!), And there is also a charming, lively performance of Eva Roo, as a girl who signs along with the "boys". Plus, anywhere else can you see inside the dragon lighting like a disco? (***)
