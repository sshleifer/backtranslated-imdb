What a fantastic fantasy film, Stardust. <br /> <br /> I can easily end it with this one statement and suffice to say, one can consider it as a very strong recommendation to see it. <br /> <br /> While Hollywood is determined to force the re-production and encircling our throats, Stardust makes us remember why we went to the cinema in the first place - to escape reality for a few hours and explore the lives of others, at other times, or Other planets. Ironically, Stardust takes us to all three places without any trouble and with a childhood joy that we all miss. <br /> <br /> Stardust is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and villains. It contains strife that suffers from distress, heroism, theft, obstacles, lethargy, antidote, magic, and even a touch of light speed to make it almost modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" revolves around a man from the town of the wall, which is located next to the wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom. The only way behind the wall is through the ass that is guarded hard by the pesky old coder (played superbly by David Kelly). One day a young man from Wall called Ben Barnes maneuvering the old guard and escaping through the rear. It happens in a charming kingdom called Stormhold where a young woman meets (and is very sexy) called Ona. She was captured by a witch and made an unbreakable series. While the witch is away, Una Ben tempts him and sends him on his way. Ben returns to the wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later, he was called to the wall, where the old guard handed over what you might expect - a baby. <br /> <br /> The boy named Tristan grows up to be a sad young man (Charlie Cox) who is fined by a girl who goes out of his patrol and addresses her to another. However, the young woman (named Victoria and play Sienna Miller) graduated once with Trieste and admits his love for her. After they incarnate a falling star, you tell him that he can get it if the star gets back and returns it. He agrees and begins his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> At the same time in the Kingdom of Sturmold, the old king (played by Peter Ottol) dies. He invites his remaining sons to tell them who will succeed him on the throne. The names of his sons are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. The other children killed by other brothers in the comic contest to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> Anyway, his sapphire charm is aimed at the sky and voila, and that's what brings the star to Earth. <br /> <br /> The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Evin (Claire Danis) who, of course, wears magic. But she knows nothing about the fact that she is now convinced by Tristin, the princes, and also an old age called Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) wants to cut the heart of the stars to restore her youth. <br /> <br /> Complex? Yes really. But it all comes with the advent of adventure. <br /> <br /> Tristin is the first to discover Yvaine but is very blind because of his devotion to Victoria, he does not recognize the growing connection between him and Yvaine. His initial interest lies only in the return of Evin to Victoria as evidence of his love. But he must go beyond the princes and Lamia first. Princes are not a big cause because they are constantly trying to kill each other - and as in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death was never funny. <br /> <br /> But Tristin also faces a witch who has enslaved his mother (although he does not know she is his mother) and a group of flying pirates led by Robert Dineiro. <br /> <br /> His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays out to the tee. He steals the film hard and soon we learn secret secret will leave the masses on the ground with laughter. Although his role is small in length, only that DeNiro gorgeous! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is as wonderful as Lamia - an exciting evil witch. Claire Dance is the most appropriate because Evin is confused and painful. It makes the girl perfect. Jason Fleming, Adam Boston, Robert Everett, and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of magnificence as warrior emperors, dying as ghosts like "Blithe Spirit" and "high spirits". <br /> <br /> The director Matthew von, who was His other experience in directing is "Layer Cake", a charming tale that everyone enjoys. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" may be very complex for young children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie several times. This is a good "Stardust" is what the films are supposed to be. Perfectly written, completely cast, completely directed, and acted perfectly. In other words ... perfect.
