I have beautiful memories of this film, as I saw it with my younger sister when it first appeared in 1977 and I was eight years old. It was clearly a failure - almost forgotten (the public video and scan - which never worked with the picture or the ambitious Panavision combination is now not printed). The film is very embellished (shadows YELLOW) submarine) admitted uneven. Some characters and series are wonderful, others are rather casual and somewhat distinctive. The sad blue camels neglected (shades of Eeyore) and his blue songs are really sad. Joe Raboso's songs are mostly beautiful. Surely a curious curiosity may (regrettably) be in full ambiguity.
