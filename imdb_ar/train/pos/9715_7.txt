Here it is slim, it looks like this is older then I thought it was. But it is still cool. Mechs cool bike and story mostly work. There are some problems related to the characters that I hope will succeed in solving them through Part 2 and my biggest complaint of all it seems is that MACROSS has stopped. Not only cartoon style but many character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY from MACROSS. Mechs look similar to macros as well as other characters. This is not really for young children, it contains graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. Even the shortest story long, I give this brilliant idea to MACROSS in 7 stars.
