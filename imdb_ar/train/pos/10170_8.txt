In complete contrast to other reviews, this film was surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see her and I expected to be bored of the cliches and obvious and exaggerated jokes, which all of them promised. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes I found myself laughing and enjoying the thrill of acting. With just one toilet gap, Over Her Dead Body managed to come up with realistic scenarios, and without spoiling anything too much, some moments involving gay animals. <br /> <br /> The basic ingredients of a good movie are all there. Screenplay, director, actors and comparison of some recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands long. <br /> <br /> Certainly, you will not learn anything or wake up spiritually, but if you go with an open mind, you will probably have a fun time!
