I was recently looking for a recent widescreen DVD from FLY AWAY HOME, and got an interesting title I've never heard of before: GRAY OWL. My attention caught the fact that it was the film of Richard Attenborough (he is responsible for great films like Gandhi, Chaplin and Shadow Land). I noticed that the script was written by William Nicholson (author of Shadow Lands). This "special edition" was full of interesting sounding material and the price was less than $ 10.00 - so I met and bought it. Wonderful! What a beautiful film. Pearce Brosnan plays Arctic Gray, the real life hunter of the 1930s who came to love and respect Canada's wild land and help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in James Bond) performs as shaded, warm and powerful as Annie Gallipo did, like the young woman she loves and influences his feelings for the creatures of the earth - especially the beaver. The good outcome of the CRUCIBLE and the wonderful photographs of Robert Pratt greatly add to the effectiveness of the film. The extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two ribbons made in the 1930s with the real Gray Owl as well as audio clips by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 features. And many other great add-on options for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL was launched directly on DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that is not a lot of violence and sex. It's a film that not only teaches Wesley but leaves you something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the conclusion of the movies - a completely new love and understanding of the beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie - worth checking out! This is one I look forward to sharing with others.
