Kenneth Branagh "Hamlet" hits all the signs. The gorgeous acting, 70-mm film is superb, the fashion and Oscar nominations for the stunning Oscars, and the degree of Patrick Doyle (also nominated for the Oscars) are sensitive and touching. Oh yeah - script, by someone named Will S., not too bad too. Critics criticized the filmmaker for receiving the fourth Oscar for films for "adapting" the script, but his decision to use the full text was a brave decision. I can not think of many of the best ways to make four hours fly by. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision taken by Pranaj works brilliantly: the use of the English Blenheim Palace for exteriors, the Edwardian dress, and the organization of "be or not" in the Mirror Hall, to name a few. Distracting Hollywood stars such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemon in simple parts can distract attention, but that's great. The main actors excel: Derek Jacoby captures the conflicting nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet vividly depicts Ophelia's descent into madness. Julie Christie brings emotion to her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Breyers is just as perfect as Polonius and Nicholas Farrell elevates the role of Horacio to be sure to form a true friendship. Every speech, every line and every word is thrown with enthusiasm and conviction; there is no lost moment in the entire film. The final scenes magnified the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in an impossible way through theatrical alterations. <br /> <br /> Hamlet Branagh's attempt is bold, ambitious and ultimately successful to match the greatness and poetry of Shakespeare's language with both eloquent images. Can you say that Shakespeare's greatest adaptation ever portrayed? Strong praise, but well-deserved.
