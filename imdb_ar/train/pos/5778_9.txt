Despite the limitations on its budget, this wonderful film, evidence that the effort and imagination can overcome the lack of funds. Openness, in which cave paintings show how some dinosaurs survived at least in the age of humans, is a nice red hymn. After that, a meteor comes down to a lake and causes heat, which in turn causes hatching of frozen dinosaur eggs (cave paintings may indicate that this is not the first time something like this has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-moving plysiosaur and causes disappearances in the local area soon. Well, so it is not the Jurassic Park, but it is still a real amusement for lovers of monster movies.
