She was gently and smartly played by two young girls, Misha Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe in the role of Hazel, although the plot is an extension of the imagination. Hazel, who is running for mayor, seems to be misplaced. <br /> <br /> While acting is well done by all concerned, the film tends to lack a real atmosphere of drama. Maybe grown to expect a really terrible reality in movies, such as comparing Pollyanna and how it was Green Valley! It does not matter, each one of them is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Blright even if her role is rather weak here. Midway entertainment is quite suitable for young viewers, and their occasional exposure to high class classical music is almost rare! <br /> <br /> I find this film a welcome change because it reflects calm, thoughtful values ​​for years to grow up, and no violence thank God. A warm family movie to enjoy it.
