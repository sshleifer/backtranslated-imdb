I recently read "The Mother of the Night," I've owned the DVD for some time now, and I watch it a lot. The little films I have and watched have made me think and ask as much as it was a mother's night, I was amazed by the brilliance not only of Vonnegut, but of translating its text into the screen. <br /> <br /> Should you not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it should be done on a DVD, and it must be accompanied by the output of the movie. To see how they took a fairly simple story, complex in its content and dialogue and made it work well, I think any viewer will be astounded. <br /> <br /> The omissions in the film are few of the text, and do not detract greatly from it. The film may also be the book, and it is the best adaptation I have ever seen. I highly recommend both book and film together that it is a shame to just say watch it. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do.
