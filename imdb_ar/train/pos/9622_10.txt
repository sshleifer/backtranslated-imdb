I watched this movie at Showtime. Quite by chance actually. If I only have 6 hours of sleep during the last couple of days, I will not be back home early. If I had not come home early from work I would not have seen this film. I did not know what I was missing, but I missed so much. <br /> <br /> This is how this movie is made. She plays almost the influence of Kevin Bacon. That's causal (and hence my elaboration above). The personality is ever intertwined in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is awesome I will find a copy to buy.
