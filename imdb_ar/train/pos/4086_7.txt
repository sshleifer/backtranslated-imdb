Wonderful. Ohm ... Well ... wow! I think I will start the plot. Lucy, who is waiting for the arrival of the bishop, the Cardinal or anyone else in the Catholic Church to marry them (to please the will). Meanwhile, Lucy is known for the legend of a monster who wandered the earth centuries ago . In bed that night, I began to imagine a monster and a rape attempt that turned into a consensus with the former lady at home. This is where you get it interesting! The plot is very thin (and it seems to last for a long time in the middle of the click), but the director rewards (?) Those who stick to it by the end of a horrible and fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for a great cinema, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a remote film about the Behemoth (a closer look at the subject), this movie is right for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it.) Outside of some horse-drawn actions at the beginning, "verbs" are beautiful caricatures, IMO
