I first saw Martin's day when I was only 10 years old, at home, on the movie channel, and I still remember the impact it has had on my life. I was touched because no other film touched me, and I remember that my eyes were caught. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw it, I could not find it anywhere else. I was asking around and no one heard about the film! I think it was one of those rare films that many people did not know, because no one, no one, knew what I was talking about. I have searched and searched over the years and have checked out the shelves of video stores and scan cable TV listings, but I've always been limited. Finally, in 1996, I discovered that I could ask her in particular, and I did, and I have seen her at least 50 times since then - and it still makes me cry, every time. <br /> <br /> Martin's day is Martin Stikert, a man in prison (but already a good man), who longs to be brought back to the private lake where he grew up as a boy. This was a special place, where he lived outside nature, spent time with his dog, and left alone to enjoy life. Shortly after the film, he escapes and begins to return to the lake. <br /> <br /> It was not long before the police found him, and Stickett holding a child hostage to convince the police to respond. turning off. Soon, Stikert and his friend Martin II became friends and had a lot of fun together - stealing a toy truck, taking a train, all on the way to this private lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Steckert has great memories of him in the lake as a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the end for you, but I will tell you that this movie is a must. It's the best film I have ever seen! I'm by far the biggest fan of this film ever! I managed to find Martin's song throughout the film ("I'll go back to where I came from ...") I even plan on a trip to Canada to see the lake and the cabin where Martin was filmed. For me.
