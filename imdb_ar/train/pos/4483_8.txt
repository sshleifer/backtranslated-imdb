Everything must be a musical comedy. Do not miss Jane Kelly (like Joe Brady) any step, and Frank Sinatra (Clarence Doolittle) will not miss any remark. The scenes with them are very good, showing how much talent you can add to a fairly uneven plot. Sinatra "I fall in love too easily" is a sign of his best at that time and in the future. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is fun. Kelly has certainly won his nomination as the best actor. There are a bunch of really funny lines, like: "Do you think the Navy takes a doping?" ; "Do you think anyone sings a sailor to sleep?" ; "We had a little problem, we picked up a little boy." A very enjoyable film, it's just something to get rid of the dust of the Second World War that has just ended.
