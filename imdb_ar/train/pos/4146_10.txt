Anyone who has lived through the ages of revenge from the morbid and Girlpower will appreciate this film. It is one of those films that provides everything you want in the film "spring spring" in addition to making fun of the type of university film. It's funny, you've got representatives to die for (Amy Boehler! Rachel Drach !, Sophie Monk !, Parker Bosi! Jane Lynch!) The writer Rachel Drach is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. (I just repeat myself now ...) It will continue with girls who are fond of Miranda July but they feel like they are eating ice cream and pretending to be stupid.
