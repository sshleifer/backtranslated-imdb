I remember watching this film, which was shown a few years ago on Lifetime TV and I think it was an interesting story. After several years I see her again and fall in the wake of this film. The story behind the film is wonderful in itself. The cast just makes it more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture. She rattles Ms Chamberlain's behaviors, tone, and even a look. It shows the pain, injury, surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in this process it is hard to remember that it is not Lindy. In my opinion, Meryl's performance was better than her Oscar-winning role in Sophie's Choice, and she should have won her third Academy Award. Sam Neil is as perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for a surprise reason, the Academy did not recognize him as a candidate. In general, only Oscar Oscar (Streep's Best Actress) has received this film. However, he has won many Oscars and Australian nominations. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the best movies: tells a great story and you get great offers from the entire crew.
