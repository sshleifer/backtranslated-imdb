Ossession is in very poor condition but is undergoing complete restoration at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The materials used are the second generation "main positive" originally from the Visconti edition managed to hide from the fascists. Scanned on Spirit 4K (such as 2K RGB data) and then processed using the DaVinci Revival Recovery program. After this rest is manual work we do not expect to finish before early spring. Sometime next year, it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that future generations will enjoy the efforts of restoration.
