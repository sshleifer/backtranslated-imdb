I do not know why I chose this movie to watch it, and it has a strange title and the description seemed to be a different thing. It's a good idea to try a film that is a bit different from the flick of the Hollywood hero and the excitement, and this film was certainly different. From the beginning, this film was interesting to me but I could not figure out the reason to the end if the film when I realized that the film was wonderful because the characters were very real. I thought the acting was wonderful and the personality development makes you really interested in them and hopefully things will go well for them in the end. I think everyone watching the movie can somehow be associated with a character, which makes for a great viewing and some funny laughter on the usual affection of actors. <br /> <br /> When you reach your climax in the movie, you will definitely feel comfortable, and you have a feeling that "things will be fine". I'm sure this will have a wide appeal and should be given a chance.
