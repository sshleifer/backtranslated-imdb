This film documents a transformational experience for a group of young people, and the experience of watching it is itself transformative. Some films are looking forward to this level of transcendence, and I can not think of any other film - documentary or dramatic - achieved. There is no other film I laughed so much and I cried a lot. Yes, it's about the DMD program and the travel available; on these issues alone, it's a worthwhile adventure, but more than that. It's about friendship. It is about life itself, about living every day alive. It's a wonderful story, fun and adventure. That's why God created cinema! Watch this movie !!!
