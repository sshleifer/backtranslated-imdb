The Scots outnumber the storytellers. Traditional type. After many years of the event, I can still see an old lady, my friend's mother, recounting the Battle of Kolodin. They make the characters come alive. Her passion is an eyewitness. One of the events on the ground was found a mile or so from where you live. <br /> <br /> Of course, this happened many years before her birth, but you will not guess how you tell her. He tells the same story in Scotland's length and length tapes. When I discussed it with a friend one night in Maleg, a local resident gave his story. The discussion continued at closing time. <br /> <br /> Stories like this have become part of our being. Who can not remember the stories our fathers told us when we were children? They become our invisible world. As we age, they may still be a source of inspiration or emotional reservoir. Truth and imagination are combined with ambition, example. Warning stories. Examples. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Anghas, like my grandfather and grandfather before him." The protagonist introduces himself to us. It also provides a story that stretches across generations. Stories are produced within stories. Incredible stories in Scotland, and rugged mountains are littered with clouds. The stuff of legend. After Seach'd actually rooted. This is what gives him special charm. It has original beauty and originality, filled by some of the best singing you'll ever hear. <br /> <br /> Anghas (Angus) visits his grandfather at the hospital shortly before his death. It burns with frustration. Part of it longs to be in the 21st century, to wander around Glasgow. But grew up on the western shores of a community that speaks Gaelic. <br /> <br /> However, there is a deeper conflict inside. He longs to know the truth. The truth behind the stories of his old grandfather. Where does fantasy end? He wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He was pulled out for a final fateful trip to the top of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can I tell the truth? Or are they all in the stories? <br /> <br /> In this story about stories, we re-examine bloody battles, poisoned lovers, ancient folklore and sometimes angry folklore of the accepted truth. By doing this, each of us communicates with Angus, who lives his own life story. <br /> <br /> Seachd: Pinnacle, which is inaccessible, is probably the most honest, simple and beautiful film about Scotland. Such as Angus, were slightly annoyed by the argument of commenting stories on more stories. But, like Angus too, I forgot this once I saw the Big Picture. Forget the pastiche box office of Braveheart and the like. May abandon the famous drama of The Wicker Man. To see a movie that applies to Scotland, this film is likely to be unique. If you meditate deeply enough, you may re-evaluate the power of storytelling and the old question of whether there are some facts that can not be told but only experienced.
