I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was blown away. The structure of the film and its implementation were fantastic ... I know it will not do that, but it really deserves the Oscar signal. Cal and Andre were adorable as annoying colleagues. Yes, the film is very controversial and I can see that many people face a lot of problems with it, as it deals with shooting in schools, and in particular makes you sympathetic to killers. However, despite its harsh and frank theme, the Zero Day is worth seeing. I'm looking forward to showing it on the video so I can buy it - it's very good. Extremely powerful and intense ... The sequence of fire makes you speechless because it is very unrealistic. Uncertainties, "recordings", footage and panic of the students, quite indescribable. I really hope you get the attention you deserve. This is done in the same format as The Witch Project, the portable camera, designed to appear as a kind of real documentaries in home movies - but God is infinitely better. Very impressive, hats off to all involved. If you've got a chance you should actually see it.
