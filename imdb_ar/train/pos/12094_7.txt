Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality of work in this kind of horror that was introduced in Italy in the 1960s. The film contains all the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, decent story and Barbara Steel. Steel makes any film worth watching. <br /> <br /> The story is about a inhabited castle. I have visited people, but have not returned. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night at the castle and return to collect his profits. But the night he visits is a special night. It is the night when the dead return to recover their death. <br /> <br /> The only drawback I see in the film is the show time. Feel almost padded. There is a large part of the first act where nothing literally happens. Our hero stumbles in the dark and finds nothing interesting. But once he finds something, the film captures and becomes very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a basic necessity for Steele fans and Italian gothic lovers in general.
