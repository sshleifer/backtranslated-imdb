I saw this film in my childhood. After 10 years I did not remember anything about this film but I discovered that I also do not know how I managed to discover this film. it's my life. My all time favorite movie. My words will be less than the real meaning of what I have inside this film. I am following this film. It's a fantastic combination of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, horror, horror and martial arts. The power story of love is very moving and warm. It is a masterpiece of Hong Kong films. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman, undoubtedly one of the best ghost stories that has been turned into a movie. Written by Sungling Bo and directed by Seo Tong Qing, Chinese ghost story has it all. Leslie Cheong's Ling Choi Sen is a young man who stands on his luck looking for a monastery to live in the depths of the forest, a place where villagers seem very afraid to approach. The journey alone is fraught with wolves, and a crazy Taoist monk lives in the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi-sen meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who lives nearby in an abandoned temple. She is forced to seduce men because of her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent Ling Choi, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of demented asshole but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from other souls in the forest, trying to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill lives in the forest. There is a great martial arts, even a monk who explodes into a drunken song as he performs the forms of the Taoist sword. The film features many traditional acrobatics of martial arts, with magic and flying through the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long gowns and scarves, but the film flows honestly, and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing married an evil monster, she can not be good, and we feel her distress at her house where we meet her sisters and her father's wife who are not really nice. <br /> <br /> In the end they must fight the witch of a killer tongue tree, and they go with Yin in the depths of hell to fight against the evil of a thousand years to save their lives, and to return the ashes to her house for proper burial until they have a chance to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that pays real attention to detail. This film has been influenced in many ways, you will laugh and cry, and you will only enjoy great martial arts and cinematography. However, in the end, both Yin and Ling Choi Sin are installed in the morning sun under the magic rainbow, we never know whether Tsing was given a reincarnation, but we know it.
