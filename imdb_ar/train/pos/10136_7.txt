This is one of the best episodes of the second season of the Department of Health, and I think Mick Gares has a problem with women ... I've killed everything, and they are often the victims (Solve Solution, Pro - Live, Valerie on the stairs, Season one, etc., a clear imprint). I think he enjoys watching women burn, torture, mutilate, and I do not know. The "right to die" is not among the best at all, as it turns well and shows the graphics and suspense (especially with the images from the wonderful cell scene). Representing like the whole series, I may be worse like "pro-life" or "we scream on ice cream." I also think that the plot can be for a film and not just for the episode. The ideology of this series is appalling, with women killing and ending women and maiming animals ... The first season was better than the second season with rings such as "Cigarrette burns" (the best of all) and "Homecoming" (the most funny) .
