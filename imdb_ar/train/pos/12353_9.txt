Tragically wonderful film ... leads us to Japan that no longer exists. Despite the Hollywood experience, I have never seen a Hollywood movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town near the river near ... The Rings Trying to take pictures of old rural Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like the quiet and intense storylines, this is a must. A break from the crisp, hollow films will be much like the last 1000 movies I have seen. I think this is one of Kurosawa's best stories. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a film about the army, brothels and complex rules governing life in such settings, it has not turned into a skin click. The characters are full of depth and act very heavily.
