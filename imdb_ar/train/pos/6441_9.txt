As in heaven {SPOILER WARNING} <br /> <br /> It was a great human drama that stimulated my feelings and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is an example that revisits Christ's life and death. Daniel is a talented talented musician, physically and mentally exhausted by his career, and has to give up. When he joins the church choir as its own, it brings about a transformation in the lives of the dwarves, just as Jesus did with the society of Palestine in the first century. They laugh, they start to talk frankly and honestly with each other, are exposed to their mistakes, accept each other, love each other, and become a vital society. This includes a mentally disabled young person ("rip"), and that is totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> Pastor Steig enjoyed power by imposing strict morality on the community, which is gradually rejected by the peshmines. When Stig Daniel is expelled, there is a revolution, and Stig is crushed. Stijg represents the Jewish authorities on Jesus' day, which provided his insistence on obeying Jewish law, a stark contrast to the new life through the "golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In one dramatic scene, someone announces "Church invented sin". Throughout this film, there is this contradiction between moral belief and vital life (existence). <br /> <br /> According to the story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Kony, when he hits him, leaves him drowning in the river. Next scene, we can not believe that when Daniel's body (revival!) Is pulled into his room (the grave) wrapped in white linen paper (the shroud!) By three women (three women kept vigilant at the foot of the cross in the gospel). <br /> <br /> Daniel is closely drawn to Lena, a beautiful young woman who is being betrayed by a man she loved, and is now mixed (Jesus developed a close relationship with Mary Magdalene - Lena - who was probably a compliment / prostitute High class). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he yearns for, and finds now. <br /> <br /> Gabriel's solo singing, composed by Daniel, is all about living a full life, in contrast to this moral health that leads to concern about sin, and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the choir shows all the songs / songs in harmony, such as the mantra, which attracts a large audience, and embodies the harmony and interdependence that is our true human destiny.
