I thought the whole movie had been beautifully presented with new photos and interesting cinematography all the time. The actors were at the top of their characters' appearance in almost perfect timing and looked great. The music was lush and well thought out. So he had a decent evolution from the end. So what does everyone vote for? The story was not entirely new (I felt like the remnants of "running" with the whole idea of ​​the TV show), but the attitude toward Christianity and Judaism about how to choose the audience for Christ was certainly true enough. It was logical to follow this man who was placed in front of a modern audience and put him on the pedestal because of his chance. <br /> <br /> Christians or other religious people can pick this up because the movie has the word "God" in it, but this shows what cinematographers were trying to do is teach the possibility to people who may not have seen the world like this , Especially in the modern world where Christianity was more and more accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought that every ounce of the film was entertaining and innovative, for the most part. Check it out if you do not feel so insulted to watch an entertaining film from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of a modern Messiah coming to a television set near you.
