Not all things are said in this excellent first feature of Ceylon Seelan. Friendship, "wanting to contain", first sexual feelings ... all this and much more is called through synchronized swimming scenes under water. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the film try to find the expression of their characters in a very different way. It's a much less violent way to understand teen years than "Thirteen", for example, but it is a worthwhile journey though. <br /> <br /> You should see A, and please leave all the American cinematic presuppositions in the section. The sound is A + by the way. <br /> <br /> Bon cin√©ma!
