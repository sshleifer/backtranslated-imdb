"Holes" is my favorite film ever! I have watched this movie so far three times in theaters and I look forward to buying it on DVD in September. I read the book after seeing the film and I was amazed at how similar the book and the film were. The director of this film did an excellent job of recreating the book in the form of a film. Also, all actors selected to play roles have played their characters beautifully, especially Max Kasch as the ZigZag props for all involved in making this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I would definitely recommend it to everyone!
