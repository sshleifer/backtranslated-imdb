There is such a litter on cable TV channels that I hit a gem with this one. From start to finish, he controlled me and deserved the highest marks. <br /> <br /> The father of two boys hears messages from "God" to kill people who are said to be "demons". > When the opening credits of the director showed that he is one of the actors who can often be a warning for a bad film; exceptionally, the opposite is because the drama does not stop from start to finish. <br /> <br /> There is no single moment in the movie when its full charm is not where there are no sub-necessary or unnecessary conspiracies, and the first-class scenario. <br /> <br /> All representatives make very convincing presentations, especially the main actor, who is considered exceptional. <br /> <br /> This film is at least as good as "Silence of the Lambs".
