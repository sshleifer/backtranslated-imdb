I did not know the real events when I sat down to watch this, just the fact that this was based on a true story. After the death of the child's father, Ronda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... I did not know anyone actually named their offspring) to deal with the loss. This is really made for children, as is often the case with "family" clicks (so to speak, go ahead and make everyone watch it, although I will keep the teenagers out unless you are sure they will buy it), but it does not reduce It is important to say that the death of a parent, do not talk to anyone. The plot is interesting enough and moves well enough. In addition, Ferland and her colleagues (with a few exceptions) are the least persuasive of the handful (frankly, they are annoying; then again, I am not really in the target audience for this thing). Editing and cinematography are the standard, certainly not the least. While humor is limited to a few amusing lines or so, the tone is not annoying. There is an intense scene or two in this. I recommend this to fans of these types of movies. 10/07
