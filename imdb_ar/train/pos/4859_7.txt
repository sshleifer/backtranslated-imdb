I read that Jesse Matthews approached and refused to participate in the tournament with Fred Astaire at Danssel in an ordeal. Jesse Matthews never left her side of the pool to do any American music. If they collaborate with this film, it will be an event once in a lifetime. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that Damsel in Distress has everything else to do. Fred Astaire, Story and Adaptive on Screen by author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for Comedy, and Songs by Gershwin Brothers. To answer the question posed by Nice Work if you can get it, there is not much you can ask for this movie. <br /> <br /> Except for a leading lady. Although Janger Rogers has made many films away from Fred Esther, Damsel in Distress is the only film made by Esther Don Rogers while they were a team. Juan Joan Fontaine was represented in this opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Her personality has nothing to do with the parts of Ginger Rogers in these films. All she has to do is to act sweet and alert. She also does not contribute anything musical. If I have to evaluate all the dancing partners of Fred Esther, Jean Fontaine will come down. Poor women are terrible in the number of things you are looking for. <br /> <br /> When I later participated in a musical with Bing Crosby, the waltz emperor, it is not by chance that Fontaine gets nothing musical. <br /> <br /> The version I own is a colorful one and in this case I think it actually did some good. The English countryside is green and poetic in P.G. Wodehouse is really brought in this VHS version. Especially in the figure I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine happening in the park. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Burns & Allen is complemented by the old-timers of the Astaire in a superb style in Stiff Upper Lip. The sequence of fun is displayed in wonderfully surreal. <br /> <br /> P.G. Aristocracy Wodehouse runs a series of games with Constance Collier at her best, forever Montagu Love as a Fontaine father as a nice guy in the film. <br /> <br /> The greatest success in A Damsel in Distress is a foggy day, perhaps the best known song about the British capital since the fall of the London Bridge. Fred Astaire is released in a simple and elegant style, one of those songs that will last as long as London and beyond. <br /> <br /> Overlooking Joan Fontaine, the young and experienced, classic, classical score, classical dance, and classic comedy. Who can ask anything more?
