I recently watched this 1954 film from Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Bryce depicts Don Ghalico, the magician / inventor who is led to death when his boss steals many of his magical inventions (as well as his wife, portrayed by Eva Gabor Gemayel). Although Price is a murderer, I found myself rooting for him. He is a sympathetic figure who is surrounded by greedy people around him and continues to benefit from him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not do "you have a" horror "factor in some of its most famous roles (like My Favorite," House of Wax ") however, it has enough to keep an interest Viewers. <br /> <br /> This is essential for Vincent Price fans.
