The performances in this film were fantastic. The dialogue was wonderful. Jason Patrick made a great show like "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Much better than "The Grifters", which was a good film, and this film has remained true to the roots of the pulp and imagination / film from which the story came. I recommend this movie to all film lovers Noir.
