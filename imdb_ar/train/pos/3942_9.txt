1939 was universally accepted as the greatest year in the history of Hollywood, where more classic films were released than any other film, and John Ford took out three of the best "Stagecoach", "Drums Along the Mohawk", a beautiful tribute to border days and a young lawyer in the backyard It was supposed to eventually save the Union, "Young Mr. Lincoln". <br /> <br /> With the world rushing to a war that America was afraid of, but I knew it would work, Abraham Lincoln was very much the mind of people, in 1939, as someone who had the same dilemma in his life, and won. On Broadway, the award-winning movie "Apple Lincoln in Illinois" Karl Sandberg published his epic book, "Abraham Lincoln: The Years of War," and soon became the bestseller. President Roosevelt repeatedly referred to Lincoln in speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, became the city's most popular landmark (a fact that Frank Capra has used well in "Mr. Smith goes to Washington"). <br /> <br /> Daryl Zanook did not waste all of this on the 20th Century Fox; once he read Lamar Trotty's screenplay about Lincoln's early days as a lawyer, and labeled it a "gift," John Ford appointed the task, Henry Fonda, Tournament. <br /> <br /> Fonda did not want to play Lincoln. He felt that he could not do justice to the "great editor" and feared that bad performance would damage his profession. Even the test of the make-up that was filmed, which amazed the Lincoln-like range, will not change his mind. According to Vonda, John Ford, whom he never worked with, gave up at his first meeting, explaining that he was not a Lincoln of Legend filmmaker, but a young Jackanab warrior faces the first murder trial. . Modestly, Fonda assumed the role. (John Ford offered a different scenario for the events, but the result was the same!) They obviously found a chemistry working together, as almost all their husbands would produce "classics." <br /> <br /> In contrast to Ford's vision of Lincoln, reflected and melancholy by Abby Lincoln in Illinois, seeing a shy but lovable young lawyer who had easy friends, missing the mother he had lost, His association with a pioneering mother becomes a vital part of the story.) The injustice angers him and speaks "common sense" to quell the intertwined violence with doses of humor. Both productions play Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; in Ford's version, the couple is in true love and committed to each other. After her death, Lincoln visited her grave frequently to share his life with her "soul" (a theme that Ford will continue to "wear a yellow ribbon"). <br /> <br /> The murder trial is the focus of crime from the film, and shows tremendous talent for the star and director. Forda captures Lincoln's experience, but his serious faith in justice is comfortable with compassion. Ford emphasizes the gap between the "intellectuals" of the big city (represented by Dr. Donald Mick, his brilliant adviser, Steven Douglas, played by the young man) Lincoln's informal governing state. Because Ford's 'regular' Ward Bond is a major witness, the experience is unconventional and largely fragmented. <br /> <br /> As the film closes as Lincoln approaches the stormy distance, and his fate (solubility in view) of the statue at Lincoln Memorial), fans can feel satisfaction with the film's message that if the case is fair, In the end. <br /> <br /> "Young Mr. Lincoln" is a really wonderful movie, from an amazing year!
