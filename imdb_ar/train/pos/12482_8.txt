I only read good things about this film and finally I had the opportunity to watch it late last night and had everything I expected to be and more. This is how the horror film should be appropriate. I think the reason was that it was scary because it was very realistic. The result of neuropathy was ideal for setting a dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the film appeared. It was very easy to follow them and understand them unlike some very complex films. The special effects were very good. I would like to see more horror movies like this movie. It's easily one of my favorite movies. A thunderstorm and realistic thunderstorm would create a nice atmosphere for this film. The film needs. I highly recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate a scary film that does not discourage you. I will add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
