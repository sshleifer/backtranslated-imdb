Ah, real memories. I lived in the Netherlands at that time and was eagerly looking forward to him every evening and late Tuesday. I saw it during my 14-16s. Very good My English (in school at the time), where Dutch TV provides translations of other languages, except today's children's shows. So you will hear the original sounds and language. - The best series was the first of three series, and after the third series, the great character, Nazi von Gelb, who was a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I do not think they really caught him, he always fled to leave space to show him again in the next story) It is clear that the series has also been distributed to Germany, and that the Nazi enemy will not go well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toon has done a wonderful job of portraying the clever Nazi aristocrat who had this constant obsession with revenge against England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high-quality performance in a series of young people, but Ronald Les Hunt was a good counterpart and the young were very ordinary. They believed me a lot at the time, and as a child, I used to imagine being part of these young people, who were four years older than me at the time. It was a very exciting series for me, as it emerged in my memory at those times as a special show with the "prisoner" too. I hope they will publish a good DVD of this series, that would be great. Even bad copies around are still fun to watch. The ensuing series was not as good as it was, and it was not as amusing as the first three fun. Hopefully they will also find the other series with Von Gelb to be placed on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
