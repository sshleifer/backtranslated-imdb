Warning: may contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I have watched this movie 3 times and have liked it every time. When I see him again, I always remember how good he is. HBO TV - very good like most of their movies - this will win the Oscars for its performance because if it was released for public distribution rather than made for television. <br /> <br /> As I'm sure anyone who knows of reading other reviews here, this is the serial killer story, Andr√© Chicatello. 56 people were killed over the past eight years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims have been buried but not found, so only 52 of 53 murders have been convicted.) The story is actually more focused on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov, who was played by Stephen Ree to perfection. The man who is tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hackers, his role is necessary to make sure. There is a very moving scene at the end of the film that recalls how in the United States investigators are routinely kept away from serial killer cases after 18 months, whether they want it or not because of psychological stress and frustration. According to this story, Bourakov worked for more than 5 years before getting his first break from it. Continue the case until its end, after 3 years. In this scene, his boss, General Vitisov, played by Donald Sutherland, told him that he was impressed with his sincerity and apologized for not knowing that he should have given him an urgent break. <br /> <br /> A very good riyals performance has been done, it does not exaggerate activity, chew the scene or do anything distracting from its portrayal of a man determined to find his killer. He is a man who has a passion, but does not appear in the same way he is usually portrayed in detective films. It only happens sometimes when it explodes calmly with more than others can stand in such circumstances. Ria does a lot with his face and eyes, and he does not need to be overstated. He is only * * - his character, very frustrating after a long time, at some point, driven by frustration, actually says that he would prefer to find 3 at a time more than nothing a year. Of course what it means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this guy. Ria makes us feel this man. It makes us understand but a glimpse of what it means to live with such horror and infertility. <br /> <br /> Surely a breakthrough, Chicatello's childhood was a breakthrough that produced such "monsters." The personality of Chikatilo is very good by Jeffrey Dimon. It is somehow (impossible though it may seem) that arouses some sympathy for itself. Maybe the worst of us went terribly wrong? In both cases, its performance is very good. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Vetisov (who was later promoted to the General) also did a great job. He began to appear as a cynical earthy official and seemed more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else who banned Borakov. But in the end becomes more than an assistant, he is already actively involved in helping Borakov. There is also a very large turn by Max von Siddo, where he is used by a psychiatrist to help identify the type of deviation they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film deals with a man who is obsessed with a hideous and violent story, it is really more what it takes to catch the killer from the killer himself. Throughout the film is very good with good performance and wonderful script. The script runs what works best in this kind of film: giving realistic events and putting them well into a dramatic framework that makes you feel you know people * behind * the facts. 9 out of 10 stars
