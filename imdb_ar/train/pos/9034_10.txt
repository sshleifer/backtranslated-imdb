This movie was great !! Every performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Jilinhal will have a huge career in movies if that is what happens. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director because he is usually associated with big budget films (Jumanji, Honey I shrake the children). It is drawn from each scene by a transparent separation. My favorite scene was the place where Homer walks in the mine and looks at the sky and goes down, as all his dreams were, were beautiful. Joe Johnston has to direct more of these great films and actress as well as his big budget films, which are also excellent. Glory!! For all participants in this masterpiece!
