This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes a very embarrassing documentary and turns it into a related social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a child from a small town (presumably) that he liked because of many acting. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a show of local talent (for those who are very excited), Gary's behavior shows that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This results in different justifications for his actions so that people do not think he is actually transgender or other social outcasts. In the second installment, Harris takes advantage of the conflict between Gary and Beaver in an attempt to begin a novel from the original documentary. The third and final installment of the truly stunning trilogy of Harris' extreme sensitivity with the theme. Unlike the second installment, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a really troubled character. He is struggling to gain acceptance within his community but to no avail. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John distanced him more from the people he considered to be socially ostracized. The film is so realistic that it, like reality, gives way to many reactions. Certainly, one can see Gary as a pathetic pathetic person, but he may also recognize him as a renegade.
