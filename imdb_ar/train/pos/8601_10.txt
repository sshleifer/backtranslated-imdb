My Notes: The outfit of the patch at the end is enchanting, gorgeous, strange and gorgeous. Janet bounced well, and even got up with Nelson naive. A boat crashing into his balcony served him right. The mafia fashion clothes are surprisingly well designed, especially by today's standards. 1942 The fashion designer did a great job. The theme of the song is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Warning for negative posters: 1942 was World War II time; Pearl Harbor happened a year ago. The United States is just emerging from the Great Depression; necessary to go out and spend that hard earned money on singing, dancing and yes, a fantastic imagination. The authoritarian dictators were trying to exclude their presence in R. to. Thank God the audience had these wonderful films that you attend. The movie was a great pleasure, in those sad times. When you become a negative poster or become an actor or even a movie star, you have space to talk and critique. Janet and Nelson's films coincide with the test of time. <br /> <br /> The angel wings are fantastic, the real angel. The RL suites were not in a very warm ceremony, but they were fantastic on Janet looking at SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful singing for Janet and Nelson, as always. Janet was dancing a pure joy. <br /> <br /> 15/10
