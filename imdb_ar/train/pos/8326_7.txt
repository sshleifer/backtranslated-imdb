While Fred Schepisi "I.Q" does not really have any important qualities, it is still worth watching. Walter Matau plays the role of Albert Einstein, in an attempt to help the mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) in love of the doctoral candidate in mathematics Princeton Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Perhaps the most entertaining scene is when Dr. Frisheid and friends (Le Jacoby, Jane Sachs and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed seem like a scientist: he ends up like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> A little historical film is historically accurate, but this is not the goal. It is not meant to be anything but a light comedy, exactly the opposite of Robbins' most famous film since 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's entire life will have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also on his political activism, specifically how he wrote a letter on behalf of Scottsboro Nine and went out against nuclear weapons (as far as the FBI point he kept a file). <br /> <br /> So anyway, this file is acceptable. Starring Steven Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Wiley, Charles Dornning and Kevin Curtis.
