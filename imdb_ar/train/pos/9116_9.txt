The idea is a very clever title, and the film has a serious tongue in its cheek. But it's so subtle that you do not know how to read it! Are these guys doing a full comedy or is there something else going on? The little dialogue of the film is not very sensitive and this increases the strength of the film. If the entire sound is turned off from the movie, it will not output anything from the movie. Physical work or the art of presentation is so powerful that it carries the whole story. <br /> <br /> I am blessed and blessed, followed by feelings of shame. I first say this film as part of the "Black" film festival. After watching the film, I was very impressed with the work. But then I asked myself what else? Where else can someone see this work? You can not find the link of art without a purpose here. You can see intention in design from start to finish. The use of African music in a way that seems to be all planned is a reason. The personality evolution is amazing. Representation is the strongest aspect in the film; characters are easily identified within two minutes of 6 minutes of actual film. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these types of movies, there is really a need for greater support for the development of short films across the board.
