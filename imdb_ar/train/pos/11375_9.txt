This film tells an amazing story with history and compassion. From the exact descriptions of crime scenes to the mental health of the principal investigator, it would be attractive that it is absolutely imperative to anyone interested in criminology. Interpol's relationships and how agencies work with each other are wonderful relationships. Not overly done either. I recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history, too. How the police work with the political party as it was ... It is really wonderful and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It's been some time since I first saw this film. Does not reduce its effect. Not very exciting or drawing, it leaves enough for imagination, well, you'll see.
