B movie? Yes really. DIY? Yes really. First movie? Yes really. But aesthetically A +. This movie certainly had some bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. Etc. Problems. However, this film has many positive things about it. First, the most disturbing personality dies first! Second, it was made to be a spoof / funny film for horror movies. The comments the murderer left on his victims left me and my friends wandering around laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people are trying to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it what it is, a group of children graduated from high school their first film. As it is, this is good, it's really good.
