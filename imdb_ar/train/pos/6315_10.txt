Welcome to Collinwood, there are lots of things, but none of the following: <br /> <br /> George Clooney star Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know the movie is another film. But as far as Hollywood is concerned, this may be rated as their most original output this decade - and for me, it is. <br /> <br /> The film is from start to finish, an absolute gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in the movie. Funny funny parts. Inflamed edgy parts. Contains a scenario, not a dull moment of dialogue. The cinema is new and beautiful yes. It does not conform to the Hollywood standard (you'll see what I mean, when you see the movie) <br /> <br /> As a kid, I remember seeing the movie's ads. This film went under the radar after not collecting too much at the box office, not even the classic cult. The reason that Transformers 2, accepted by ordinary filmgoers, is that they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If the film was original and funny where it was often pumped like several million pieces **, the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place - /> <br /> When they say "They do not make them like they used to," they did not see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> Fun, a mini-masterpiece of great comedy, which rejects compromise. .
