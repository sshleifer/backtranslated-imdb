I have not seen the film since its first release, but it was unforgettable. The offerings of Rip Torn and Farrell Conchata were fantastic, excellent photography, story telling, and everything else about it was of the highest standard. However, it seems to have been largely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because the UK is a strange market for her, but I did not watch the movie on television or video, which is sad. Has it achieved greater success in the United States, where it can truly be considered a historical drama? <br /> <br /> I always think that 50% of the good movie is music, yet I'm not sure I think the address title is simple but it moves solo in the clarinet "Who has a friend in Jesus". Then the film went to refute it! Am I right or wrong?
