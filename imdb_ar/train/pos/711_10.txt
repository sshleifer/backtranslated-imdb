The Rock and Roll High School may be forced to decline in history as a flicker of the rebel party. The film depicts a handful of high school students who use Ramones' music as an inspiration to stand up to their tyrannical directors (Mary and Ronoff, for the famous "Eat the Roller"), and the whole film is one mile per minute. It's basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you will. Scaring student? Check. Dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Check. Mice explosion? Checkmate. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is the kind of thing that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know Ramones music, it's pure fun. With Roger Korman, executive director of production and Joe Dante participating in the output, how can we expect anything less? Too bad that director Alan Arkoch subsequently deteriorated to fare like "Caddyshack II". <br /> <br /> Also starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young and Dick Miller (who appeared in Joe Dante's films, Roger Corman's films, Don Steel, and of course Ramones. <br /> <br /> It seems that Bartel and Waronov are always participating in the tournament, and they also took part in the Hollywood Boulevard of Joe Dante and the vulgar Chopping Mall (also starring Dick Miller) ... they re-represented their roles from "Eating Raoul".
