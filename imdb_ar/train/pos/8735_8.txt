This happy world has been created for us in the life of Pixar A Bug's Life; we indulge in a world that can only be reliably documented on the film, but with more subtle precision that can only be documented through the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what a rich and abundant cartoon can offer in the world? When in the right hand is this? Bug life is a warm reminder. We walk outside the film with warm feelings, and a sense of satisfaction is derived from productions of high-caliber films only. <br /> <br /> It's only the second animation feature in Pixar. The sub-series of Disney debuted for the first time in an astonishing and possibly unintended mark on the world of cinema three years ago in 1995, with their film Story Story Game. It was a film challenging the convention, reinventing new life and blowing it into animation and setting a whole new level of excellence. Now, they are returning with their secondary effort that, frankly, attracts a false sense of pessimism in all of us before watching the film. <br /> <br /> After all, it's a film about ants. Well, all aspects of the world of insects and insects are covered in the life of A Bug, but the ant is the focal point in this film, since humans are the focal point in dramas, romance and so on. How can such an unimportant type of animal like an ant work as a movie hero, let alone provide the full premise of a feature film? Sure they are joking. However, we forget that in the Toy Story game, a group of game box elements has been able to become a group of heroes and the most powerful and inspiring evil villains. Pixar players can get rid of the same achievement, and they can manage a group of dirty, smaller insects in the most pleasant and pleasant groups of people you may ever encounter. <br /> <br /> They are all totally friendly and lovable? There is no unpleasant character on the horizon; even the bad guys are fixation personalities? They are colorful, selective, and distinctive. The group of characters is also trivial for the lack of a better term, adding only the rich layers of excellence that have already been attached to A Bug's Life from the start. We will start with our main character and hero. His name is Flick (David Foley), and his character is fairly general to say the least. Of the thousands of devout and obedient ants living in the beautiful lush ants island, he is considered the "black sheep" of the clan, as we saw in the opening moments of the film when the harvest accidentally destroys the harvest. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that ant harvest is a group of greedy locusts led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who are eager to continue asserting their anger and tyranny among punishing small ants. When they come to Ant Island to attend an annual banquet and see that their shows have disappeared, they reap, because there is no better term. Hopper offers an offer to save the ants from total extinction at the hands of its packaging; however, it is a negotiation that is simply impossible to achieve. The hunting dogs and the clock in the minds of Flik are now full of strength despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave the island of Ant in search of some mighty warriors who can come to save the colony and fight the Hopper and the lizards. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Bug's Life has some similarities with the classic Seven Samurai Samurai line of Akira Kurosawa, or the new American version The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of poor people is exposed but good hearts are threatened By enemies who hate and evil? One of the only villagers looking for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to ward off evil. In the life of A Bug's Life, help comes in the form of a circus band that is mistakenly understood by Flik as belligerents in a bar fight. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of entertainment coming from these scenes, and a lot of entertainment comes out of these circus band mistakes. Among them is a fine-grained insect (David Hyde Pierce), a German-born caterpillar divided side-by-side with Heimlich and a semi-Fatimid beetle beetle, actually a brave and malevolent beetle (Dennis Hopper). It is very interesting to watch these bugs on the screen, as they see insects and insects interact on the screen, as with the entire film collectively. <br /> <br /> As I said, a lot of fun and fun comes from their characters and happy interactions with each other, which give way to a range of funky lines, admirable attitudes and stabilization and overall a wonderful film. What makes Bug's life better than that is that the film is not limited to children just because a lot may see it, although children will actually find more entertainment from this film? Child-friendly cliche attitudes are a little more abundant than we would like. However, it is easy to ignore this error, and it is very easy to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Although A Bug's Life may not meet the staggering standards and standards set by its predecessor, this film is still wonderful, and the beginning of something promising here. Pixar has proved that it is not just a single wonder, but instead a group of highly talented and talented Hollywood filmmakers. They raise the tape indefinitely, and when someone always runs his highest standards, it is always on his own. What more can be said about A Bug's life than: seeing it; not the best we've seen in Emeryville, California, but that beats a lot of its year? I would be cursed if this was not the best animation feature of 1998. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
