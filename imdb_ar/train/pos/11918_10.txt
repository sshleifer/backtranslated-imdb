"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from the Ted Turner library; Disney produced it in 1994, this time using California's angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney used to own this and Anaheim's Meets Dox Hockey Team; Well, good use of words, huh ?????). <br /> <br /> This film was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised boys a family, only if the angels beat the flag. Therefore, God called one night about it. For example, when the first angel fell, the player hit a very strong ball and not only broke the bat, but also the ball !!!!! During most of the 1994 post-all-star season, the Angels were at the top of the West (where Host Rangers were one and still). However, they lost a game because the boy was on the pitch instead of White Sox / Angels (there was no central division of baseball at the time, and then Chicago was in the west), and there were no angels to help. Thus, a new rule was created: can not help the angels in the tournament games. But wait! In the final, Angels won !!!!! It has been a miracle already! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: it's a good movie. I mean, I've been praying every night for the last few years to seek help in school and things; look at me now! It was a good job !!! Therefore, this shows that if you believe, God can send his angels down to help you in any troubles you may have in life. Second, this is a family movie for baseball, which is always exciting. This Disney movie is also old. I've seen this recently on the new Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels Abroad" will change your life forever by watching it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
