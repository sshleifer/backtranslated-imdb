Cutting to the chase: This is one of the most amazing and intense films I've seen in a long time. The first film in the years that left me very stunning. I barely felt I was out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I was staring at the screen for fifteen minutes trying to find a way to describe the power of this film, and failure only. The highlight of any aspect - the coordination of video memoirs in the form of a documentary film, the unlimited portrayal of events, the power of characters - seems to make fun of everything. Some may find it funny that any murderer is described as normal. But then, not all murderers chortle madly throw in the mouth. Many people are very ordinary, humble. They are connected in a different way only. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most chilling idea ever.
