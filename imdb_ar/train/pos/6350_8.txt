I waited and waited for the appearance of this movie, and it seems that the trailers were working for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies again and again, but I can not wait until everyone comes out to buy them! Not a fan of Jim but this fits him perfectly, there was a lot to see him and a "good feeling factor" is far from the range, ideal for Christmas. I think Ron did a great job about it to a movie, if you do not see it, do it, if you see it, you see it again, and I know you want!
