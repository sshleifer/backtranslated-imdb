In August 1980, the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain and the trial of her parents, Lindy and Michael, caused the alleged murder of the child in a frenzy through what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had tried and convicted the couple who were already charged and were demanding blood. What followed was a blatant miscarriage of justice. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, Rotha took their 10-week-old daughter from their tent as they prepared to eat in the barbecue area. No one believed them. Lindy was accused of killing her child, and Michael as an accessory after the fact. The entire country was filled with a whisper of ritual murder. The Chamberlain trial ended before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was convicted. There was not enough evidence to convict her, but the jury was affected by public and media pressure. How can we as a nation sit in power? From where we are, how can we suppose to know? Unless there is absolute evidence, and no doubt at all, Chamberlains should have been acquitted. <br /> <br /> Farid Shabisi's film unequivocally supports the argument of John Bryson, that Chamberlains were completely innocent of Chamberlain's novel. Charges against them. In fact, this fuss caused her baby Azaria to suffer that fateful night in Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Shibisi has captivated the mood of a bloodthirsty nation, and hell lives on the "truth" that has come to light. He shows Australia in a rather intolerable light as a people who was totally obsessed with seeing Chamberlains pay! The scenario of his film, which he co-wrote with Robert Casswell, evokes strong emotions and will certainly find the public feeling sad and angry at the trap of justice that has taken place. <br /> <br /> The outstanding Meryl Streep performs amazingly as a woman is accused of the most horrible acts. It brings to life more convincingly the tough little Australian who was prepared to stand up to the allegations and set the world right. So her accent is almost, but not quite, immediately. Very good effort by the master of that trade. Sam Neal is all that Streep is like believers at first but Michael is disappointed that he can not understand why their world is collapsing and begins to question Christianity. His, as was Streep, is a show of great emotional power that will move you deeply. The entire support team is also excellent, with some of the best actresses and actresses in Australia playing a role. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also wonderful, with director Ian Baker taking over this wonderfully magnificent land (especially a rock). Editor Gil Bilkock keeps the entire film tense and emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a degree of telling. <br /> <br /> For all Australians, this is a must, a terrible look in the mirror if you wish, as a country we did to a family that just wanted to serve justice, and the truth is known. As Michael Chamberlain said: "I do not think anyone really understands the meaning of innocence ... for the innocent." <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even in cases of return, Farid Shibisi's account of the irony of justice that confronts Chamberlain, who lost his infant Azaria in Ayers Rock 1980, emotionally strong and moving faithfully. John Bryson's story was brought to the screen, saying the simplicity of the horrific story of a terribly wrong vacation for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose new daughter Azaria took the family tent from Dengo just moments after she was put out. <br /> <br /> amid media speculation and sinister public rumors, Lindy was accused of killing her child, and Michael was charged as an accessory after the incident. What followed was more than a trial by the media, and with the Australian people determined to leave, Lindy was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, although the Public Prosecution provided no motive or other circumstantial evidence. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is at her best where the accused woman who is fighting Australia is charged face to face to prove her innocence. It's really wonderful, and the only thing that fails is the real Australian blue tone, although it does its best to look like impossible. You may wonder why a high-ranking Australian actor has not participated in this role, but perhaps star power is the solution. Along with Merrill is Sam Neil equally impressive, as prominent as a husband who sees his world disintegrate in front of his eyes, while he feels helpless to do anything about it. There is strong support of Australian cast. <br /> <br /> The editing of Billcock's generation is very timely, Ian Baker's shooting of rocks and other visually stunning rugged sites and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the part. Really is a must for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
