The Unborn is a low-budget horror horror film that takes advantage of pregnancy-related concerns. She acted very well by Brook Adams who was always good and starring James Karen strong, although the support team was fairly average for the classmates. Music, written by Gary Numan for all people, is very good. The text of Henry Dominique is highly intelligent for this kind of thing, although there is a hint of hateful women around him. Rudman Vander's direction is just enough, and there are some unnecessary cheap fears. If you are a fan of Adams, who have never had their film career anywhere near as glossy as it should be, check it out; it's fantastic, as always.
