My friend had the idea of ​​watching animated LOTR after watching Peter Jackson's Return of the King. So, I've finally bought from the e-bay, thinking good from the start to suck it. In fact, it was not really as bad as I thought. The animation was good at the time, they used a unique way to mix live animation with animation to create some interesting effects, and the man who made Frodo sound seemed somewhat like Elijah Wood. The greatest adaptation of the book, but trust me, I've seen much worse. Too many things go by, with both the fellows and the bidders being squeezed into a single two-hour film. Definitely worth watching, children may wish, but still, there is no comparison with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
