While on her deathbed, Anne (Vanessa Redgrave) was named "Harris" and remembers today in the 1950s when she was an ambitious singer and traveled from New York to be the maid of her wealthy friend Leila Fetturne (Mami Gomer) in Newport. Anne Grant (Claire Dance) welcomes Lilly's alcoholic and frantic brother Bodie (Hugh Dancy) at Whittenburn's seaside house and tells her that his sister actually loves her boyfriend and boyfriend Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson) in the war and graduated from medicine. The bride later recognized her true feelings towards Harris to Anne. However, when she meets Anne Harris, she is crushed and has a short relationship during one night during a tragedy with friends. At the same time, Anne's daughters, Nina March (Tony Collett) insecure and unstable and happy wife and mother Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson), are concerned with their mother and have differences to be resolved. <br /> <br /> "Evening" has one of the most influential actors I've ever seen in a movie with fantastic shows. Mami Jumer is stunning with her amazing mother Meryl Streep and has a performance that honors her mother's name. The costumes, selected decoration, photography and soundtrack are also fantastic. Unfortunately, the plot is confused and I did not understand clearly the message of this film. Why is motherhood so important in the story? Was Constance a fan at Anne's night and Harris was her father? Why did not Ann and Harris stay together, if the man really loved her, as he admits at their casual meeting in New York? What issues did Lord Lord get after Laila Ross's visit? Was the friend bisexual or had a love for Harris? Why did Nina Mars change her thoughts about motherhood in the end? It seems that the screenwriter or director failed because they were unable to understand and tell a beautiful love story. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ao Entardecer" ("In the Event")
