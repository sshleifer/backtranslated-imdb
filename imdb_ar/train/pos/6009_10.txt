Marc Frechette is Mark, a radical leftist at the college. Mark is charged with killing a policeman during a campus riot, and escapes all the way to the desert. He does this by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flying by himself. <br /> <br /> Once you fly over the desert, Mark discovers a car from the air. A young woman named Daria leaves, and sees Mark flying in the plane. Mark the plane very low several times, causing darya ducks or batting. When he lands, he becomes familiar with Badria, which is strangely charmed by Mark Air. <br /> <br /> After engaging in intimate conversation for hours, Mark and Daria became naked, making love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realized he needed to keep running. So the experience of Mark and Daria is very short, because it does not develop into a full love story. <br /> <br /> Zabriskie Point was the head of the eraser in the early 1970s. Both films enjoy ambiguous quality, along with complex meanings and characters. Frechette was personally reckless, as was his character in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette stole a bank in real life. While serving time in prison, Mark died with a meager death. He was killed with a weight of 150 lbs, fell on him when he was lifting weights. <br /> <br /> The best of this film is great cinematic photography and special visual effects. The sight of the incredible slow debris that floated in the air after the explosion was a genius blow. Although not a leading film like Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still resonates in the early 1970s. I recommend it, for those who love the vanguard films that show unrest, to the youth rebellion in the early seventies.
