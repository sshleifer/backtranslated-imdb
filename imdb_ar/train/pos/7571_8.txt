This game is ranked above all yet. I was honored to play mine on the PS2, so the graphics were really good. The vocal representation was higher than the level. The difficulty level is just right. Wesker must be the best character in the RE series in my opinion. The story surprised me and took many different transformations that I did not expect. The only rating you deserve for this game is great.
