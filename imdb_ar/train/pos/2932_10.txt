I have seen my fair share of comedy movies and backup movies but this movie is very original, and very new, and will make you wonder why you always walk in the video store. Murphy has some nasty jokes but this is very funny. If every movie can be this funny. It must be called "107 minutes of the most amazing comedy" Murphy is a comic genius in this film, and will make you say "This is the man who made Dr. doulittle!" He talks about an ice cream man, mothers who throw shoes, his aunt with a mustache, racism, everything you can think of and those you can not think of. Please, if you see one comedy in your life, all these movies can be a play.
