Before we start, I have a fear of dentists. This film gives me creeps and even makes me cringe. That's what I like about this film. The film is kind of boring. So, I leave 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Dr. Alan Finston, who just discovered that his wife was betraying him. Soon, he begins hallucinating and begins to torture his patients, killing his colleagues, and even tortured his wife to death and killed the man who had an affair with him. <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and glorious. I would recommend it if you are a gore. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your normal doctor every day!
