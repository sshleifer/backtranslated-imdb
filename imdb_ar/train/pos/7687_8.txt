Like The Jeffersons, Good Times was one of the classic American comedy series that was never broadcast in the UK, not to mention that it appeared in the 1970s - a decade in which I was not yet born. <br /> <br /> But like most fans of the show, I watched some episodes on You Tube - and then, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is headed by James and Florida - parents who are trying to achieve ends meet, and who, despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own aspirations in life to achieve them and take their chances. James was the loving, strict father, who dared not hesitate to discipline J. C. Michael and Telema - if they go beyond the line. Florida, on the contrary, was a fair, good, polite and loving wife, although she was very much like James, with regard to her position on parenting and family values ​​from an African-American perspective. <br /> <br /> The children were as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves: JJ was an ambitious artist with a funny personality and crazy humor, often dressed in multicolored clothes. He had a "DY-NO-MITE" The phrase "infectious and familiar" like "Wizo speaks" to Arnold Jackson about Willis? Of diffrent strokes. Michael Alec was the smart one, who dreamed of becoming a lawyer, while her sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. Her verbal irony of JJ was mostly gay, as was the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, which was well played by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Throughout the seasons, there have been a few appearances of veils, notably Janet Jackson, Deby Allen and Gary Coleman himself! I prefer to say Good Times on the Cosby Show, which was a show in the 1980s because I prefer the Evans family to Huxtables, both in terms of (a) characterization and b) because I felt they dealt with serious and difficult social issues, in a way that echoed with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary aimed at shedding light on the lives of the African-American working class in the 1970s in America. Cosby tried to meet the needs of the mainstream audience in a "candy-wrapped" way, with Huxtables portrayed as blacks who easily absorbed themselves in a top-class American culture in which we would link eggs, while Good Times was much more reluctant to address topics Such as drug abuse and children in a realistic way. In fact, while the Cosby show can be fun to watch at times, it has lacked so much "coolness" that Good Times has made it more modern and cooler. <br /> <br /> The show has jumped shark during the last few seasons, and continued after the character of John Amos, James died in a strange accident (in fact, it was known at that time that John resigned from Good Times for good. Thus, the death of his character was written as it is on the program). Without John, the show suffered, and unfortunately, has lost much of its charm. <br /> <br /> However, for the sitcom, Good Times recorded all the correct boxes. If they showed it in the UK during the 1980s. As it certainly is, as JJ said, "DY-NO-MITE !!" <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
