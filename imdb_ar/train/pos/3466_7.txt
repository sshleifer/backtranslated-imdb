This was a real pleasure ... I saw the trailer and all the ads, so I understood "Why do not I check out this vh1 movie?" As they used to say on television, "I can not believe I've seen it all!" Kevin and Harris were fairly reasonable children, and although the dialects were too much and sometimes difficult to decipher, I found the dialogue credible too. The film touched on the weak relationship of the LIN / MC and showed how, in their depths, they were just young people who grew up close and shared a passion for music - where they were reached, with different sets of personal issues and needs. Find yourself wishing the hopper in the cab for an improvised reunion that would have brought out the stockings of the world, but you also get a greater appreciation for what they did not do
