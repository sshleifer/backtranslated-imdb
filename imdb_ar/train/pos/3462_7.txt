This was the first serial television series of the Colombo series (though filmed after "Death Lends a Hand") and premiered one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who has played a serial killer three times) evokes the same strangeness, vanity and self-confidence here as Ken Franklin, half of the secret writing team that hides a detailed conspiracy to kill his partner Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) ) Decides to end his professional relationship, leaving Franklin Makshova as a good publicity rather than as a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> The first murder squad is wonderful, and Cassidy makes it easy to appreciate that he was the best killer of Colombo in the series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is admirably appreciated for his role as Colombo, and the inherent personality traits and traits highlighted by apparent slowness and lack of thought contrast well with Cassidy's strange character: one of her early scenes together Where Ken Franklin makes the motive for the murder through an unknown display of Jim Ferris to identify successful men working in the underworld, a very good example. Franklin hints at Colombo of this potential motive and Colombo's failure (deliberately or unintentionally) to hold on to it, forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a remarkably patronizing way and comparing it unfavorably with the books' detective, Ms. Melville. <br /> <br /> The early contribution of 24-year-old Steven Spielberg is also noteworthy. Despite some initial additions to cameras that cast shadows on actors and actresses, it adds some elegant and complex touches to support the overall professionalism of the ring. One of the most striking images is the dead body of Jim Ferris on the warehouse, almost dark in the foreground, while Ken Franklin raised a glass in the background after he finished answering a phone call with the tragic wife of Ferris. I have no doubt that working under a restricted schedule of 10 to 14 days, Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the second murder, necessitated by a blackmail scheme, was planned by a friend of Franklin's friend (who is sarcastically referred to as "Colombo" by Colombo in his Climate Brief) takes steam from everything. The plot's advanced plot is in jeopardy and the screen time between Valk and Cassidy is unbearably reduced at this point, perhaps to help the screenwriter Stephen Bochu emerge from a narrow angle, because he can not develop the story uniquely without another murder. <br /> <br /> Peak is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial joking and the exchange of words between Volk and Cassidy are carried out vigorously and effectively, but he announces the fact that he should have been more in the loop. The main flaw in the idea of ​​sealing (if it can be called an idea): Cassidy's character has so far been arrogant and arrogant. They are surprisingly expelled by an idea that does little to mean his guilt; once mentioned, he surrenders in an uncharacteristic and unfamiliar way To some extent. <br /> <br /> In general, there is a bold opening of the series, which inevitably proclaims and predicts all that is good about Colombo, on the contrary, the problems associated with such ingenuity, namely maintaining high standards and especially creating a reliable and intelligent end appropriately.
