This is an excellent film. As a Canadian he grew up with a rustic lifestyle, much of it familiar, winter, rowing, fishing, hunting and the like. It's easy to take familiar things for granted, but after watching this movie many times it has grown on me. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians attributed to Ateneboro director and screenwriter, Nicholson to expand the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan depicts a complex man, a very good performer. Annie Gallipo is beautiful in her first major role. The rest of the cast is solid.
