Othello, Shakespeare's classic story about love, betrayal, lies, tragedy. I remember that I was studying this story in high school, I actually found that Othello was probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of the fact that it was wonderful, and the fact that Shakespeare possessed a feeling of friendship, love and racism altogether. I mean, when you really study this story, you can go into many philosophies about why Othello's jealousy is in the blink of an eye. But later on my report I saw this version of Othello and I had to say it was very impressive. Lawrence and Kenneth pick up the story well and realize it's dark. <br /> <br /> Othello is the great soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello has infiltrated with his daughter, Dedimona, the king is angry, but has ruled him out. Othello is welcome in the city and offers his best friend, Casio, his side-leg instead of Iago, who stands beside Othello. Because of the crazy jealousy, he went out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he hints at Othello that Desdemona is betraying him with Casio, never saying they are, just making Othello believe he is happening. Othello is mad and has no pleasant plans for Dismona or Casio and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello's story is amazing, and I highly recommend reading it. It's an amazing story that makes you think after reading it. Othello's film is also wonderful, and again I recommend him, he has completely captured the story and has a great sense of humor, or may be in a severe shock of what happens between Othello and Desimona, to what extent he believes true love will betray him. This is a wonderful film, a great representation, good sets, and a good direction, that's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
