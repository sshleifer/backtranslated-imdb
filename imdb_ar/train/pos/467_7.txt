This film is one of the best films of the year 2000, which is definitely one of my best films. The scenario relies on the novel Vladimir Nabokov and transferred to the great screen very cool. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is excellent as well as the representation of Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely gives his best performance yet proves it is worth much more than we thought. Watson also performs brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a Turturro chess player who is also eccentric in his daily life. The film is presented at a non-linear time, with several memories of Lucien's childhood. Through those, the complex character of Luzhin is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say, but I suggest this movie to anyone.
