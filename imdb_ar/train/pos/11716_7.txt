Cassandra Peterson originally designed Elvira as a TV host for late night horror movies, and when her character proved unexpectedly popular, she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer ads to sites in The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Reached its peak popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK, was the result. <br /> <br /> The plot is the weight of the fly. Host of a horror TV movie Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt died, she traveled to New England in the hope that the estate would provide enough money to support a theatrical show; she was disappointed to find that she inherited a rundown house, a dog, and an old book. It happens that the city is more extreme than any description, and raises a straight mess everywhere you go. It also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil witch and is determined to put the "old book". Take a look at a few teenagers, a lover's cake, a hateful, lying woman and go there. <br /> <br /> No one accuses her of being a cinematic masterpiece, and she withdraws from time to time. But Cassandra Peterson highlights the tremendous taste from start to finish: thrilling, exciting, and combines low humor with flashes of sharp comedy, and she dances through the film like the circus director of a circus of corneal jokes and often mocks herself. From the disaster of FLASHHDANCE to the madness of magic, they are nothing less than violent entertainment. It's a huge amount of fun, and the film's conclusion manages even a great thrill generation. Will the poor man improve her wicked uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll get a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is fine and there are a few extra items, but if you are in the mood for something ridiculous, it is certain that this will answer the desire. If you never see tassle-twirling, you will get treatment. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Amazon
