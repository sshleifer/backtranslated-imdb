FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of SF Hollywood movies. Its effect has been felt for more than a decade. However, some of the elements of how this wide-screen entertainment is targeted to the mid-1950s audience, which has now disappeared, have been slightly dated, and sometimes slow film speed has not helped. But the compelling central idea of ​​the story of Karl's ancient civilization and the "monsters of identity" has not lost its attractiveness and continues to make this film a "must see" film. What I am interested to say here is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The film never looked very good in the home video and its elements were in desperate need of restoration. I hope it happens soon and we get a special version of this classic SF movie.
