A series of random robberies that look tiny at her sister's house has angered Mrs. Lemon. Ring, light bulbs, backpack, lighter, stethoscope, shoe? There seems to be no rhyme or reason for any of them. Ms. Limon asks her employer, the Belgian big investigator Hercules Poirot, to look into it. But what Boart sees is a much more evil thing than Miss Lemon imagined. Bourout's fears were confirmed when a student living in the house was killed. It's up to Poirot to bring a murderer to justice. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock is a strong but not spectacular entry into the long Poirot series. I appreciate how well the script fulfills the original Agatha Christie story. I realize that some freedoms must be taken, but I appreciate this effort. The main points of the puzzle are all there? Small robberies, internal boarding, students, torn suitcase and, of course, the ability of Poirot to see something evil happen before it actually happens. Except for some exceptions, the group of students is almost as pictured for them. Damien Lewis and Jessica Lloyd occupy a prominent position in the group. While I always enjoy David Sochitt, I get a real kick from episodes with Philip Jackson's Inspector Japp and Pauline Moran's Miss Lemon. This episode is a real experience where Ms. Lemon gets a larger screen time than usual. Finally, I enjoyed using the mouse that is currently being monitored for activities in the hostel. It's a fun little play called Hickory Dickory Dock. <br /> <br /> During the re-viewing of Hickory Dickory Dock, I realized exactly what Agatha Christie's enormous influence on the Italian films was highly embellished, or my generation, the sixties and seventies. Take the murder of Mrs. Nicolet as an example. If you want to climb the graphic nature of the scene, you will get something from the early seventies in Giallo. In fact, it was possible to use the entire Hickory Decorative Duck plot in Gialo. It's just coiled and interesting enough to work.
