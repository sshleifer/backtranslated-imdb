I love watching this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the birds of prey. I love the birds of prey because they are scary. My favorite parts are those seen by the Raptor behind the column because it reminds me of a scene from the film on Friday the 13th with a girl eating bananas. <br /> <br /> I really like to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics look a bit fake but it's fine because once you get into the movie, you hardly notice anything that happens and I think it got a good ending even though I did not really understand What happened was the first couple observations emerged over time and this is the important part. Another important part is how dinosaurs can be scary if you watch it the first time. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie.
