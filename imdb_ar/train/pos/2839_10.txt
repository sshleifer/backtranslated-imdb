I watched this movie in advanced view and found it excellent. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a real spin in a romance story that explores the smart, funny and sometimes shocking attitudes about the most powerful feelings of the human race. <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, a real circumstance 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawk, Xia Labov, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all make some spectacular performances in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that there are some directors who collect stories in clever and interesting ways. Brett Ratner, Shaka Kapoor, Natalie Portman, I mean -Wow! This film is not romantic ahead or romantic comedy, although romantic and funny. It also has serious stories and observations. But that's good in my opinion. Go see it yourself and respond to my evaluation, I want to hear what others say.
