Diagnosis Murder is one of the only shows I regularly watch on TV now. The way in which all the major characters work in each episode makes it different from today's programs, focusing on one or two people in each episode and every other person who straddles it. The way the brain is working is also so vague that you never know what to think, and if you think you're doing it, you're wrong. <br /> <br /> The murder dealt with a variety of topics, not just in cases but in each of the characters a personal life. Everything from racism, adoption, terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> As for the elderly? I'm 24 years old! I do not think it can be rated as old yet. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when all eight chapters will be released on DVD (not NTSC) so I can see them all in order. They seem to do so with a lot of other programs from the same era, so they can speed it up a bit!
