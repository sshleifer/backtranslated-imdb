Mahatma was portrayed as a man who neglected his son in this film. Do not get me wrong I do not condemn the film; it is a wonderful film and came out of the cinema with a tumor in my throat. We need to understand Mahatma's spiritual status, he is a true spiritual leader. Only the enlightened man can separate from his loved ones. A man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example. According to the film, he talked to his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilal who had little intelligence could not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilal, Mahatma remained calm and accepted that his son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If there were any other parents, they would have risked their values ​​to help the son to stand on his feet. Mahatma did not, he is the real leader to be emulated.
