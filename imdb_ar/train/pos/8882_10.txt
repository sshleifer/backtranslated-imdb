John Singleton's best film, before famous gambling films such as the new Shaft edition, is a thought-provoking film with a wonderful public representation and a striking balance between the three main characters, each with its own specific youth problems. <br /> <br /> The most he likes is that it also covers the problem of self-sufficiency among young blacks, a problem most ignored by the media and other films that often focus on social, economic and racial discrimination by whites. This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The tricky thing about this movie is that it deals with many topics without becoming shallow. It is not just about racism, but about how difficult it is to embrace a new world, rape of dates, the discovery of sexual activity and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Christie Swanson make great performances, and the supporting team is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly Kalez (Yai) and Ice Cube and Busta Rimes as university college students who cause little riots. <br /> <br /> The only negative is a caricature of the Professor by Lawrence Fishburne ("Mint?"). Sure, a lot of professors are nutty. But it is not flat. The hairheads are also part of the cartoons, but I think they are in real life. <br /> <br /> In general, a great piece of great cinematic work, if you love American history X you like it. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
