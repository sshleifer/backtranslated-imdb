John Thoben is an excellent actor. I must admit that I was impressed with his collection as an old barber reluctantly agreeing to get off the streets of London (World War II). <br /> <br /> This is said, excellent film is also a very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some characters lag slightly (especially the school teacher), but none are necessary for the scheme. Basically, the story revolves around the old man and the boy, and the film needs a little.
