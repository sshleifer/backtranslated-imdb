I used to watch this show when I was a kid and loved it! I watched it when it comes to Toonami years ago .... Sheesh, I look very old! I must be 13 or 14 years old ... but anyway, he had a wonderful plot line, and I was one of those girls who saw (and loved) Sailormoon, and I enjoyed it a lot. The animations were not the best .... In some parts it was quite amusing, and the vocal representation was very lame at first, but it was a good hour and I found myself full of it day after day. Samurai Roppers / Ronin Warriors is a classic, one of all my favorite times. Go Rio!
