As usual, I always like to read reviews of "hate" for any given film. Particularly those that I would like to comment on. And it's not a point-to-point deal. I just want to see what people are saying on the other side. <br /> <br /> However, I want to address one thing. Many people who hate her have called it, to rephrase, "beautiful, but shallow", so that some went so far as to say that the desire of the standard but the inability to help his brother was a worldly conspiracy, at best. <br /> <br /> I would like to disagree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a brotherhood with a similar dysfunction, I can speak. Daily, see them mistreat themselves, and they only know that their current path will inevitably destroy themselves. Not about the details of what they did when; how or why Paul decided to deal with gambling and connect with dubious persons; it's really more how they are wired. On the one hand, they are real geniuses, and on the other hand, they destroy themselves painfully (very much like people like Howard Hughes?) The same forces that drive them are the same forces that tear them apart. All the time you see this, you know this, and worse , You realize that you can not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> For Norman McLean, the river through which he passed may be a way to find an answer why the tragedy must take place, and who is to blame. In the end, there is no one, and often there is no reason for it. But it takes a lot of personal pain to really get to that realization. Sometimes it takes a lifetime. And sometimes it never comes at all.
