I took the opportunity of "Hardcastle and McCormick" to buy Amazon's first season (Canadian version). When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I was hooked immediately afterwards. I have a 5 star value on Amazon and I rated it 10 stars here. It's just good. What I liked about it was the opening and closing themes, and of course the motto of Stephen Cannell at the end of each episode, but most of all, the relationship between the judge and Mark while working together to eliminate each case. I was so hooked that I also bought the second season as a comrade and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this excellent series on disk, I think you should buy it and place it in your collection.
