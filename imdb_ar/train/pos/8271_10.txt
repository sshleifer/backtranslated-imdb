Brown is one of 1926's greatest songs, an exciting comedy / drama that shows boat racing and football that gave William Haines the role he needs to become a major star. She patented Heinz along the way: smart aleck scream who does not take anything serious until he is rejected by everyone becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. No one works this formula like Haines. Haines is a wonderful actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Beckford, show people with Marion Davis), Haines can swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. It is a joy in this film because he was in the film "Tell him to the Marines" (with Color Shani) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Bryan is as good as the girl and Jack Beckford is very good like the sick room mate, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrens, Geen Williams and Grady Sutton took part in the tournament. This film is now referred to because of the homogeneous relationship between Haines and Beckyford and being first seen in John Wayne as a Yale football player (but I never saw him). Haines was a star at the box office among the top five films that began from this picture until 1932. It is a shame that he has largely forgotten and most of his films seem to have been lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
