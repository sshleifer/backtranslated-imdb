An excellent film shows the pathetic life of two old ladies. They could not live together, nor separately. Constantly raving, and sometimes at the same time, they have assembled and regrouped the past; happen and what about Kanda Kanda. I found myself laughing sometimes, but I often felt very sad and abandoned those two women. See this one.
