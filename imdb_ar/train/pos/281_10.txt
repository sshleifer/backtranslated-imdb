This game was really fantastic and a great challenge. It has a wonderful story line and scary and very good graphics too. I recommend this game to all horror lovers and capture from start to finish. The only problem in this game is that I wanted to get more weapons but that's just for me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG fans and Shoot'em'up. <br /> <br />>
