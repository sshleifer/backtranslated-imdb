Legend of Dragoon is one of the unknown games that people like or dislike. Some people claim that it is very similar to other games, the Final Fantasy series - which is understandable, because it was originally intended to be equivalent to Final Fantasy. Frankly I can not comment on the similarities beyond that, since I am not familiar with FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite side of the game is the battle system. Not only do you have the ability to change to a more powerful drag model, but every time you attack, you must pay attention to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right time. Not only that, the enemies sometimes attack you directly in the middle of the sequence, which means you have to press different buttons to avoid damage. Even using certain attack elements requires a little mash button. If you do not want to attack, you can always guard, which not only reduces any damage done in half, but raises your hitting points without using treatment doses. <br /> <br /> FMV files are very good done, the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. However, the graphics during play do not live up to this standard. It's nice, but it could have been - frankly, it should have been - better. The translation also leaves something to the desired level. It not only raises interesting questions about personal relationship, but there are also some grammatical errors that should not be allowed to pass. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found interesting was that you lose key characters in the party - one dies, the other becomes essentially useless to the party and leaves. While the death of one character is said to be of no use, it makes you realize early that the characters, while the heroes, are still as deadly as the next person. People who replace lost characters simply acquire all their statistics, so the transitional transition game is fairly smooth. Perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the interest of the main personal love, Shana. It is an example of the helpless woman who needs rescue, so pathetic that it leads the player to scream in frustration. Although you can use it in your party, it is insanely weak - I do not even know what its tremendous power is, so I hated it so much and never used it. On the contrary, Rose is my favorite female character in any game at all. It's not a herd, and some of her dragon charms are extremely helpful. Miro is also very strong, while sometimes being an annoying talkative poet. <br /> <br /> Personal designers, like most of them, tended to make female characters look beautiful or whatever, and did not think much about the actual benefit of fashion. Seriously, there are no shields and most of your skin is exposed when fighting against monsters. But I will give them the props, where they have females serving as knights in different countries. <br /> <br /> I can not comment too much on this plot, as frankly I did not care much about it then so I needed to go to the next. I'm not sure if this makes any sense about the plot itself or the way I play. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a very fun game. It has its drawbacks, but for me it has achieved the right balance of having to think and just press the buttons and kill the monsters.
