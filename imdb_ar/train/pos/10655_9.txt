It seems to be a perfect day to swim. The regular family wants to take advantage of it and take a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under a sidewalk and his wife or little son can not help him in this - while the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and looks for help. <br /> <br /> John Sturgis's short film (69 minutes) is strong because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a man who can help, but there is a price he has to pay for it. There is a double question posed by the film. How far will you go to help the man you love, and on the other hand - watch Stanwick's behavior toward the stranger - do you really love her husband? Like a good short story, this film leaves the viewer with questions that he can only answer.
