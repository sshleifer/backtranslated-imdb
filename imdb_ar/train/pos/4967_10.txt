This movie is a must for all people who enjoy football as a shroud. What is striking about this film about the FIFA World Cup is how it is portrayed. In addition to watching the play like television, there are generous shots dedicated to individual players in the games. This brings the feelings and attitudes of these men as they try to reach glory. Still the current television broadcasting method, quite different from 1986, is less quality than this film. <br /> <br /> Players are not just stars. The audience, referees and journalists who cover the matches and the environment themselves play a key role in the development of what is today's history. In this film, you can see how all these factors play together in a very clear way. In this regard, the method of television broadcasting today has not reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are several prominent players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkayer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Leinker (England), Rummenigge (Germany) ), Socrates (Brazil) and SÃ¡nchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This film is not one of the best football moves in Mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. Throughout the film, there is pressure to present several aspects of the game and the contest itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the expense of skipping the related plays of the games themselves. This makes this film interesting and very unique. <br /> <br /> Because of the referees during Mexico 1986, many comments about this film and the World Cup are very biased with Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two team aides, they are human beings like players, and that all of the above are making mistakes in one way or another. Football rules do not allow referees to use television-based repays to make decisions, so in most cases judges have to decide what they see. As a result, the referees play an active role in developing the game. Their impact can be seen in several parts of this film. <br /> <br /> The 1990 World Cup supplement, compared to this film, is just a source of bitter disappointment. Much of it comes from the fact that he has been heavily involved in the game, while this film tells things from a distant and unbiased perspective.
