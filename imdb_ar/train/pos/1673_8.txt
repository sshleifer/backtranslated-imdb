It's a great trip from Martino, a lively and fun giallo game with great performances from well-dressed actors, mainly George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the mystery in the plot is for me. It is very complicated and confusing for you to just sit and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. Only when everything seems determined, we face again a series of pleasant twists and turns, it must be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy with lots of gory kills this wonderful movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal sites. The super finale laid on the Aegean rocks wraps things and was a lot of fun by everyone.
