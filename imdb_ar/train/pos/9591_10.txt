Excellent documentary. Personally I remember this grew up in New York City in the early 1980s. This movie is for anyone who did not exist during that time period. This shows the only thing African-Americans feel and that they represent their love and girlfriend. Real people Unfortunately, a few of them are still alive because this is written. The balls are still held but not as much as they were in the 1990s. This time went forever. This is a good movie before "Homo Thug". When Queens was really proud to be open. Goodbye to Storville This is another era gone but the film is pretty much documented every chill!
