It's a great-looking movie with everything done in just six or seven colors. When he came out more than 15 years ago, viewers were amazed by his color scheme, which was completely different from anything else on the film. These colors, to me at least, make this movie very cool to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I hope will freeze and somehow transform them into a study board for their artwork. <br /> <br /> The characters and the story do not match the grandeur of photography, but they are all above the top, especially the bad guys. The famous actors who have played here should have a lot of fun on the group that plays "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles" and so on. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Warren Petty and Glen Headley are as good as Dick Tracy and his girlfriend Tess Truhart, which is as sweet and smooth as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Cursmo where the little boy dicks Dick and Tice playing under their wing. Other colorful characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forthist, Paul Sorfino, Mandi Patinkin, Madonna and other names you know but there are many names you can not mention here. Check out the full credits on the home page and you'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only drawbacks I found were Pacino's voice which you grate on after a moment, the sound of Madonna singing outside the key and the fact that the movie will have been trimmed better about 10 minutes. All these "flaws" are simple because this is a fun movie .... An animated bar appears in life in unbelievably bright colors ..... like anything you have never seen before.
