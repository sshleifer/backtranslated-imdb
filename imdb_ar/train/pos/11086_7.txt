I saw this movie when I was young - it was called "Glacier Fox". I was quite shocked by it! It follows a small family of fox. It was a great start and I remember that I was very attached to the small foxes. I also remember that my mother was carrying me out of the theater while I was hysterical. I will not tell you what happened, but let's just say it does not end well for all the foxes. You're used to writing natural Disney movies where animals do not really die. Hey man. This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good film ... I think - I was really small and told the truth - I remember being happy with the foxes and then I see someone die. Rent it if you can, but do not show your children!
