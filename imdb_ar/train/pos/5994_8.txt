I was pleased to see Ryan Jaffrey's short film "The Cure" for the first time. What really impressed me was the camera and music work. <br /> <br /> I think many young filmmakers (myself myself one) will have a hard time filming when they start making indie. We see that the output is not exactly what we photographed or without our ambitions. But this film, for the first time directed by a young director, was treated very well on screen. Camera movement, color, lighting, and composition all contribute to the story and emotion of the film. <br /> <br /> Music, as a key element in the language of the film, also helps a lot. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to portray a woman's heart, desire and fear, especially in a short period of time. But still, I must admit that I am not a fan of v / o (narration), especially when the film is presented by narration, rather than shots and pieces. My personal feeling of some narrative part is, I think the narrator tried a little bit. Thus, energy drives the audience to retreat from the passion of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a short film that's done well, and I can see the input from the exit. Way to go, Ryan! Greetings from China, looking forward to your next. <br /> <br /> Tim
