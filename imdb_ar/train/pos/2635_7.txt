My Take: A funny shot on THE LION KING, a demonstration as a sequel. Surprisingly amusing. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually a funny, live video that deserves drama therapy. I do not know why Disney released this video directly, and made crazy movies like Little Chicken and Back to Neverland. It's best to watch these movies in video stores (in the "new releases" area), rather than watching theatrical posters outside the theaters. <br /> <br /> This film is just a parody of the first film (although the events in "Simba's Pride" have not yet taken place, Timon (expressed by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella's view). The events from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their vocal roles from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give some comical comic relief like Mom Timon and his angry uncle. <br /> So it's not that fun sound.Not maybe now, but go see it for yourself.The fact that it's not serious in its plot makes it more fun.It's kinda like the MST3000 with Timon and Pu mbaa. <br /> <br /> Rated Videos: *** 1/2 of 5.
