"Hundstage" is the first fantasy film from Seidl (before that he produced great documentaries such as "Animal Love" or "Mannequins"). Seidl has worked in this project for over 3 years but cost only about $ 2 million. The actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who have played their part. The cinema is also good. The entire film is disturbing, and some scenes may be too much for "ordinary" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence but also that people feel lonely and unable to communicate with each other. Finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most famous films of Austria in the past years. Please excuse my bad English. <br /> <br />
