The authors Perry and Randy Hawes coined a very interesting little story in "Chances". <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a man returning to his former wife's house several years later, the plot takes unexpected and pleasant training. <br /> <br /> The twenty-four-year-old Robert Downey offers a great performance Junior, skillfully assisted by Cybil Shepherd as widow and Ryan O'Neill as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has only the proper chemistry for this grandeur, playing each other in a graceful manner. I have watched this movie several times on TV, and each time I found it more fun.
