New York City fashion model Alison Parker (Christina Rains) rents a room in an old brown stone where she meets some of the strange neighbors and experiences some dreadful hallucinations. While lawyer Khalil Lerman (Chris Sarandon) talks on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her integrity (not to mention her desire to live) because her experience negatively affects her physical, mental and emotional health. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil better moments in the psychological horror film for those who are not familiar with it. The story is exciting and entertaining, but the film does not offer much in terms of real fear. Or, in this regard, any atmosphere. It's kind of a villain, but it's not like a traditional horror movie. It is more than a story about a troubled woman's attempts to deal with the increasing realism of her life. At this level, it works, but it is not strong enough. <br /> <br /> What the "Sentinel" offers is some amazing pieces (especially, the magnificent peak, the magnificent creep, and there is a scene with Beverly Dangelo that must be seen as thought). There are also some things to see, but not too much. The melodious music of Gil Melle adds to the danger. <br /> <br /> The review of this film will not be completed without an assessment of the film directors in the collection of such excellent representatives of his group. Some of them can not do much, but seeing them all together is impressive. Elie Walsh and Bourges Meredith are the most impressionable, respectively, as the hard-nosed reporter and neighbor. Other legendary names include Jos√© Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum show short appearances, and other familiar faces are Jerry Auerbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. The director of this film deserves a prize of some kind. <br /> <br /> Written by Michael Weiner on screen, and perhaps best known for his "Death Wish" series with Charles Bronson, by Jeffrey Convitz. <br /> <br /> I will not consider this a truly terrifying film, but it has its moments and is reasonably amusing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
