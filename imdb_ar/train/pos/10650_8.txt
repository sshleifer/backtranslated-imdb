I rented this movie last weekend and got a surround sound system and got a wonderful sound of special effects. This film is a wonderful movie rental, and the film especially affects enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed that some seemed to have been created by the computer. I did not go to the cinema and I see it, but late at night I do not feel like going out of the movie. I would recommend it!
