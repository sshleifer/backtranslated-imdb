I watched the whole movie last night and found it very exciting. It was at least not like the films of teenage sailors that are published from time to time. Look for the killer and the "partner" relationship between the hero & the so-called bad guy was parts I liked in the movie. Also, I remember that I was on the edge of my seat during a certain scene in the film. I mean it's exciting. Maybe later, I might watch the film again. ..
