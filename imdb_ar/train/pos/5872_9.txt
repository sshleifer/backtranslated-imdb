Who votes in these ratings? "Jacknife" is a piece of fine-grained and brilliantly watched work, with actors on top of their game, especially Ed Harris and Robert Dineiro (please do not mention Marlon Brando in the same man as "Taxi" to confirm this point). Is it a "mundane" movie because it does not contain sex / act / nudity meaningless. This film revolves around the complexities of the characters concerned. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him, and his emotional rush toward the end is sad. The part that a young man orders in a pub to take off his military clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and film are used to the tragic situations and how well-liked real men feel of a young, arrogant military outfit. While we are on the subject, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films of all time, from one of the greatest directors, starring the greatest cinematic actor of all time, with the most thrilling gangster films ever made, does it guarantee only above average? Come on!!!!!
