The first TV show Barbara Streisand was fantastic! From a comedian as a child to her collection of high-end fashion stores - everything was at the highest level! It was easy to understand how I got these special awards. <br /> <br /> The guest has not been marred by the features, but Barbara has remained focused on the whole production.
