<br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is a vibrant and vibrant movement image with the power of a high octane star and plenty of cars with a great look. If you're a car enthusiast, this product, through producer Jerry Brockheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock"), deserves to be seen just to look at the shiny cars. Although the film produces a faint smell in many areas, its delicate sense of excitement and excitement makes it a rather exciting journey in the summer. <br /> <br /> The stars of the film, "The Mod Squad," act as an impostor named Kip Raines, who, with the opening of the film, failed to present a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclestone) ). When Kip's life is threatened by this, his older brother Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicholas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is invited to complete a mission in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars specified by the model, color, year and makeup in just four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis spends the first three days recruiting a bandit to help him get rid of the robbery. The crew includes Sarah "Way" (Angelina Jolie), a cheating retired sex fraudster who knows Memphis through previous works, a fellow named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), and wise old age Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), Tombler (Scott Kan) Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), Donnie Astrique (Che Macburdy). <br /> <br /> Contributing to the film and tension campaign is a sub-scheme of two police officers, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drikoff (Timothy Olivant), who suspect past experience that Memphis and his crew have not reached a good level and are watching Closely followed. <br /> <br /> There is not much time to develop character here; the public recognizes these people through their rugged lifestyles and bears tough characters through solid, attractive and attractive films. To make matters worse for the film, the dialogue failed to identify the characters in a courageous cultural tone. I do not say that I think obscene and superficial words are necessary for excitement to thrive; I actually respect the director's decision to preserve the most awful language in a film that might have earned the R rating. However, I believe in a movie like "Gone in 60 Seconds ", To develop enlightenment of personality strongly, the dialogue must be reasonable and real. <br /> <br /> In spite of the problems, the characters are effective because of the first degree, the performers are fully responsible. The performance of Melodramat Nicolas Cage is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's flabby look is quite appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is a strong and delicious believer. Giovanni Ribesi, Scott Kane, Robert Duval, Will Patton, and Christopher Ecclestone provide convincing supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film has a standard structure, with the first disease explaining the story style and personal motivations, setting a fast-paced action theme, but lacks the depth and powerful introduction to the character. In the second chapter, we face some other problems: the story is wasting time during much of this part, never accumulating for the third act. While the middle of the film occupies a lot of time, the sexual scene provides a strong mid-plot, does not happen too much. The third chapter is a purely adrenalin rush that contains an angry stir from the wall to the wall and one of the most intense car chase chains ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for "Gone in 60 Seconds" greatly contributes to inspiring action scenes. They are scenes like car chases that make this film work despite many devastating flaws. Dominique Sena, whose career was mostly commercial, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds", which will give viewers two hours of turmoil, excitement and excitement. But not much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
