Thomas Capano was not the president of Anne-Marie Tom Carper, and was the governor as well. That is why the federalists, called Clinton and asked him to involve the Federal Reserve in the case. I was living outside Philadelphia at the time, and the issue was the front page news every day. I also read Ann Roll's book and saw the "Secret City" section on A & E. Tom Capano was a man of paranoia (sp.), Ruler of Abir and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie but all he wanted was someone who could control him. When she did not allow him to do so, he killed her, the form of final control. I think it's a waste of money still alive.
