In 1955, the British prepared a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kai Kendall. To this day, it is one of the finest examples of British comedy, in particular, about how popular television series have become popular. It has been and continues to be a great example of self-reference cinema. <br /> <br /> So is Soapdish, a movie I did not hear about until a few nights ago when I saw him on the late TV show. I was a bit dubious at first because comedy is very hard to do well, you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was surprised and pleased to see a very intelligent satire about American television during the day. In fact, it has been some time since I laughed hard. So, if you like spelling, I recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> Key actors? Sally Field, Kevin Klein, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty? Simply do an excellent job, revealing how little business is done. As I watched him, I kept thinking about myself: How much is this noise going to real life? That is, if the actors have a real life? As you know, Peter Sellers, for example, was notorious for hiding his true personality behind so many personalities, so that no one really knows the person. So when I saw Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought again that the former British film with Kai Kendall was playing Laura playing a character in the TV comedy series for Peter Finch. That some actors have nervous breakdowns? This feeling crystallized when Celeste finally confronted her daughter (Laurie, played by Elizabeth Choi). In an emotional moment, she repeated the fictional lines she used in a previous episode of her daytime soap when she encountered her fairy daughter in this way! Are you scattered abroad? Well, not so, but the dialogue is stunning for originality, comedy, dogs, anger, corruption, duplicity, and even ... love. <br /> <br /> Story? Well, there are many stories in this film, all tangled up, all of which end up (of course, but not like Robert Altman's, well!), And are not all solved in the end. Life is not so anyway, is it? The pace is almost non-existent, and you really have to watch it and listen carefully to capture all the hidden gags and jokes. Spend 97 minutes of your life watching it; you will not regret using time. <br /> <br /> All the actors performed well, although I did not take much time to Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the most radical exchanges between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty, and for my money, the latter steal a lot of scenes from others, and get my vote as a wonderful player. I dont you, they give the bitch term a whole new face ...
