Does anyone know exactly the citation for "Time and Love" for George Id alias, Father Fitzpatrick in this move, you had to be you? He was talking to Charlie and Anna in the church as they left? If not I would have to rent the movie. It was a wonderful time. I also love the coincidence! A wonderful love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my true love (my companion in life) and although I had the experience of meeting him when I expected it at least, I was not prepared for this kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> However, we got married, I was not mature enough to give what I thought I would do. I got satisfaction and took his love for granted and stood him for 7 years. <br /> <br /> I finally left resentment, but we are still in pain and angered and see our lack of faith in the way he appeared. I had some very hard lessons that I learned, and we have now gone through three years. <br /> <br /> This film meant a lot because I was still waiting to reconcile with my only true love and love. I can now appreciate this remarkable feeling inside me and quote Father Fitzpatrick's statement to me. <br /> <br /> I know when he has recovered enough to trust me again, and we will get married again. Never get the thrill and take true love to give! It was the hardest lesson in my life. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is also wonderful and amazing! This film is deeply and spiritually elevated. True love is worth waiting, if it is supposed to be, it, regardless of, will happen! Nothing is impossible, even when the second time! thanks!
