I was pleased with representatives of reputable players. The story is a story stand for some reason, even if you are in personal danger in doing so. While violence and pain are often at the top of the film, this film focuses on the good old cop. Although similar plots have been carried out over and over again, these men are pulling them well. Kick and enjoy. Dennehy is master of film control.
