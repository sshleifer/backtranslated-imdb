I have been a fan of this film for years and years. Because Terry Hatchers moved to the front, I had to take the film out of the shelf and watch it. Why did not people back in 1991 to what extent was this film wonderful? Sally Field and Kevin Klein are out of shape. Although I did not watch TV shows during the day, this film kills me every time I see it. Representation is second to none for comedy and very clever writing. I strongly recommend that you see this if you have not already done so. You'll see Elizabeth Choi, Wipi Goldberg, Terry Hatter, and Carrie Fisher ... to name just a few.
