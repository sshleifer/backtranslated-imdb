This story may have been one of the most powerful stories I have ever seen. John Singleton certainly went even further when collecting this educational masterpiece. Great performance by the entire crew, but Epps and Rapaport managed the best and convinced the career of any young star. <br /> <br /> However, as a university student myself, many of the issues addressed by Singleton have been addressed to the fullest extent. In the sense that despite the problems it faces in many universities, it does not offer much or open abroad because this film makes one think. In some cases, it seemed strange to believe that something like this could actually happen. However, apart from the fact that it was a bit more drama, the film was wonderful and left me stunned, unable to speak, just thinking. One of the things I will remember forever is borrowed from Laurence Fishburne's character, "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see your strength." Fantastic, just fantastic.
