Another one of those movies you hear about from friends (... or read about them on IMDb). There are not many wrong observations in this one. I could see everything actually happening here to a little girl running from a blocked town in Tennessee to Florida, with all her mundane possessions in a broken old car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, is doing some wrong beginnings, but he learns from them. I found myself wondering why, and why did not they lean a little more on Mike's shoulder, but ... have their reasons, as it turned out. <br /> <br /> Just a good movie. The only thing I do not like very much, I think, is the address.
