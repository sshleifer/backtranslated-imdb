Frankly, I had no idea what it was like when I started it. So I watch movies whenever possible. No preview. I thought this would be a film about the stones in the woods or something. I've been wrong, kinda. <br /> <br /> Loaded was a bit boring at first, but once I started working, it was self-destructive. I know that the feeling of being absorbed into something dangerous feels helpless, but to do things you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how silly and absurd this film was, but I beg for disagreement. These kinds of things happen. I'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy attitudes are "unreasonable". Really sorry but the fact of the world is that they are speaking. The creator of this film as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things could go wrong and how people could make really bad choices. Sometimes things turn out to be a good thing, sometimes they turn into a bad situation and this is life. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie.
