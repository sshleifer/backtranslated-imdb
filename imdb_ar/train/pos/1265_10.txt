Hi .. I consider Just Cause one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, it's a thrilling psychological story with excellent cast shows, especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines I have seen in movies, so the dialog box is very good in this movie. It also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when Sean interviews Ed Harris's character in prison, she's so wonderful .. I enjoyed this a lot and I can not recommend this enough, do not really miss this! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that indicate that the last 30 minutes suck, it was as thick as the rest of the film, and I really find Just Cause a very enjoyable movie ..
