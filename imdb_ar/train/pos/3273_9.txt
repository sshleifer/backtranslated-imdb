I give it only 9 out of 10, because I need to see it again, within a more modern mental framework so I have a new perspective. What I remember was an amazing psychological excitement that stunned my mind and my eye when I saw it. I was watching him every time he showed HBO in the day (maybe 1990 or so). I may have registered it, but this registration is over, and I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title, they do not hold it right now. I hope I can find it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend trying it if you find it somewhere. It's interesting at least. If you enjoy movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or anything weird along these lines, try this show.
