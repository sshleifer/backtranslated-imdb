"All the world stage and the actors in it" - or something like that. Who the hell said that the theater stopped at the pit of the orchestra - or even at the stage door? Why do not participants participate in the play experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> The film was a great experience: "The story is you and it needs more than your interest. It needs your active participation." "Sometimes we bring you the story, sometimes you have to go to the story." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately no one has listened, but that does not mean it should not be said.
