Deodato brings us some moderately appalling moments and the film does not take itself seriously. Totally classic in it's particular kind of way. This film provides a refreshingly different look at barbarians. If you get a chance to see this movie, do so. You will definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because they are funny or anything as ordinary as that, but because they are so bad they flip in the other direction and become good, although they may not be clean and fun.
