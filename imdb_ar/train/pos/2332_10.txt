"Imagine if I could bring things back to life with just one touch." As soon as I heard it for the first time, my attention was closed on the trailer, and after the first episode I found myself in love with this show. A modern day tale brings my spirit and attention to me throughout the show. I think acting and casting are ideal, each character brings something unique to the display that adds to perfection. Even the only time the villains were able to feel a unique feeling, from a bee man to a man who can swallow cats, does not seem to ever let me down. And deaths that would normally lead to bleak moments that often end up being pure comedy (such as the Book of Explosive Scratch and Shame) <br /> <br /> Even with a large amount of crimes, we now have days, daisies are one Of the few that really stand out for the rest, being not just a mystery but a love story, a comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama, are all wrapped in one wonderful pie ..... err show. <br /> <br /> What shocked me was the fact that he was on ABC, for years I had no reason to go to ABC, but that brought me back every week with a smile on my face. It was as if the "push daisies" brought ABC back to life for me. But so, after two seasons, a few awards, a large base of fans and positive feedback from critics, the program was dropped. It seems as though Ned has touched ABC again and killed him forever for me. I will always be impressed with this offer and recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talk and lots of love from the shows they watch.
