For me, this is the most perfect film in Ealing Studio - after half a century as new and relevant as it was the day it was released. <br /> <br /> As spelling about the economic concepts of "growth" and the commercial need for a built-in obsolescence, it may be hardly more modern. And what can be said about the other film that the hero is literally wearing the plot? <br /> <br /> It is strange that there are similarities with Jurassic Park, where the tampering with the environment literally turns into a bite. But Spielberg has moved away from the brilliant central idea in the book to overcome some nonsense about "children." Hmm. <br /> <br /> In the movie The Man in the White Suit, Alec Guinness plays an ideal young scientist with a cloth that never gets dirty or worn. Suddenly, workers and capital unite in the Northern English laboratory where he works unmatched in protecting their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Ealing, it's a comedy, but it was not. The complex interaction of vested interests (must be appropriate?) Is beautifully manipulated, as all parties recognize that "progress" is a threat, and that waste disposal and waste are turning to the horizon. <br /> <br /> But, yes, this comedy - albeit pointed - and amidst political paradoxes are delicious shows, and some old-fashioned laughs narrow. <br /> <br /> However, they are satire which bears - dazzling and white.
