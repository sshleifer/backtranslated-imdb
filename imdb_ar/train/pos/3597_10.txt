(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This movie blew me up. I've been renting a little movielink and decided to check out this movie. It looks like a lot of boxing movies are drowning in blood. In this movie, it shows an amature level. Although I hope that perhaps more attention has been paid to improving its markings. The film refers to the problems some families face between the sexes. <br /> <br /> I was very interested in the result. But the end was not so disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think it was very clear from the title you won. What was unexpected was that the two had somehow come back together in the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the result for some scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Restart: 10 / 10
