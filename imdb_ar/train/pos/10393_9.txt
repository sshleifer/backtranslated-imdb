Let's shorten a long story. I love every minute of it. A luxurious fantasy in the style of real Arabian nights. There is a wicked wizard, a beautiful princess, a department and everyone lives happily ever after. The modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from these classics. Just Laughing: The special effects are pretty much dated (I love Sabo with the foot of the Jinn, though!)
