It takes patience to get to the strange story of David Lynch, but for change - a sure history of life on the Alvin Street journey, but stick to it. Although it is just as slow as John Deere of Straight, when you meet the gentle strangers along the pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, regret and painful secrets, and ultimately family power and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth goes beyond his career with the most realistic performance of the year, sad and poetic, courteous and caring. Sissy Spacek matches him with his "slow" daughter Rose, who is losing her own while caring for her father. Rarely is a recent film published positively on the family.
