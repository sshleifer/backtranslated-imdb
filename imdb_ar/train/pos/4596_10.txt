This is the best film for Jackie Chan and my favorite profile. After making the disappointing "The Protector" by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the idea and put it in Hong Kong. This is probably also the most violent Jackies movie, where the audience swings in stunning stunts. <br /> <br /> The action was quick and furious, Jackie and his crew really did the utmost to design the fighting. Bone fractures and bloodletting have been done in the process of making this movie as you will see in credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a police case and simple thieves, nothing special, after all that was written about work. I must say that the English version contains some dodgy dubbing, but should not prevent you much. <br /> <br /> So, get ready for the boys, open the beer and enjoy. By the way, the film was called "The Glass Story" by a stunt crew. why? Will let you know for yourself!
