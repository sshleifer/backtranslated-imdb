I loved this movie! I'm a real fan of Tom Hanks, and I've always been impressed with all his work. His most important roles include Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. To his hilarious roles such as A League of own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big & of course Toy Story. But in this film, Hanks is not the only great actor who shines the screen. Tyler Hweklin, the rising and coming star who shows a great promise in the Hollywood stars participating as the son of Hanks and does not perform well. He is certainly a person to be noticed during his career, and I think he will do a lot. Paul Newman as always offers great performance on the screen. It's really a myth. We can not forget people who do not have such big roles in the film, but they helped make it great. Jennifer Lee, the very beautiful and talented actress who performs in the film "Bastard Out of Carolina" and "Single White Female", will never forget her, bringing her grace on screen as Hank's wife in the film and doing a great job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the film. He does a great job with such a small role, like his roles in Lemony Snickets, Sweet November, and I dream of Africa doing great.
