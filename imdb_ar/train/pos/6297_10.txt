My friends and I have been discussing only how frustrated we are about the way in which films are made, especially romantic comedy. We are insulted by Hollywood's coup these days because it acts like everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Well, everything is not so good ... except for some bright spots, such a movie. She does not have senior reps, big budget, do not think she has a big release (I've rented a video from Hollywood video) he did not have anything owned by most of the big budget romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> But he had what most of them lacked. She had a great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Shitch) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was not imposed on us like many. The director took his time to let these people know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> The supporting actor did not only add funny comic moments, but also added depth to the story. The character of James Legros was invaluable. He was a Sam friend like me hysterical. Parker's interaction with fellow staff at the Psychological Line was very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I laughed, cried, remembered how wonderful the feeling of love was.
