When the world and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Eurech) finally invite to work with Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and her son Robbie (Barrett Oliver) and his daughter Crisie Huge company complex. They meet with their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbo) and his family fully reclining with the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt to tell him that every member of the club has a professional rise in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by the offer. He was later introduced to the club's manager, Jessica Jones (Suzanne Luchi), who endorses Patricia and persuades her to join the club with her children. Matt feels the change in his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club, and find an evil secret about Jessica and the members. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, when I saw "Invitation to Hell", I liked this movie which partly mentions "Stipford's Wives," as people change behavior in the suburban complex. I just saw this day, and found a big metaphor against big companies, when people literally sell their lives to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries. I'm not sure if the author intends to give this explanation of the story, but I think this is quite appropriate. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
