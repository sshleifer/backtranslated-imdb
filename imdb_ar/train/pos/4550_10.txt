Daniel Dae Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. An English aristocrat in a room with a view, an Irish thief passionate in the name of "the Father", a rude and violent butcher in the New York gangs (ten times stronger than Adrian Prodi in the pianist) and a gritty Christian with brown cerebral palsy in the left foot (to name but a few) ). All his roles affect each other, but each of them is separate, and completely unique. It changes completely, with each character taking it. I started to think that it could serve as anything. Anything. <br /> <br /> As Christie Brown is amazing. He does not make fun of character, and does not spare the character. A difficult achievement. And Christie Brown comes to life. smart man. An infamous man. Human. <br /> <br /> This film, despite small errors in moving the scene and the like, is a source of inspiration. Yes, predictable. But is he stupidly passionate? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Prove that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite show is the scene in the restaurant, when Christie discusses painters with Ellen and Peter and her friends. This is where Daniel Day Lewis reaches its peak. "I will take you in the only part of your mobile anatomy." "Get out the paraplegic!" And its performance never slows down, never stumbles, it is beautiful. Simply. It has a lot of screen time here. I see him again, never tired of Christie's rich eyes, vulgar and wrong speeches. <br /> <br /> I must see her. Fu Shu, yo!
