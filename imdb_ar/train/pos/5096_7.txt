This sprawling version (4 hours) of the story of Ryder Haggard, with the usual female addict and an odd sub-plot with Russian soldiers looking for a "stone of strength" buried with King Solomon's treasure. It was filmed very well, giving a vital sense of wide open space in Africa, and it behaved very well. Patrick Sweezy is an excellent Alan Quatramin, and Dodie Allison is as attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who rents Quatterman to help save her father. Sidede Onyulo in the role of Umbopa, and Gavin Hood in the role of McNabb and commander of the Russian soldiers (who are not mentioned in the IMDb list) are also memorable. Although Hollywood can not leave a good story alone when you adapt to it, this story has been told well, but it is very long, I enjoyed it. 10/06.
