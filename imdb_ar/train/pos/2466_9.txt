I have never noticed that four hours pass as fast as I did when I saw this movie. This film reinforces the power and art of Hamlet that he was supposed to have always had. Even those famous speeches are made in new and innovative ways. The incredible cast, the brightest star. It is his attractiveness, strength and leadership to determine the role of the film. Make it a complete and complete copy that fills many holes and allows a new appreciation of the tragedy despite its length. Where one expects dark dark castle dark, we treat a lavish feast for the eyes. The only depression comes from Hamlet himself, as he should. Well worth your time, every four hours of it.
