The brothers with mental mobility (yes, indeed) are not only competing for Debra Wenger's pros, but also the secret of their childhood that left them at odds over their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (a fire brigade that acts like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, wit and romance. The soundtrack is also fantastic. Like the way in which the bewitched Americans in London used every wonderful Wolf song they can get it, but by fire, I do not think I'll ever forget Denise Quid, who put his own piece in rockin 'as well. Lady '~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> Best line missing from bidding section BTW ~ "Once you have a clown, you will never be back!" <br /> <br /> I like this movie (I asked for a DVD from the United States) and if comments written by some kind of people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3 do not stop you - try it :)
