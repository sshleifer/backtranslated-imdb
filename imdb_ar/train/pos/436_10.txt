I absolutely love this movie. I'm not sure about that especially about this but I think it was fantastic and it should be available for DVD. The women were strangers but they were well enough to spend the time we spent in the villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were quite different, but it was a clever story that made them work. There are issues of humor, drama and relationships all at the right time. This requires 10 lines, but I can not think of anything else to say, so I'll just hit until I get 10 lines. Very sorry for this. What can I say is that it has been a long time since the last time I saw it. I am looking forward to seeing again but not available.
