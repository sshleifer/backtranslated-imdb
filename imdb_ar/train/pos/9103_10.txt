In life, we first organize the stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as profession, family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find space between these elements to fit the small stones, and our small necessities. If you behave in reverse, you will not have enough space for large stones. The five heroes in this film are women who have not been able to organize large "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, identifies his first film "Stones" this way. The film tells the parallel parallel path of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955), Adele (Antonia San Juan, 1961) -). All of them seek to remove stones that appear stubbornly on their way or, at worst, in their shoes. They are five Cinderella in search of a charming prince and a new opportunity in life. The best story of these five Cinderella is Anita (Monica Cervera), which plays the role in the "20 cm", "Bosco", "Kremen Verispato", "Interi Viver Wai Sonar", "Hungus" and "Octavia."
