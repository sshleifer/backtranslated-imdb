This is a very moving picture of forty-three of the best friends in the small city of England. One finds an emotional love and a new beginning with a coach for the younger piano, when the blows and hearts are changed forever. Definitely a film that contains a box of tissue with you! Powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! Alarm spoiler! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is taken by her handsome young coach in the piano and romantic romance blossoms. Playing her two "friends" Jealous is an immature prank that quickly leads to tragedy. She lost her love and her friends in one fell swoop. In the end, pulling them an unexpected surprise (in my opinion, can not guarantee her forgiveness)
