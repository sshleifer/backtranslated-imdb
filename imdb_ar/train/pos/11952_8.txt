Scoop **** **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point". It was a fantastic romantic film, and fortunately, the star Woody Allen did not attend. It was beautiful with Scarlett Johansson. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is the latest film for Woody Allen and although it appears in this film, it is fine. Scarlett Johansson also works perfectly together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sandra Bransky, a young college journalist who takes a lead in life from the ghost of Joe Strombill (Ian MacShane). Joe heard a head start while he was on a boat with a harvest machine and a handful of other souls taken by Ryber. One of those souls is Peter Lehmann's secretary (Hugh Jackman). Joe was told that Peter might be the serial killer who roams the streets of England. Joe, with a lifelong scoop, returns to life and gives this information to Sondra, during a magical act. Sandra in a magic show with magician Mr. Waterman (Woody Allen). Become a volunteer to go in a box disappear, while she is in the box, you get a visit from Joe. Because she does not know what to do, she uses the help of Mr. Waterman to help her break the case. <br /> <br /> This movie has a nice and pleasant feeling compared to "Match Point" yet it works all. Johansson and Allen work together great. Allen Teaser fits perfectly for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is as wonderful as Peter Lehman, the serial killer "suspect". <br /> <br /> It's a fun little movie to see if you're looking for someone else to watch. The cast band works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget to see Woody Allen himself. Say I give it a chance because you might like it.
