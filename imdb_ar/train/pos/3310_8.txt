In Kongwon-do ui, offers a relatively intimate look at the meaning (as well as the general meaning) of the lives of different Koreans; empty people looking for ways to fill themselves, and enjoying the escape of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film we notice the lack of clarity of the different personalities; learn from their shortcomings and desires, and the overall complexity that has been captured in human life (and yet the extra simplicity of humanity). Although the film is slow to move, it can be very reflective. It does not impose any ideas, but it allows ideas to go out of themselves, and allows concepts to reveal themselves. <br /> <br /> The film also ends abruptly as it begins, and one understands the meaning of loneliness. This love is often really selfish, and many of the mistakes we make. It's a look at daily life, very well done and beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for work or an intense drama, this is not the right movie for you. However, if you enjoy fair, innovative, meaningful movies that are not forced or free from the facade, this is a great movie to watch.
