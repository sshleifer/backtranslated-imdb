To connect in the film the basic things of life - like what life, do you have meaning? - Is impossible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions appear in every film (story), but communication needs direct appeal to consciousness. This happens if the inputs of the senses invalidate the "input" of our mind, ie our thoughts. Few managers know how to communicate with the basic things. Tarkovsky, one. His "Stalker" shows images of existence and communicates with life as it appears in itself and runs away from your mind. I think De Zee and De Graf are doing the same thing.
