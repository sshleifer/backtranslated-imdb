This is one of the best comedy movies that have appeared on television. The first season was Farhana as it was most of the following seasons. The only reason I gave this offer is 9/10 because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the last season was the end. My favorite part of this show is the scenes that are limited to people's perceptions, and often depict characters in famous TV shows or movies from the seventies. It's a rare show because I loved every character (except the last season ... too late to try to develop a new character and Fas was not nearly funny). Red foot did not advance in your old ass, nor Kelso stupid. Bravo on the fox to keep such a good show for a long time, so very long.
