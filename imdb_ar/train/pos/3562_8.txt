Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the longest floating crepe game manager in New York and needs $ 1,000 to secure a new location. Confident of his odds, he bet on the top of the city's roller, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can not attract missionary Sarah Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). "Guys and Dolls (1955) is a great musical because it blends skillfully with the contrasting styles of film and theater. During a stunning opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm, stop working and begin as if they respond to signals behind the scenes. Even the walking movements themselves are fringed and angled, midway between walking and dancing. Mankiewicz's New York City is a glittering wave of Art Deco colors and movements, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that secret gambling and criminal bullying seem perfectly normal. <br /> <br /> While writing this review, I just received a message stating that Jean Simmons died at the age of eighty years. This was, incredibly, the first time I saw her in a film, but she impressed me from the start. Sarah, idealistic and repressive, emerged from her skin after a drink of Havana drink, retreating with a playful playful adage "If I Were a Horse". Although Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to describe them by singing. "Your voice may not sound good, but at least you are." Despite Goldwyn's inverse confidence, they both work well to carry the entire musical numbers. Simmons suggests the same childlike vitality that Audrey Hepburn may have, and exudes Brando with such self-confidence and charisma that his lyrical voice does not quite exist.
