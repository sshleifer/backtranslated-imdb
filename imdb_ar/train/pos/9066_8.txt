~~ I was able to watch this movie yesterday morning on an early show ~~ <br /> <br /> I am the mother of two children aged 11 to 6 years. So I'm sure a lot of parents can relate to the need to see many "children" movies. This was refreshing for me. I have not read this particular book, so I do not know whether it is still true for the book or not. But certainly taking the factor of rudeness to a high level. This is the story of the "new" kid in the city, and it happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of some kind and loved the choice of children .... they seem to be familiar? We have not all suffered this once or the other. He has a younger brother who can not stand up and parents who are embarrassed about him. What I enjoyed most was seeing how each character was completely different from another. The bully (why they make the bully head red always? My daughter has red hair!) It is not a bully It took distractions and turns, you fall in love with them all and find yourself really in the direction of all the characters Even the parents, a great connection between father and son Every fun place, Sweet, funny, gross etc ... Take your kids! You will enjoy it as much as you enjoy it!
