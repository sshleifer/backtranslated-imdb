The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a convincing documentary about the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe in Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to reach pastures. You will feel poorly pampered after seeing these people grazing their animals through cold snow and walking barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to carry their animals along the steep mountain trails.
