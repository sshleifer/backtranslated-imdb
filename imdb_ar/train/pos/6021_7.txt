Although this may not necessarily be a "classic" film as standard today, it is still worth watching. The main reason is that after the experience of this film, you will feel that you have also experimented with anti-culture idealism in the 1960s, regardless of being good or bad. <br /> <br /> The film's vision has come across in the English literature section of SUNY Geneseo, and although at first it seems to be a meaningless combination of 60 icons, the film is far from "throwing together." <br /> <br /> My point is that if you leave the movie feeling uncomfortable and confused, the film does its work: it conveys a futile vision of the future which makes you feel uncomfortable and angry. Perhaps this was the same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it presented. <br /> <br /> As such, Zabriskie Point may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters may be unilaterally predictable. However, it conveys this kind of cliche, the rebellious desire to get out of the presence that must be shared by Mark and Darya. Even anti-establishment students are as honest as the government they oppose.
