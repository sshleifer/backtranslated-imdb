This is essentially the difference between House Of Wax, in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price. In both pictures, he plays the role of a talented artist who is sent to the edge of madness when his creations are raped by other less talented and less passionate people. In this film, he plays the illusion of magicians who aspire to embark on a performance career only to frustrate them when the other Grete Reinaldo (John Emery) insists he respects his contract and gives him the first choice for any illusions he designs. The price is already bad for Rinaldi, since his ex-wife is now one of the most important figures in Rinaldi. He spreads his talents as a inspiration and a wonderful traditional way to avenge Renaldi and others who foiled his plans to recognize him as a performer and designer. <br /> <br /> The price is the whole program here and it turns a well-condemned star into an oppressed man gaining his sympathy in public. The rest of the team members are efficient if colorless and bear the weight of the whole project on Pric who bears the burden easily. <br /> <br /> Good Solid B Movie melodrama, this is a crime film rather than a horror and fun picture provided you do not expect a masterpiece. The picture in black and white is low in the picture and is better as melodrama and enjoys it because there is a star that gives privacy performance
