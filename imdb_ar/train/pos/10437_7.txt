This is a slow motion story. No reaction. Do not thrill crazy. No surprise surprises. If you can not stand to watch a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly to the end and about the romantic love, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in a dialog box, tell brilliant stories, and think about stirring up ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life, this is your film. I advise you to watch this movie when you are on high alert, because the speed, music and tone of the film can put you in the mood of wool collection. It's really wonderful. I really mean it. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delby sometimes annoy their behavior, but fortunately, the chemistry between the two makes the representation very natural, warm and precise. They act and feel at each other from the start, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In their conversations, there are excellent comments on many topics that will stimulate reflection and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was very deep and very diverse for such small characters, but I may be less than their intelligence. Still did not spoil the film. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple and I think it gives the film a charm and in the end it's a force. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The movie flow is slow. The dialogue is wonderful. The story is gently, methodically and objectively adopted. Building up to the end is satisfactory and ultimately rewarding.
