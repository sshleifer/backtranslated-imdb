Rain or sunshine outside, you can enter a movie house. Makes you happy. (If not, come directly). The lights go off. You settle down with a bar of ice cream. Animated images start flashing on the screen. Feel good. In the dark, I returned at the beginning of time. Sit around the campfire ... look at the modern version of the twinkling flames 24 times a second and share the joy of exploring the unusual turns and scenarios in the scenario with the rest of your clan / onlookers. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves, should not write a comment. (Long live romantic comedy ...)
