Rohinton Mistry's multilayered story seems impossible to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, passion, humor and pathos. The story is fairly slow motion but there is always something on the screen capturing the audience. The film takes time and place accurately accurately. All Indian actors - few if any are known to the "Western" masses - are happy to be seen, especially the little girl who acts very convincingly. Do not be late for the title and the plot summary - it's a movie you can see on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from.
