This is an excellent offer! I had a teacher of US history in high school and was like this pretty much. There are many "facts" in history that are not entirely correct and are explained by Mr. Wohl in a memorable way. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wohl teaches a class of film students, but history students and even the general public will appreciate the smart way in which he has discovered some of the known fallacies in world history and sought to impress those minds of his students. The use of direct actors who perform "actresses" is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in getting the history they learned when the child turned upside down.
