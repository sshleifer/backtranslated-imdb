I participated in a very small production of this when I was an 8-year-old at school and my mom bought my video. I've loved it since !! When I was younger, it was the songs and the amazing dance series that I enjoyed, but since I saw them when I became older, I appreciate more representation and portraying great characters. Oliver Reid and Ron Moody were fantastic. I can not imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Wagon. Shani and Nancy if she is the best character for me. I have dealt with so many of these boys and I think they are a strong personality and their last scene when ... well, you know ... always make me cry! The best music in my opinion of all time. It lasted all this time and will continue for many years to come! 11/10 !!
