I followed the journey two years ago on the Internet - now I saw the movie !! What a ride! What a journey to finally get to know Darius Wimz! This spirit of courage, wise, funny and talented! What a crew! To listen to Darius laughing at his presence in the water in Panama City, to see his fear of being very close to the crocodiles in Louisiana, a miracle in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, and the thrill of riding the raft across some of the slopes, , The phone calls home, and as always - the boys will be boys. This film must be watched by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. The crew members are testimony to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius in a new wheelchair. They documented access problems; they took Darius on the journey of his life. They touched so many lives. By raising awareness about DMD and promoting funding for research, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a treatment for DMD.
