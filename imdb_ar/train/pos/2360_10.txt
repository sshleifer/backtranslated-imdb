I felt very balanced in showing what the Jehovah's Witnesses did in protecting American liberties. It also showed the strong faith of two families who were witnesses of the first generation. I also appreciate how he showed how the Jehovah's Witnesses affected non-witness family members and how difficult it was to accept the fact that they did not celebrate holidays. The sad part is that non-witness families do not think of a family of witnesses at dinner / family visits or gifts to them at any time Another but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, witnesses want and expect a high level of medical care. What people forget is that blood transfusions allow medical care and slow surgical procedures, while non-bloody treatments make the medical team highly skilled and trained to treat your loved ones. ? I highly recommend this video!
