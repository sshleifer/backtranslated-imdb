Frightening symmetry is an interesting episode with few drawbacks. The first thing about this episode is that it is located near Mount Hum Air Base in southwestern Idaho. The first season "Deep Throat" is held near the Ellens Air Base in southwest Idaho. I wonder if the Air Force rules are the same but they decided to use the real name in the frightening symmetry. Mulder and Scalley have some good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Micham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of the strange old school teachers. They must have loved the children at once, and you can not imagine it. Just as animals should be more caring at one time. I liked the idea of ​​the loop, but I felt that it had some contradictions. If foreigners are adept at abducting and safely returning humans, why can not they bring the animal back to the right place? Are foreigners now facing problems in returning animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the continuity of space-time. As if he were an expert on it. I also thought Jane Atkinson's performance like Willa Ambrose was not good. Along with those NetBix, I still enjoy this episode because of the interesting concept of harvesting the DNA of animals as well as human DNA.
