I have been waiting for this film for a long time since I saw the trailer, making it look like a political drama, starring three of my favorite actors: Al Pacino, John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. Although taken out by Harold Baker, who did an uneven job, he and Pacino combined with SEA OF LOVE, which is classified among each of their best works. But the overlap at some level (for starters, many scenes do not appear in the original trailer in the movie) and changing the tone (subsequent tracks make it look like excitement) makes this, while the view, is not accessible anywhere near the . <br /> <br /> It's very bad, because I really wanted to admire this movie. There was great potential here to be a film about how the government can remain viable despite all corruption, and make a complex statement about this corruption, not the usual good men and bad guys. A good job here. Pacino and Cusack are very good, and Danny Aiello offers one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is lost in her role, has nothing to do, and while there is an advantage in the central story, when the film turns into a thriller, the film loses its way, briefly recovers in the last scene between Cusack and Pashino, and then falls down completely at the end. I hope I like this more, but not.
