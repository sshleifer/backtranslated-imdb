Paul Reiser moves away from the stand-up comedy lights to write a funny story and a newspaper about the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we expect and what surprises us. Nothing about my work sets any new standards for the film, but it's a wonderful little story that reminds us of the important links the family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was an addict to work, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (McKenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and son Ben (Paul Reiser) to the background. One day Morrell leaves a note that after years of marriage you leave! Her daughters, along with the wife of Ben Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), began searching for her place immediately, leaving Sam puzzled by the hurt and despair Sam grumbled to sort things out on a road trip with his son Ben. The journey on the road becomes a time when the two men learn from each other and what each of them means as a father, son and family. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and now gives you an addicted alcoholic addict to the fun of life. The journey ended with a phone call about Morel's whereabouts and why she left, and the redrawing of the wise family marks the end of the warm story. Not everything seems: it is better and different well. <br /> <br /> Both Falk and Razer play each other like professionals, but in many ways the film belongs to the short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that she is one of our most powerful mothers in the film. deserve watching.
