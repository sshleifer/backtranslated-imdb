I do not understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American public to Dynamo, Jet Li. The grip of myth was a much better option. Anyway, the black mask is not terrible, but it certainly is not great either. The final fighting sequence is well organized by Yuen Woo Ping who followed the Matrix format. But the English version suffers from editing and dubbing. (I beg to Hollywood studios to release these films without translation with translation). Jet Li shows his distinctive attractiveness in a starring role, while Francoise Yip plays a great but short role like the 701 female. Black Mask has a strange gothic style that adds some interest but loads of gun battles and explosions. My physical skills were even more focused. Black Mask is a good movie, but do it yourself and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see a great movie that really shows Li's skills.
