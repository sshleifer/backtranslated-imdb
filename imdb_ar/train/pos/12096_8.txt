I have watched this movie several times and found it very good. This film is also known as the "Castle of Terror", "The Casket of Terrorism" and "The Macabre Dance". Barbara Steel, are the same usual beautiful / creepy. George Revere, a male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole movie is dripping with the atmosphere, and there is a lot of tension all the time. The camera angles are good and the representation, for the most part, is not bad. This film is perfectly suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have an unbroken DVD version, which is much higher than the version of the TV that was edited. Grab some popcorn, turn off the lights, settle down and enjoy. John R. Tracy
