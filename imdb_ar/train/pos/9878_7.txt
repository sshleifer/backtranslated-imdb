Almost every review of this film I saw was very bad. This is not so bad, it's very good, although it is not good. The character of Judy Garland may be annoying, but she did not allow it. Somewhere along the line, I became a fan of encouragement, over-complacency, and overstating Van Heflin, at least in the early 1940s. Judy's singing is wonderful, but the film missed a great opportunity not to show more of his relationship. I gave him 7.
