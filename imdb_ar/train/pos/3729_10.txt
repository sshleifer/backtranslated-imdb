While I assume that this film can become a rap for Vietnam, while watching it I did not feel that this was the case as much as the film was just an honest look at the perspective of young people being trained on war that the public did not support .... Their fear, despair, ... all that, in the open, naked. As a soldier myself, I have heard a lot of issues in my experience in the army - especially the boot camp. On the whole, although it was filmed with a very small budget, it looks great, but it has been well placed together and has excellent acting and output. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for Colin Farrell. 10/10
