There is a story (perhaps apocryphal) about the exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of a dozen monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think of the plane as one of the fifth element) and handed it to Bruce Butch. It was titled "Things Bruce Willis Does When Acting". It ended with a simple message: "Please do not do any of the above in my film." <br /> <br /> There is a truth about this film (certainly true). Gilliam did not have a hand in writing. <br /> <br /> I would argue that these two factors played a major role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success of the "twelve monkeys". <br /> <br /> Visually, the twelve monkeys are all we really expected from the film Gilliam. They are also full of giliamsic surrealism and general (but brilliant) quirks. Gilliam rejoices in stealing his audience. Although the end of the twelve monkeys will not surprise anyone who sat in the first realist, Gilliam is heavily borrowing from Kafka's work around the clock, and the movement of bureaucratic figures is relentless towards their fate. It is this journey, and the personal developments they are subjected to, which bother them. <br /> <br /> I like the films of Gilliam (Brazil in particular). But they all tend to suffer the same weakness. He seems to have a lot of ideas, a lot of enthusiasm, so much so that his films always end up in tangled chaos (especially Brazil). I still insist that Brazil is the team of Golem Tour de Force, but there is no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a refreshing air smell in the careful planning section. It seems that the style, content and format are combined in a way that is not usually seen from the previous Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the rumors above, Gilliam is also capable of getting first-rate (and very unusual) performance from a bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film, as is the case with all actors, especially Bonniekers - and the most frightening - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> It has been more than a decade since this movie was shown. When I saw her again, I realized she had not progressed in age. It has changed, of course. This made me look at the film with new eyes. It seems to me that this is an appropriate tribute to a film, at least in part, about reflections in mirrors, changing perspectives and a futile absurd journey through the time we all make. First Class Movie. 10/08.
