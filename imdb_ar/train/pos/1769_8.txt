Just came out of the sneak preview of this movie. He was laughing every 30 seconds. The end was so funny that the tears rolled over my face and she wished I had not bought the big coke. There is certainly some quiet, but in general, very entertaining. The film gives Steve Carrill a chance to shine after stealing the lights from Jim Carey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their films. Paul Rod is as hilarious as always. I like to be very funny in this vast comedy and continue to work in independent dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should get more work, because he's obsessed with gravity and gravity. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it to those who just want to laugh like crazy. However, if you feel easily insulted, do not see this movie. If you are a mad woman, do not watch this movie. And please, it does not matter, even if you think you are a parent "hip", do not take your children to the film. Sure, you should let your young people go to see this movie, just do not see it with them. It would make for some incredibly embarrassing moments.
