I was one of many who expected to see a magnificent image of Yankee-doodle for a day in which you must live (as quoted by fame) in a bad state, rather than glory. How wrong you are. These guys were there, just in the middle of it, and the pictures they brought back were amazing and amazing. However, it all happened on an opportunity trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French directors were collecting a documentary film about life as a fireman in New York, especially from the perspective of a young novice coming out of During the ranks. At first, we saw a lot of these shots, just to remind us that there was no idea of ​​a film about terrorism. The aim of this film was to be a film about ordinary people who earn a living that will help others, and the film's beauty is that it never loses that edge. <br /> <br /> While investigating a suspected gas line (I think, the memory is a little blurry), we suddenly hear a plane flying over the area. The camera rolls around to reveal a commercial plane blowing itself up in a tower. What should a photographer have thought of at this time? Recognizing the importance of the stills on the camera, and possibly achieving the same, FDNY allows the camera to follow the building. <br /> <br /> The following is a true view of the frontlines. We see the commitment of the Free National Defense Forces, their reactions (the astonishing silence after hearing the first person's death until their death is frightening) and the collapse of a building from the inside, while a second camera captures events from outside. <br /> <br /> If this was not the horrific event they were covering, the footage alone would be the dream of a young document maker. Simply, the footage is worth being preserved all the time. But what really distinguishes this film is the real humanity it brings to the viewer. We see firefighters charging without hesitation, people of different races helping each other escape a wave of rubble and even the filmmakers worry about each other (understanding brothers) because they can not reach each other in confusion. There are amazing scenes as well as amazing human stories in this film, something Hollywood can never repeat (though it tries). <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a film about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad in this regard. 9/11 is a film about people, a real indicator of the best and worst we are able to. 9/11 is simply one of the most important films I have ever seen, and it will be the only film that generates this event if it is up to me. You can not repeat this.
