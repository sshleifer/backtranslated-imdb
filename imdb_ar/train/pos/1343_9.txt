There is not one Scorsese movie I would like to put in my favorite movies. But this is the best thing I've run through my DVD player about five years ago. Scorsese's explicit articulation of favorite film moments, and how Hollywood works are gracious, quiet and incredibly intelligent. <br /> <br /> It's 3 items with DVD sides. It must be British production, because everything related to the culture of American companies was trampled on a calm, systematic, unadorned approach that focuses on the content that is followed here. American production would have been asked to say that he only liked films that were popular favorites. I wish everyone took a page of his love for movies. You should love movies that you make for personal, specific, and specific reasons. Not just more "I'm too" votes for the "Godfather", and so on. People do not have a clue about the ideas that are explored in their favorite movies. If they do, the films will be more interesting than they are. Scorsese does not know what ideas are being explored, which makes him a strong speaker and involved in the subject. I truly appreciate the clear interviews he has conducted over the past decade. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, Scorsese is the best when he is eager to show you some mysterious films, not when he teaches you something solid. About the history of the film. I hope that those three hairs will be snatched from the bridge of his nose. It's very distracting.
