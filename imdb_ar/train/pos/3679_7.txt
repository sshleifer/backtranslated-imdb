I saw the film two days ago and I was very pleased because Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent 18 very romantic months there in the 1980s. I was somewhat disappointed that most of this collection of short essays, though original and artistic, did not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well. Not enough romantic enough! We did not see any of the tree-lined streets ... there was a lot of darkness, not just literally but figuratively. Some conspiracies dealt with the scenes apparently, leaving him falling "flat" (Marais sequence, sequence of the coiffure seller, to give two examples). Good things and well-being: the Mime sequence, the cemetery, Montmartre (though he left plenty to see for the viewer), the short article "Cowboy", and the Sacre Coeur - seemed a few and far between, I would love to see a wonderful actor like Orlando Bloom being in something that would display His authenticity is more.
