The first time my favorite friend sat to watch this movie, we were watching Alex Winter of Bill & Ted's fame. We did not know what to expect but who and what it was. <br /> <br /> By the time the film ended, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, though not historically accurate, was the best of its kind. I have seen other films depicting the history of this famous summer, and in my opinion, other films can not be compared. I have joined a few details, but these parts have not escaped the elegance and romance of the story. I have seen other films about this summer, and I find that most of them are good, but nothing captures such a film. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has the characteristics of painting. Colors and settings seem to be something one can find on canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric house. The costumes were wonderful, and although I was not the most comfortable clothing in the world, I was made to want to find a seamstress to make such clothes for myself. The entire film was placed on the picturesque Lake Geneva (where I hope to go one day watching this film) and the calm that these historical figures have found there. <br /> <br /> This film, along with the calm that was found by all fugitives from the harsh judgments in England, shows the strangeness surrounding this adventure as well. Yes, there was drugs. It was a fairly common practice during that period, when drugs were illegal. The laudanum (liquid form of opium) was taken as medical as well as recreational. Chile suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered from troubled foot pains. It was no surprise that there were prescriptions for the strong drugs they had during the summer. They were poets during a time when experience was the key. There was no time for cautious caution. Passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. From the ideas and discussions of science, religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend: "Frankenstein". <br /> <br /> Yes, in this film, we see Mary Goodwin's beautiful and liberated (not married to Shelley at the time) played by Alice Craig beautiful and talented. It is the control factor in everything that is going on until you too give up on the experience. But she stands on the ground and experiences things on her own terms. She was also the force she inherited from her mother and father. <br /> <br /> Actors and actresses in this were ideal for the parts they played. Music installation. The trend dominated the essence of the summer, as I read about it. The film was based on a wonderful book, "Haunted Summer," by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author takes the story of what I have been able to compile from the actual magazines of Mary Goodwin Shelley and other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are someone who loves history (so little precision from time to time) and romantic and Gothic, this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of the birth of the beast, which teaches us to this day about the ethics of "playing God." <br /> <br /> A specific movie must be viewed!
