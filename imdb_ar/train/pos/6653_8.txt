With all political views left aside, the film Fairuz Khan and Anil Kapoor "Gandhi, Abi" is a good film that intelligently explores the muddled side of the family of engineer Karam Chand Gandhi, and the battle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with a larger father's life community and more importantly demons in his head . One draws the resemblance to Gandhi's father and the struggling mother any son can have with their father. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Shivali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshay Khana - add a color and lament to this dark Harrell story, which embraces her fight only once and shun away with a faint touch of the finger. <br /> <br /> The direction of Fairuz Khan and the canvas of production is grand and attractive, yet the scenario could have been tighter. I saw the play a few years ago on a DVD-type pirated video (it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi, I think) and it was definitely more silent. However, the background of the film and the moments of father and son are nothing but wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie was great. It's the borderline for that. It has enormous potential to be just a story of the differences between father and son or just Gandhi or both. Somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect an absolute example of emotions, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> This game compares to Gandhi's other fitness. Certainly not a general film about a movie like Kingsley's Gandhi or abstracted by Kamal Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram. The film revolves around finding his foot. However, one is left wondering "what if ..." worth watching. 7.5 / 10
