Ernest Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the time, produced films full of beautiful scenery and delicate love for everything precious in life. <br /> <br /> At present, if people should hear about him, they associate Marishka with the Sisi (1955-1956-1957) trilogy. However, he has made other excellent films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and certainly this one, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN which presents the years of Queen Victoria's youth. Although it deals with a slightly different subject from SISSI films, I do not see many differences between this film and SISSI. They are remarkably similar. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost identical. Style, music and photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Proves, Bruno Mundi! <br /> <br /> The cast ... Romy Sneijder is one of the first major roles. She was a wonderful introduction to her role in Cisse, where this film was made a year before the first part of the Austrian Empress Trio. It is also a film in which Rumi plays with her mother Magda Schneider. But Ernest Marishka was not the first director to throw Bromi to play with her mother. The first appearance of "Rumi", "Wayne Deer Wes" Flaider and Weider Bluhen (1953) was her performance with her mother as well. So, there were some sounds that Rumi started her Austrian career based on her mother's fame. In fact, there is some truth in it. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, this movie shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert at the Inn in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure glorification in dance and gentle smiles. And now ...? What will it show? Sex only ... But is this the only thing that love is based on? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernest Marischka for these films. They had a spirit and a message. Some people may call them kitchy name, but I will not give up on these films. They are impressive !!! Inappropriately, badly underdeveloped!
