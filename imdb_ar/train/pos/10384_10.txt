After nearly 30 years, I recall that the original PBS film is an almost unbearable tender. Periodically, I check here on IMDb in the hope that someone has a good sense of buying rights and putting them on a DVD. In September 2004, I still hope - a deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the main actors continued his small career mainly in evening soap at peak times. The other, Francis Lee McCain, was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But they did not do anything before or after the adaptation of this little film, which I remember, to the short-lived PBS series, which featured original film shows with new and new playwrights. I watched him every time he was shown on a TV show, maybe two or three times. It was before the age of video recording devices, so I do not have any record, except in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 In addition to the above: Happy new year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. I understand that DVDs are being burned from a personal writer's copy.
