Soapdish may become one of the most individual films ever evaluated. <br /> <br /> An excellent and unselfish actor is perfectly aware of where the film goes and the roles they played in it. While everyone installed it, there was not one command. Klein showed great intelligence and physical comedy. Goldberg and Dawnie knew how to have a funny conversation while someone else was talking, and I could go on. <br /> <br /> Do not pass this movie!
