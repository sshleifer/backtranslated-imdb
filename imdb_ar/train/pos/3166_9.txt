This show has come so far. At first, each of the actors from Erik to Fez, were all representatives and new actors, new faces, just look at what they accomplished. They held on to the show and it was a success. It's one of the best shows ever made, and it's probably the funniest comic I have ever seen. It will be sad to see the end, but if they finish this show, I hope the series will come out with one of the biggest bangs of any season. I do not care if it absorbs the whole season because it saves all the fuel needed for the last episode. Keep on swinging, and get a final punch. The show deserves it, and fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know it will end, as with friends, let the final be huge. I say that I am married to Donna and Eric. I say that Hyde and Kelso are fighting and becoming friends again, and I say that there is something interesting between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for a long time, but of course it will not work for him. Just close out a large chain of guys! <br /> <br /> The 1970s gallery will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish you had friends as friends. you are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
