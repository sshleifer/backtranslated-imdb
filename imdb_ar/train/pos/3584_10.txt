My name is Heather and I am the girl whose story is based on it. I want to thank you all who have seen this movie and enjoyed it. Horrible and cruel as some of the things filmed in this film, it did not come close to describing how bad things actually are. Not to mention the effect of everything on my mother and my little sister. Thank you again for the great comments that everyone has made, and I truly appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is My Mother Heather. It is hard to believe that many years have passed since the making of this film. Harder to believe people have been watching for a year. For anyone of you who went to the same position or the like, please be aware that there are people here in cyberspace who fully understand what you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
