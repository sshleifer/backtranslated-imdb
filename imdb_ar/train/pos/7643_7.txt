spoiler!!! This film is based on the concept of what if? Of course Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character going through a bad day, like many of us, poses this question. Chaos theory states that a butterfly in China can have an effect on someone here from a chain reaction. The focus of this film depends on one event during the baseball game. This event puts in motion the fate of one; just like Ashton's "Butterfly Effect" except Mr. Destiny uses comedy on drama. The results of making a new film, fairly original. If a philosophical person is in harmony with the "butterfly effect", one is likely to enjoy the destiny. I give it 7 out of 10. Amazing because I saw the first half of this movie 3 times and finally watched the end on TBS.
