Stack should have won the Oscars for this performance, this period. It's a crime he did not do. Amazing how humanized personality is rich and worthless. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone won the Academy Award for her performance. In fact, every representation in this film is excellent. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a taxi ride, then a plane ride, then continuing on an emotional journey that will interest you all the time. Will be entertaining! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a blatant opera. One-dimensional, 100 percent soaper. You may call it the final texture, because good behavior triumphs over the material. Excellent behavior, well directed, but strictly within the type of soap. So I would not call it melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Tradition of Life"). While you can not deny the wonderful entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented director and talent might achieve through a more fundamental theme.
