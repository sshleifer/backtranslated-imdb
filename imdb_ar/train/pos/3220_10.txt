The soldier may not have academic influences or special effects for Lucas, but she certainly does not do it for me. I will not tell you about it, I'm sure you've already read the summary. This is a fictional science / future film. Kurt Russell does not say much, usually he has a strange look or drones on his face but fits the character. There is great work and fighting scenes. Some scenes are unrealistic, but this makes Hollywood believe that Earth must escape from our normal lives. I have not seen 2 Soldier but this is one of my favorites. I'm lucky enough to have a wife digging in a guy's movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes strong guy / science fiction movies.
