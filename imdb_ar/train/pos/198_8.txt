Hey it's great to see Silent Classic once! Director Vidor is simply delicious and even makes a long (at least 1928) veil in itself. The story revolves around success in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davis plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio. Become a great star and the consequences are that they are truly alienated from the real world. For a moment they even deny their past (the poor)! Simple novels are simply delight, and certainly the scene you see as the main character (Marion Davis) ... Marion Davis in the studios and concludes that she does not look special ... She must be one of the first film films here and for real moments, it's great to see cameras and materials from Then. Must see if you ask me!
