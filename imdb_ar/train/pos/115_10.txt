A piece of hidden art. Maybe a masterpiece. No doubt a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Kafka's story about the impossibility of victory or survival in a strange, permanent world. Life is, in this film, a practice of adaptation only. A lesson about the limits and original sin, about the fragility of innocence and the error in its ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessel is Joseph K. Another trial picture and the same mysterious woman. Europe is a symbol of the fundamental crisis, which has many aspects, such as tent warfare or the constant search for truth / substance / the golden age. <br /> <br /> Methaphor or proverb, the film is a disappointed development history. War, peace, work or lying are just details about gelatin time. Hypocrisy mask. Love - Convention. The only way to sacrifice hope is to understand a painful truth.
