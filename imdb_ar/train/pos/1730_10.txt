This unusual quiet jewel tells the true story of the escape of prisoners during World War II. The presentations are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on several different levels: brain, emotional, visual and craft. The dialogue is innovative and real episodes. In fact, the extraordinary universal originality puts this head and shoulders above most war deadlines.
