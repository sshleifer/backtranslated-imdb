The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It is full of comic characters and interesting situations, from the innocent, cheerful Pecker game (played by Edward Furlong in an attractive way) that likes to portray almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Pecker Matt's friend ("He's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), the sister of Pecker Chrissy (the sugar addict), and the Catholic grandmother Pecker who discovers life in a statue of the Virgin Mary in her room. <br /> <br /> The film gently illustrates how the daily life of many riches is successful, and it manages to raise this point without being too heavy. There is always a risk, when you send messages about the value and dignity of the "general public", from slipping into a kind of "creed over you" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the audience to get a point while allowing enough vent space for viewers to compare this message With their own ideas on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun.
