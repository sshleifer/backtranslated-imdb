I can remember seeing this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO will be shown late at night when they were only one channel channel. At the time the film was not filmed and it was the only film of its kind that was shown on pay TV ... especially at the time. I would like to see her now as an adult where I would be more willing to understand his adult theme. Perhaps this was the closest I had seen in pornography at the age of seven or eight. Luckily I had angry babysitters and parents at weekends. Most of my memory in this film was the completely wrong sexual behavior of these two men. The storming of houses for sexy underwear, feeding on a man's breast milk on a public bus, and sneaking into a taxi at the request of a national, were just a few of the mashed festivals that these men had withdrawn from. A very lively film for the early 1970s. So I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this movie had such a following. Most of the people I spoke to have never heard of him.
