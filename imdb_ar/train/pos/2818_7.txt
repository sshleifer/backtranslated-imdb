"Dragonlord" sees Chan returning to his "Dragon" role of "The Young Master". Did not carry much of the first film though. "Tiger", his older brother, has nowhere to be seen; neither Marshall, his daughter or his son played superbly by Yuen Biao in the original film. Dragon has the same teacher - presumably all other students have moved to other things. ("Dragon Master In Love" is originally portrayed in this film, so it may still be taught!) <br /> <br /> Originally, the movie Dragon (for the first 60 minutes at least) The villager follows the villager in various stupid ways and dogs. His rival on affection is his friend (incorrectly named "Cowboys") played dutifully by team member Chan Stant for a long time. See different scenes where ridiculous schemes are counterproductive. One of these scenes we found (fortunately) "Dragon" in his head. <br /> <br /> This film is notorious because it failed the expectations at the box office. Having said that, I'm sure the expectations were very high and I feel that this film had no equitable judgment based on its own merits. But even when I try to do this, I still feel that there is a problem with the film. It seems quite unfocused, and sometimes hasty, I think the procedure is very choppy and not as wonderful as other Chan's works in this period. <br /> <br /> The thing that really saves the film is the sequence of the end. As in "The Young Master", there is a fantastic final reel filled with unbelievably heavy work - you really feel every blow. Again, Chan confronts the same opponent of "The Young Master" (the same character?), And the timing and energy here are fantastic. Chan's use of every last part of his environment to help defeat his opponent - not just relying on pure physical power - is as obvious here as anywhere else. The barn where they fight is filled with small muzzles and improvisations. This is the absolute highlight of the film and one of Chan's amazing career. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to see the intro of the film before seeing "Dragonlord"; it may raise more questions than an answer. But it must be said that the original film is a superior film, it seems that "Dragonlord", focusing on chasing girls and sports teams is puzzling. Fortunately, his few scenes of fighting (as well as a wonderful sight of the shuttle ride) are pushed across the line like a movie to watch in this genre.
