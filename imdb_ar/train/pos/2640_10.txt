Obviously, a lot of people have not seen this movie, because no one publishes more comments. This is not a movie to be missed. After all, he has won the George Peabody Award as well as the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield has won a prize for his outstanding performance in this film. Eugene Logan, who co-wrote a television film, was part of another film about humanity, or lost, by being a technical adviser to Glass House in Truman Cabot. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will post another letter explaining how Eugene Logan became the film's technical advisor to an amazing person like Truman Cabot. Thanks for reading this and I hope you find a way to watch these two films.
