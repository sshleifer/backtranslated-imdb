I saw this after my mother returned from America to me, and it scares me to see this after all the negative comments here but I have to say yes, it is cheesy, and some of the effects are laughable. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember that this was supposed to be 1898 and not 2005, and for such a low budget, I think it was very good. I enjoyed this version a lot, then the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I have read the book many times and found myself going "ah, yes, that exists in the book" almost all the time, with the other version barely found anything from the book. <br /> <br /> Well done at least to try to make a real copy.
