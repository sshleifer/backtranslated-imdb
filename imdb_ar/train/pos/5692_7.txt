This is the second film based on the life and times of the highly outstanding porn star, John Curtis Estes, known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights also depends on his life. Maybe someday someone will make a film about Tommy Byron's life instead. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not good. There are many law and order rings that contain more transitions and turns from Wonderland, and the manager does not get any criminal case going with any kind of tricks. Val Kilmer has two problems - he was not quite as hung up as Holmes (and there is no industrial alternative this time, unlike the Buggy Knights), much better than the Holmes creature. <br /> <br /> The director does not present one beloved person among the actors. The immature racial element that comes out with him, his wife and the police does not stand in the way of characterization. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is Erik Bogusian who told Paris Hilton "Lost". <br /> <br /> After all this, you should not miss anyone interested in the most fragile aspect of pornography in the 1980s or the real crime.
