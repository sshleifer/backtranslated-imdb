The executioner (played by Jennifer Thomas II) has an enjoyable job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all men sentenced to death before meeting their maker. And what a way to go. Lucky this movie is not real, or we will have many people in this world sentenced to death. <br /> <br /> The show starts very slowly. Low light and bad representation, like most films (B). It becomes better as it moves along. It ends with a stir. <br /> <br /> I would rate it very high on low-cost, very sexy movies from the 90's. You should see children once or away in bed.
