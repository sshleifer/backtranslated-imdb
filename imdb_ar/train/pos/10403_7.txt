This is the Oriental fantasy about "Arabian Nights" a lot of wonderful adventures, magical magic and fantasy. The jaunty minister Jaffar (who played wonderfully with Conrad Ved) with the powerful magicians at Prince Ahmed's prison in Baghdad (the assassin John Justin), who lost his throne, then escapes thanks to a small thief named Abu (sympathetic to Sabo). They arrive at Basora where the love and princess (gorgeous Jun Duprez) falls in love. But the prince and the thief are chased by Jaafar, Ahmad is blinded and Abu Kalba becomes. The story brings together many fascinating components such as the transformation of the tournament, a mechanic horse, a magical bow, a flying carpet and of course the massive harvest (excessive performance by Rex Ingram) which gives three wishes for the Sabo, the Magical Eye, the figure of the goddess Cali with many hands, among other things. <br /> <br /> This wonderful picture is classed as one of the best films of all time. Produced by Alexander Korda of London Vim and directed by Ludwig Berger, and Michael Powell and Tim Whelan, two stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, discuss the writer and actor as a master of mechanical games. The outbreak of the Second World War caused the paralyzing fire, and the three brothers and collaborators in Korda traveled to the United States of America, continuing in a special photograph on the Grand Canon Colorado. The cinematography of Technicolor was visually and visually brilliant, and the FX and the Academy won three Oscar Awards: production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, the filmography of George Perinal and the special effects of Osmond Borradaile, although they are dated today and are necessary for redesigning colors because colors are worn out. In addition, he presented the nomination of an oriental musician for musical aging Mikulos Rosza. This vivid tale with huge doses of fantasy will love the imagination of fans and classics
