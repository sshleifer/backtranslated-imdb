It took us two rings to enter Dark Angel as a story and a series, because we were moving from The Sopranos, a completely different mental framework. But once we got to the core of this chain, we were hooked on the plug very quickly. It is shameful that the series ends when it just started in an excellent category: Dark Angelwas much more than the regular television series. It rocks rocks and rocks as much as work, but the interactions of characters and community reactions to "mutants" remind us of the persistent prejudices we face (and make) every day. Preparing the story in the future preserves the surreal mood and prevents the rubbing of an anti-discrimination message in our faces (thus not destroying "fun" for those who do not like to lecture while entertaining), but each event and human / social interaction is still relevant to the present. We all judge and face our prejudices, but in the end, the question of who you are lies: Do you sit and close your mind in front of you, or do you get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series enables them. For those who have never faced the question, this series "sneaks" into this message under the guise of pure entertainment. It is much more well-made and well written than most TV series. I am very disappointed that it ended before I could reach a high standard.
