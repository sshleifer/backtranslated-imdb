A highly acclaimed documentary about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworth, mostly composed of ephemeral sculptures made of elements of nature. His work consists of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which are detonated when the tide reaches the shore or the wind blows in the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works do not really last, except as pictures or films of what they used to be. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's work is a reflection of death, or words to that effect, but it is not easy to say that what he is doing is just a beautiful art. While the stereotype of artists is often bitter, tired and often mentally unstable and living in degraded urban environments, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, modest, family-oriented person who loves nature and lives in a village Small in Scotland (of course, I'm sure these are the same reasons that make it out of some people in the art world who found their works fluffy or superficial).
