Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began to end their career together. Remember that the best of Grumpiest of Old Men and Oddest Couple who made us laugh ever, Lemmon and Matthau was one of the best comedy teams in Hollywood over the last 100 years. Not "evil" like Breuer and Wilder; it was a classic comedy team that reflects the most modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as physical comedy as well as a mix of chaos that is best known by Marx, Chaplin and Keaton. In Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play full antibodies that create chaos. The physical comedy is unique like Chaplin's. The humor is usually opposed to passing the joke to another. It's not your favorite movie, it's a comedy coming with two old men opposing two teenage boys. Chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is enough entertainment. Although this film is not for everyone, it is a wonderful comedy.
