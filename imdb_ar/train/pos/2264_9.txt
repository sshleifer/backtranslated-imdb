It is best to use the words Vonnegut on paper. The anecdotes we weave are gossemar, sharp strands of words and expressions that can not easily be translated into a world of blasts by Marilyn Manson or Jerry Brockheimer. His words were well treated once before, at the magnificent Slakenhouse-5. <br /> <br /> Mother's Night may be one of the three novels written by Vonnegut that I was able to take to a desert island, along with Slaughterhouse-5 Bluebeard. <br /> <br /> The movie version is worth 10, but the books are a permanent part of my inner scene so much that I can not do it ... some of the scenes that have been left of the movie are part of my memory ...
