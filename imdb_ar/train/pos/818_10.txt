The "Return of the Jedi" is certainly the most exciting event in the series, and is a great ending to the story of Star Wars. With Han Solo being held by Jaba Hatta and the Empire in building the new star of death, the rebel alliance faces a tough struggle against the dark side, and only our favorite heroes will be able to fight. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence, on Tatooine, we see the Japa Palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and a new home for Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare to save him, and the forces of Luke Gedi, have the advantage. <br /> <br /> We are also witnessing a huge triple battle in the end. Han, Lea and Chewy are fighting a battle on Endor, desperate to deactivate armor that protects the star of death. The rebel fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while waiting for the armor to land, and Locke has a final encounter with Darth Vader. Epic ending to the classic epic, which is only the pace of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
