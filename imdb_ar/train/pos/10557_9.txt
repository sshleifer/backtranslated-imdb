I saw this only at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival, and it was funny like hell and a little surreal. Takes place in Toronto, where these two losers live in this run-down house in the middle of the highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are absolutely fantastic because the losers who want the world to disappear. Representation, dialogue and writing are very good, and the entire film looks great for such a low-budget click. The director / writer Vincenzo Natali was present in this show, and looked smart and modest. This man is very creative with these great stories that work well within the limits of small budgets, making Hollywood's huge budget budget shameful!
