Overall I would say I loved the movie. Some fighting scenes are really good. In particular the fight against Leong Kaian. One of the points that really bothered me is the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I really mean. Talk about bad taste. During a fighting scene, you see a fighter on the ground laughing. Otherwise, Sammo reproduces Bruce Lee's movements perfectly. 5 of 10 stars.
