Passport to Pimlico is a real pleasure for all British movie lovers. It is not only a fun and entertaining comedy, it is also a movie from a time back, with situations and scenarios that, unfortunately, are now just a memory in British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway plays the role of Pimlico Arthur Pemberton, after the accidental explosion of an unexploded ordnance, discovering a treasure from the medieval treasure belonging to the 14th century Burgundy Duke buried deep in the streets of these small suburbs through The last 600 years. <br /> <br /> The treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which has not been formally abolished) to show that this private London Street has been declared in the soil of Burundi, which means that under international law Pemberton and local residents Others are no longer British nationals, but the people of Burgundy and their small streets are an independent country in itself and a law in itself. <br /> <br /> This resi-ruined war and poor dents are in good shape because they think they are outside the law and the English mandate, so in the act of drunk challenge they burn their ration books, destroy and ignore their clothing coupons, blatantly ignoring British license laws Etc., and declare that they are completely independent of Britain. <br /> <br /> However, what happens next is always the black market and the evil crook follows suit and crosses the border to Burgundy as a haven of law and postwar restrictions to sell their dodgy goods, followed by half of London's consumers to avoid rationing , Making them a small, happy, quiet haven, a thorn for the robbers and somewhat crowded. <br /> <br /> Whitehall's appeal for help told me that due to developments, "this is now a matter of foreign policy, which the Majesty's government is reluctant to participate", leaving the population high and dry. However, they declare the area legal and, accordingly, have set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road, mainly to monitor smuggling rather than to ensure the safety of any Pimlico residents. <br /> <br /> In the end, the border was completely closed and a great siege began, as the Bogundians slowly ran out of water and food, but the fighting never said in real British style. "We are English and we've always been English, and because we're only English, we're fighting hard to be bogandians," says one Bogundian resident. "A feeling that resonates soon throughout the capital, as when you know the rest London is on the plight of the poor Bogandians, who all feel compelled to fall in and help them, by throwing food and supplies at the barbed-wire blockade. So the invaders may be brought over the centuries to this new group of foreigners, especially since these are English !!! <br /> <br /> A wonderful story, wonderful fun all the time. Not to be missed.
