I really liked the "how Christmas Grinch stole" when it was released and I still love it now, after 5 years. Many people still do not agree with my opinion, and this movie never received much love at the time it was introduced. <br /> <br /> Sure enough, the movie has become too much and a camp but it's also the same reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All groups, costumes and characters are done in a very pleasant way, without ever becoming truly ironic. It is a visually wonderful film to watch. It's a famous film made at its best! Director Ron Howard is really amazed with the fun little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the film is played and why it is so often watched is Jim Carrie, like Greenwich. It really carries the film in a good and fun turn. He was of course helped by the convincing make-up, which also earned the Academy Award. Of course if you love Jim Carrey, you should not even think about watching this movie. This film is really his film and it makes it fully functional and enjoys watching it. Other memorable fun roles are played by Jeffrey Tambour and Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans in the role of young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The film has a good sense of humor, but I am a little pleased. Maybe it's because I'm a Dutchman and we do not really celebrate Christmas with such enthusiasm and greatness here, as in the United States or England. For me, the movie was fun and enjoyable, and the spirit left me too cool to be honest. <br /> <br /> The musical result of James Horner is good and fun, although it's an average every day in Horner still everything works perfectly for the film and helps in accomplishing some of the scene works. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
