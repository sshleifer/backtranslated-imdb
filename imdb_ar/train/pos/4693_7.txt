Johnny Dangrios falls entirely into the category of "blow" or "miss", being overly exaggerated and lacks a comprehensive text or story that makes any sense. But that's the point, is not it? <br /> <br /> The cast is lovable; Michael Keaton is an excellent comedic performance before he takes himself seriously over the years. Griffin Dunn, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilo Henner and Danny Devito all play with enthusiasm and get at least a lot of laughter from me. But the full-fledged thief here is Richard Dimitri (the word "Iceholes" in the history of the film) as one of the gangsters who do the best in killing English. <br /> <br /> I have many childhood memories associated with this film, which I have often seen so I may be more likely to enjoy it. Johnny Dangrius is at least a parody of a gangster movie that conveys some good-faith messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like this but it's hard to recommend. <br /> 7 out of 10.
