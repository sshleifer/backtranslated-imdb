This film contains the size and grandeur of many great biblical epics in the 1950s and 1960s. But it may also be the first to confer human character on the biblical characters themselves. The best thing is that they do not reduce them in the eyes of the viewer. This unique and attractive balance helps us realize that even great people such as David are flawed and find their faith and greatness in the face of their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The actors are all first class in the film from Gilbert Barnett as the son of David II Absolom to the brilliant Susan Hayward in Bishba. Hayward is at its best in this film. Her honest but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here. She is never seductive, but she plays the role in a way that empathizes with her. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey does a great job like Nathan the Prophet. When I was a kid when I first saw the film, Massey seemed like he was talking to the Lord himself really and had a wonderful sight. There is no doubt that Alfred Newman's great music, which is always amazing, has also made great successes in other Bible works such as "The Robe" and "The Greatest Story Told" with perhaps 100 other films too! I have been shooting the cinema of Lyon Shamrui well and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film. Henry King, a real film director, like William Wheeler, has never fluttered with a dove in any one genre, combining a larger production of life and never forgetting the love story between David and Bathsheba and David's deep struggle with his faith in God. The pathway in this film could have been very choppy, but King kept it real and enjoyable along the way. In addition, we never lose the sense of ambiguity about trying to understand God's will, just as David is struggling with himself. From the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction. David is not satisfied with Nathan's answer (to rework) that no one can understand the will of God. This is the journey we begin until the strong end where David finally confronts himself. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film belongs to Gregory Peck, who is as great as King David. David to him is a man who could believe that he could rule a country mercilessly but was simultaneously a faithful singer of the Psalms. This is one of his best shows. <br /> <br /> I no longer see this movie on TV anymore, but when I do it I never fail to see it. I think it still stands very well today.
