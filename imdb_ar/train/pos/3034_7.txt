Add little to cinematic hatred Graham Greene - now perceived mistakes can be seen as virtues. The director, Schumlin, directs his work with a repressive hardness suitable for the material, and the ineffective combinations seem to suggest discomfort. ("The Feminine Character!" In the 1940s!), The film is a straight-angled, mad (and perhaps beloved) hero who brilliantly brings out ideologies far removed from the Spanish Civil War. To a perilous reality, he has one horrific murder, amazing insights about class and capitalism, clever play quizzes, a rare approximation of the god of Greene, and a happy ending only if you know nothing about history.
