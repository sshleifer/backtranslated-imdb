Alec Guinness is a very interesting political satire in the corporate industry, and an eccentric personality study as well. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is a bit slow for comedy, and none of them really flows. Funny type on the ground, except maybe sound effects for the test. But has amusing moments, which is very skillful in their implementation. Perhaps the big bang segment is the most comical element. <br /> <br /> The union's actions are very shocking, and it reminds us that I am elegant. Especially women's socialism of a romantic nature, the Guinness figure. Political machinations actually bear the story. Ernst Theissner is a very important figure. <br /> <br /> I do not think this works exactly as with customers, or the hearts of children and their children; but even the light of Ealing comedy is better than nothing.
