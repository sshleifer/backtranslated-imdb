Who does not know Largo Winch in the France, Belgium and Luxembourg trio (the three countries where "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are widely distributed)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which itself adapts to a series of novels, must be adapted to screens. After the first failed attempt with a TV show, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is what most fans do not get, the goal of this film is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. Some basic parts, characters and original actions are missing. The film itself presents an alternative and more recent version of the series. As a first-class comic book fan, I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are good as well as the script, although it may seem very fast. So I recommend this movie to everyone interested in financial / political excitement, but it's obviously not a substitute for the James Bond series or Jason Bourne where I can read online.
