This game is one of the best RPG. Grip, is actually more entertaining than anything else because of the battle system (you hurt the enemy depending on how the attack is directed, you can switch to the Dragon, your attack, magic ...). Very good script All characters are beautiful and you do not have long dialogues to support them, as happened in many Final Fintasy series games. I was bored by those conversations about the past, when you just wanted to follow the story of the game. Ambientation is a gem in this game, it combines the imagination of middle-aged and future science fiction. It is remarkable that the effects of the movement are incredible, I love it more than others in other modern games (we can not remember that the Legend of the Dragoon game is now 8 years old) Then, the map is huge and there are all kinds of places enemies. Finally, music is not the best game I've heard about, but it's perfect for such a game.
