This film really surprised me. I had doubts about it at first but the film became better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be about the work that seeks to gain the audience, but for those who like a clear picture of a very strange criminal, man, lover, and husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is not really for you. <br /> <br /> It's a little hard to follow the story sometimes, but in the end I think it made everything better. The end was unexpected because you almost believed it would end otherwise. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think it was good. The Oscar will not be for a long time but at least caught my attention. The image of Gil Bellows to the prison man is not always perfect but very entertaining. Sean Parkes' picture of Beloz Klein's companion is very impressive and powerful. On the downside, I think I'll put a picture of Esai Morales to Markey. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, either you will love it or you will!
