I saw this film for the first time in 1980 at the midday movie spot. After many subsequent views (and buying video), it still makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is the remains of another era - a local comedy set in the rich middle class of America - but well executed and well executed. But it is also a lifelong document - a celebration of optimism after the war, the baby boom, and the age of the emerging consumer. This film is not fun "guilty". <br /> <br /> Three wonderful and excellent actors - urbane Melvyn Douglas; Horribly designed Myrna Loy - complement each other and a team of memorable characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite viewers - "That means we should explode", "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This piggy". <br /> <br /> I love her.
