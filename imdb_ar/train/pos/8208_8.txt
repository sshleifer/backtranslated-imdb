I liked almost all the movies in the Dirty Harry series except for the one I thought was titled "Enforcer." "Deadpool" was a bit weak in the areas as well, but I still enjoy it. This is one of my favorites in this series, if there is nothing else for the great line "go ahead, make my day". This one also features an intriguing plot though familiar to a person who killed those who made her mistake. Just think of "Magnum Power" with less secret about who stands behind your plot killings. Granted there a little more because this features a very nice final finish in an amusement park. Dirty Harry also has the bulldog as a gift and explodes Sandra Lock in a rather funny scene. The only remaining question is why Clint Eastwood had to get the modest actress Sandra Lock in many of his films. She hits the score every time even when the movie is fun for me. Granted that it is not bad here, but her character could have been much better by someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes they seem to be ads for guns. I love weapons like the next person, but do we really need scenes from him explaining all the different strengths of his latest weapon and the number of bullets he carries? Still, very nice entry into a series of Harry filthy movies.
