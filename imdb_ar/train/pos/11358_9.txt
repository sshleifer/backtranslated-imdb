The quality of the lousy DVD video is the only reason I was given this movie 9 instead of 10. This has been much better, this movie deserves it. <br /> <br /> This movie covers several movie themes at once. If you do not like films about armed killers, but you are fascinated by the amazing bureaucratic culture of the former Soviet Union, this film must be seen anyway. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the "Silence" lambs for several reasons.The way in which the serial killer is filmed was much better in Citizen X. You see several details of his own life, because you "travel" with the killer, which Gives you an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only other film I have ever seen is such a realistic film "Henry - Picture of a Serial Killer." If you are fascinated by this movie, you will definitely need to take a look at Citizen X.
