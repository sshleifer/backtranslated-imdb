I have only seen IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but have been haunting me ever since. <br /> <br /> One sequence stays in my mind in particular, and it could have been designed by a great director, as Michael Kakoyannis did. <br /> <br /> Context: The weight of history and a mighty army and fleet are all on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. One of the secrets of the sea has been thrown into the sea, endangering his great mission to Troy. He was told that he must sacrifice his daughter Evgenia to Apollo in order to get the winds of the wicked from thousands of ships. At first he resists, but comes around him, and deceives his wife Clemenstra to bring their daughter to the Greek camp in order to marry the greatest warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Climtenestra and Evgenia arrive, knowing the sacrifice and anger of the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in this deceptive way. He climbs the hill to tell Evgenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> Snapshot: The camera revolves around the two young men, without looking directly at each other. They complain about their fate, the weakness of men who deceive their loved ones and desire for war. Suddenly, they look at each other, and for a moment, we feel all their power and beauty, and no surprise - except for the camera - the paradox that somewhere else, somewhere else, they may love each other and get married. It is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for a moment. <br /> <br /> What a trend! What a camera! What a storyteller!
