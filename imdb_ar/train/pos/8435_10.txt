Although there are some rough points and some of the plot lines that were not completely correct for the character, it was Classic H: LOTS. The characters, outside Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were real in composition, and the reunions of Pemblton (Andre Brauger) and Bayliss (Kyle Sikor) were as deep and visual as anything at all for a small screen. <br /> <br /> "Murder: The Movie" also known as "Eternal Life" is a fan flick, but it stands on its own and every two-hour episode of the series. Both Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura have done a great job of pulling out the 7 seasons and every important member of "The Best Curse on TV" together for a series that NBC never ends up giving. It is true that "murder" shape, there are no happy ends, this is life. This made the show always far away from the puppeteer shows that were left on TV. Glory to writers and actors to create something along the series and in the film that challenged television viewers and producers alike. <br /> <br /> ** I call myself a "maniac" if no one else has a reason to keep my coworkers in a cooperative mood. **
