The amazing and wonderful film about the restoration of the Gospel. Much better than any other movie, or film made about the restoration so far. If you do not see it, hop on a plane to Salt Lake and see it now. You will not regret! You really feel the knowledge of what the early saints should have been struggling with, and they have full and complete faith in the prophet Joseph Smith. In the end you get a kind of understanding of the things that the Prophet had to fight and the persecution that he and his people faced. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, watch this film, it will be logical and comprehensive afterwards.
