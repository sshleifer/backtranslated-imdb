Well, I must say I waited for it to come. <br /> <br /> I will not try to spoil it, and a few people have talked brilliantly about the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not quite sure of the understanding of the critics who claim to be fans of the BSG team and not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What did you expect frack? !! The background is set 50 years ago from BSG. We offer assistance at the birth of Cylons, see the life of the Adama family (already known from BSG), get a deeper explanation of the Caprican population and imagine it from other colonies, possibly the origins of the gods' faith in man and the unique faith of the god Selon. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same abundance of special effects or space opera as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two although I know that Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> This is an hour and 30 from the promising start, and I also think this will press the scenarios to be as good as BSG. I expect a lot of the following things, but I have no reason to doubt we will learn more. <br /> <br /> Watching the deleted scene on a DVD also provides more stuff for your brain to chew. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
