This impressive little flick made in 1967, with cool twangy jazz music and a plot that will make you laugh ... well, it's not really stupid but cheesy fun. I have seen many similarities between this and the "blue-eyed creature" (AKA The Dead Dead) and they have the same director! The oldest Scotland Yard is investigating the murders of young girls in college. It seems that the criminals are released from a local prison to bid from a bad person and then be returned when their job is done. There is a neat device hidden inside a gospel that produces brusic acid, and there is another device that is not elegant or secret, it looks like a large spray gun and the victim must be near the soak before it expires. Joachim Fuschberger plays the role of inspector, who often chews gum and looks far away. There is a "monk," and how does anyone recognize this thing as a "monk" outside me? He carries a scarf and vests in red clothes with a red lid and more than one member of a different color than the monk. There are all kinds of stylish appliances such as a fireplace, which rises and falls to recognize the monk, and goes directly to the fire without lighting his dress, an elegant trick there. This is a strange mix of crime drama with maddened tones, and although it's sometimes silly it's fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
