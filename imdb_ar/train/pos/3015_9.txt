Why can not this kind of entertaining mystery be portrayed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing along the way. The cast is a great band. William Powell shows the quality of the real stars. Who knows - maybe he was training on his future as Charles Kanek. It is a joy to watch. One can also see why Eugene Pallet made more than 200 films. He is a wonderful supporting actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is a pleasure to watch. Mary Astor works above average in a non-fatal role. All other chip hands in to make this a very enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes. I think Michael Cortez was running one ball. Bravo!
