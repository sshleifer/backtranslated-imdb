Containing the spoiler Except for John Wayne, no other actor sat in the saddle in the West more than James Stewart, and this film proves it. The story of this magnificent revenge revolves around the Winchester Rifle, only one weakness I can think of: casting Will Gear as a White Ehrb which is not much like. The choice of bad guys was good: Steven McNally, like Dutchman Henry Henry, Dan Doria like Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntyre (versatile in playing both good guys and bad guys) as an armed foe. The confrontation between Stewart and McNally on the Great Cliffs! I was emphasizing this West against the entire West crop. They will not stand a chance!
