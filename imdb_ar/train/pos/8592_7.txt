Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. Garrison's relationship with the First Lady was unrealistic and emotional. The President was a piece of cardboard. And who are the real bad guys anyway? Nothing has been sufficiently developed or explained. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole was involved. The bad guys were anonymous and uneducated, so they never felt involved in their scheme. Both Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to introduce some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were unbelievable in their roles. Basinger was completely lacking in character and Longoria could not be a secret agent. It could have been a very good film but somehow lost the way, with so many unanswered questions. Disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes. Did they use the "West Wing" in the scenes of the White House? - I kept expecting the appearance of CJ or Charlie!
