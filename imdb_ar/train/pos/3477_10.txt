Some people think that the second series was where scooby was destroyed .. I do not agree completely together. But the quality does not go up or down and win, I won my opinion, as a very good chrecter. I looked at the poll on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% Serial Scrappys II was the fall of Scoobys. Well, a few said yes, but 28% still are not able to. I like the way most episodes focused on comedy. I think the show was going to end up with the same 5 people / dog solving puzzle in the same formula. Scrabby was breathless on the air in the show. Sure, some people set it up, but when scrappy was displayed, DOUBLED.Back characters were displayed. All the episodes and sections were very funny. I was fascinated by yabba shorts, but in the end, it's a matter of opinion. If you like scrappy or not, it's a matter of opinion, certainly there is no common truth. But in my opinion this was a fantastic series that gave a start to the tires showing a new formula and rental life.
