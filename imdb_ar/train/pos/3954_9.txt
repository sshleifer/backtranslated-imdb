When people ask me to name the most horrifying movies I've ever seen, I always answer "Black Noon" and to this day I've never heard of it before. <br /> <br /> I saw him on my own about 30 years ago at 13 years old when my father left in the evening. As far as I know, it has only been shown once in the UK and unfortunately is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can follow a copy, please let us know. <br /> <br /> If you see it again now, it will probably be a big disappointment, but it has always been stuck in my memory as a very annoying little movie!
