I originally watched 8 simple rules on the Disney Channel in the UK for the first series and I got completely hooked. When they did not show it yet, it bothered them, but then the abc 1 disappeared showing the second string. I did not think another series would begin after I read that John Ritter had died, but the second series was not amazing. The last series returned to an excellent old standard. I hope they will continue to produce more shows soon though I can watch every show a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character like the Bridget airhead, as it performs amazing performance in Charmed. Rory is also good, also taking part in my name and Grampa. I will continue to watch it until it ends up hoping that it will continue as funny as it always has.
