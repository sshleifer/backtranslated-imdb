Send a young lawyer to a remote area to end the legacy of a recently deceased client. When he arrives, he finds that he was less welcomed by local villagers and that his deceased client was not loved. To speed things up, he decides to move from the local lodge and to stay in her house, a house that is often restricted and only approaches a road that runs to the sea most of the day. As soon as he sees visions of a black woman, he is real or imagined, and he is exposed to the cries of blood roaming by a child and apparently drowned in swamps. These events have an impact on him and soon become very frightening. A television adaptation in the atmosphere with a famous play by Susan Hill, which first spends building its characters, before moving to the scary country house, the bad color contrasts its television roots immediately, and it was supposed to be black and white, but still a ghost story. Disturbing moments passed, but although I waited a long time to see her, I must say I was a bit sad.
