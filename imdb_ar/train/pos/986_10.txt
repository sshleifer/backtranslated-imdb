If you like Jamie Foxx, Alvin Sanders, Date from Hell and 01, you will love his actions as a man who never gets a break in life and ends up with Jumbo Size and at the same time a lot of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has a lot of FBI eyes watching him and ends up getting a blow from the bricks in the jaw, David Morse, Edgar Clintin, "Hack", TV series 02, decides not to focus on the poor Alvin and his use of the so-called fish hook to attract The criminals. There is a lot of laughter, drama, cold-blooded killing, excellent movie spots and lots of expensive cars being sent to Junk Yard. Jamie Fox and David Morse were prominent actors in this film and had a terrific entertainment through out the entire picture.
