I do not know whether I would recommend this movie to Tetsu fans or not. Why Tetsu? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as "Tetsu" is very clear. The concept is similar, the editing is equal and equally fast - which is good because, besides making the film more dynamic, it obscures some of the disadvantages resulting from low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> Less exciting, and in the case of the "minced meat machine", the transformation of the human being into a partially created being is a machine called "Necroborg" (very original) caused by gentle young foreigners. <br /> <br /> This tiny, sticky slag from outer space is actually used by humans as bowls of wrestler games they play with each other. They are deployed in the body, and somehow they can put a crazy amount of mechanical parts in it, apparently pulling them out of nowhere and turning them into a killing machine aimed at other necrosis. Their goal is to defeat another alien in another Necroborg, taking him out of the corpse and eating it. <br /> <br /> All in all, the plot seems rather silly and I did not expect much, but in the end I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this is a budget flick, but it is still relatively fit. Do not expect too many actors, they are mostly not good, but can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere, the quiet and some strange situations and the way the film is directed and edited. Although the story is not very original, it has a certain charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
