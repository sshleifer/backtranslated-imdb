This is not a masterpiece theater. You should not go so expect it. This is a pure FUN girl with a cast over a wonderful female lead. As someone else said here, this is the film that the child was supposed to be Mama. The only downside I see in this film is that Tina Fei did not exist - and she starred as the smartest and smartest girl in the world. The film is eccentric on the surface, but if you see it you will know it contains a lot of messages and deep meanings for any one of us who wishes they can come back and do it again in life and they know what we know now. I recommend PURE FUN to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
