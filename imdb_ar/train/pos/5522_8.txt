The second part picks up ... not where the last movie stopped. As part of the near-familiar event of Stephen Soderbergh epic epic for 4 hours or more, my story is listed as a classic "rise" and "fall" scenarios. In the second part, Che Guevara left his post as a bureaucrat in Cuba and after a failed attempt in the Congo (only through the passage mentioned in the film), he went to Bolivia to try another jungle-like revolution. . Things are not going as well as planned, at all, perhaps because of Chi's then famous reputation as communist and revolutionary, partly because of America's involvement in the Bolivian government, and, of course, Castro was not "in fact a backup." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , And ultimately through a narrow and attached military force, but the saddest thing is that c One can see this as an amazing force or a fatal flaw - perhaps both - but it is also clear how a person begins to see qi, if not completely fully rounded, and then as something more sympathetic. The sequence in which Guevara's health gets worse without medication, which stings the horse horribly, is one of the most The films are unforgettable and satisfying in any film this year. , If, at times, is fairly slow (understandable because of the great run-time), and only one or two scenes are quite strange (Matt Damon?), But these are secondary responsibilities. As this time approaches the approach of colorful colored camera, this almost resembles the image of a militia-style war, very carefully listed for men in the group, as well as Guevara as the lord-over of this group, and how things dwindle in the final scene. As always, Del-Toro is at the top of his game, in every scene, every rhythm that knows this man well - for the better and worse - as close to being as possible as possible. In general, the two parts of Che are an impressive package: history as a drama in an attractive style, useful to the public even if he does not know Che or, better, if he does not think hard. It's special. 8.5 / 10
