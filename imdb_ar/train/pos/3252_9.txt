The story of "Woman From Anywhere" is fairly simple and fits perfectly with someone from Eastwood Spaghetti West: a mysterious stranger comes to an outlaw town run by a VIP and starts shooting at the place. Even the opening credits and music are felt by Spaghetti: Sergio Lyon and Anio Moricon will be proud. The really interesting twists are that the odd person is a beautiful woman (!), Saki (Ryuko Unikura) on Harley, and the location is located in a town somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> A large amount of fireworks, some of them good, some are predictable, and others are fairly hekey, but they are a great range of fun. Ryoko deals with her guns with sincerity and ordinary kindness and gives the thugs their right. It was not a big challenge for her, he was physically challenged, but she handled things well. She shows her acting skills like Otsu in NHK drama, "Musashi". <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the film if you love Ryoko Yonekura (who I love) and / or like "girls with guns" and admire the frequent scenes. For me, there is something unintelligible about "girl-in-arms" films like "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight." And for a fabulous gal like the Ryoko starring in it is just crumbs of ice on the cake.
