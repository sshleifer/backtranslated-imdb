She may go with her husband to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is embarrassing because grandchildren and "children" do not really know each other as one would expect. The warmth that should be there is missing. After dinner, the Mayo husband says he is not satisfied, blames his daughter for cooking, and says irritably that he wants to go home. He died that night. <br /> <br /> A widow may have been lost now. She obviously did not have a passionate or very emotional marriage, but she had a goal. She had someone who needed her, and although her own needs had not been met for years, they were tied to her days. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and unenthusiastic. Goes to stay with her daughter Paola, who allowed her mother shortly after her arrival, to know that she never felt that her mother gave herself at all. She gives up anger because her mother is not being cared for. It seems that Mai has been disarmed and surprised, but does not seem to have the energy or desire to make it right. "I am your mother and I love you." What does he really say? (I've heard this from my mother's way many times and have not figured out what it means.) Paula is a little nervous (well, more than a little). Both women are in need, although they appear quite differently. <br /> <br /> Paula has been involved with a friend of her son, Darren, a witty worker working at her son's house. While Paola works during the day, Mai starts talking and lunching with Darren. Darren is a married man who resided with his wife because of their autistic son, Nicky, but is supposed to not live at home with his wife. <br /> <br /> You may become attracted to Darren because he is so sensitive that she enjoys the contact they seem to have. Darren is attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understands that he does not get it from other women in his life. (He is also very interested in the money that Mai says she can give him "to get away from everything," although he is obviously not interested in wanting to join him on such a trip.) They end up sleeping together in the reserve room during the day, As a woman she had not known for years, she did not expect to know her again. As her daughter Paola told her she would leave Darin married, this became part of May's rationalization. "In the writing group led by Paula , Was introduced in May, instead forced to conspire with a widow who was not attracted to her.There is one scene practiced Sex with the older man, who is obviously barely able to perform, is really painful and unstable because we feel absolutely disgusted in the face of May and she bears the dreadful one-time contact. <br /> <br /> Finally, Paula discovers through Some very graphic sketches were made by her mother, who was already her mother and Darren having sex. <br /> <br /> This film will undoubtedly be seen by many in countless ways. May reveals through a short article she felt as if she hated her children by the end of the day, and will leave to the bars after they were asleep N, making sure to go home before her husband. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a good mother does not think of leaving the children alone while she goes to the local pub. However, she also revealed in the film earlier that her husband did not like to have any friends, so she did not have any. She did what she wanted her to do. She was miserable but she carried her because, she said, "it was easier." So, while May was not the best mother, for those who tend to sympathize with her, one may think that May's actions are the act of a woman who just wants to be a sexual and live for a few minutes in her life. A woman wanted to be heard by someone, to know her as a human being, to have a friend and a lover. <br /> <br /> Paula, though nervous and unhappy, may have become this way because of the distant parents who set her up. Certainly, it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It's a good-performing film, with more complexities than I mentioned, and certainly a movie that will leave the viewer with many, possibly conflicting, reactions. It is a film worthy of discussion and discussion, and above all, worth watching. <br /> <br /> There is one thing the film leaves us with the horror and fear of a single life. Regardless of who he considers "right" or "wrong" by every viewer, the theme of aging and loneliness, which is most frightening to us, is inevitable.
