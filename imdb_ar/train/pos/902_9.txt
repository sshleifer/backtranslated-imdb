I thought this film was really wonderful because in cinemas in India nowadays, all you see is skin, music and misconduct ... In this film, you can see some traditions and ethnic origin, at least some decency ... although it was Some parts a little dramatic, guess what? This is what is going on around Indian cinema! After watching this film, at least you do not get headaches from all the loud music or any violence, it's just the truth, it's about love, and of course caring for the person you love all the life ... I think it was a wonderful film ... kids can watch it without a minimum Doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that was India's sure depth ... until all these rappers, short skirts, and leather skin became part of it.
