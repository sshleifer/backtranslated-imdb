I'm sure this is a show no one knows and may not think about; after all it is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, location, style and publicity of her? Women walk around the beach and all. No wonder people have a misunderstanding and decide not to see it. <br /> <br /> It was a mistake to do so. The reason after I decided to watch the show, there are actually more things going on, a real thrilling story and a conflict, turning out to be really exciting to watch them pretty much? Addiction. <br /> <br /> The story of hotel writers, manager and owner and their complex lives. Also enter a disturbing hotel visitor and a strong guy who tries to steal the hotel. It's actually more exciting than it seems here. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that act absorbs but it is not bad that you will look away. The story is not consistent but good enough. Soundtracks are well suited to the scenario and work all the time. It took me several episodes before anything actually happened, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really enjoyed watching this. Zillion Times is better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my rating after reading it, thanks.
