Since the day I saw this film when it was introduced in 1981, it was one of my best 3 films. The blow I wrote about Amazon below, I am very pleased that it will finally be released on DVD on 10/17/06 - 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The latest credit in this film explains the appeal - "Thanks to the people of Manhattan on this island was filmed." This is a love story written for the people of New York (Peter Bogdanovich) who can identify every place (West 12 Street, Ansonia, Old Schwartz Organization, Plaza, The Roxy, Chee Brigitte, and the city limits that were rural and western). ). One gets the impression that the whole group has been clicked on as well as off the screen as they do, and this intimate relationship is clearly communicated. I laughed, cried, was better than CATS. Not only was Dorothy Sturten's poem, but also the last appearance of Audrey Hepburn (she had a veil later) and leaking out of her inner beauty from the screen. Buy it, make a large basin of popcorn, and curl with someone you love.
