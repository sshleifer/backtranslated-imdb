Yes, Keaton seems to really enjoy making this film. As he walks through his pinned suits, he will remind you of Jimmy Cane! Johnny (Keaton) is a young hood who does just that to pay his mother's expensive medical bills and send his younger brother (Griffin Den) to the law school. Nobody even knows Johnny Kelly is Johnny Gravity until later in the film. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and does not like Johnny One (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice singing / dancing routine while Johnny does it. I love the part when they are in a constantly changing getaway car! The policeman who "calls all cars" is Skipper from Gilligan Island! See this one for 1930 laughing bands! The gags in this movie are hilarious but you have to pick them up or you'll miss them! See the background of each scene.
