My observations: Post-war fun. Tom Drake and Grandfather from the film "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reid is charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton is as good as always. Part smaller than in the Wizard of Oz. The Byington Spring Way is nicer, also with a small foggy nose that lacks Hamilton. The tent scene at the end with the former boy next door was hilarious. As a veteran in army tents, he looked young and inexperienced when he looked into his eyes. <br /> <br /> I used to work in a multi-section store, and it was just as stylish as this store. Unfortunately, it disappeared and faded into obscurity. We were famous for the great display windows that were used to attract passersby to the store, to get them to buy all those wonderful goods. <br /> <br /> 10/10
