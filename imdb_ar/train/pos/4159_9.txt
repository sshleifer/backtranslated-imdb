Anyone who thinks of anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. It's a wonderful film that tells Tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but he is also growing up in the process. The trip on the train represents Tetsu's journey from childhood to manhood. The music and visual styles of the film are a bit old (you can say it's a movie in the 1970s) and the animations are a bit better than the regular "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and characters are very strong, does not really matter. Must see for any cartoon lover!
