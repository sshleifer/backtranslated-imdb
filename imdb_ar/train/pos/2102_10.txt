When I sat down to watch "Largo Winch" I did not expect more of the traffic scenes and wonderful cars. When I stood up, I saw both; and more. <br /> <br /> Finally, Karl Rodin was not the opponent in the film, and he started. Christine Scott Thomas played her role well, but the two real stars in my opinion are Tomer Sesley and Micky Manuelovic, both of whom are doing well. In Radivoje Bukvic portrayed Goran well. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics has brought a beautiful color to the film, but I understand why people are bored with it. <br /> <br /> The scenery of Hong Kong and especially the stunning seashore both amazed me, and I barely wanted to keep my eyes off the screen when I entered the incredibly beautiful island Largo. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if anyone likes expensive limousines; this is their film. It's also a movie for people who like motion sequences, good acting, extreme beauty landscapes and, above all, a fast-paced, well-written action film, with dazzling fighting and a completely twin inner drama. <br /> <br /> My vote, because it has lit up a bleak day is: 10/10
