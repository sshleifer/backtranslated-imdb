The musical in the 1940s was usually a specific formula - and if you've studied movies that know what I'm talking about - some of the theater shows are very exhilarating, they were fantastic on the surface but they did not go into real characters, br /> <br /> This one is different - and the light years are better and worthy of being nominated for the best picture of the year - 1945 (although he did not have a chance to defeat the final winner - Lost Weekend). <br /> <br /> Jane Kelly may have been in the best form of his career - yes, I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This one is different. In his character "The Wolf of the Sea" (in the beginning), he admitted that "picking up a girl during the vacation" was nothing more than a grave. And if you have to make up a "story" to get it - so be it - even. Much like a music man when he gets "his foot stuck in the door". The joy of the film ultimately stems from the attempt of his new friend (Sinatra) to make a good "story" in order to "get the girl" who falls in love with her unexpectedly. You should see the film to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In addition to the many other elements of the wonderful film in this film, it is a classic companion story, nostalgic for a time when World War II was almost over (the war ended about a month after the movies) A realization that a person who has always laughed at life can really know that he is a great person, wonderful songs and perhaps some other elements of classical filmmaking I can not think right now. <br /> <br /> Why do not I do 10? Near the end - at about two and a half hours the feeling starts for a long time. There is a small number of ballet dances performed by Gene Kelly, which should have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and seems to be adding only minutes now. But in general, this is a clear winner on every level.
