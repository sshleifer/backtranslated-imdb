Shuli beautiful short temple. The child actors who scream in their lines seem to be the norm for that day and time. Perhaps it should be "seen and not heard". Apart from this is fun. Given the age of films, there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social point of view, that make me amaze me more progressive and liberal. I'm not going to go here, I'd rather not spoil it for you, but let's see it yourself and see if you discover these elements. In the early days, it was easy to see from this shortcut the charm was already evolving to the temple. This makes it worth watching if you are a fan of the temple. For others, a great way to kill for ten minutes while waiting for a cup of good night milk to warm the fireplace.
