Intimate film. The usual wonderful work by John Zul, who recently died. Man was always very humble. I have been one of the top ten representatives in England for sure of my time. <br /> <br /> It can be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. As Jack Reagan in 1970 hit the TV series "Sweeney and a lawyer at Kavanah QC.You should see it all the family and a great DVD for my group." The film will bring back memories of people who remember Britain during wartime and those who were evacuated from London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters Tom and the boy William acted very well and true to the book by Michel Magorian.
