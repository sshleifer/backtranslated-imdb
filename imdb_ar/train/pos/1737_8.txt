I love old Bert Reynolds movies. It's fun and better than any common movie. They may have stopped making films after "Cannonball Run 2", but I think they knew there would be no other good movies? Man this movie is good. Bert Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and walk around in a race car, and the luxurious Lonnie Anderson is at hand, looking very hot in the 1980s. Bert and Lonnie, those were the days! I used to have this magazine where Lonnie Anderson was advertising a vaccine cleaner. I definitely love this ad! In addition, there is one part of the film where the public at the racetrack gets upset by something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) shows, and there is one person in the audience who is bending and fixing his finger recently to show his disappointment! I laughed so hard almost passed away! If you can find this movie, rent it! Then you do not see another film again, because I'm telling you now: no use.
