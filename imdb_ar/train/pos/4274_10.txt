I like this film very much, but the truth is that you can not understand it, unless you are from the former Yugoslavia. Most actors have now died and those were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can get it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. the black Mountain. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was the former Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balkans. It could be the land of dreams, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists did not poison the minds of the nation with their sick thoughts.
