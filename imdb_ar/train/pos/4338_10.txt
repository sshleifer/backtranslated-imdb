The film was very moving. It was tender, and funny at the same time. The scenery was very nice! Peter Falk and Paul Reiser presented awards. Olympia had great dachks. I understood that because of the line of the story, her role must be short, but I wish I could see her more, she is a real supporter. You will be able to remember your own life experiences, hoping in a positive way after seeing this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in Q and A after watching. He is a wonderful, intelligent, eloquent man and a "real person". It was a really enjoyable night! It's a must-have film. You will be very grateful went.
