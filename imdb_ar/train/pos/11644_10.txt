This offer is great! I have been a fan since I first made it, and I only have to watch ... I've seen some terrible things here, and I wish I had not done it, but it shows you how addiction affects all concerned, not just addicted. You can see all sorts of different addiction, from drugs and alcohol to a shopping addict, or an addict of eating disorders. In fact, it is really sad to see some of the famous faces that have also emerged. We've seen great musicians, NBA players, and even young people, who really need help. And because they started showing some follow-ups, it was also great. Now, you can see how long it is after the broadcast. If you have not unchecked, please do so. It's on A & E, it's great! The new EPS is Sunday nights at 10 pm EDT, if I remember correctly ... set TiVo!
