Best movie about marriage and family. These are very interesting reflections for couples that will come to a dangerous and paradoxical world of marriage and family. This decision can be the best or the worst in our lives and the lives of our children. Real snooping or helping "friends" or hangman if we leave. The real role of families: They can help or they can destroy us. The crazy priest who may not be too angry to say what can happen according to statistics and reality. The couple who are considering a "private" marriage live a painful story in their future history. <br /> <br /> Who loves marriage? No one, after telling the priest their history ?? If they leave the future with other hands, if they do not know what marriage is. That the problems are real, that life requires real participation, guarantees, from each one. That the real victim of divorce are children, with real name? Andrea's film or names. That abortion is only an easy way out: grief, sorrow and unhappiness will be there after the abortion. That the state and social security think each time less in the real problems of families. Gossip "friends", betrayal because of weakness and despair of Stefania because Tomaso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Stefania and Tomaso, deep in their hearts, admire marriage and the beautiful family, if not, why love marriage? A true and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: of each of their decisions, of every act in their lives. The family can be a place where everyone feels loved because of his or her presence, just by being there. Great screenplay. The presentations are superb: Stefania and Tomaso, the almost cynical priest! Excellent direction and scenario. Color and camera management, fantastic.
