Strange and exciting, he forgets a full story and full of science fiction in a low budget about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They have witnessed a series of events that are rising at the level of strangeness; they seem to have fallen into a drift in time and space, where the past, the present and the future collide. <br /> <br /> This is an excuse to review very entertaining special effects - a continuous visual and acoustic display, creatures resembling dinosaurs that have in each other, a little friendly ET and a small granddaughter who charms and so on. This picture does not show some imagination, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very nice music by Richard Band, with special effects such as David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Coran, and most importantly, a beloved family is the main asset. It generates a sense of surprise like a child. It may be very good that it is difficult for children (or children within many of us) to be able to overcome any drawbacks in narration or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to resist. It's a short and beautiful rendition (80 minutes), and a great preference for director John "iPod" Cardos (from the fame of "The Spider Kingdom") and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
