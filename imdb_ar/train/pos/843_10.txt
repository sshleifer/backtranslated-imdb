Not to mention the best performance of Pierce Brusson. Of course Greg Kenner is always wonderful. Really, when was it really bad? I think this movie has been incredibly understated! The use of colors in this film is quite different in today's film world where every other film has a Blue Payback candidate. I also liked the way they used the Asian song. To prove that even what was previously thought to be somewhat cheesy can be quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I was making my first advantage when I came out this. Since my film was a successful film, I had to check anything in the type that was released. After seeing him, I'm sure he had some influence on me during the process. It was very impressive when my film got on IMDb, it would recommend this movie if you liked my film. How related to any of the others I have no idea, making the coincidence more interesting. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
