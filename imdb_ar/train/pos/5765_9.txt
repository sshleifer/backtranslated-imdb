Zombie Bloodbath is a zombie film for zombie lovers with true love for horror. As I understand it from the commentary and the things I read, it happened during the huge flood in the Midwest in 1993 when half of Missouri was under water. The buildings were under water. Cars and homes were under water. An article said that zombie and crew of this film will help sand in the river after the shooting every day. The fact that this movie got absolutely is a miracle. It is like a huge mash of every zombie movie ever put through a Troma filter. It's a concert film to enjoy with friends who love a lot of nice characters. He is walking fast, lively and really funny. <br /> <br /> The toxic spillage of a nuclear power plant has caused people to melt or become zombies. The local government covers it, tears the factory and building houses above it. Some change in the earth (?) Opens a cave to develop it and some new inhabitants find the cave and unleash the newly built community. From there it becomes crazy and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I have read these reviews here several times. It seems clear to me that the same person has attacked this three-part movie three times as a different reviewer, using fake names. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie Bloodbath cheap. It's raw. She has some bad representation. So do half the movies. There is much worse than this fun movie. If you hate this movie a lot, do not buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast "Trailer Trash". Obviously you are not from Australia or England. It is disturbing that this wonderful service, IMDb does not catch people who use it just to get rid of others. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not mind those. I give both reviews bad and good myself. But it is painfully clear that some idiot just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this film. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "reviewers" basically charge their "review" just to promote their own films. One called this boring movie - well, I like it or hate it, one thing you can not say about this movie is that it's boring. It moves fast and has no boring place. <br /> <br /> Hey this reviewer from the Netherlands ??? Mother - liar. I tried to publish this same review in the Amazon and grabbed it there. SAME was reviewed only by the fact that she was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense has stopped. Love it or hate it - give it a real review or write something. You obviously did not watch movies. <br /> <br /> But for the record, this is not the best I've ever seen, but it's far from the worst. Even worse, I will give an actual answer and will not personally attack the manager. <br /> <br /> We hope this review will help some people see the stupidity that is happening here.
