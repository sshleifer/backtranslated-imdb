As we all know that romantic comedy is the kind that ends with the end. Both must always meet. At the end of the third chapter I was trying to figure out how this would end and how they would end up together. You have been given an idea right from the beginning, but you will not realize it until the end. It's a simple link, but it works. You've had to cover a lot of the usual ground, but take a new spin whenever possible. I liked all the characters in New York and loved the sites. It's a postcard from New York. It was also good to watch a movie and not find anything offensive. So, if you love a good old romantic movie ... this is for you.
