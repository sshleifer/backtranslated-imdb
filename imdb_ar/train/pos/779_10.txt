In the north-east of Brazil, 12-year-old Marian (Fernanda Carvalho)'s 12-year-old mother sells his daughter to a middleman in a prostitution agency, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be employed as a domestic servant and a better life. However, the girl is sold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who empties her, and gives the abused girl to his teenage son to get his first sexual experience. They are then sent to a brothel in a gold field in Amazonas and explore its owner, a filthy Sarayva (Antonio Calone). When Maria flees to Rio de Janeiro expecting a better life, she is explored by Cavin Vera (Darlin Gloria). <br /> <br /> "Angus do Sul" reveals the sad and shameful truth of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Maria. Last year, I saw "Lilja 4-ever", which tells a similar story in the former Soviet Union, so this problem exists in Third World countries. Director and writer Rudy Lagman presents a great film that shows the truth but never shows naked or sexually explicit scenes. It is the first time for promising Fernando Carvalho, who has an excellent performance as a child who is afraid to fight for survival. Most prostitutes are amateur, and it is impossible to identify the well-known Darlin Gloria quite differently closely after cosmetic surgeries. The bitter and desperate end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
