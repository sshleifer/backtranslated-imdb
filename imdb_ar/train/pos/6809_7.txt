This was a very good film. I'm not sure if this is a comment on the spoiler, but I do not want to take this opportunity. In any case, near the end of the film, the plaintiff reads a verse from the Bible and then cites another of the memory. I can not remember the first passage that he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says that it is Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage used by many to defend the death penalty. It is very bad that the prosecution does not dare quote the Bible today. Has anyone heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court judge in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best in all books. Too bad we lost this view in America.
