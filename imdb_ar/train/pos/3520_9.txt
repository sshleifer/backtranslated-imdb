This is the film "Series B" Noir, a voice reflecting his membership in this genre. I watched this film last night at a cinema on the Left Bank in Paris, where a two-week film was opened. The film has some flaws, yes, but a lot of delicious ingredients can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> As noted by the previous reviewer, the scene of the drumming is incredible! (B movies can be trampled where the movies have been blocked!) And the plot is interesting. As for the French Tun, however, I beg the difference: for me, it is appropriately ambiguous. Only the right shade of creepy. One has to bear in mind that there is a kind of German expressionism that takes place here (the director, Robert Seydmark, Germany came to Hollywood during the war), so the atmosphere of exaggeration fits all this film. It is at least for me. <br /> <br /> However, it was the brilliant Ella Raines who kept this scene in her third film only. The type of "Friday Girl" is very similar to Jean-Jane Tierney, it's no wonder she did not become a family name. But it's so good here that I just asked for another film ("The Effect") outside the Internet, and I can not wait to see it either.
