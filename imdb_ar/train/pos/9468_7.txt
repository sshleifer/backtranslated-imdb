I've seen a special offer for today. I must tell you, I'm not a big fan either with Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I had no expectation of that. I ended up enjoying it a bit. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life is the story of a widow with three daughters going to spend the weekend with his family. While in a library, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to discover that she is his brother's friend. <br /> <br /> This movie is well done - soundtrack, film and acting are all top notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with this was that it often seemed that there was a lack of personal development, most of them with the character of Dane Cook. We never took a closer look at the relationship between the characters of Dane and Steve, and felt that this could have helped a little to show how Dan's inner conflict was about love in Dane's love. Otherwise, Dan in Real Life is definitely a great movie - it's definitely a nice break from all the horror movies we've had this year.
