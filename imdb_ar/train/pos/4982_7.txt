I love these baby diaper movies! You can not make a movie like that today and it's rich in cinematic history. It's stupid and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does. How they made these children "act" I will never know. I think they value and laugh at the children, but the others who made this film do because it shows the naivet√© that existed in the early 1930s. You have to remember that this was when filmmaking was at an early age, the stock market had collapsed, and depression all over the world had begun, and these films were made to give someone a break from the real world. The fact that you can watch movies for five cents is incomprehensible, but then dine for 25 cents. It was a different time with a completely different mental group.
