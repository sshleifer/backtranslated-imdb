A record high to the tale of fame that has a few high points. The number one, Lunette Mackie as a sister, offers amazing performance and star-making. The fact that it did not become a sensation after this is beyond me. Unfortunately, she is a supportive figure and we are forced to focus on Irina Carter's kind character, Sparcl, whose reputation has become easy, boring and unconvincing. However, whenever girls start on stage and perform, the film returns to life. The original music of Korys Mayfield should be praised. The version I saw was a very old VHS tape. The image quality was very low, as were the production values ​​I guessed. All in all, it's worth the guard.
