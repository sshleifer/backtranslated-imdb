This is what I call a wonderful film. She lives through the skills of a wonderful actor and a simple but human story. There are real characters that can be funny and exciting. But the main theme is very harsh, such as live is that the bus driver and his son gather people all over the country (Yugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrade. The ridiculous and cruel positions that occur on the road, continue between people and pigs that travel together. <br /> <br /> Watch it and remember it for life ... full of Slavic humor and way of life. <br /> <br /> Another reason for his charm: it's hard to get !!
