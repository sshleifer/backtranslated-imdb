This was a wonderful accommodation for Jane Eyre. The only problem I had was that I did not like Zila Clarke. I thought it was very old and made Jane look shy. In Jane's book he looked like a much stronger figure. I was really upset by this picture of her. The part that is the next morning of Rochester asks her to marry him and rush to him and always laugh. I think she made a bad choice in her casting. But Dalton was just as wonderful as Rochester. It makes this version of Jane Eyre worth watching. Another thing that made this version not 100% quality is the movie. I know it was made in the 1980s for television. If it were a feature film and better quality, it would have been perfect. My main complaint is that Zella Clark was definitely too old.
