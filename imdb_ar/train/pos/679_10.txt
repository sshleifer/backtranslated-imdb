This wonderful Peter Weir is one of the most exciting and brilliant films ever made. Richard Chamberlain performs his best performance here as an Australian lawyer defending a group of indigenous youth accused of murder. The closer he gets to the case, the more he learns about the main defendant, Chris, not about himself. Chris tells him that he is a molorol, which seems to be a race of supernatural beings that have lived in Australia for thousands of years. At the same time, unusually heavy rains seem to confirm the indigenous prophecy of the coming of the last wave, which will plunge the world. <br /> <br /> The dream sequence and supernatural effects reinforce this film and make it an amazing experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Golbilel knit in supportive roles, as well as a chapter with a hard name that plays the role of Charlie, an old oboriginal who can turn into an owl. Do not disappoint the peak and the end, unlike many supernatural thriller movies that fall after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure film. It is also a drama and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, master of dramatic dramas.
