I did not expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then the story began, unfolded in a film filmed beautifully and quickly I was surprised and pleased with this story (basically). Made me want to read more about this wonderful character, which meant that the director achieved his purpose, and the film was successful!
