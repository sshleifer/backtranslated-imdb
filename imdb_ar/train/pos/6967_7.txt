An introduction to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica by the same creative team as Ronald DeMore and David Eck, as well as the new co-creator of Remy Obuchon. Caprica is located in the 12 colonies about 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. The new series in addition to human drama also lists the key steps in developing what will become the Cylon race. <br /> <br /> The Graystone's, featuring Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius, corporate leader and his brilliant daughter Zoe (Alessandra Torison), has been appointed to follow two families; the Ada Joseph (Isai Morales) has a lawyer and his son William the future Admiral of the King of Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, the series includes some of the most experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some relatively new talented actors including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> For Battlestar Gallactica fans, there are similarities and continuity with this series, but they are also different. In the experimental model, there are at least science fiction elements, but they are a smaller part of the series. The scenes in Caprica, while reflecting a more technologically advanced society, also have an old feel, and this is achieved through some architectural structures, fashion and the way they are portrayed. <br /> <br /> While the appearance and appearance of the two series have some fundamental differences some themes will look very familiar, and religion is again very important here, while the ethnic theme rarely touched on BG is much more important. We also see terrorism with a spirit and whether the machine can own one, as well as issues related to crime and government. <br /> <br /> The pilot was released directly to the DVD in an expanded file and unpublished version before being broadcast on TV. The series is scheduled to begin in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, This series is in Vancouver
