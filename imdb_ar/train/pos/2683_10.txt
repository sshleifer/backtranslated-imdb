Franco, once again, proves that he is the surreal and dramatic prince of cinema. True, many of his works can be seen as amusing, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he really is capable of when he allows his distorted creativity to run riots and gives us a sleepy and mysterious film while maintaining rave sexual excitement rooted in his work. The wonderful result of Jerry van Ruijn springs as the viewer is thrown from one strange scenario to another as we follow the experiences of the striptease artist (Renault), who may have schizophrenia, or may be (as a mysterious person says) a demon, or try to deal with the world in which you live . A beautiful and mysterious cinematic piece is highly recommended to anyone with a fleeting interest in alternative cinema.
