The pickup of Samuel Fuller in South Street is an anomaly: the film "Red Scare" is devoid of hysteria, where the communist threat is nothing more than a McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pick Becher Richard Widmark loosened a loose woman Jean Peters from her purse containing a microfilm tape. Without knowing either, it contains vital secrets of the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, was under surveillance by FBI agents who are not as upset by the robbery as the man he runs, a thin cowardly Richard Kelly. In an attempt to recover the precious film, both parties are using the help of Thelma Ritter, an old Jane on the street who is always willing to sell what she hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller paints a rich palette of rhythms and tons in story telling, which becomes a race against the rising hour of brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, the mid-summer maid in Manhattan takes an almost sweaty shine. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark became an unstable mix of turbulence and tenderness. They were recorded on "Again," a song by Ida Lupino at Road House, and Widmark. The scene of Ritter's death is written down and played beautifully - among the most influential short stories in every nuance, and a sort of oasis of mirage in a movie that drops feelings. This is the only work by writer / director Fuller at the far end of the Noir course; his subsequent explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Kissed Naked, Underworld USA) did not produce a satisfactory combination like Pickup in South Street.
