One of the best (if not the best) offers Stephen King. Dark as it can be dark, amazing ends of non-Hollywood, terrifying atmosphere, amazing adaptation of the book, wonderful actors, educators (do not play with the afterlife), in short - everything must be an awesome horror ... <br /> <br> /> My favorite horror film, Straight 10+.
