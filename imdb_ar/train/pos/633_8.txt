Stardust is another watchdog review (originally written on June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> I've just started a marketing machine for this one only (there's still no website yet?), So I doubt most of you have heard about it. In fact, I was not. When I got the post, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried that Transformers, one of the movies I wanted to see when I was not working, so I enjoy it 100% as a deadly artist award. It turned out that he was not the Transformers and I was familiar with them when the movie "Neil Jiman" came back. what is he talking about? Well, in short, it's a fairy tale from Jiman about a boy and a fallen star. Any more, I will give up the piece of land that (a) breach the contract, and (b) spoil the pleasure. If you really want to know what's going on, buy the book. Rumors say Jimman may be just a writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie may not be fun if the surprise is worthwhile. And for this one, it certainly was. This show was "distinctive" because it included not only film critics, but also exhibitors (rarely having a mixed show) and local science fiction / fiction people. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and Stardust address, you know what to expect. <br /> <br /> What an error you're sweet. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fairy tale written by a famous author in a comic book. But he was not Lord of the Rings. It was not even Lord of the Wannabe Rings (important, Aragon). It was more intimate than that. <br /> <br /> But, like the Lord of the Rings, it was the humanity of the film that sold fantasy characters. It's definitely a romantic story, but with generous spots of humor. This humor is of a kind that does not represent a clear hierarchy. It's more like drama than comedy. Before I go forward, let's do this review thing. <br /> <br /> Acting, at least, is good. It's always hard to say more about fantasy films, but I think there have been important roles. Michelle Beaver is not, unfortunately, one of these. Play an evil role, and do the job. nothing special. Robert Everett, though, was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole, well, Peter Freckin and Autol - which is great. Ricky Gervais is completely cast and explains why. Robert de Niro seems to enjoy much of it. When he wanted to deliver goods, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) In his leading personal capacity was a good surprise from someone I had never heard of before. <br /> <br /> Claire Dance. Claire Danis. Claire Danis. I have always been of mixed opinion with her. They can be wonderful, and then they seem to miss the mark. In this, it's the former. They are, literally, the star of this film. Sure, her tone stumbles here and there. And yes, it's not as good as can be when Cox is not in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are muted after they are done, which is important only where they should be. Best Airship So Far - Sorry Potter. The trend is lighthearted and flows well. Filming could have been better than New Zealand films. Everything else is the top bracket. <br /> <br /> Now that this has been done ... <br /> <br /> ... write. Oh, the writing! Neil, you are the devil. It is difficult in today's climate to do anything original, and at first, I began to wonder. Kingdom, dead king, boy proving his own worth, witches, ghosts, search (or three) - what's new? But the story of Gaiman paints you with its superficial importance just to sabotage it all into a sweet original story for a boy and his heart. Although you doubt how everything will end, you begin to wonder in chapter three - and if I am - you find yourself engaged in a dramatic climatic confrontation and hope for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this film, is what all fairy tales should be but most often not. Fiction and real. <br /> <br /> (I hope to talk about Septimus and Tristan but I will not spoil it for you.) For those who read the book, be reassured, it was done correctly. <br /> <br /> I had I then spoke with them the same way I felt. A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new generation {WITHHELD} for this generation. The vacuum is filled only after the movie is released widely because, perhaps, you might expect it. You'll know when you go out, anyway. I sincerely hope that Stardust will not be lost in the camps. Even if that is the case, it would be a pleasure to put pressure on everyone I know. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I forgot to add {WITHHELD}. It was a few years late, but ... "A wonderful movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> Maybe a fairly high assessment but I'm still confident that the years are shaping up now, there will be the same response "Oh, I love this movie", as now with The Princess Bride.
