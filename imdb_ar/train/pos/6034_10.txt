Last November, I had the opportunity to watch this film at the Renault Film Festival. I must say it was a lot of fun. Some technical errors aside, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially from the man who played the leading role. There is a lot of heart in this film, a lot of intelligence to. I had the opportunity to talk to a few filmmakers after finishing it and looked nice. All in all, the whole movie was just a positive experience, and I definitely recommend it. The story was amusing and wonderful, as a woman who faced many of the same problems as the leading man, and I can understand his problems because of them. The film does a great job of providing us with people we can sympathize with. Friends are written in the film really well, they are realistic. I know people like these, just wish Imy friends and I can look great like these people when we talk. The whole movie is really wonderful and I wish there would be more movies like him. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
