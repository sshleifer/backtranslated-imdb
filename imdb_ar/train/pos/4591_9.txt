It's frustrating to see where Jackie Chan ended up. He used to be a hurricane that could not be stopped by punching, kicking and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in his 50s and one expects some slowdown. But with Rush Hour 3, where he takes the back seat of Chris Tucker (for all people!), Then there is "Kung Fu Panda" where he not only plays a role, but his character barely has any dialogue. .. To say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a huge understatement. <br /> <br /> It looks like this when the only solution is to take out an old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some donkeys in his youth. , Experimenter, free days from Chris Tucker. <br /> <br /> Enter "Police Story". Jackie Chan plays the role of Caro, the policeman whose job is to protect the witness before a major trial. He faces resistance from both the uncooperative witness and the many men who were sent by the mob to silence them. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who cares? We do not watch Jackie Chan's movies for the story. We watch them see Jackie Chan perform spectacular works, and generally beat and kick a large group of people who are less beautiful than they are. <br /> <br /> At this level, the "police story" does not appear to disappoint at all. There is a terrible confrontation in a mall that eventually culminates in a taxi sliding into a giant high-powered chandelier. Seriously, if this kind of thing happens more than ever, you will not need any mention to ever convince to go shopping to buy clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy, many of which include unintentionally annoying Carrie Mayo (Maggie Cheung), his seemingly eternal suffering and apparently tolerant. The humor in its entirety is rather indifferent, but it works so as not to complain. <br /> <br /> The representation is not very accurate, either. In fact, I'm not sure there's anything hidden about the "police story" at all. Jackie Chan (yes, he does that too) has a deep understanding of what we're watching, and knows that while we wait for the next battle to begin, the last thing we want is to look for a little bit of depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So the "police story" is an explosion. As with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the things she sees on the screen puts her head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan is already hanging from a speeding bus next to an umbrella, "Wow!" A completely new factor is added to the action.
