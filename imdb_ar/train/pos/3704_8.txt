In general, it is difficult to evaluate cut and paste movies. Some slides can be very good while others reduce the overall product rating. In this example, for example, the sight of all the girls in the doctor's office was very interesting ... one of the best in the limited (limited) viewing history of this scene. Then there's a slice in Asia ... The lady is always amusing. The story that connects all together was an interesting concept. The swap scene that closes the offering is not bad either. Technically, production values ​​are fairly high. Recommended.
