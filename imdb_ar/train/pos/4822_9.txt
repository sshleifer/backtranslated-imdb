Do you have someone holding your hand whenever you climb or climb the stairs? After others have tasted your food before you eat it? Experiencing excessive mother in pregnancy? These are just a few of the obstacles that young Victoria has to deal with in this film (there are also various power struggles as well as attempts in her life). Needless to say, it makes viewing great and informative. <br /> <br /> I've only seen Emily Blunt before in The Devil Wears Prada (and so on). As they were in this film, they are again the foreground here. I was very impressed by her portrayal of young Victoria, and I thought she dealt with the role very well. She is moving from the small Victoria we meet at the beginning of the film to Queen Victoria, who later became her full believer. Plant plays an ideal role in this role, showing all the different aspects (from the vulnerable, the stronger, from the young Victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who controls). Can not say enough about Emily Blunt in this role. It is - quite simply - wonderful, inviting your attention every second on the screen. It keeps you confused including the last shot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend also proved to be a good representative for Victoria (and the final husband), Prince Albert. Actors have nice chemistry and fully believe in their developing relationships. They have their differences, but you can say they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene they share and keep you interested in what happens between Victoria and Albert. Other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Pittani as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as Duke Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not one bad performance in this film. Less focused people are also well photographed, due to their limited screen time. Even a Victorian dog (King of Knights Charles Spaniel named Dash) is unforgettable and affects the film. <br /> <br /> Although the film tends to skip more than a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially in the end - instead * tells * what happened (with her and Albert) on the screen, what matters more is what we actually see *. This is, after all, a film about "The Young Victoria" (not "The Old-Age Victoria" or "The Old Victoria"). While there are some decorations on history using this film, it still focuses on what it sets out to do - which tells us how the little princess stepped into power. <br /> <br /> The movie looks great and Emily Blunt's costumes are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film, never detracting from it. Filmed exceptionally, unlike many movies these days, this film is a good length, as it does not work for a long time so that lose interest or feel that it is withdrawn unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, what makes this movie great is Emily Blunt. She is in good shape here, she has turned into another excellent performance and raised this film over what might have been, had another representative been represented in this important historical role. It's a unique film, with excellent shows that must definitely be seen. If you have an appreciation for having a wonderful look at a woman who has been very important in history, it is a must.
