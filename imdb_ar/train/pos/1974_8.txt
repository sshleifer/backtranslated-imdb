I think the reason for all the diarrhea seen in this film is that most people have as much as Sharon Stone at the age of 50 and become naked during play excitingly. No one cared when the golden girls sat around eating the cheese pie and discussing the first orgasm, but to see someone after menopause rejoice digitally while driving, I think some can not handle it. Let's face it, it looks good, it's light years older than my mother who is the same age! It is not Oscar or cult classics like the first, but since the beginning of the century, it seems that all filmmakers expect: a cinematic experience will touch your soul. As such, they do not claim to be so. It is a thrilling and exciting story, an extension of a wonderful personality we all like to hate. It's the character of Catherine Tramel who helped make room for this sequel. Fans of the first film want to see more of the ice queen lukewarm. <br /> <br /> The film industry and artistic direction were fertile and expensive, and made me want to move to Britain for sure. The result is also amazing. <br /> <br /> Surely there are some excessive elements from some characters but there are some wonderful works from the unknown David Morrissey. <br /> <br /> There is a setback in that the script is almost the same as the first movie blocking only a psychiatrist instead of a cop. In addition to the criminal decision taken by the MPAA to force the film to lessen than to move away from the ugly guilt known by the story. <br /> <br /> At least, it's fun and fun to look at, and these are the only intentions of the film. So if you've got beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should actually watch the movie and draw your own conclusions before you eliminate the extruded vomit?
