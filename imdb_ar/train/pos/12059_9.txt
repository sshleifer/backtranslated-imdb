I love ghost stories in general, but I particularly like the stories of the British ghosts that resemble the cold-period style. This one qualifies on all counts. A naive young lawyer ("lawyer" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the seashore to settle the property of an elderly woman who died. It is the 1920s, when many middle-class Britons go to the seaside on vacation because of their "health". Well, guess what, there is nothing "healthy" about the village of Crythin Gifford, the creeping site of the huge, Victorian-era women's estate on the fringes of a swamp filled with fog. When a lawyer saves the life of a young girl (no local community will help the endangered community - find out why later in the film), he inadvertently bears the wrath of an evil spirit, the black woman. It's not cheating, ghost, but a solid black silhouette of evil slag. The viewer sees it only a few times, but you feel its malignant presence in every frame. When the camera crawls the lawyer while reading the legal papers, you expect to see the woman in black at any moment. When the lawyer goes to the generator to throw electricity into the old house, the camera leaks into it and thinks it will pop up too. Waiting for the appearance of a black woman is disgusting. We have seen many elements of this story before (the unlocked room, the fog, the na√Øve strangers who ignore the warnings of the locals) but somehow the director is able to combine them all into a whole new and attractive ghost. a story. Watch it with friends so you can get a warm person to grab it while waiting for the woman in black. . .
