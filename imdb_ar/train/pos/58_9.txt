I got to know the end of this movie channel and it's through cable TV channels, and I was very excited about the next show. <br /> <br /> I did not really know what I expected after reading the program summary, but I came from this film and I was very upset and worried. This opportunity also gave me the opportunity to adults who attended high school in the 1980s, a little better idea of ​​what our children should face these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see the fire just adds to the cold of the plot. The vision of both children and adults was both struggling to understand the senseless shootings and sometimes arrive at them. I will admit that I have thrown some tears all the time. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a movie I'm looking for, but I'm sure I'm happy to see it.
