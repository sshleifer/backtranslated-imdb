My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {correction. Cuts. Read} <br /> <br /> I have never seen a director take a lot of excitement because of his style before. It is now clear that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott's astounding and astute editing style. If I have to choose between her love and her hatred, I say that I love her. The border line was sometimes broken, but the end result was very good, and it's good to see a director who has a creative edge to his style and some originality (even if he's borrowing heavily from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic edge in the role of Keira Knightley is reflected in the role of a rewarding hunter by the intriguing Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely fickle. Otherwise, she plays badly because I hated her very much and did not sympathize with her a bit, no matter how big she was. We have been following Domino all her life and joining her fellow reward hunters Mickey Rourke, Radwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew became entangled in the FBI, and suddenly he had a live show contract under the Christopher Walken television production company (What does Christopher Walken do in every film, by the way?). I think this is a smart film technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use the fun MTV / Reality Show footage as he likes. This stage of MTV culture has become at this stage. <br /> <br /> The story, which is listed at astonishingly fast speed, is followed by a lot of violent language and gun violence. There are some funny jokes. Everything is very modern and surreal at the same time. It's chaos, but it's a fairly fun mess. It is ultimately flawed in many ways (actors try hard to make their characters "wonderful", for one person) but they work successfully. I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared with the general consensus of the filmmakers who got the rating of this movie ?? But I feel that they have some good ideas and have done well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
