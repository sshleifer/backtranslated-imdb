A terrorist attempts to steal a highly secret biological weapon and, in the attempt to escape, becomes infected when the case containing the deadly client is at risk. Soldiers can retrieve the case, but the terrorist is on his way to a hotel where he tries to hide. Eventually they arrive at the place where they are hiding, and "cleanse" the hotel and its inhabitants. Unfortunately, they get rid of his body by cremation of the dead, and if you see "the return of the living dead," you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 has been widely criticized by critics and zombies alike as a complete mess of the film. While this is a fair assessment, it is not without points of interest. For one reason, he has a lot of bloody deaths to keep the dogs happy. There is an abundance of zombies that seem to come from everywhere possible. They are in the water, the rafters in the houses, hiding in the trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a handful of dead, to come out to attack as the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head that is hiding inside the refrigerator. You should see it incredible, because this scene alone makes Zombi 3 required to view the IMO. There may be some horrible adjustments and some dubious work, especially from a doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it is good to sit and watch a movie that requires nothing more than your time and an open mind. Zombi 3 fits this law, then some. It would be more fun if you open a few beers, and watch it with some friends like brains. I give it 8/10, just to enjoy.
