One thing is certain ... You should not watch this movie if you are going through a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and a personal trait must live with a sin he can not handle. The story is driped to you instead of the usual interpretation, so it makes you wonder what is going on. In the end the points and displays are logically connected. All the characters were fine and Will Smith had spent another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of ethical questions to ask, but if you accept and accept his passion, it's easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree, this is irrelevant. The trip it takes is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good enough movie will unfortunately make you sad in the end. I recommend this movie if you like the type you should think about and not just watch the bangs and battles.
