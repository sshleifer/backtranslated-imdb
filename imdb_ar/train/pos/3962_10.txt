Fantastic James Stuart, Vera Miles vehicle. What makes this historic film that deals with the FBI well is the family element that takes part in 35 years of work as portrayed by Stuart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film features a history from the major investigative agency. He deals with aircraft bombing plots, killing Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gains, fighting organized crime, and Nazis and communists in this order. The human element never departed as Stewart was married to Vera Miles. They create 3 children with Miles out of the heart every time Stewart leaves on a mission. <br /> <br /> Look for a short but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later, Mr. Robinson appeared in the film "The Graduate" in 1967. <br /> <br /> The film has only praise for Jie. Edgar Hoover. He certainly made the FBI (FBI) equal. <br /> <br /> True, this can be seen as right-wing propaganda, especially with the real Republicans' views of Stuart's life, but it is well-known, informative and historical. The family filmed well.
