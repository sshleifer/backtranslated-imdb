This is one of those films that they have promoted a lot. If you see T.V. , You may not see the movie either. Almost all the funny scenes are pampered in the previews, except for the scenes where Jennifer Anistin is a funny sight. It's a typical Jim Curry humor and it's really funny. Just do not go to see this movie expected to be surprised. All in all, if you love Jim Carrey or comedy movies, this is a must, otherwise you can watch the previews and you will be completely satisfied.
