Higher and Higher was one of Rodgers' and Hart's lowest Broadway shows, with only 84 performances on Broadway in 1940. Yet he made one of his greatest successes "Never Enter My Mind." <br /> <br /> However, except for one minor song, So Disgustingly Rich, the entire Broadway score was canceled when RKO bought the movie rights. Instead, a completely new result was recorded for Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson, most of them to accommodate Francis Albert Sinatra who was first in his long feature film. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who did some vocal work in the previous movies, got a sheet of his rival Bing Crosby's page. When Bing made his first feature film in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra took the role of Frank Sinatra and I can not think of anyone who can do a better job. <br /> <br /> The chairman is in third place behind the stars Jack Haley and Michelle Morgan. It is the servants, a maid Scalieri to Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid him for seven months. The main reason is that he is about to move to Chapter 11 or so, where he informs staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is an exhilarating old spirit working for her and does not want any of the staff to lose anything good. Pool their resources and get Michelle Morgan to impersonate Errol's daughter, who ended up in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to stumble on a rich fortune in the hope of saving the family fortune. Michelle starts just looking at the other. <br /> <br /> It's a simple plot and certainly not worse than a whole set of musicals, but RKO has invested this film with a wonderful group of players. Barbara Hill and Elizabeth Resdon play the role of another Depotante and her mother, who suspects that something is not true. Victor Burg is a fortune seeking no account. Dolly Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcie McGuire, Mile Turme and Mary Weeks. The Errol Family. staff. This was not a bad thing at all. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good songs, all of which achieved some kind of commercial success, The Music Stopping, a beautiful way to spend an evening, and I could not sleep. Last night. The last Oscar movie was nominated for the best song, but lost to Alice Faye, you will never know. <br /> <br /> 1943 was the year of the Union Strike band against the recording industry. To get their own material, Frank Sinatra recorded songs from the high and high with the acapella chorus of Colombia. Bing Crosby recorded songs from Dixie in the same way as Dika. Both were convicted by the union's president, James C. Petrillo as attackers of the strikers did not cross the sit-in again. The strike was not entirely stable until 1944, although Decca was at the forefront of earlier recording companies and settled earlier in Colombia, RCA Victor and others. <br /> <br /> The strike has saved some of Sinatra's worrying moments. He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was called. He closed a place he needed for his art when he was not sure that leaving Dorsey would prove to be an appropriate professional step. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, received higher and higher well, the legend was launched.
