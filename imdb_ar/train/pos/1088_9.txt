Carrie Grant and Mirna Lowe are ideally represented as middle-class couples who wish to build their dream home. All this starts with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which explode due to countless complications and the original budget burst. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of great laughter (even if the story is fairly thin) and you're sure to enjoy star fans or Hollywood style in the late 1940s. The highlight is conspicuously obvious when the contractor goes through a drop in all expenses, which must seem highly overpriced to the 1948 public. When he comes out, he assures the client that he could possibly achieve a $ 100.00 reduction of the total ... or not Less than $ 50.00 ... but definitely $ 25.00. kidding!
