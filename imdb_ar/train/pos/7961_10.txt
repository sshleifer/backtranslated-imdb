"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about pets at home. Deserves a place among the great movies of this kind and even in the world of cinema in general, along with other animal films such as Old Wheeler, Napoleon, Flock and Air Buds. This means that it is more than just a film about pets. <br /> <br /> Could this be just a "remake"? It's very good to be a "remake"! I know this one by heart, since my early teens (when I was 12 years old). <br /> <br /> It's a family movie worth looking for: it's emotional, exciting, adventure, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet , Nostalgic, beautiful, intimate and sometimes thrilling It is one of those films that puts a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> This film is not lacking in qualities. It contains a well thought out story, , Excellent and fun music, and spectacular landscapes / landscapes of the magnificent Sierra Mountains (in Oregon) .When talking about the sights, not all the mountains: Trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunset ... In the end, all the pure wonders of nature - a truly complete panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are nice, well developed and conceived by the actors involved. The affectionate father, Bob Seaver, Kim Gerst is as good as Laura Bernforth, Veronica Laurin as good as hope, Kevin Chovalaya as a traditional little brother, Jimmy (his appearance reminds me so much of Kevin Corcoran at Old Yeller). <br /> <br /> When it comes to our Quartet colleagues, Shadow is my favorite. The Shadow is a wise, mature, beautiful, caring and golden golden savior (brilliantly expressed by Don Ameche). Opportunity, the American Bulldog, is the opposite of the shadow. It's important, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (expressed by talented Michael J. Fox). Only chance can not stand still. Sassy is an example of a cat image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat stand but with the charm of certain cats. Sassy is the cat of Seal Point Himalayan, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. Sassy is expressed by Sally Field, who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four legged friends are themselves wonderful "actors": Ben as Shadow, Rattler, Chance and Tiki like Sassy. <br /> <br /> It's a simple, but classic film in itself. Its sequel is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This must definitely be the best 250.
