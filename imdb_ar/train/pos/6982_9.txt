good offer. <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are a range of moral dilemmas that face them. Humanity has achieved a number of technological advances, but is mankind mature enough to deal with its new games? There is moral deterioration in the virtual world. Religious fanatics are ready to kill to attract attention. I expect (based on BSG background) that there will be a problem with Cylons and Slavery. In addition, there are all the other problems we humans face. <br /> <br /> This presentation is not BSG - at least not as far as the human race is running away from the harsh problem they were ultimately making. There are not a lot of special effects that come from shootings or space effects - at least in the first few episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> She has very good stories, characters, and themes. It also has good performances of actors. They can create a culture similar to that of modern society, but at the same time a foreigner would be completely authentic. Like BSG, this exhibition revolves around humanity - strengths, weaknesses, potentials and flaws. It may seem a little strange that a human society is on a different set of worlds with neckties, antique cars and chickens. But these things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone getting involved in these details is really missing this point. Whether you are from a Mafia-like culture or a rich and high-tech culture, human beings and human nature are no different from the 150,000 years ago in the high-tech past of what we see in today's world. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
