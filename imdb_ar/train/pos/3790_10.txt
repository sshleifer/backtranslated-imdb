I accidentally caught this on an independent film channel and was set up. I am a professional representative and I was amazed at the offers. They felt completely satisfied, without any effect. I could not tell if it had been written or how it was filmed and I waited until the end to see the credits then I spent half an hour in IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the writer-director also made a very good film, Everyday People, which I enjoyed so much. It is a disgrace to filmmaking that excellent projects do not get the distribution and advertising they deserve and live under the radar. This film deserves to be transferred with great pride. I urge people to look for it and watch it.
