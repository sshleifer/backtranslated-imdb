Although this film was released a year before my birth, it is certainly one of my favorite comedy films. She starred Redd Foxx as a father trying to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know anything about what it means to be gay and have all these stereotypical perceptions of what homosexual people look like. His son Norman grew up now and lived alone. When his father, Ben, discovers that his son is abnormal, he visits his son in the hope of changing him. The title comes from one of the films in the film - when Ben arrives at Norman's apartment he runs in a whore and thinks his son is in a trance ("Norman ... is this?") The film made me laugh from start to finish. Red Fox is great. Although much of the content is typical, I have not found anything offensive about how the material has been handled, but it has good ends. Highly recommended.
