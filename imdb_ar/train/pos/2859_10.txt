I know this sounds strange from someone born about 15 years after the show stopped, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I enjoy watching it. I love Adam better. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I found to buy chapters on a DVD was in Germany, and it was only in the first two seasons. This is disappointing, but this is good. I will continue to search the Internet. If anyone has any advice on where to buy the 2nd to 14th seasons, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first one. The only downside is that DVDs from Germany, they only work on the portable DVD player and computer. Oh, okay. I still own it!
