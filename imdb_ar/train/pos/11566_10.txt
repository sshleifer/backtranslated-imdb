Youth revolution in a short subject. <br /> <br /> A teenager, embarrassed by his fear of dogs, escapes from the house. The abandoned Spanish he finds helps to change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a fun little movie, with Shirley Temple stealing all of its scenes as a vital hero's sister. The opening gag - dealing with urination - is in a weak taste, but is quickly forgotten. Highlight: Climatic artistic forms, which look remarkably realistic. <br /> <br /> The short themes that have been ignored or neglected today are often important for studios as a training ground for new or thriving talent, both front and back. The dynamics of creating a successful short theme were quite different from the dynamics of a feature film, which is like writing a short story rather than a novel. The short subjects were produced economically in terms of both budget and schedule and were able to depict a wide range of materials, perfect complement to studio films.
