I have watched almost all Cynthia Rothkir films, and this is the most entertaining for me. It reminds me of the early Jackie Chan movies. Admittedly, Ms. Rotherock may not be the greatest actress, but very good at seeing her as a martial artist and a very nice young man. This film, although perhaps not the best in all its films, was the most enjoyable.
