It seems that some of the films were made before we were ready for them. When I watched this movie, which was produced in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching the OJ movie Simpson Disaster (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of individuals in each case). <br /> <br /> If this movie is believed, it has been devoured by murder and a possible fact. I left as a subsequent idea. It was frightening to see the scenes of hordes of invasive media, and ridiculous accounts of facts, lies and discussions about the supposed merits of the case by people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> The media is portrayed as indifferent and incomprehensible to technical information in the case. I hope there will be more religious bias in the case (the defendants are Seventh-Day Adventists). <br /> <br /> These circles are now common but this makes the lesson more important. <br /> <br /> Streep is excellent as usual and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. Australian accents become a bit thick at times but incomprehensible.
