Dick, who is not married to 20 things (played by John Travolta), leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in Tonk Tonki. In nominal value, it's a modern love story ... Texas style. There are openings of cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs, and signs to big belt buckles and horseback riding. Music, if not native of Texas, is derived from Texas, thanks to the talents of Micky Jelly, Johnny Lee, and Charlie Daniels Band. And that's the story of Texas ... "y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and characters revolve around the lightness of the hot pepper taste of Texas, equipped with five alarms made of halabino pepper. It is enough to make civilized viewers abort the film for a beautiful classic film, one starring Lawrence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman, perhaps. "Hamlet" is not. But Urban Cowboy is hot and frank, and I admire it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is generally good. Dialogue, production design and fashion are all realistic; editing is skillful. Both acting and acting are commendable, if not Oscar worthy. I did not play Travolta in the role he plays, but he did a good job ... as Debra Wenger did. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, are very good at supporting roles. But, cinema seemed weak. The copy of the film I saw was gracious, and sometimes it suffered from a red / orange tinge, a visual feature I observed in other films of the same time period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the film does not appear to present any social or political "message". But I claim that when Urban Cowboy was released 25 years ago, it had somewhat prophetic effects. In 1980, the United States faced all kinds of problems, not least American hostages held by Iran. In the minds of many people at the time, the United States was being intimidated. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others in its time, presented something the Americans wanted to see in their political leaders. Hardness. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical film. The characters may not be the brightest people on Earth. But, it's tough! <br /> <br /> Everything about Urban Cowboy is reactive. As a tool for cultural expression at the time, this 1980 film was one of several films that reinforced a difficult new era for the United States. It began in 1980 with the election of Reagan. That era continues to this day, with a president who may not be remembered for his intelligence, but who will remember him for his strength and aggression, traits that Americans seem to be attracted to, such as Texas, to chilling chili.
