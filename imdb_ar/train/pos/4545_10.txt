I've seen this movie recently. Two hours later, my head is still full of laughter. The plot was very bad, and the jokes were very bad, but what I did not count on was: <br /> <br /> 1. The scenes before and after the film by Pat and Jay (who caused more than a laugh) > 2. kick the windshield that broke the bad guys' head. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and even my version came with a speaker saying if you do not like the movie, send the certificate to HBO. While I was thinking about it, it was the date you had to send it in January 1991 (which also caused the unease).
