I feel that Monarch Cove was one of the best dramas written and represented in any network in a long time. This offer had great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This can be developed in a big primetime soap. People are looking forward to this kind of behavior because we are "reality television" an exaggeration. I crave the type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Knockdown, The Rumble, Melrose Bliss, etc. Monarch Cove updated this concept well and expected it to improve only. There is a lot to expand with these characters and they were all very interesting and interesting in themselves. The loss of not exploring this and developing these characters will be after we have withdrawn and linked them to their world. I loved this show completely because it was obscure, interesting and memorable without going abroad or insulting me. loved it.
