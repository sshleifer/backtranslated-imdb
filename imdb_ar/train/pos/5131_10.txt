Jammin 'the Blues is a short film nominated for the Oscars since 1944, which is about 10 minutes of improvised jazz playing in one long jam. Mary Bryant sings "Sunny side of the street" at some point to highlight the film and then shakes the bat with Archie Savage to end the most fun "jam session" to its exciting end. Director Guinness Millie was a photographer and this experience is shown in some of the double-screen footage of some musicians, making it one of the most creative corners of the 1940s. According to some observations, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be photographed in a silhouette reflecting the social attitudes of the time. what a shame. Still, this is the most unusual movie available on YouTube, so if you like jazz, I suggest you look for it there.
