Wonderful! <br /> <br /> This film is the best living testimony, I believe, about what happened in New York City on 9-11-01, compared to anything that the mainstream media shows. <br /> <br /> Those outlets can show you only what happened overseas. This film shows you what happened inside. <br /> <br /> The focus is on a rising firefighter in New York, waiting weeks for the weeks of the first major fire to be called for fighting. The subject suddenly turns to the picture that exists only for the first plan to hit the towers. Then you are given a seat in the front row as the firefighters rush to the scene, in the lobby of the first tower. <br /> <br /> In the minutes before the crash of the second plane, and the fall of the second tower, firefighters are interacting with the annoying sound of people landing over the lobby. It's a sight we will never forget. <br /> <br /> The heart, the tear-jerking, very attractive from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever produced. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
