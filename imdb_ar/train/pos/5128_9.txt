First, let me say that I am not from the South but I am an American. I do not like country music but I can accept it. I will never wear a cowboy hat, but I wear hats. I do not live in a trailer but I eat tuna salad and own a house. What does this comment have to do with it? Much if you are one of those people who just say that people "country" like this movie. This film is based on the premise of "love and lose". James Bridges directs a true American love story as it is. In the era of Jerry Springer and the mentality of "Let's put it there," this film symbolizes reality more than ever before. <br /> <br /> Bud is the "Age of Mature" and begins his own life with the help of a few of his aunt and uncle to move to the big city with them. Buds finds himself attracted to the local Honky Tonki world for the only escape that a blue-collar man can carry. Sisi meets quickly from a similar background and the two face a romantic storm filled with painful shortfalls and falls. <br /> <br /> * This plot takes a lot of turns so that one has to sit for only a few minutes before it intertwines.Recognition is the focus here that is often absent.In early film they get married and see the transition from being single to The film highlights some of the modern struggles women face when they marry an old man, as the male ego emerges with women and competition. <br /> <br /> Buds is a challenge and excited when he puts Mickey in the e-bull. Sisi gets ideas about enjoying her too, but she is quickly reminded that she is married and needs to start acting like her. The emotion between the two people is unclear and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when it is divided (note that this is given some of STORYLINE AWAY) and Sisi falls into a previous deception with a tendency to abuse and cruelty. I soon realized that the grass was not always greener on the other side. <br /> <br /> How can anyone compare the shoots with Vignini Barberino to me. John Travolta has performed exceptionally well. He was honest and true. The scene in which he shaves his beard and sees him first in the bar ... still gives me a cry of terror. Keep in mind that I'm not a huge Travolta fan, but come on, I see why Cisse was kicking her shoes early in the film. Deb Winger was so genuine that you found yourself sympathetic to her as she spoke of feelings toward Bud, after sneaking in to clean his house during its disintegration. <br /> <br /> The cast was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn played a first-class performance that made you hate him and curse him as he insulted Cisse. Madeline Smith-Osborne, like a buddy's girlfriend / mistress, was so authentic that big girls all over the United States were praying until they could sit on the chest to wear the clothes they wore in the film. The greatest celebrity is sent to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as uncle and uncle. They looked like their aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas, and despite their small role, they made the film much bigger and more vibrant. One of the unforgettable scenes was the Dolly Barton contest and the unforgettable scene where Broum and his uncle stand outside after the death of a character. The dialogue between them is touching. <br /> <br /> If you can see this in reality, it is a true American love story. Then I advise you to take what it is ... a movie before the time comes that gave us the joy of a world different from ours but real enough to enjoy our entertainment. If this world looks similar to your world, you will enjoy it a lot. Finally, music, no matter how dated, is sure to bring you back in time if you are over 30 years of age.
