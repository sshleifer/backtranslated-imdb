Dr. Winston Dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a swimming pool. He discovers that his wife is walking around with the pool host - he realizes that behind everything is clean, there is decay. Begins to torture his patients. ... Corbin Pearson is wonderful, since the dentist is dysfunctional, he is quite reasonable. There is little surprise but the scenes of tooth torture are very bad and strange. "Dentist 2" is highly recommended.
