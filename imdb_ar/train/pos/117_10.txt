Europa Lars von Terris is an echo deserved by the third man, about an American coming to Europe after World War II and finding himself involved in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays the role of Leopold Kessler, the German-American who refused to join the US military during the war, to Frankfurt once the war ended to work with his uncle as a sleeping car driver on the Zentropa railway. What he does not know is that the war is still going on in secret with a secret terrorist group called "Wolves" targeting American allies. Oppold strongly opposes taking any side, but is enticed and enticed by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukawa), the glamorous daughter of the owner of the railway company. Her father was sympathetic to Nazism, but was pardoned by US Col. Harris (Eddie Considine) because he could help run the German transport system and run it again. Colonel Leopold quickly mobilized or forced him to be a spy (without giving him a choice or a chance to think about it) to see if wolves were likely to carry out attacks on trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold is stuck in an adventure by getting involved with the parties to the conflict in a mysterious way and noir-ish, where everyone and everything is not as it seems. It's amazing to see Leopold's naive deal with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, the annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even railway officials who come to study his work ethics) before he finally boils and acts violently and loudly. control. The film can not be predicted indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed elegantly, and it always happens at night during winter with lots of snow falling. Shot in black and white with clips of color showing randomly around. Also, background screens display images that conflict with images in the foreground. Add Max von Siddo's hypnotic novel, Europe has become a dream-like place outside this world. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie now.
