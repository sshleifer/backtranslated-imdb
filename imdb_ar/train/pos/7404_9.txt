I just watched the first Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - an ideal, moving, moving, fun, dramatic and meaningful joy. Can not accept more. I only hope that the rest of the festival's films will reach this level of entertainment and I look forward to seeing more Chinese films to be shown in Sydney in the coming months.
