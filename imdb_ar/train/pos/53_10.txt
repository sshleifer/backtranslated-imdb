The room of the house really surprised me. Compared to other films written about Columbine High School, this film is the best. The room of the house does not show the shooting of the school, but the effects of the community and the city and its effects. The film focuses on two opposite characters, Alicia (busy Phillips) and Diana (Erika Christensen). Alicia outcast saw the whole shooting. They seem to show no emotion about it. Diana is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital for graduation. At the same time the police check with Alicia because they might have learned that the shooting would happen. Alecia and Deanna are completely different and do not meet at first. Eventually they develop mutual understanding for each other and become friends. (Very much in the breakfast club style). Home Room beautifully shows the power of rapprochement and turmoil after school shooting. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
