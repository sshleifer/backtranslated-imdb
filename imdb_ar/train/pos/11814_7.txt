Usually, when we use the word "survive," we mean it negatively; the large screen version of Dick Turnsey by Warren Beatty shows that the fugitive can be good. This is really one amusing movie. As a character with yellow names covered in fear, my house creates an investigator we can all deal with: ready to work, but not without its weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world unto themselves. Tess Truhart (Glenn Headley) is as glamorous as one would expect to be the miserable fighter of any crime; Breath Mahoney (Madonna) is the most perplexed person imaginable; Bigboy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include Mumbles, who defies words (Dustin Hoffman), the 88 key keys (Mandy Patinkin), and Lucky (Charlie Cursmo). Charles Durring, James Kan, Dick Van Dyck, Estelle Parsons, Katharine O'Hara, Seymour Cassell, Paul Sorfino and Cathy Bates starring. <br /> <br /> Oh wait a moment. I have not even explained the plot! Tracy's plot involves trying - and failing so far - to find a way to catch Big Boy. At the same time, some strange events occur in the city, answers that may or may not be closer than everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing in this film is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Betty had a problem with his age, he used it well here. "Dick Tracy" is a wonderful movie.
