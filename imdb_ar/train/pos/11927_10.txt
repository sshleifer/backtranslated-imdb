I would say though that it was a review of Angels in the Outfield movie very well. I love the fact that he teaches children to be always faithful and never give up because miracles can happen. Unlike other baseball movies, this particular film has been featured because of its spectacular special effects and well-directed soundtrack that was very enjoyable. Although I liked this movie, it had some drawbacks such as incompatibility (ie towards the end when Ray Mitchell hits Homer, does not step on the board and therefore will not be a result. I must say that I really admire the existence of this film and its ethics: only faith, do not give up.
