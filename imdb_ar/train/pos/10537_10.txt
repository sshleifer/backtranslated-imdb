This movie was very funny, I could not stop smiling when watching this movie, and I have already seen it twice in two days! The film is unique in humor and images, both gorgeous and on par with other gems in the movie Natalie Cube and Cypher. I have become a great admirer of Vincenzo Natale since I saw Seifer and everything he did was very exciting. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the music and the two "lost" characters Dave and Andrew, portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), are very fond of actors. Also awesome are X-Box Dead Or Alive battles (until you see Dave playing Halo at some point) and Andrew Andrew's solo guitar, among many other things. <br /> <br /> All in every wonderful and fun movie about friendship. You have to see this!
