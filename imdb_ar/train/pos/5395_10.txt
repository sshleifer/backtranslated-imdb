I remember watching this movie, thinking was interesting. I really wanted to know what would happen next. I was amazed at how much it could fit in with 8 short minutes. We start in the school yard. . Two friends discuss skipping class. Child B tells child A "Let's go to class today." Kid's dropped, claiming she might miss something really important. Therefore, child B passes and child A goes to the classroom. When he gets there, the teacher teaches that today they will learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They would learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a booklet, and when she reaches a child, she runs out and asks the next boy to share it. Well, the child will not participate, so the child looks "A" for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation about the true meaning of life. I suggest that everyone watch this briefly. It will only take 8 minutes of your life, but the message is very important, it may help you in life for life.
