A novel by Robert A. Henlin, a classic novelist, Starship Troopers, in recent years, in everything for Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a television series, to a number of games. But none of this, so to speak, really captured the spirit of his novel. Games are usually unconnected, and the TV series was more aberration, to say the least about Verhoeven was better. However, many do not know that in Japan, a moving adjustment was already made, released in the year of Henlin's death. Believe it or not, despite the differences, this 6-part animated series is the wisest, most faithful adaptation of the classic Heinlein. <br /> <br /> The most obvious addition to this series is the presence of armored power structures, something we have denied in Verhoeven. Like the book, the series focuses more on characters and their relationships than on motion and space travel, although we see quite a bit of each. While events are different from what happens in the book, the book's plot exists. Ricoh and Carmen have a romantic affair, but they have been touched a bit more than they did in the book. While some may think that dialogue and personal interaction are inferior to the book (gets a bit of anime therapy, but what do you expect?), But it is much better than the film. Political views of Henlin are excluded, unlike the film, where it is reversed. However, the big gain of this series is the climactic battle on Klendathu between soldiers and bugs / aliens, which is characterized by a kind of action of powered armored suits that we would like to see in a movie version. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Henlin's vision. I think they did a good job with this. If you can find the string, give it a look.
