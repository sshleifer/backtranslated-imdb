Along with Duck Darkwing this was canceled unfairly. Disney has slipped since Tarzan and we need to show like this to bring Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were idealists for Lewis and Palo's sounds (look familiar?). Among all the bad guys, all of them with their own merits, Tony Jay is featured as Sher Khan. Lewis and Blau really look very similar to the vocal controls in the jungle book, and that's not bad at all. In fact, it's very inspiring! The animation was shown immediately, and the text contained a lot of intelligence that was so lacking in animation for years. Please bring this offer back! 10/09. Bethany Cox
