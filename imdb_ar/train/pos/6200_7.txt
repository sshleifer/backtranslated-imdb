Henry Bean is the best film. But this is the perfect way to follow a movie like Henry Bean. Let's take Henry seriously, "his lies" and his mysterious halo. Even the opening shot of "Henry Bean" when Simon put his ear to the ground when Henry comes walking up the hill appears more clearly through "Faye Grimm". The most important jokes, which are a dead joke more or less (about writing the film and jokes themselves) are good, but the opening of the film is a bit saturated. Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is annoying, yes, it's intent, but he feels forced and over-used, and goes beyond what is annoying, and what I would call it, annoying. It's a flawless movie, but it's a must see for anyone who loves Hartley or Henry Bean. <br /> <br /> Do not listen to stupid comments, you only see this if you watch the first movie. The plot, irony and intelligence of this film are completely lost if you have not seen Henry Bean. It's the sequel. This is just stupid.
