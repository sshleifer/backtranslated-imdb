I was lucky enough to take this film while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies, especially William Castle's tricks, so this was definitely necessary for me. <br /> <br /> This is about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was a director of disdain. True, some cheap horror movies have made a budget, but he added something to these films: real tricks for the live theater that you no longer see. For example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack in his movies and put shakers in the bottoms of the chairs in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> This is a well-established documentary that comes with this shaded exit in the light, and celebrates his contributions to the horror cinema. The film also depicts the castle as the largest character of life, which was very loved and smiled on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most documentaries that often show testimonials from film historians, SPINE TINGLER! The interviews often feature family members and directors who have been influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. Must see for lovers of classic horror and science fiction.
