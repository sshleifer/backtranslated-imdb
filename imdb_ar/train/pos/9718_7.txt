The potential spoiler - somehow "how to isolate friends ...." is "the loser learns to adapt, becomes successful and discovers that there is something more important" than the story, which falls into the works of celebrities. - End spoiler <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy provides several good moments. Although I think the end is flawed. I felt very fast and sudden, as if there was something missing. Plus I say that the film is unable to maintain a high standard. Apart from this, you will find a selection of actresses and actresses who sometimes enjoy controversial acting qualities. So far Pegg has not seen anything else. It is still a unique type although sometimes it may seem more boring than necessary. Fox proved that she was able to play a hot rooster with her head in the clouds. She did not know if it was difficult, but her performance was warm and better off through the "Transformers" (well ... maybe that was not a tough match). Kirsten Dunst is Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may wish (as I do) or find it disturbing. On the other hand, you'll see Anderson who has demonstrated her acting skills and Jeff Bridges (which is fine but maybe could have been a bit more powerful). They all fit their characters well enough. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a nice comedy with some other clips that contain more funny clips, a wonderful band but a very sudden end.
