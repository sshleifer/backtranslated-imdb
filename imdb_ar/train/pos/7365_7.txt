I found this very moving because Spike and Heaton are staying together throughout this film to say that there are not a few betrayals along the way. I thought the chase was set aside, the relationship between the two was in the foreground. I have already guessed that there are very abnormal intentions on the part of Heaton. My favorite scene should have been the place where Heaton and Spike hung in the marshes, while Spike was running in general, I think Spike is gone. I must say that if it was not for the film studies teacher who made us watch this, I may never have seen him. Overall, I thought this film was very good and would recommend it to anyone who liked British-made movies.
