We have great expectations with this one. . . Because its Zombi 3 is the official sequel to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . However . . . Written by Bruno Matte (Night of the Zombies), not written by Dardino Sachetti but written by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and shot in the Phillimines such as Night of Zombies and much like the Night of Zombies (Hell of the Living Dead). As a result, it is like the hell of the living dead of zombie 2. Fabrazio de Angelis, who produced zombie 2 and editor-in-chief Tomasi (?) And efx gianetto de Rossi gave zombie 2 its charm. . . Zombie 3 is not magical. . . It's like peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years, I have grown to accept zombie 3. I managed to swear that I saw a copy where a soldier was killed on his arm and went to the hotel room. . . There was a senseless Fulci cut and Mattei / Fulci-cut is the one on the DVD.
