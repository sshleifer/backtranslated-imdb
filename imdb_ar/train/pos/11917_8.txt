Yes, the original version of the film is simple but inspiring. The end when the entire crowd wakes up in the stadium and raises people's hands, gives me the cold when I see him. This is just great. Joseph is wonderful as the only sad child who has been disappointed so far by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels funny and exhilarating. A very beautiful family film - and I give it up - with a rather happy ending. But hey, it does not really matter, the film retains its basic quality through good behaviors and inspirational themes.
