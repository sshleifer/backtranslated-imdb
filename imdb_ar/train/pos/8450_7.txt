It was not really bad for Raw's first PPV from 006. But the end was really awesome for all the attendees who were watching at home. <br /> <br /> The first match - RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA For WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP is not a bad opening game, these two teams can play a great game seriously if they have more time to put on a wrestling match. The taste of the DQ wins after being criticized by Edge with the MITB bag. 3/10 Match 2 - TRISH STRATUS VS. Micky James of the WWE WOMEN Women's Championship It's not a bad thing to notice that this is the first time these singers have been in the ring together. Micky goes for the Chick Kick modifier, but Trish ducks her nails and Chick Kick to win to keep her title. 3/10 Match 3 - TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW Seriously good this game was, really. The entire game focuses HHH on the Big Show injured arm but Big Show is still battling. Later HHH is able to drop Big Show & nails a Pedigree to win. 5/10 Fourth game - Shelton Benjamin w / Mama vs. VISCERA was not a bad game, it was fine. After the fall of Viscera, behind the referee, Mama got Benjamin's wallet (which was by brick) and criticized the Viscera on his head three times. Viscera just woke up to manipulate Benjamin's heel kick for her win over the big guy. 4/10 <br /> <br /> The fifth game - Jerry "King" against lawyer GREGORY HELMS boring, slow and dirty. Both men did not make a really good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after falling fist to win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> The sixth match - Torrey Wilson against. Victoria vs. Ashley vs. MARIA VS. MICHELLE CANDICE MATHELLE In her first ever match with women, it was very fun for me. Ashley (I think) removes Candice's last participation to win the first women's game ever. The seventh game - John Cena against. Chris Masters Carlito r. Shawn Michaels vs. Ken vs. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI In a competition for the WWE elimination room was a great match in the exclusion room. But nothing will top the justice room last year that was the best. The last three are Masters, Sina and Carlito. Carlito runs his back on the master and gets a roll to get rid of him. Seconds later, Cena got Carlito to get three numbers to win the exclusion room and retain the WWE title. But his night is not over yet. 7/10 After the game, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Cena on his win. Vince McMahon says his night is not yet over and says Edge is earning his money in an opportunity to challenge Cena for the title. Edge comes with Lita and offers a bag to Vince & heads in the ring because Cena has another match to go here tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA for the WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena, which was set up during the Champions League match] gets immediately by Edge, Edge and Spears on Cena, and goes to get the cover and hit it Cena. Edge is heading to another "shaft and cover" for three shocking numbers, beating Sena and winning the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's revolution was better than this year's revolution, but it was fine. The European Union game was also good, and the hard Edge advantage in MITB's opportunity was the most shocking in the PPV presentation. <br /> <br /> In general: I'll give you 7/10 & C
