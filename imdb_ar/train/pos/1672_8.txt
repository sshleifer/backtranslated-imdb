The scorpion tail case is a very elegant Giallo directed by Sergio Martino, who appears to be the master Giallo second only to Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this wonderful, uncomplicated rider, but in the end he is the mystery of murder and very satisfying. It also makes sense in the end, a great addition, because this is not always the case for these giallo, because they tend to expand their credibility with the Infinite Red Knockers and final solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The wonderful brands of giallo found here are beautiful cinematography, attractive music, wonderful women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murder, black glove killers and explicit sex scenes to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most parts, he has behaved well, and Goerge Hilton is usually gentle and others work fairly well. Martino runs a certain hand, keeping things tight and airy with some wonderful pieces, <br /> <br /> If you're a giallo fan, that's a must. If you like well written excitement and excitement in general, this is highly recommended.
