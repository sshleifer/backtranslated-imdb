This film scares me crap! I must admit that I spent most of the film while watching my fingers but what I saw was really scary. I screamed loudly two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> Making the film among my favorite aspects is audio and photography. The sound was especially impressive and the setting was really great. I read somewhere that it was the strange husband and wife who made it. For some reason this makes strange for me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the raging jumps of movies that are more terrifying than those that suit you! Disgusting and wonderful movie to hire it with a group of friends who love watching movies as they walk around the sofa screaming like little girls!
