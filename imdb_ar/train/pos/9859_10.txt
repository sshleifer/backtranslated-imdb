Ice Age is not only the animation of the year (in my eyes); it is also the best cartoon feature I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Excited excitement last year I spent several happy hours a website. Great Scrat! As well as the rest of Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Your heart really goes to the characters in this film. They have good lines of dialogue and sophisticated. It's hard to identify anyone who really steals the picture. <br /> <br /> You met their journey with laughter, tears and surprise. Nothing was forced or ended. The passion was real, especially in the second half drama. The last film that deeply influenced me was Anastasia's 1997 film, which is also a Fox production. Before that, The Land Before Time 1988. Everyone had real charm and sought to entertain the whole audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
