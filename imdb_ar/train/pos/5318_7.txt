Ida Lubino was one of the few women who invented Hollywood's direct glass ceiling under the studio system. It is not surprising that I dealt with feminist feminist topics, when they were touched at all, and were treated so carefully that it was very rare to talk about. In Outrage, dealing with rape and its consequences, although referred to throughout the short film as a "criminal attack," she leaves, for once, no doubt about what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in her first official debut) plays Amin Amin at a large industrial factory; lives with her parents but works with a swollen man (Robert Clarke), who just got an increase and now gets $ 90 a week . When I left the factory after working late one night, I found herself stumbling. In the scene that followed? The best in the film ?? Trying to escape from chasing her in a maze of forbidden buildings and alleys but fail. <br /> <br /> When she returns to the house, raging and shocked, the police can not get her much; she claims she never saw her attacker (who ran a light truck outside the factory). In an attempt to pretend that nothing has happened, she returns to her job but collapses, believing that everyone is staring at her and ruling her. I went to Fugue State, where I ran to Los Angeles on a bus but stumbled into a rest stop. <br /> <br /> I woke up at a strange farm house, and learned that Todd Andrews, the young minister in an agricultural town in California, had been rescued. She lies around her identity and takes the job of packing oranges. The two are in mysterious love, but Andrews is clearly that the powers keep the secrets terrible. When, in a company outing, she took over the wrench and broke the skull of Jerry Paris, who was trying to steal a kiss, showing the truth of her past .... <br /> <br /> The courage of the film was to be released in 1950, Lack thereof. Lubino never returns to the scene of the early assault scene, and the film travels in the emotional and emotional arena and ends with speech and education. Yes, Lubino had important information to convey, but she did not trust the narrative that speaks for itself. The help of her team was not beautiful and wonderful but gentle and a great year, whether to return to melodramatic positions or home reassurance. But "anger" was a major breakthrough, as the speech ignited the subsequent discourse about what rape was and what it really meant to its victims.
