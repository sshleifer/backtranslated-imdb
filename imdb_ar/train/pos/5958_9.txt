Unlike some comments, my comments are positive. This film wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends, some of them love them, others do not like them. A few are linked - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not a smooth one, happy with everyone and everything, and the type of life - much like real life. Some lines of the story do not develop, they only happen. But like real families and close friends, they stick together. Parents who want to buy a baby are such holes! You are happy for the end. Poor Delmar is caught between rock and rock taking care of herself, her mother and son, and trying to keep their lives together. This does not end with watching the sunset or home in the 'burbs' and they all live in a dream world, but it represents a very realistic picture of people living daily, from month to month. In general, this is a good story and a wonderful movie !!
