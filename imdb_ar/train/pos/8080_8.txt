Well, after a while I used to read comments about these films that did not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better evil than some of his most famous films. It was a riotous tomorrow, and tomorrow without apology. To me, it was a refreshing breath to see him in a role that his wickedness did not undermine in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the boy who played Ariane on his head with this actor. There I think maybe it was possible for the director to be better. But, frankly, the best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. She is an unknown heroine, a real veteran friend and has been qualified for every role offered to him. But I have to say I appreciate her contribution a lot because she played the role of wife of Ferdinand Sahi. They may be given little to do, but they do everything with complete conviction. I'm sure it sailed over the heads of most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So, if you're used to stability in the Bollywood medium, you will not get much of that movie. But if you're constantly looking for something else, this may give you some of what you've lost.
