If you come to the movie with expectations, throw it away, because there will be no amount of noise justice brings to the film. <br /> <br /> Categorizing this movie into one genre would be criminal. It's a spy film, with elements from Noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk all connected to wonderful novels, painful distortions of the mind, and great cinematic photography. <br /> <br /> Much of the comments here are centered around being derived, in good and bad ways, for other films. But as they say, every story has stories from Shakespeare, so once you can get over it, you're in hell. <br /> <br /> You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points, and although the group is never credible, there are parts (read: elevator) that suffer from a low budget and visuals to a certain extent. Do not misunderstand it in the sense that it is on the same level as the original Sci-Fi channel, because this is at a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for action, you should run away. This is pure psychology. But if you're ready to sit down and devote 90 minutes of your life to a new cinematic experience, now! Watch this movie now before it gets great!
