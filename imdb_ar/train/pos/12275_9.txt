I have never heard of the book, and I do not care to read it, but I will probably see the film several times. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable with the richest pictures I have ever seen in a movie. It was as if I were looking at the paintings several times and I think they were the idea. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie, story, actors, and cinematic. Filled with deep emotions from every corner. Although I am not particularly fond of romantic films, I liked this and was very touched by Winona Ryder's call to her father in the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Iron deserved an award for his performance and was not a better close. <br /> <br />
