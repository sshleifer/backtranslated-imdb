In the old commercial ad for blank audio tapes, the line was "Is it real or is Memorex?" The same can be said for the events in this episode - a set and remake of The Cage, Star Trek's first pilot. Mr. Spock had cleverly seized the ship to be transferred to the forbidden planet Talus IV to allow Captain Christopher Pike, his first burned-out captain, to return. Why the diphtheria? Because you have no contact at all with Talos IV calling for the death penalty. Why is this never explained - which bothered me so much - but, if there is nothing else, he adds to the story. After he got the ship to travel to Talos IV, Mr. Spock handed himself over to Dr. McCoy (the older officer was present; Captain Kirk was out of the ship) to catch him and say, "The charge is rebellion, D. I have not received orders to control the ship." The following is a military trial where - thanks to Talosians - we learn why it was extremely important (along with the apparent paralysis) of Captain Pike to reach Talos IV even at the risk of Mr. Spock's death. The delusions created by Talosians, the background music and the whole story are fascinating. Mile Willie as a guard (Talousian head) is wonderful. I was sexually biased, but I never had a woman in this role but she was perfect! Physicists, having abandoned almost all physical activity and have become almost entirely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex. You can not tell if they are male or female, and that does not really matter. This episode, more than any other episode in this series, makes me hope and call out that there are other worlds out there and that there are sophisticated civilizations yet! What a neat thing if so! This is one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I've seen them (I even own them on video), they never surprise me. Meg Wyllie looks like an alien and I do not mean that strange.
