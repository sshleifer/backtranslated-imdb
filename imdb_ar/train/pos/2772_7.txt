I have always believed that David and Bathsheba were a film originally directed to Tyrone Power in the 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Beck gives a good description of himself as King David, the king with a wandering eye. <br /> <br /> A whole host of Biblical themes are covered in this film, adultery, salvation, sin, punishment, and generally what God expects of His followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, you even predicted a king in the gospel. Kingdom You surely have a lot of privileges not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including one truly evil in Jane Meadows who was the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But his eyes are gazing gracefully in her garden one night. It turns out that she is married to Uriya Hathi as David to her husband of women. Uriah is one of the leaders of David's army. David is sent to Bathsheba and because he is the king, she comes to Ronen because she was watching her too. <br /> <br /> What happens, an affair, pregnancy, and carefully arranged death for Uria in a battle. But God in His vision and knowledge has taken possession of all this and not only punish David and Bathsheba, but the entire Kingdom of Israel is punished with drought, disease and epidemics. <br /> <br /> The Sex Discrimination Act today strongly calls for the death of stoning. David shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he climbs up to the painting and asks to put everything on him. He even puts his hand on the Ark of the Covenant which was instantly dead as seen in the film. <br /> <br /> My explanation for this is that God admires courage even if I am wrong and leaves David and forgives them both. Batchba Solomon's mother, David, became the ancestors of many caliphs in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they invaded. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the laundry of Patchiba in a lovable marriage with Uriah played by Kiron Moore. The only thing that makes Moore angry is a good fight. I liked the performance of Kieron Moore as a brave and stupid fool. <br /> <br /> No one can put the law like Raymond Massey. Nathan's prophet is in line with the character of John Brown, who played in two films, with the same intensity. <br /> <br /> So when he called his law to die, why did God not spare Bathsheba and keep David on the throne. Perhaps that is the fact that he does not want to train a third person on the job. Saul was replaced by David. <br /> <br /> But I believe that the Christian explanation may be that this was a hint of the New Testament, that one would sin and receive mercy if we were asked to repent. I will leave it to biblical scholars to provide explanations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you come up with a completely new theory.
