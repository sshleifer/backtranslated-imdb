Before you read this review, I must point out that it is by no means a statement against the Iranian people ... If you really want to read something in it, as we hope to see, I am against politicians in general ... but if you Looking forward to offending ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> I'm not in Iran where this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). It's a disgrace, because the film is wonderful. This film will not be dedicated to "Grbavica", it would have won the film at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> He was right in that (he was the runner-up, or second place if you will). why? Because it is a film about persecution. Not even that is a complete women's issue. It's about the government trying to keep people down. The analogy is so obvious that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by blocking it, nothing will be resolved and / or they can make this movie disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a great summary line: "Comedy about a Tragedy", which sums it up well!
