An excellent film and a great example of how terrifying a movie is without showing scenes of anything. It is a collection of four stories about tenants of an old-fashioned house and their horrific and horrific destinies, all connected by a story about a Scottish inspector looking for a missing horror star. It begins with a story about a mysterious writer whose main character is somewhat realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic foes who have become obsessed with a waxy figure in the museum, and then a story about a cute little angelic boy who concludes with the story of what happened to the missing movie star and what he does Of the inspector. It's a great print that really lets you appreciate the work of director David and what he could do with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Danholm Elliott, Gus Akeland, Ingrid Pitt and John Bertoy, and you'll get a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just do not answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate contacted you to offer you a deal on a beautiful home in the English countryside?
