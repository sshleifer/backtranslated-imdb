Moonwalker is a wonderful movie, from start to finish you can not close your eyes to it. I love all Michael's singing and dancing clips, I just love the "Studio Tour" ... very funny :) The "mini movie" is to cool down, with all its own foreign currency etc ... Michael is a genius and always will be !!!
