I enjoyed this film, and after watching it, I was wondering how many Katlin Rose were in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this kind of sexual abuse, the torment of their classmates, and their fear of opening their mouths? What is the extent of the threat of teenagers and their cruelty to each other, because as this film illustrates, it is not important in the first place, who is popular, afraid to manipulate the minds of young people, and affects them to allow this kind of debauchery Tiffany Amber Thyssen offers a strong performance as a victim of rape , Brian Austin Green is convinced that he is the man torn between the girl he thinks he loves, and his favorite friend. This is the kind of film that does not get the exposure it deserves. Fabulous, gorgeous, so good that it is not just a film made for television.
