The jokes are clear, the gags are poor, the characters walk in the form of screaming, but I could not stop laughing at his very interesting film. No matter how many times I see it, I still get a kick from this one, and I highly recommend it to all the reckless entertainment lovers. It contains many quotes, and some of the best viewing scenes I have seen to this day. If you have a bad week and need a chuckle, rent this week on your way home on Friday night to give you a good week's start.
