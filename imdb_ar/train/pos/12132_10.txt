Fun despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat figure. One should feel sorry for this man; however, I find myself rejoicing at the "House of Davis". Mrs. Davis presented her best performances (she won an Oscar nomination). Thanks to her performance, I brought this fairly boring film. ** Make sure you do not lose yourself when you tell Mildred Philip exactly how you feel about him.
