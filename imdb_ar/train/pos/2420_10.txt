If you enjoy John Kandy's subtle reactions and actions (yes, you said hidden), you can only like this movie ("filling" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The observer (and uninformed) always saw Candy as an actor - a big clown. Sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But, when granted the opportunity, it can be very sharp and very accurate. It is very bad that he was represented in many roles that showed his broad side only, because we will not see more about the other. Oh, yeah, the movie. One can see "Going Berserk" again and again (I know I own) with "Caddyshack". It's just good. The plot, despite being a bit crooked, is actually somewhat deep to the alienation of this kind. They allow Candy, Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to be the least-rated of Candy ... and bounce hard. Definitely worth a glimpse of anyone who was enjoying SCTV or Candy's other work.
