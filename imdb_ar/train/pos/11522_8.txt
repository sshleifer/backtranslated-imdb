I wanted to see this for the longest time, James Mirindino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film, I thought it was a wonderful follow up after that, and the draw started. The acting and direction were fantastic. In fact it seems that everything in the film flows except the script. Sometimes, the only thing that caught my attention was the fact that in the cast she was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Furlani. This film was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for the great inscription from Che McBride and Chris MacDonald.
