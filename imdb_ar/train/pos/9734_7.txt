Well, here comes another romantic comedy ... but unlike all other films of this genre, this is the best I have seen in a long time .. <br /> <br /> I will admit, first, I wanted to watch this movie because Megan Fox, a bit because of Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First, if you've seen a good amount of movies, you'll know that Sidney and Allison will be together in the movie, one way or another ... but from the beginning To the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Well, now this movie is specifically designed for Simon Pegg. I can not see any other actor in Sydney's role, and I'm sure this will be a very weak film if not for the outstanding performance of Pegg. <br /> <br /> There are a number of great jokes and jokes in this film that made me laugh hard, as a courtesy to Simon Big Sydney's character ... but I think everyone in this film is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is solid in this film (she usually does not think more than just doing the average Reese, but she was really good at it), then there are Jeff Bridges, there's Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox, Sophie Maes ... her big role ... <br /> All in all, although I usually do not agree with their ratings on IMDb, I only agree with them this time quite ... <br /> < br /> Go and watch this movie, it is very light indeed and positive, and I highly recommend it ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... Well 7.5 actually ...
