Well, first, I must point out the fact that when I first saw this click I was 9 years old. If you've seen this two weeks ago for the first time, you probably noticed that this is just another horror film from the cheap cable TV with some great sights. But when you are nine, you do not care about these facts. I was afraid of this hell at the time, especially those scenes above (and still do). These days I am hooked on this film. I must see this maybe once a month, and every new night I watch this with 12 cans of beer and a bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! Kinda agrees with those people who said that representation here is inappropriate. It seems both Midkiff and Crosby that I wanted to look like Louis and Rachel, but one can not see much dedication or feelings on these two faces. Hughes and Gwyn are saving the scenes that "doctrines" are working on. What I really want to say about this is the fact that there is actually no other movie that resembles any kind of Sematary pet, and I do not mean zombie things here. The atmosphere of this movie is definitely one thing of a kind. Honestly, how many times have you seen a film that looks superficial on cable TV, but I leave you cool compared to the best coolers there? Well, I broke some cast balls a minute ago, but I must say that all the pieces at this level have sharpened the overall representation to perfection. But hey tell me if you know some movies that look like Pet Sematary! I really like to know ... I do not mean the night of the dead living here ... this way far outweighs the intelligence compared to those things.
