Resident Evil: code veronica is a superb video game, with great graphics, very comfortable controls, a great story and a very interesting factor. The story is that Claire Redfield moves to an island to cross the parachute, and chaos breaks through the main laboratory as they search for her brother. The Veronica code charges are very good, and the effects of fire and rain are fantastic looking. The controls are comfortable, but the button style does not fit with the Dreamcast control, making it hard to get used to.It is still fun revolving around a strange annoying place, shooting the courage of the zombies.Code: veronica also has a bit of "romance" between the two main characters . You can also play the role of Chris Redfield, Resident Evil 1 in this best game ever, for example, although I hate the new feature, when giant spiders crawl, their feet become annoying annoying sounds, and guns sound more realistic. Fantastic graphics, fantastic storyplay, and comfy controls, and a strong voice reali makes the Resident Evil Code: Veronica certainly loved. I give it 10 out of 10.
