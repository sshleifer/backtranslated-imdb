The film revolves around a man who believes all forms of media are out of date. The idea behind his artistic project is to reveal the ridiculous culture in which we take a shower. Of course, the film is shown in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacked comedy (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, popular Hollywood movies, and many other touches in the end, finding himself in the eyes of the weapons he launched. The film is five years old and true every day. It is the best description of anger after the villain I have seen in my life. It's also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
