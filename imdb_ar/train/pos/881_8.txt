The film "Read My Lips" tells of a strange cohabitation that grows between an easy-to-social office employee (Devos) and a trainee in her workplace, Casel. While the film embodies this unlikely duo down to their identities, they engage in a horrifying combination of minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary result. Good things for anyone in personal-driven movies with strong psychological currents. In French with an easy-to-read translation and a good translation. (B +)
