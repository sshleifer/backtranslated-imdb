The documentary presents an original theory of "guns, germs and steel." The series graphically depicts many episodes that strongly support theory and defend theory against common criticism. <br /> <br /> I was very confused to find user comments complaining about the lack of new information in this series. They say the documentary presents information that is taught in middle school. Already it is. In fact, I really enjoyed the original look at the information I knew since middle school and the unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So, if you like to know why things work, if you've disconnected the phone by trying to figure out how it works, if you go to the farm to see how the farm works and how you like cows, you'll enjoy the series. Specific Recommendation.
