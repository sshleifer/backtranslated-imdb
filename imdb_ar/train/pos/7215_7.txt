Full of spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is a fast-paced, thrilling crime based on Ira Levin's play about two gay lesbians (Caine and Reeve) planning to kill one rich wife (Cannon) for property and insurance. The plot succeeded, but Christopher Reeve, where the young man and writer were the least proof of the authors, decided to carry out the actual killing mission - with only slight changes in detail. Reeve allows that Easthampton, Long Island, can become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for example. The remainder of the play plot is a dead giveaway and the truth tells Reeve not mind a little gossip or even investigating the apparent death of the cannon. Will boost revenues and its Warhol stake. <br /> <br /> Michael Caen is Sidney Bruhill, the playwright who makes a massive bomb that has bombed his last four productions and wanted nothing more than to quietly return to work on a new play, perhaps with the participation of Reeve, which would restore his reputation. He can not allow the production of the scandalous countryside play. What then? - Trying to kill him. In the end they ended up killing each other, the manuscript was seized by their neighbor, Helga Tinsdorp, making a million bucks to sell to Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's great fun for a number of reasons. One is production design. This multi-storey and multi-storey house with a large windmill, which is located on nine of the most valuable acres on the ground (Easthampton!) Will be a wonderful collection of fossils anywhere. You will not be able to afford the pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is not too big or parokia in its decor. It is wonderfully modest, though slightly tidy for my taste, this kind of clean house that you fear to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving footprint. <br /> <br /> Next, representation can hardly be improved. Ken, Cannon, and Fred Jones are wonderful. Dyan Cannon performs well as a keen wife, with her panties looking as tight as if they had been sprayed, which is acceptable because of her origins. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable place in his gentle killer role but mentally ill. Erin Worth, as psychologist Helga, was difficult to define, in some way. She was granted - or someone like her - necessary for the plot, but my God, what offense does her character give up, and she turns and claims, "I feel pain in zis woom!" I suppose that in order to make her a little more interesting, I woke up sweating and wearing a clumsy hat with reflectors for the bike. However, it is a nuisance from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You need to love the irrational Ira Levin dialogue. Quinn pleads with Reeve to tell him why he wrote the play "Everything". "Because it's there, Sydney!" "These are mountains, not plays, the plays are not there until they are discovered," says Reeve. Also great is Ken's call to the police after his wife fell dead of fear, as planned. He works himself in a torrent of sighs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and begs to send an ambulance right away. When he hangs, his face assumes his usual quiet expression, blows his nose in his handkerchief, and walks away, all the actions again. <br /> <br /> The peak, though appropriately ironic, is confusing and noisy and full of works of art, lacking the evil magic that Levin and Lumette have brought to previous scenes. The result is mostly made up of hard-hearted revs on Harpichord, fitting in the film. <br /> <br /> You will probably enjoy it.
