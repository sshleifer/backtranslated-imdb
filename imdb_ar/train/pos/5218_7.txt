The herd is unfairly malignant as a "Se7en" tear less. There is already no reason to compare the two, except perhaps in a similar scene in the final showdown. <br /> <br /> Now that you're out of this way, The Flock is very interesting in some respects. Is often a drama, not an exciting film about a very attentive social worker watching the perpetrators. At first you can clearly see that his work has improved. It is evident in two scenes where he first interviews and slaps one of the perpetrators and the other when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think of is the usual questions in his questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the social worker mentioned above. The way he does his job is no different from that of a police officer. He carries a weapon and is constantly checked by the press and provides information to the law enforcement staff if some of his "flock" may be responsible for a sexual offense. He is also a person who has lost all the happiness of living and seems to be the only satisfaction comes from imposing his own justice on his flock. Twice he sees smiling, once apologizing for treating his partner rudely and the other after being beaten to a member of his flock. <br /> <br /> As the flick thrills, the flock is not successful. Somewhat confusing with some annoying plot holes but has a number of amazing set pieces. <br /> <br /> In general, Flock is a strong drama about a man who performs an inhumane job and ultimately has to work hard not to be swallowed up by the abyss that surrounds him. The world we live in is a very sick place and whenever it can distance itself from the worst, the happiest person. The herd gets to this point well.
