The modern parrot is not a very creative idea for a new film, but Paulie has turned a simple idea into a wonderful and intimate movie that will delight all family members. He is able to bridge the gap between emotional litter and cruel cruelty during the separation of Mary and Paulie, and all the events in the film lead to a highly satisfactory emotional result. The animals are well trained - everyone will be affected when Polly spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie's wonderful character was supposed to get even more successful, although this film was not in 1998, unlike Save Private Ryan. This hour and half will definitely be an enjoyable hour and you will remember it. Pauli's story is a touching, sad, happy and interesting story - from the moment it was first seen to the moment of its reunion with its original owner, you will enjoy watching it and learning the friendship and realities of a gloomy life in the way. Do not be missed if you have any kind of heart or passion. 9/10
