Well, if you're open enough because you liked a barber, you'd love this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as close as Fort Knox, the current will give you a record that: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for anyone who is willing to watch films outside his ethnic territory. It's interesting, it's real for life, in two or three occasions, you lose links between scenes, but often, especially in the end, you find yourself experiencing a tear or two in your eyes simply because it often reflects the shape of life. <br /> <br /> I love it and recommend it to anyone who is open minded outside the traditional American film.
