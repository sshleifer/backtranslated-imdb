I have to vote this out of 10 out of 10 in a rare opportunity to come across this review, and I regret, and hilarious to Hollywood, and involve me in her strange / funny world. But very seriously, it was good. It is clear that the first ring finds it to be feet, but Silverman's strangeness seems to pass through it. It's not the kind of loud laughter of comedy, but that's good, and a lot of it laughs at it, and this will not be true when referring to laughter, but the audience hear their inner clown laughing at the absurdity of everything. I can easily see this as a strange Drew Carey show with strange characters and an incredibly powerful central character. Worth seeing, look forward to the following episodes. Very good chance of the usual comedy there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? talk me....
