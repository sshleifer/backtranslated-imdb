This film is good for what it is, and humble. However, I will not see him twice: I am complementary to Peter Cushing and that is why I saw him. The best profit for this film is: BREVITY and effectiveness. Compared to other similar films, do not pull their feet forever as each of the four slides (plus one) lasts less than 30 minutes, the last under 10 years. In the first part, the horror writer who suffers from the "writer's block" moves to an isolated old house looking for inspiration. He finds a lot of him when he begins to imagine one of his fantastic fancies. The contrivance plot is similar to the BURIAL PREMATURE. Good use of the development of the point of view: Does the writer suffer from mental illness ... or (as it appears in the end) his wife wants the cup from her lover to play with the phobia of the husband to make him crazy and secure his property .. Will be successful Bimbo planned to enjoy the fruits of its creative plan? <br /> <br /> In the second part, two long-lost friends meet in the same old isolated house, but they do not seem to be helping to visit a strange horror. A museum with a wax statue of the long-lost love of their youth, which once separated them. Of the Gothic museum guard, learn that the woman photographed is a dead ax used as a murderer ... or is it? <br /> <br /> The third part was the least interesting for me. <br /> <br /> The fourth episode shows a horror film - thought to be the best ever - in the depths of low-budget C movies. Looking for a costume to give credibility to the fictional vampires, he gets the real deal. This part also lacks the rigidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> Representation is fair, with the first two parts contributing in the most part. Good film, taken with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing, nor me ... but worth seeing.
