Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone has to see it ... it's too hot. It meets the strengthening of the values ​​of perseverance, humility and love of the family ... The story can be related to our lives today especially since poverty has reached the threshold. The way we deal with this problem is very important. If a person is not strong enough to address this problem, it may leave no sense or benefit. I am very pleased with how the characters justify their roles even to the young actors ... Their emotions have captured the public. The film may have been filmed in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you do not want it to end. This makes it really wonderful! There must be a remake of this very beautiful film.
