Another one to mobilize Babe and Lead. The story is more exciting than any other musician I have seen: the cannons are hidden in the lost female legs, and they are generally placed in the other in a way closer to the intelligent commentary than we might expect to language. More effective than the contemporary "drama". Hard to identify with a woman who keeps her cannon on her pants - because of her luggage. Very impressive if you are considering the context. <br /> <br /> Despite the artillery that provides 90% of the surprises, this film also tells how greed replaces all other considerations in the life of a group of yakuzas who follow a woman who keeps her leg on a hidden cannon / rocket launcher (and then not There is a group shower or a cascade (a hidden hidden bomber pulled from behind the fans back, apparently from nothing, dead or alive in miike (1999)), the flame came out of the slow air by the heroine near the end of the original Tommy (2000) , Or the horrific scene of the flames in the Sunny Gets Blue (1992), all of which testify to the nearly third world movie "Cantinflas-esquire" Bond, which put them at a loss is the explanation, but I can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see good quality films of this essence being produced in Hollywood, but they are extinct with cheap crap that they pump in for cheap, all-funny but funny thrill. It's a real film and, although it's fantastic in its entirety, the ending is a wonderful, if not blurred, shredding of certain pictures of Sergio Leon, including a defender where the legs must be, which is certainly appropriate!
