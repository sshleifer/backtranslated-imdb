I really enjoyed this movie and it was very hard to do this when your brother made stupid comments in 30 seconds. But I enjoyed it, because I used to get used to the usual motion pictures in Hong Kong. Most movies like this do not see them in the story line, you see them for reckless motion. Unconscious work is correct. You'll see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible hops and dodge countless bullets. It is true that this film was released to a wider audience after Li was in the Weapon of the Flesh 4. This is one of the reasons that led to the low ratings in this film. Perhaps most people would expect to watch a film polished like the North American movie. But you have to remember that most of Hong Kong's film budgets are not as high as North American, and the style in the motion picture in Hong Kong is usually very different and usually requires wiring in many of them. If you want to see a good movie, you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My classification was 8.
