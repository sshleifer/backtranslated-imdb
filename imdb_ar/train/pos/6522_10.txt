During the film Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures, the ball was dropped in the restoration of this film supervised by Cecil B. DeMille and Anthony Quinn and get it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the additions. It is clear to me that Execs in Paramount Pictures are blind as bats and are ignorant of the fact that they have a wonderful film of pirates in their captivity for a real pirate who has already lived in New Orleans, Louisiana than would have helped make The Crescent City once again famous for its pirate connections. When Execs at Paramount finally gets the program and this movie is released in digital format, I'll be a happy vehicle. Paramount Pictures is back for you to get your movie and restore this movie now!
