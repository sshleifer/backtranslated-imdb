The origins of caring for bears and their cousins. If you see the original movie, you will notice a discrepancy. The cousins ​​were raised with Care Bearz, rather than later. However, I have no problem with this, preferring to treat films as separate interpretations. Children are adorable and fun to watch as they play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Bunny. The villain is a delightful threat. I could sympathize with the three children because I have never been good at sports too. Cree's summer is excellent as Christie. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love games or enjoy the original, do not be missed. 9/10
