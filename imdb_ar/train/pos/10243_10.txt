I loved the show because it was not copied from another show, and it had an original good story and good for young children (if they love dinosaurs this is) I have very few dips not Its all that great reason the dinosaurs look a bit mutant so i had to have but 7 but now it's a little late for this yay 4 other lines to go it's fantastic for a fantastic show though you are warned that this might spoil part for you, so if you do not Want to spoil Do not read Plz near the end is a bit strange all they need to do Is getting dang i forgot what it was so i think it is not spoiler so i do not care i like it and my opinion is sorry for any spelling words if any
