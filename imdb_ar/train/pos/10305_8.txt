If you want intense pain in laughter, watch this movie and the things that Bruce is getting at his news reporter. Deleted scenes are priceless. I do not know why they did not include it in the original film. It can not be because of the time, because the film reaches only 101 minutes. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor, who has been ignored for a long time. Jim Carrie needs meds!
