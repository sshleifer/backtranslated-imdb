It took 8 seasons, but first, in early 1959, and last, in the fall of 1965, it was shorter than the seasons 2-7. CBS president William Paley canceled Rawhide production after watching the premiere of Season 8 in September 1965, because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming in the role of Gil Favor, who left after season 7. The last episode was shown in November 1965. The CBS broadcast The only 1966, on January 4, 1966, served as a replay. <br /> <br /> I often wondered why Rawhide did not go into color photography last season? Most Westerners in the 1960s were colored by 1965. CBS was broadcast in color that fall for many of their comedies, but Westerners such as Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained black and white. Gunsmoke was the latest Western series (and the latest series of peak times to switch to color) on Sept. 17, 1966, for the Snap Decision episode.
