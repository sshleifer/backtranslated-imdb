I remember seeing this film at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky when I was a boy. The scene in which Dr. Carmos found the gardener's coffin, and the dead body where he breathed, was the most terrifying part of the film for me, which only intensified the film's darkness. I also wondered about the people who flocked out of the trees in the end, until I realized the part of the movie that changed the name Blackwoods family from Blackblood, because there is a character in the family history known for many hanging from different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood appeared to be stepping out of his kicks to deaths from his family. I also noticed that when Foster first enters the cemetery door, he is keen to observe the sharp goal of the gate, where he meets his finale. I will not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror film lovers.
