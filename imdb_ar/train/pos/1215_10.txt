This is my favorite of the Three Bears Care movies. Once again I liked all the songs. But the big problem as most people have pointed out is that this story contradicts the original story. For those who saw the first movie, remember that the bears met their "cousins" who they never seemed to know. It was not, of course, until the end that the cousins ​​received their symbols after they proved their care. However, in this story cousins ​​grow up with caregivers and have belly symbols all the time. To say that this is not a bad film as long as you keep it separate from the first. I thought that Darkheart's character was far more evil then Nicholas I. But at the same time I felt he had added some sort of balance to the sweetness of caring bears. I also liked the part that we care about in the end, although I know that others have mixed feelings about this scene. Of course I loved the songs. My favorite being growing up and yong forever. Bears movies have always been such a good song. Ten stars for a very good film.
