The problem is that the film focused on the build-up of the concept created in the 1960s, that comic books can only be done as a "camp" (ie Batman's 60th presentation) for television and movies. So you have combat sequences with translations (Come on!), A non-clueless Doc Savage (uncomfortable about women in the pulp, not a fool), Monk Mayfair at night (a guaranteed scene to give you nightmares for several nights) In gold, such as Herve Felichez, which represents an Oscar system. When they do not perform the thrilling Sosa marches, the little "funny" music of the little one reduces a lot of drama. <br /> <br /> Even so, this movie ... well. It is fun, and when it stays serious, it represents a very accurate representation of fibers. Except for Monk, as mentioned before: he is heavily muscular and not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale man with a pale attitude, not Paul Gleason with a scarf (inexplicable). <br /> <br /> Death sequences, for example, are wonderfully awesome and not something I would recommend for children. But they are very close to the feeling of pulp. When writers and producers understand them correctly, they do it correctly - I will give them this. <br /> <br /> But if the producers have acted as a loving and programming Doc, for example, Reeves' first Superman films, think about what we might have after that. I think the problem is schizophrenia in the film. There is a certain sense of trying to honor the thirties, but they are also trying to surrender to the "heroes must be camp" created by Batman. One has the impression that there is a realistic first draft like a pulp and then a person comes and says, "Hey, let's make it funny - it's been successful with Batman's show for 8 years!" <br /> <br /> Yehia Duk, thanks to Earl Makrawash and Bakaro Panzai. If MacRauch does not honor Doc Savage in this movie, the man will already be scared. So when the series is actually shown on the TV (allegedly mid-season at '99-00), Doc Savage, which was updated until the 1990s, will live again.
