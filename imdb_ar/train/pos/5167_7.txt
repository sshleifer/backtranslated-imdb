I must say that the worst part of the film was in the first half hour. I was confused about who I was. For example, Bill Paxon's character was long-haired and wore a sweater. Then, when all the males arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a character like Bill Paxon, but it was not. I said where is Bill Paxon? Then, there was a man with his girlfriend. He said she was 21 years old. This was supposed to be the reunion of 20-year-old camp director (Alan Arkin) who is unforgettable. Later, this same girl was interacting and talking about her experiences in the camp. This makes no sense. She would be one year old. However, it turned out that the film was very good. Kevin Pollack was a gentle man who was always harassing. One man was a complete narcissist, and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-fashioned camp director who admits to being in touch with young people. The best part is that none of the emerging campers had successes in life. None of them were very big careers. This seems very real life. The film was compared to The Big Chill. In some ways, it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was more realistic. So, although the beginning is not promising, the film ended up turning into a good movie.
