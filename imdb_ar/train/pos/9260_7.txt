There are enough sad stories about women and their suppression by religious, political and social means. Not to minimize films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as unequal wages and marginalization in society, all in the name of God or God or some ridiculous justifications, but sometimes it is useful to take a different approach and shed some light on the subject. <br /> <br /> The preparation is the 2006 Iran-Bahrain match to qualify for the World Cup. There is a great passion and many women try to hide themselves as men to participate in the game. <br /> <br /> The women arrested (Sima Mubarak Shahi, Chaysa Irani, Ida Siddiqui, Gholnaz Varmani and Mazniz) and the detainee are tried to give a funny and glamorous glimpse into the customs of this country, and probably all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers guarding and transporting them, both residents of the city and villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter spent some of the fun moments when we thought about why such unwritten rules existed. <br /> <br /> It is essentially a patriarchal society that feels that it must save women from the horrible behavior of their man. Instead of educating the male population, they are denied the privilege and rights of women. <br /> <br /> When you see changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society, it is no surprise that this film will not play any role in Iran. But Jaafar Panahi has a winning hand for those who can see him.
