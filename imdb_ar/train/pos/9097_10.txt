We were given this movie a high mark because it was really nice and really funny, while it was mediocre. I went to see this movie when I was playing in the Philly area and it was the hub of a great night with friends. The film is well written and works well, and although it seems like a comedy and not a movie, it does not take away the film. You no longer find such a comedy anymore, as you do not have to shock people to be funny. The film revolves around a Ukrainian housewife who finds herself working for a young couple in need of help. Although she initially helps her, they soon add more madness to their lives, then the couple bargains. Things get so far out of control .... you have to see! He made me laugh laughing, even after I left the theater. This film has put me in a good mood. I can not wait to be released on a DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
