This movie can only be created in 1970! It is a strange action film in a small city for workers in California. Close a kind of plant or factory, suddenly, bad behavior occurs rampant in the streets! The townspeople are fed up! So Ben Arnold (Jean-Michael Vincent) goes to another town to recruit his brother Aaron, played by Chris Christoferson. Aaron is a veterinarian in Vietnam looking and balancing a bit. He hang out with a group of other Vietnam veterinarians. They come to the city to clean it (they become turned), but under their good deeds, they actually manage gambling houses, demand protection funds, etc. !!! It takes some time for people to catch up with him, and in the face of the Bible between Cain and Abel, Vincent has to face his older brother. There is an interesting ambience about this film, which makes it fun (note the anti-cock scene!). Vincent is semi-angelic in this role ?? He thinks strongly about his brother, can not imagine that he is committing the evil deeds to which he is accused. Finally comes to his senses ?? His girlfriend, Victoria Princapal, was brutally beaten in the back and beaten in his home. Chris Christoferson is an effective creepy like Aaron. He bluntly denies committing any wrongdoing, but gently denies and talks to his little daughter Vincent (referring to him as "Uncle Aaron") even while threatening his father, smiling all the time! Vincent and Christoferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters shows a sexy appearance as a "salon" that attracts Aaron's attention. This action movie 70 is good, if you can find it !! It's not available on DVD yet?
