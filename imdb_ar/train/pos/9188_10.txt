It is very bad that many people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! I explain this too to you :) <br /> <br /> This episode has been divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "Dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now what people do not understand is that Tony's dream is just a dream. In this episode about his willingness to die. Lose his own identity, and eventually forget himself, and thus cut all his ties with this world. You'll notice what I'm saying in the doctor's scene, where Tony says he has lost his "life" bag. They've done a great job explaining their thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the entire plot, you will find this and the next episode something unique with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> Like every Soprano episode, acting and photography are great. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand was the role played by the monks. I'll see it until I get this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode really touched me, and I do not think anyone else can provide a better insight into what is happening in the experience of death. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt.
