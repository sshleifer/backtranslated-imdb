A "witness on the Rhine" began as a Broadway theater by Lilian Hellman, who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still associated with Nazi Germany through the disgraceful non-aggression pact of August 1939. Much to the fact that Helman was just echoing For the line of the Communist Party, the line did not change until two months later. Lillian was already months ahead of schedule. <br /> <br /> The play "Witness on the River Rhine" was performed from April 1941 to February 1942 and received 378 shows. Five Broadway players came to repeat their roles. Frank Wilson The servants and Eric Roberts as the youngest son and Lucille Watson as the family scientist , And most importantly the villain George Colores and Paul Lucas. <br /> <br /> Lucas got a hat trick in 1943 and won the Oscar and Golden Globe, and New York film critics for Best Actor. Maybe if the Tony Awards were there, he would have won. Oscar is more prominent when you think of who was against him, Humphrey Bogart of Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his rivals had a movie box office name bigger than him. The Lukas nomination is usually the type given by the Academy to overcome a field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew that this was why Maddy Christians did not repeat her role in Broadway and was given the role of Lucas' wife to the House of Davis. Davis took the part not because it was a particularly flashy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and wanted to be associated with it. It is the same reason for her role as the man who came to dinner, a play much lighter than this play. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of a judge at the US Supreme Court who married a German citizen in the Weimar days. . After many years of displacement in Europe, Davis Lucas and their three children come to America, which has not yet entered the European war. They were welcomed by Lucille Watson, who is naturally thrilled to meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The bird in this ointment is some other guests of the house, a friend of Davis from the last days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, the Roman diplomat and aristocrat George Collores. Coulouris is a wonderful waste and he craves the opportunity to double the deal when suspected in the background of Lucas anti-fascism. <br /> <br /> His doubts are absolutely correct, and that is why the family is the vagabond that has become it. Lucas fought in Spain from the Republican side and was injured there. His health has not been the same since then. His family sincerely supports him in any decision taken. These decisions affect all other members of the working group. <br /> <br /> Add more to the Broadway play including some beautiful Fascist creatures Dashiell Hammett was another Lilian Hellman. The Coulouris playing cards at the German Embassy were Hammett designs with abhorrent types such as Henry Daniel, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolf Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is really one of the most hateful characters ever to the screen as no Count Runmanian count. It was a metaphor for his country, which embraced the Nazis with enthusiasm and then denied them on an equal footing without losing a step after Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lusail Watson was the best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Pacino in the Bell Bell. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and the film won Best Picture for this classic anti-fascist film, Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although it has been firmly planted at those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still carries a tough, anti-fascist message that carries endlessly.
