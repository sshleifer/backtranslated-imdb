A number of contributors mentioned the age difference between Stuart and Novak. She was 25 years old and was 50 years old when the film was released. I think the difference was not important for a thriller like Vertigo, but it's important for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is why his personality will be attracted to her salary, but it is unclear why she attracted him. <br /> <br /> However, the film works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene around the cat's head, with its dark eyebrows flaring and whistling and ejaculation, is a real charm. So, it's a bit difficult, when the scene moves to the top of the Flatiron building, and we see the age difference very sharply. As he hugs her, she runs her fingers through his hair, but she stops moving and brushes her fingertips lightly on a wig.
