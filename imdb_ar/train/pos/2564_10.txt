Personally I think Sayonara was the greatest film he ever made. All feelings touched from anger to romance to complete the tragedy. Brando had to win the Best Actor award. Anyway, the movie is awesome, the guy is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! Do this, fall in love.
