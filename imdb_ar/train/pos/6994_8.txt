Bela made 9 photos for Monogram, but at this stage, only four, things started to gather. All the rest in the series will use this model as a basic template for production, writing and personal development. From here on, whether better or worse, the series will also address one basic theme: the world (usually Bela) conducts experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes in the basement of the old house), causing things to flourish. It was the first time that director Dave Milton had a chance to spread his wings. He joined Black DRAGONS, flicked before, but that's where he started to click on his craft. Lewis made a wonderful atmosphere next to almost anything and was present in the rest of the individual sections. Casting is an essential element of this game, a very good B movie, here. You can get Barclay and Harlen (also from Black DRAGONS), along with Russell, who will star in the CATOPLE CATOPLE from Lewtons and Rosetto from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice slice of Poor Row talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with ... summarizing everything you've learned so far, and giving you something to compare the rest with. the plot? Bella steals the juice of the gland to keep his wife bad young. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you can read it and smile, the rest will be easy.
