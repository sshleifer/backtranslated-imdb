Yes, unbelievable, in 1968 she won the Academy Award for Best Picture - and was the third musician to win the award in five years, first Lady Fair in 1964 and The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady and Sound of Music And Oliver! However that is Oliver! Is incomparably better! no comparison. The first two films are wet wet noodles compared to strong Oliver. Fantastic acting wonderful songs wonderful story and wonderful dance. This film is dynamic, topical, related to human experience and unlike the huge New York gangs, Oliver! Presents a picture of poverty in London, the nineteenth century, England that evokes sympathy without compromise. Oliver Reed was a great actor and proved that in Oliver! The other actors and actors, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are both wonderful and provide powerful images of characters who inspire sympathy and warmth without being caricatured.
