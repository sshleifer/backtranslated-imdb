I was ready to make a trip to the glittering opera opera of opera and soap, but I was happy to find a fast-paced text, moral images and excellent of all actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense, Which has recently been destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor in her most beautiful beauty and sympathy, before succumbing to the hysterical nurses who later distorted her work. All the supporting players are going around, and I wonder who trained all those elephants. <br /> <br /> When talking about the Stone Buddha sequence, you can really realize that Vivian is in the long shots. Their shape and manner of movement differ from Taylor. The only thing that is similar to this sequence is the footage of the operation being performed poorly, as the background moves too quickly for horses to stroll. <br /> <br /> If you want an interesting movie that is beautifully thought of and can never be seen boring, spend a few hours with the elephant walking.
