This early film contains its flaws - a predictable plot and some long scenes of dubious importance - but it clearly illustrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It is also one of his most stylistic films; note, for example, that the strange distortions he uses during the sequence of concerts and repeated echoes of both the title and the plot in the picture. <br /> <br /> Its essence, though, is still the final that remains among the most exciting examples of boxing cinema. Although you know that the hero must win, it is perfectly reasonable that he will lose, and his wife's movement from the angle of the hero to his place, driven by the final plot, very tied to the progress of the match. The stopwatch inserts do exactly what it should; you can almost hear the tick mark (although this is a silent movie, but the visual images often have an amazing audio feel). The rhythm becomes amazingly fast, and the viewer is absorbed in the excitement and brutality of both the conformity and the sexual jealousy behind it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD version I know is the Laserlight version, the public domain company. As with all silent Hitchcock releases, they have attached many musical selections, mostly a musical band, to work. Sound editing is often dirty, sound quality varies widely, but it seems that some real care has entered into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final works very well; this sequence is unlikely to be accompanied by the best ever Here. <br /> <br /> This film is more impressive than the current mystery suggests. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock and the canonical list of worthy boxing films.
