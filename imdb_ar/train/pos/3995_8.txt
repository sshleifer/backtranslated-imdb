Kurishi did not enjoy films that justify the quality of his writings. The recently adapted fading like "intimacy" has destroyed the great writing. But the mother outperforms all his previous incarnations, surpassing even my beautiful laundry. A middle-aged woman overcomes the widow's cover through her physical relationship with a friend of her emotionally vulnerable daughter. The fact that you believe that all this is credited with the quality of disposition as it is in the gift of limited writing. And in Daniel Craig, we have antagonistic antagonists, screaming, denying the public to ever wonder why a little lover thinks of a crumbling grandmother's bed. The film, which was beautifully filmed, failed only in the weak portrayal of peripheral characters, but as a study of the unimaginable lust, it is the winner.
