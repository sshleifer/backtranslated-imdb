I went to see this film I expect a relaxing time to relax in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself to convince her that I was not afraid. In many ways the story is still children, but with the scenario has a lot of potential. Perhaps one of the most horrifying films if another audience is planned.
