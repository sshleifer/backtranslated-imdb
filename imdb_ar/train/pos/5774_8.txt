A meteorite descends from the sky and reawakens the Pleasure Warrior, which has long been used to terrorize the area around Crater Park. While the monster eats locals who are trying to find them away from the monster killing. <br /> <br /> The latest attempts to send horror movies and old sci-fi like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are a kind of walking picture when we have films like Crater Lake Monster available for viewing. It's a kind of film that only strips and sends these movies, it's the real deal. All those films try to be just without a tongue in the cheek and because it is more fun because of it. It's a kind of real film that has the bad luck of coming, just like Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects. Monster, a mix of motion saver and a life-size head, is a cute little monster. The directors spoil the audience through frequent footage of the monster and chaos. Surely everything is fake, but not the movies about the suspension of disbelief? In fact, I think it's really great monsters, and that's what you like. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a low-budget campaign in some way. If you want a real real engine in the monster movie, look no further. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar monster lake movies (Boggy Creek and others)
