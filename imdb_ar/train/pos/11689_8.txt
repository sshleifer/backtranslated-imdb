We hope that the result has changed now because of my amazing and amazing assessment that convinced you all to go and watch the movie, which led to the creation of an instant choir with "8", the real result of this film. <br /> <br /> Listed before Chris Rock is King! Before going to see this film, I did not outdo it, but now I hit the doors of Chris Rock's website that I ask him to take me as his leader. This movie is really funny, if you do not find this movie funny, then you really need a treatment which is a humor that targets all areas of society including race (as expected), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams and comedy stand. The menu continues. <br /> <br /> There was a slight disappointment for me. This was when I entered this film, I did not realize that it was actually a new version of "Heaven Can Wait", a very good movie that was produced in 1971 with Warren Betty. As such, I was quite surprised when I saw this movie and suddenly the plot began to break down to become quite similar to an old film I had seen on television a few weeks ago .. No matter that this film is in my opinion the best version of two of them simply because of the different areas covered The fact that Chris Rock is more entertaining than Warren Betty in any second of any day of any week than any year of any ... gets the picture. <br /> <br /> Well to the actual plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not spoil the experience yourself! Do not read the plot! Go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on the IMDb so far they got angry and see it because it's the most extreme thing I've seen in a long time, go and watch it because this cinematic experience does not leave you grumbling about nausea at the expense of movie tickets. Go see it because it's a good movie!
