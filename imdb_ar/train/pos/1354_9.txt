For people interested in business and the corporate world, this offer is simply the best among the best. As one former contestant wrote in his blog about this innovative show: business people finally received an audience. The idea is all perfect; there is a group of entrepreneurs who compete against each other in business-related tasks, located in the best place in the world, New York City. Donald Trump is ideal as president, though his vanity is greater than the fact that the whole world is endless. It also makes a lot of dubious decisions about who should be launched, one of the drawbacks of the offer. <br /> <br /> Season One: The Great Season In general, it is the best season for the "normal" season. It was this season that was about actual work skills. Later the series sank almost in marketing-related tasks with lots of product placements. The racers are large and generally interesting, with the most beloved character in the series: Troy. I know that I'm not the only person to suspect that the Trump World Tower ring where the fire was rigged to get Amy and Nick on this specific mission. <br /> <br /> Season Two: The season is also great. The tasks were still pretty good and many of the racers were interesting. Jen M was terrible and did not have to reach the final, IMO. Also, this season was the worst shooting ever (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Too bad. In fact, I liked the idea of ​​the book of intelligence versus the street smarts, but the cast was so awful (it turned out that Trump also hated the actors) so much that the whole season was a complete disaster. The best moments were the second episode (Motel Renovation), with the release of PM Brian, a man who has only added enormous amounts of comedy value. <br /> <br /> Season 4: Excellent season, thanks to a lot of interest and entertainment racers this season (especially Randall, Ala, Marcus and the total disaster that was called Toreal). "Take Me to the Meeting Room" is one of the absolute classics of this show, which ends with a four-shot shoot. Unfortunately, I think we were robbed for the Final Randall vs. I think Trump was afraid to have won, and prevented it from happening. <br /> <br /> Season Five: A dull season with no special objects. Brent was just awkward and obviously there was only to create a drama. The tasks were awful in general (how did you create anything that deals with business at all?). I think the best man won, but I personally did not care less. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I can see why they wanted to try LA as a new location for the show, but looking back was a mistake. New York will always be the right place. This season added a lot of new things, mostly awful (such as losing the team while sleeping in the tents, still winning the afternoon is PM, for example). The tasks were awful as Trump chose the wrong winner. James deserved it, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity Edition. Best season ever. The rules are quite different (like using rolodexes), but all have fun and entertainment. The biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not celebrities at all, especially the women I was not familiar with except Amroosa, a total disgrace to everything she participated in. This was Jane Simone's season, but it seemed to be Jane Simone's season, but after he deceived himself completely during the Kodak mission, another man came out of the shadows: Pierce Morgan. No one controlled the season as he did. He crushed his opponents and also caught him as a man with a great sense of humor. (Although some uptight Americans (not all Americans, of course do not make mistakes), they unfortunately did not have the social skills to understand them. WAY TO GO PIERS !! <br /> <br /> For fans of this, I highly recommend the UK release of Sir Alan Sugar as president. In fact, the British version is better than that, and that's something to say because the American (and original) offer is a really great show. One thing about the UK's version is that racers usually behave like decent people in a meeting room, unlike the persistent and rude behavior of the United States.
