This film was just as good as some other Western films produced by Anthony Mann and James Stewart such as Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend of the River. This film begins as a mill of the West, but it becomes more complicated as it progresses. It begins with the arrival of Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan to Seattle and accuses Stuart of killing. He was found innocent but was stolen by a corrupt judge. Stuart then agrees to lead something but I forget what it is, but Stuart only cares about getting his cattle back. As the film continues, Stuart seems to care about himself just like his character in Naked Spur. The situation improves halfway after arriving in Alaska. This is one of the best Stuart Westerners.
