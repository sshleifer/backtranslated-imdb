This movie is the reason I found this site. I could not find this movie anywhere else! I am very happy because we found it here! We've seen it on TV before and wanted to find it hard and buy it and we have several friends interested in buying it. One of the other posters commented that it was boring, although I must say it was not. Especially if you are a fictional person, you will love this movie. Fantastic horses, well trained and good film. It is definitely the one we will buy it for our home DVD library. We would recommend it to our friends. The bond between the man and the horse in this film was very inspirational and made you want to spend more time with your horses. It's definitely a movie we'll see several times.
