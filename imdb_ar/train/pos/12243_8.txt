Kate Beckinsell is good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow like Emma in this movie, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in Emma's other release. Both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsell in the role of Emma looks more interesting, though. I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this film better too ... She was more sweet and emotional. There are some things I like best about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, such as how the comic side looks more pronounced.
