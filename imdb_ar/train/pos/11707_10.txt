I remember watching this movie a long time ago, at the time, although it did not have any special effects, but the acting was really good. It still has the same message for today, although the technology has changed, and perhaps should make a new version of this film, it will be interesting to see a new edition. I also enjoyed the music of the film, Larry Norman was a good songwriter during that time period, although most of the Christian music is now worshiping and praising music. I was always curious to see what happened to Patty after the series ended? Did you continue to produce more films, did you eventually get married and raised a family? I would like to get updated.
