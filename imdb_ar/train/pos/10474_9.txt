I was amazingly impressed by this film. It contains basic elements of depression, sadness, loneliness, hopelessness, hope, dreams and companionship. It was not just a genius musician, but it was about a man in grief trying to find consolation in his music. He finds a companion who comes with her own issues. Claire and Dees were able to provide each other with friendship and love, but more importantly, a conclusion to the events that shaped their lives for the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is an impossible character according to today's standards of rock star. However he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that makes him in a recession, while the things around him literally go to ruins. His focus is on creating his own "whale music", in fact, becoming his obsession. <br /> <br /> Clare is a child in the direction of the street and needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talent while at Des. They also find a common friend who accepts them. She learns to trust him over a period of time. <br /> <br /> These two people find love for each other. Do not blow mind and sex a kind of passion, but love where friendship and understanding means more. For two infected people, they find confidence together.
