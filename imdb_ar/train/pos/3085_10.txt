I watched episodes that were not broadcast on the internet and I was so sad that the show did not return. He had the best mature and talented actors and amazing chemistry. It seems that all actors are personal friends in real life. Near the end, the show became attractive, exciting and very enjoyable. Of course, some lines of the story are not realistic, so what ... characters are all beloved and you are the root of it. The presentation reminded me of the intersection between other favorites: "sex and the city" and "happiness." Great glory to all cast. Note to ABC execs: Nielsen Ratings reports do not display true results. The audience will often record it. I was very disappointed with the major networks to flood reality television programs or programs for young people. Why do we get mature material, deliberate and good disposition that we have to turn into HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes on the Internet. New broadcast media will become more and more popular among viewers.
