Even in the middle of the season, I got involved in school and my activities so much that I did not realize that the offer was canceled halfway, which is nonsense. <br /> <br /> I think the followers of this show must write the fox and ask them to finish filming at least until the season can be released on the DVD later. They may then see the number of people disappointed that the show has not survived its first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the show and looked at it every Thursday after OC. Can you imagine my disappointment when I came back to try and watch the show just to discover that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not too happy with the fox now. Even more so after discovering that NO was terminated. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what's going on. Half a cameraman looks like a half-made car, it's pretty useless. Fox, the film end damn and give some fans at the show some peace.
