In the classical sense of the four humor (not limited to the concept of funny or even entertainment), Altman "H.E.A.L.T.H." Treats both humor, in fact in very funny, amusing ways. There is sputum, as embodies the character of Lorraine Bacal very lazy and guard and toughness Ester Brill, whose mission seems to be life is all about appearance, protecting the secrets of her life and beauty more than her well-being. There is Dr. Cole Gully of Paul Paul Dolly, who loves a fish out of the water (perhaps more like a seal) flops around him overheating, barking and urging crowds to subscribe to his watery craziness. Isabella Garnell of Glenda Jackson flutters from the troubled Hamlet and has a good bar to Shakespeare - so she raises a solo or two. Let's not forget the character of Billy Hammer, Bobby Hummer ("Breast that feeds the child governs the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolf and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carole Burnett, respectively), relatively rational figures seeking to create a balance between all the companions and extreme humor that met for H.E.A.L.T.H. - Type of WTO specialized in H.E.A.L.T.H. , That means nothing but health. This Altman is at its best classical.
