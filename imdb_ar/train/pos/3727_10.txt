Tegerland is one of the coolest films I've seen, and in my opinion even outperforms a full metal jacket, a movie of a similar nature. Booz played well by Farrell, a character that stays in your mind long after the film ends. The finish is brilliantly cut by Schumacher - with singing melody melody and slow mue of the troops preparing to leave. What a movie.
