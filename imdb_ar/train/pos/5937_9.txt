After seeing the "dead end of Batman", I did not know what to really expect from the finest of the world. Of course, Superman and Batman. All the picture books I have in my world have one team. <br /> <br /> After watching this 3 and a half minute trailer, it made me wish someone had filmed a World's Finest fan movie, if not a full movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, some things in the Superman game were cheesy, but movie clips in the theaters are always exciting, giving you only certain aspects of the entire product. This seems to require a complete product. <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of director Sandy Cholera, who plays a role in poor Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie is produced, actors will be represented to suit the bill of the film, although I think Nina Katzorowski will make Louis Lane well, especially if a closer dialogue is conducted with the character. <br /> <br /> It's good to see Clark Bartram wearing a Batman costume deadlocked, but it has to be updated a bit more, not like the 1940s Batman with the head and leather in the eighties and nineties. His behavior is like Batman, but I'm still wondering about the health of white contact lenses instead of just letting his eyes run through the mask. I think the goal was to make it closer to the comic character of the movie character. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hairn can not play Superman. Standing around him with an idiotic look on his face he simply says, "Slap me." Online delivery seems to be a problem with him. <br /> <br /> In general, though, I like to see a whole story and a film based on this innovative work. There were rumors about the best movie in the world being manufactured, and with the correct additions to the script, that could be the case. Hope more like these are made.
