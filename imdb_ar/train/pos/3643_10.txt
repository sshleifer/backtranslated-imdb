The end of an era here in the states was launched in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie," a live Disney film that seems to be "the best of the world !!!!!" I've been here in Texas! In fact, the story began in West Texas, as illustrated by the area code on the sign there. It was a high school principal who was so convinced of the baseball team that he decided to become a professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this film: it was so nice! !! It was a very good mathematical film, a trio of "The Mighty Ducks". I also acquired filmgoers all over Texas, from somewhere between Penhandel and El Paso to Metroplicks (where I live). I can say because I realized that the pitch (was "the pitch in Arlington;" now became the "Amerikst Field")! It was good to see Disney's "Golden Age" ending here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Golden Age of Disney <br /> <br /> 1920-Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "Everything started using the mouse ... and ended It's using baseball. " (Sighs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
