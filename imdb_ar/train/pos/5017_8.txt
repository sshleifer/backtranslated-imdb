I was 15 years old when this film appeared on television. Being raised in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teen life there. This film touched my teenage heart, and I remembered him fondly in the last 12 years. She recently got her second, third and fourth view thanks to LOVE Channel. I still cry because the film arrived and touched my confused inner teenager.
