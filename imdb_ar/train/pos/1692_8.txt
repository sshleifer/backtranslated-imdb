Like the classic cartoons of Bugs Bunny, this film enjoys a sense of humor at different levels. I just gave this to my 10-year-old daughter and my 11-year-old son. They both enjoyed the movie - breaking laughter several times ... and my daughter is not a science fiction fan. The movie kept me laughing even though I had seen several times ... humor at the adult level (the humor that adults will get simply because of larger life experiences, no dull things or classified in the R category can be found here) is equally enjoyable for adults. For example, adult humor, Mars sounds are based on characters from different films / actors. Pilot Mars, Blaznee, has the voice and conduct of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, Peter of the seller Dr. Strangelov. The special effects are surprisingly good for this film. The lack of the best 10 actors actually works for the film, and the actors / actors are playing their part well - in fact I would say that producers chose actors and their skills to meet the role-playing needs of the box office powerhouse (an excellent example of Wayne Werner's character). I had to write this review ... Children are playing this for the third time in 4 days at dinner now. Good On a rainy day or late last night there is no movie "Nothing in it and I'm not bored".
