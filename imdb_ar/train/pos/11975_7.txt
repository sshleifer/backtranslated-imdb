Full House is a wonderful family show. However, after watching some episodes again and again, I realized that she was incredibly boring and seemed to protect herself from the outside world too much. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it is incredibly cheesy. It's not like I hate it, but do not see them again and again because they grow up fast. Perhaps the best season is the first. <br /> <br /> Full House revolves around the widow Bob Saget and his three daughters, D.J. (Candice Cameron) Stephanie (Judy Sweeten) and Michel (Mary Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife died, he needed some help. So, his best friend Joey (Dave Collier) and Jesse (John Stamos) go with them. Once they lived there together they found that they could not live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you of the importance of family and that you can always go home again.
