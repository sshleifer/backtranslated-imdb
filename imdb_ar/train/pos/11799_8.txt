Summary cast well for a real event! Well, actually, I was not there, but I think that was the case. I think there are two obvious American attitudes in the film: "Communismophobia" and the like with Adolf Hitler. These must be obvious to most independent observers. However, Boothe performs well, as do many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the film is unbearable - I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after him is abnormal. (That's why it's terrible - everything happened, and maybe it looked like that). But, in fact, did this last scene happen at the air station?
