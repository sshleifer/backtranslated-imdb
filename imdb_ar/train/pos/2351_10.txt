First, I would like to point out that the inability of the average user to appreciate the imagination is appalling. What makes this exhibition unique is the excessive reality it creates. You do not need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead, or why it can be for just one minute. Where did the admiration of strange childhood tales, such as "wrinkles in time"? <br /> <br /> I say it is refreshingly original because it is a pole opposite the masses of ordinary television leaves no room for imagination or wonder. <br /> <br /> It's good to add a little escape to the TV experience. <br /> <br /> Excessive reality is my favorite part of the program. The environment of the fifties of the last century, and the innocent and rare characters, landscapes and physical not intended to be taken as a real reality. <br /> <br /> This show hides the deadly nature of death, while the other embraces it. While amusing, other television programs have taken the back shelf of the series. She really regained the curiosity, imagination and wonder in television. <br /> <br /> Daisies were pushed quickly to the top of my list.
