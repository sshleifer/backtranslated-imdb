I saw this movie in a very strange way - I put it on my Netflix list and could not remember why (otherwise I knew that Philim Seymour Hoffman was there). Since the film has no opening credits, I could not even remember who took it out. <br /> <br /> As my wife and I watched, I turned to her for about 45 minutes and told him, "You know, I still want to decide that I hate this film, but something around him will not let me stop watching it." There are nearly half a dozen scenes in the middle of the film that are truly reflected in actor performances. <br /> <br /> I realized that Sydney Sydney was to Lumette when they included end credits only. Movie. I thought - F. I'm surprised that Lumette took over what was really a dirty little story about really broken people. But this is a testimony to his talent, where I was touched when I did not realize it was. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good in this film. Like a good scary. Put this in front of Capote and I would argue that the Oscar had to be for this film instead. <br /> <br /> I also highly recommend the narrative feature with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talking about the film industry - it's entertaining and educational, with Hawk playing a keen student to learn at the Masters' feet. Lumet certainly teaches you the first rule to work with actors - kissing their donkeys constantly !! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of violent and melodramatic movies that are there empty zeros when everything is said and done. An element of this film - that actors fill the air with sulfuric bursts of emotion, and when smoke hides nothing remains. Nothing resonates at a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us a network and 12 angry men - films that were each uploaded in their own way to the highest levels of cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at this level. But there is something about it that still exists. Maybe that's enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment concerns the comments - if you look at the comments on this little film here on IMDb - and the depth of the comments and their intelligence, the pro and con - it's a good sign that something special is happening with this movie.
