When this film first appeared in 1984, Prince was one of the most exciting works. Everyone wanted to watch this movie, which was nothing more than an extended music video. The acting was very bad, but what do you expect from the musicians who are acting on the big screen for the first time? However, it was still a very entertaining movie! Maurice Day and Jerome Benton offer some classic comedy all the time, especially "The Password", which makes you think of Abbott & Costello performing the "Who's the first" baseball routine. <br /> <br /> Appolina (who was presented as one after that) introduced some beautiful breasts, so you had a brief nudity covered. Plus they are very attractive. Of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best songs ever recorded. Lens later had repercussions with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time of his career, he was at the forefront of his game. <br /> <br /> This film does not rank first among everyone in a large category of time, but it is very entertaining.
