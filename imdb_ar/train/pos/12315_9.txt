This is because this movie is a wonderful entertainment and contains little of everything in it. <br /> <br /> It may be very scary for young children but my 15 year old son thought it was great in every way from action, humor to even the degree of fine music. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they will watch them regularly and now that this is finally available in the UK, definitely add it to my collection.
