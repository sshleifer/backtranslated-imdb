This film reinvents the term "spring season". Hans, a member of the group, presents his talents to such generations as Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "The King of a $ 1 Bet", shows that he is no longer in Kansas anymore by increasing risk. Kyle laughs really hits and offers a little candy to the ladies as well (Matt). The dwarves, while their moments, did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance as it deserved. Finally, our protagonist, Ed. It gives hope to all of us grumbling, stumbling, passing, pale, still looking for someone special. This hope, is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. Although these films have missed the theaters, this is a must for rent, where we can all relate to one this spring.
