Whenever I saw Nicholas Cage, I appreciated him as an actor. By watching this film now (in 2005), I can see that it does not really fit the genre of films that appeared in the early 1990s. I do not really think that it can be considered a noir for the film, but it is sometimes too dark, mostly due to the lighting and individual characters of the characters. <br /> <br /> Typical performances for each of the three main performances are actors, who did a good job with their roles. I thought, however, that Huber and Boyle had been left without development, where it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is his love or hates kind of man. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts very unrealistic, there were parts I had to deliver to the director (ie when he saw the sheriff first). All in all, this film deserves to be seen for sure. *** 1/2
