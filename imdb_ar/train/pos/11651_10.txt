When you kill friendship, in my opinion, it is a very moving and sad drama about the consequences of being anorexia or bulimia. At any time Lixie (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton), I wanted to vomit from myself. It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative in things. However, I enjoyed seeing them doing things together as they brought their parents. Before I finish this, I would like to say: "If you ask me, when a friend really kills how anorexia or bulimia can affect someone's body." I have not seen it. You are in some tears and the right time, so next time on TV, kick with a friend and watch it.
