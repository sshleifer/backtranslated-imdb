I saw this film and heard the writer and director Juan Gerrard speaking at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I know about this is that it was an eight-year story - a great boy at the time of the 1958 Cuban revolution and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> His opening scene will see "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "clueling chicken" (Rebel without a Cause), and references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; The homeless man (George Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore, which often uses a black man as a sort of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What really represents this film is the culmination of the dream. Gerrard wanted to honor his family and his medium of films that I loved throughout his life. <br /> <br /> This is the real story of Juan Gerrard and all the people are real, as are the events depicted. Gerrard is actually an architect and engineer (and lover of film lovers) but his dream was to produce this film. He and his wife decided to live this dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce it and star it. Keitel carries the screen as strongly as his mysterious and mysterious "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the film. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the first half of the film suffers from strict delivery of lines, some outlines, but stay with them. The latter half is much better where the events of the revolution gather for bittersweet, honest. This is the first effort of Juan Gerrard, but he is sincere as he is, his passion and his heart really, in this first sincere effort. I will definitely see her again, and I hope he will continue his film career. <br /> <br />
