I really thought that this movie was wonderful. Not only is the date correct, but the style is luxurious and intimate yet. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrayal of Victoria and how she maintained her spirit even though she was forced into virtual exile during her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and doctrinal way in which Vichotria is known (perhaps notorious). The romantic elements of the film are so authentic and tender that you at the end of the film really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are worth noting as well. I appreciate the beautiful result, which moves wonderfully alongside the drama of the story. I also thought that cinematography was wonderful, as some scenes left me mercilessly because of the fertility and magnificence that I imagined. <br /> <br /> There were very few films this year beautiful and beautiful like this movie and its rates as one of the best 2009!
