The Last Hard Men finds that James Cobren is outlawed and is serving a long prison term free from a serial gang. He and his friends go to the Mexican border of prison and safety. They did not because Cobran has a vengeance. To kill the peace officer who brought him and in this process killed his wife. <br /> <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Hyston now retired and knows what after Cobran. While explaining to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was hiding in a hut and was involved in a confrontation like Wako. An Indian woman was killed in a barrage of bullets. It's not something proud of him, she was a side-casualty in a hunt. <br /> <br /> Lest we feel sorry for Coburn, it allows us to know very well what a really evil man is. Heston is his usual strong hero, but James Coburn honors acting in The Last Hard Men. Puff out everyone off the screen when it is on. <br /> <br /> Coburn gets a bright idea to make sure that Histon follows him by kidnapping Hershey and transferring her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heiston should make her personal. <br /> <br /> The Coburn band includes Morgan Powell, Thalmos Rasulala, John Quad, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. He has Chris Mitchum along with his son-in-law. <br /> <br /> The Last Hard Men is a bad and evil western one. Andrew McLaughlin directed it, and I think it might have been a project originally dedicated to Sam Beckenbo. He certainly shows much of his influence through the liberal use of slow motion to highlight violence. Of which many. <br /> <br /> For Peckinpaugh the Little, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
