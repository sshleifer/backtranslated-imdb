Sentinel is a movie recommended by my parents years ago and I have seen it several times since. It is always able to entertain me, while it is also crawling effectively. Flashback scenes are what make it a reality for me. Christina Raines's father ran a crawl, with the two crawling women, always able to send chills. It's good for something nasty, but at least it's capable of entertainment. The end that I consider one of the best in the history of horror. She has a lot of shocks and suspense, seeing Meredith Burgess doing what he did on behalf of Chazen, made me on the edge of my seat. The keeper has a perfect build-up of tension. We never feel comfortable when Allison is on the screen. We know that there is something terrible that is always waiting for her, which made things more tense. This movie is often neglected among horror lovers, but I personally think it is one of the best movies out there, and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Shows. Christina Rains enjoyed her wooden moments, but she came in most of the time. It's beautiful to look at, and its chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon is awesome as her friend Michael. He had an instant screen, and I could not help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jose Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Silvia Miles, Deborah Ravin, Jerry Auerbach, Richard Dreyfus, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Beringer are all memorable roles. Bourgas Meredith is as wonderful as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we have discovered is very frightening. Ellie Wallach, Christopher and Lincoln do a good job, like the petty investigators at Beverly D'Angelo, one scene that is chilling and will not spoil it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Sentinel is an effective horror film that fans of horror unfortunately love. It will give you the excitement and fear you need to be satisfied. deserve watching. <br /> <br /> 7/10
