Well here's how I do this. I grade films on 10 components. Each component will start by 5 points. You can lose or get 5 points against 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - Give this component 10 points. He had an ideal balance between all five aspects. The work was fun and outgoing. Romance was not overstated, but still very emotional and animated. I laughed hard and long during the film and still fascinated by the wonderful drama and the thrill. <br /> <br /> Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all good fairy tales had already been told. I found myself sitting in the theater, back to my childhood, and at that moment I thought again of the loneliness, evil sorcery, and falling stars that made dreams true. <br /> <br /> Cinematography - I give this component 8 points. While the film took the story well in most angles, I found myself more than once trying to discover what happened outside the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I love they used C.G.I. Frugally. The epic scenes were reasonable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less, that was all! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and both seasoned actors and the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was superbly evil, and Charlie Cox Tristan was alive, and Claire Danis was sympathetic to the stars, and I would never see Robert de Niro again. <br /> <br /> Acting - Give this component 10 points. Even the novice actors played their rolls to perfection. Again, I will never look and Robert de Niro himself again. <br /> <br /> Personal Development - Give this component 9 points. It felt a little rushed and I think that if the film was a bit longer it could have given the characters a slightly better justice. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - Give this component 10 points. The dialogue was intelligent, intelligent, fun? Even Harissa had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Outcome - Give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire film. I do not complain about the fact that music can be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Finish - this component gives you 9 points. The end is almost perfect! I feel that certain aspects of the end should have been clearer, while other aspects could have been quieter, but no chains of letters were left without strings. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy a DVD? Hill Yes! See that in the theater? Certainly! Bottom line: Excellent movie for everyone! The Melhem! I highly recommend seeing him at the theater, I know I will be back for a second!
