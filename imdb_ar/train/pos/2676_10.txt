Every day we can watch a large number of soap movies ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle occurs. Wonderful film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realistic director. For me there are two things everyone needs to watch: The first is Bakula? "Choosing Sophie" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As humans, we need to know humility, love others, accept other civilization, and other way of living. We must also fight racism and fascism. We must avoid judgment and criticize. We just love our companion Earth. This wonderful film helps us reach John Lennon's dream: imagine all people living in peace. It's hard to see these two films: Watch these movies, but make sure you're hurt, but better. Fantastic movie, wonderful actors, awesome story, guarantee for pain and crying, but also a better understanding of others. enjoy it.
