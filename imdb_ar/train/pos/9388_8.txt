To a large extent for the readers of your supposed Happiness Fair, he met Cage and Huber and fortunately not in the film Lynch? Because RED ROCK WEST is better than any Lynch movie. Nicholas Cage third rate representative, Babe Porcelain is an alternative killer woman, only Papa Hopper is as he was ever. RED ROCK WEST is, despite a vulgar team, one of my favorite American novels; a word, a thriller with some transitions. <br /> <br /> One notes mainly the joystick, the remarkable pace, the excitement, the pleasant thrill, the delicate narrow ass of Lara Flynn, the ugly physical shape of the ugly Cage, with the features of sharp birds, thick eyebrows and delicate thin hair, A good year ?? Lara in the middle, Cage seems to roam, a dark walker in Noir Cinema, hungry, cruel if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle plays the glamor in the cold, and she and her husband have no heart, and Huber as a man hit Lincheen before. <br /> <br /> Cage seems really eccentric or dizzy or very confused with heavy waste. But this may have a regular look.
