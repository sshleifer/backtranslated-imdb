This reminded me of Spinal Tap, at a more serious level. It's the story of a reunion band, but things are not harmonious. I was especially impressed by Bill Nei's performance as Ray. I felt sorry for him, yet he had some creeping about him. It's a great movie you can watch if you've seen your favorite band get wrinkled, old and pathetic.
