When I went to watch this movie my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I would watch the boring flick, but in fact the plot was exciting and well executed, the acting was rather convincing - especially from Melville, who showed his talent in this film, and the scenes of fighting - for a low film The budget - very well. <br /> <br /> I think this film deserves a wider audience than it received. It's a movie you can see all the family - maybe not the smallest children, because it has some harsh scenes. A film about love, problems that can occur, when inconsistent with your family's traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very much like "Bend it like Beckham", but I think that movie draws it a lot.
