Drama is very good although it seems to have some empty spaces leaving viewers to fill the work themselves. I can imagine that life is this way for someone who can not read or write. This film simply shocked the real world: the wife suddenly became the only pro and living relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who knocks, and then, usually, leaks out of school, a husband gets angry nest egg and buys beer with her. 2 Excellent.
