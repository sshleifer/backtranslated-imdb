What happens to rock and roll stars in the late 1990s? They launch a return / reunion tour. At least, that's what Strange Fruit, a rock stadium group, does in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rhea) has concessions on condom vending machines when he runs over the promoter's son from the famous music festival. At that festival in the 1970s, exotic fruit collapsed. The 1970s are "old" and the time is right to expand that wave. He started looking for other members of the band. <br /> <br /> Part of what has separated the band is the death and replacement of Keith, the lead singer and great songwriter. The band became famous for its over-life, and now they all returned to the working class from which they came. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was fantastic in Secrets and Lies), is a serious player, the bus operator is Rover, and still the main rock singer. While he owned a huge palace, he had to sell it, because his wealth was short lived. Matt Bryan, the main guitarist, was appointed as the young guitarist to replace him. <br /> <br /> The band agrees somewhat reluctantly to the reunion attempt. By abandoning their day-to-day jobs, they begin their exercise, and their manager deals with their signs about re-releasing their albums. But he wants them to start touring again first. They hit the club circuit throughout Europe. The club scene is not nice with these ancient pioneers and historians. <br /> <br /> It's on a tour that the film begins to evolve. All the old conflicts are escalating, with the characters of Keith and Brian moving. They are all screwing together because they are all looking for a second chance for the greatness that they had previously felt. They rediscovered some of the personal chemistry that made playing together very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy starts in Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a dramatically more dramatic film, after the band members' relationships. Although it is still a very funny film, only the sophisticated characters that struggle to deal with the death of Brian and Keith and with their own demons are making the film work.
