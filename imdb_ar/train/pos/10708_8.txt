John (Ben Chaplin) is a single banker living in a small town not far from London. Despite the Internet, he is contacting a Russian bride agency. Sophia (Nicole Kidman - the man can be lonely and shy, but certainly has a good taste, does not he?) When they met each other, he realized she did not speak English. Communicating between each other is mainly restricted to sex (again, imagine, what a terrible attitude for a man, just fucked strangely with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends visit them. Then, a lot of surprises will happen. I liked this movie: First, it is almost impossible to be categorized. Is it a black comedy, action movie? I think all options are correct. Nicole Kidman is fantastic as usual, and I am very curious to her Russian: Do you speak Russian in a true tone, or is it just fake? Anyway, I found it a fun movie. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
