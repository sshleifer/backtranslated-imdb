"The Luzhin Defense" is a good film with great central performances, but much of the novel is not enough of the craft of filmmaking. I felt during most of the film that the characters only helped to push the story. Marilyn-Gorris may have studied Lozine's psychology, rather than portraying him as an innocent, tortured victim torn apart by harsh motives. <br /> <br /> Clearly, adapting literature on the screen is a difficult task, especially a written novel in the early 20th century. This film does not deepen the relationship between Lozen and Natalia. Natalia was shocked with her mother's cruel encounter with the mother instead of an exciting point in the film. I felt that I had experienced Lozine's torment and ultimately tragic ending, without the pleasure of collapsing his complex and complex personality. However, this film was impressive and enjoyable but certainly not a great movie.
