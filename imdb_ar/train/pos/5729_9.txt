This is something of a puzzle for many of Lynch's artistic crowd. They tend to try to write off this as a kind of side-by-side project by Lynch's. Like this Lynch is going through the gas between his real pieces of film art. Well, it may be a fart, but one of those interesting branches that you catch from a whiff and feel embarrassed to admit that you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Dumbland distilled down this is art. What you can do with aspects of modern life but laugh at. If you take it seriously you'll go nuts. You can link them, smell them, taste them, sense their pain, their unreasonable stupidity, and then express them by any means you choose. Which is called art, art is not stupid. But this is Dumbland.
