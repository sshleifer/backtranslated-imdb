I still love it though. Warren Betty is just like a comic book hero. What saves this film is the group, the amazing cast, which produces a modest text. I was really expecting something more important in terms of work, or plot, but I got very little. The main reason for watching this movie is watching some of Hollywood's biggest stars at the time in such an extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the only person who did a terrible job and did not belong to this movie. She did not belong to this film and her acting job was very bad. The film in some points just remains. I was expecting something more and did not get anything. Al Pacino plays really bad dude and he does well. He and my house do not make a good man and a bad man. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to watch Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthar. I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things. The thing in this film is that it is good, but it could have been much better. I loved it as a child because I thought it looked great, a wonderful film, incredible collections, fair writing, and with such a film in the film, I expect the situation to be a bit better. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I think in particular that the end was not big enough. It was interesting, but for a big movie, I thought it could be a little over. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. The movie uses only seven comic book colors, making it more visually excellent anyway. <br /> <br /> Fashion and makeup were also flawless. Facial makeup for the bad guys was great. My home is not just a bigger figure than a life figure. Still, this good movie could have been much more. For me better than Batman, another comic modification of the book was released soon from the same time. Of course this film was much larger in terms of gross.
