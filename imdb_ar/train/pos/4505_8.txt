Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural divide between the Aboriginals and the white men of abuse. Although it was apparently filmed with non-professionals, the Eskimo is a skillful production that has a believable story that the audience wants to see until the last shot. <br /> <br /> The original Eskimo has different beliefs, simply the behaviors of women and life, from whales that darken their landscapes. When an Eskimo man loses a mate, it is normal for other men to share their wives with their friend. It is also common for her women to want to replace the missing husband. All this seems natural in the context of the abandoned Arctic environment. The Eskimo, who trusts himself as prey to unscrupulous white whale hunters (in heavy European dialects), does not view these citizens as equal. Deception, drunk drunkenness, rape, and death occur after the men leave the Eskimo to work in icy cold seas. Eventually the Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been deceived and is avenging him. The audience would sing in theaters in 1930. <br /> <br /> The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of whether money should be brought back to trial. The mountains are played in the sense of the police who know that this is not dry and dry condition. Will the mountains get their man? Is it fair to stick money with a code of conduct outside of its traditional society? Is there a way out that does not punish money? Is it imperative that the law of the white man prevail? Is there no hope of innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but it's a movie you'll enjoy to the depth of the problem being dealt with in a completely different environment. I think that filming sequences with animals has been done before today's disclaimer that no one was hurt in the film industry - so beware of the raw nature sequence. Highly recommended.
