One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Ch치vez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, and his support came largely from Venezuela's poorest regions. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, Chavez's coup was briefly overthrown. At the time, Irish directors Kim Bartley and Donacha O'Brien were in Caracas, filming a documentary about Chavez for British television. Their film shatters the coup and its aftermath, and records the dramatic history of life unfolding immediately, outside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez was aiming to free Venezuela from free-market policies imposed by the United States. Although Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was run for the special benefit of the executives Chavez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite being the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela is still submerged in poverty, literally absorbing its resources from foreign multinationals. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins by depicting Chavez's first years as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity with the poor, on its various policies that have proved popular among the local working class population (educational plans, distribution of oil revenues, grassroots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great supporter of education, printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan Constitution, and encouraged children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. This, conceptually, made oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private television stations immediately began opposing the state television station. They asked about Ch치vez's motives, his mind and his sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup would not have been successful. The film shows that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily manufactured. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of "re-establishing democracy," the opposition silenced the state-run television station, dissolved the National Electoral Council, the Supreme Court and the National Assembly and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. The financial interests supported by the military elite (encouraged by the United States and the CIA) organized a march for citizens on the presidential palace to trigger the coup. Snipers fired at Ch치vez supporters, but private media stations released footage so that the fire appeared to have been aimed at the opposition process, which was in fact transformed. <br /> <br /> 12. The police launched a shooting attack against Ch치vez's supporters, resulting in more blood on the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, the prisoner, refused to resign. Of course the media / the government lied, saying he had resigned, but the members of the Chavez Council conveyed the truth to the international community, which finally sent the message back to Venezuela via cable television. <br /> <br /> 14. The people have been pressing for the return of the president they elected, who can only be replaced by a constitutional referendum. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - After just over an hour, this document is very short. However, it is a piece of interlocking journalism that deals with a form of "media war" that is rarely addressed. Make a great companion piece for the Battle of Algiers. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
