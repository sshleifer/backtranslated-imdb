In the colonies, we are not familiar with Arthur Asky, so I almost missed this film (which was recently previewed at TCM) because of the negative comments here on his appearance in The Ghost Train - which I had been expecting quite disturbing. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing aloud. The physical aspects of Coomy Asquay and his timing when presenting the line indicate what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen gave birth to a child. There is no comparison between him and Bud Abbott or any of the usual sponsors of comic convenience who attend films of this kind. Moreover, one can feel the thread that connects Askey with British comedy after 30 years; at least it is clear from the American point of view that he has a common denominator with the Monty Python band more than any of his counterparts here. As for the rest of the film - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you are to guess, but it's still amusing and a wonderful atmosphere and worth waiting for its next appearance.
