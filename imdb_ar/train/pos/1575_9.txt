The film van trotta rosenstrasse is the best film I've seen in years. I am really not really interested in films with a historical background, but with this, I won my attention for this time !! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the film was the scenes in New York and the impression that I was "trying to be as American as possible" ... and I think it completely failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the back have really reached my heart. German actress Katia Riemann deserves her award. She is one of the most impressive actress I have ever seen. In the future I will watch more of her films. Good luck to me because I am a native speaker of German =) and only for a year in the United States, and once I come back, I will buy some DVDs from Reimann. <br /> <br /> So for everyone there are people who have not seen this movie yet: Watch it !!! I think it will be a long time to describe what's going on around it, especially since it's hard to explain all the flash appearances and the keys of the times, but simply, you'll be amazed !!!!!!!
