Where the sidewalk ends (1950) <br /> <br /> where one ends, the other begins <br /> <br /> This is a typical film, and as such, flawless, of style points and content in the opinion. The first-class photographic and night-time settings (the cinematographer Joseph LaChel provides the opportunity for drama in scene after scene), and close to pure expressionists. I can watch this kind of film for pictures alone, even when actors struggle and produce the plot. <br /> <br /> But acting is first class here, and the plot includes what I consider the essence of most of the noir films, separate male lead (representing returning men to the United States changed after the war and feeling lost). In fact, not only is Dana Andrews really convincing as the only troubled investigator, he has a small but important counterpart in the film, the main female husband (first), and his ex-wife in Guy. The fact that a man kills the other may be of enormous importance, in general - the ordinary man who struggles with his internal problems for success while the medal-clad soldier slides into accidental death with a silver plate in his head. Women move from one to another - assume they marry and have children as previously suggested in the film. Even if this prompts us to explain this after the fact, we can still see the path of a man carrying some psychic bags concerned with a crisis to the highest level of moral order - surrendering himself to a small crime at the same time he has already gotten rid of him. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a more restrictive role and moves from the role of Kirk Douglas in a similar role in the story of Detective William Wheeler, which was made after only one year, Andrews is definitely less play. You can easily watch both movies side by side for a comparison of textbook and contrast. The fact that Andrews in the role of Detective Dixon is morally struggling through it all, and Douglas as a McLeod investigator, may explain why a man gets his girl and the other does. Jane Turney acquires a kind of highly sympathetic woman, who removes the flaws, the traditional and the ultimate "beautiful" - not just a desirable cartoon, but someone wants to marry Dixon actually. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is indeed secondary to the main drama, but it is effective enough to play with species and clich√©s. Snappy bit parts, small details (such as a portable litter table) are kept pleasant touches, away from character actors or the charm of gambling in Casablanca. Curtiz, however, is so creative, even in detail, that he makes no effort to be accurate, real, and penetrating, but instead he is sweeping, unforgettable and unforgettable. They come at opposite ends of the war and represent the opposite potential of their leading men. Bogart began his actual work, Dixon, the man who killed Dixon, all of it. Through, completely, but not washed. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that many film nouers have what they might call "happy" endings. The man overcomes his opponents and changes his inner self. The film director, then and now, realizes how beautiful he is.
