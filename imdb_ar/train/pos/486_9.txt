"Luzhin Defense" is a movie worth anyone's time. It's an encouraging film, intense, and kept my attention all the time. John Turturro is very stunning in his portrayal of the tender, grandmaster of eccentric chess, and Emily Watson is bound to spell as a kind and rebellious daughter of a very respectable Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is clear from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this film is one of the best in-depth insights into the Grandmaster's chess life, and Turturro and Watson add a totally uncommon and non-smiling sense to the film. Most people will come out of the theatrical thinking, and feel that they are somewhat influenced by this wonderful view of most love stories.
