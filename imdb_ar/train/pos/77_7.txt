The film begins with Vincent Price about to begin his performance as a magician. However, halfway through a very successful show, police come and shut it down. It seems that the old boss has been deceived by the tricks created by Price - even those he made in his time at home. As a result, the price kills the wicked man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why Bryce was killed and probably thought that was a good thing, because Price was rather angry, he could not stop at one point (like eating Lye chips). <br /> <br /> The movie was full of creative and very amazing magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a burner), as well as fantastic plot tricks and exciting movement. One thing you can not say about this movie is that it is boring. Although it is not far from precision, it is fun all the time, but well worth a look. <br /> <br /> If I have not seen the Vincent Price version of HOUSE OF WAX, you might have liked MAD MAGICIAN very much. And recorded 8 or 9. This is because while MAG MAGICIAN is a great movie, it reminds us to a large extent of the film that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX has been a great success, the formula has been redrafted in the follow-up movie. The two are made in three dimensions, both of which have a scheme where the price has every justification to kill, but can not stop once the first is committed and both are very fun to watch. The biggest differences, there are little ones, are that the HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror film MAG MAGIAN MAGIC was certainly more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this movie and wax house (price version only). Both are terrific movies horror 1950s.
