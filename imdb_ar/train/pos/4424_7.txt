Although it is incredible, it seems that Gojoe is a game of samurai films inspired by cartoons and Hong Kong with a peaceful message. This ankle is depicted for the film effectively through the protagonist (the great acting post by Daisuke Ryu), the murderous monk who turned into a boddhist-monk Benkei. Benkei has never been killed again, but he still takes the sword to fight what he thinks is a demon invasion ... Gojoe is a difficult film to evaluate. Visual images are great and difficult to use, but they use a lot of tricks (circular camera, high-speed drives, expressive images, outstanding colors, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is somewhat tired. However, the beginning and end of the film with it elegant and powerful. If director Suzhou Ishi was just wise enough not to overuse the bag tricks. <br /> <br /> The other problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For the film that carries this anti-violence message, Jojo wastes a lot of energy and screen time to shoot endless scenes of battle. Also, the way in which violence is shown is always on the brink of self-indulgence; in fact, bathing with blood against the night sky seems to be a distinctive feature of the films. Fortunately, Ishi is wise enough to show the tragic ugly side of the violence as well. However, Ishii does not seem to be sure whether he is making a traditional film or a profound moral moral story. The audience can not be sure of that, until the end of the film. The strong (albeit sarcastic) ending is what keeps Gojoe; it clearly confirms that this film is more than just the Gore Festival.
