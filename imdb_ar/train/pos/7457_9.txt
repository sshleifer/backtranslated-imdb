This is one of the best bond games I have ever played because of: <br /> <br /> The tasks are very enjoyable to play as there are lots of actions that may be very difficult sometimes making them more fun the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this really good game driving missions are fun to do. This James Bond game has a good story to it. The sound across the actors in this game is really good and it is wonderful that Pierce Brosnan in this game and the way the characters look really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really fantastic. Also the graphics in this game are very good. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********* of **********
