I just watched this movie and I say, I was very impressed. It is very creepy and has many moments to make you jump out of the seat! I had to smoke many "emergency" cigarettes all the way to soothe my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that maybe there was anything, there were a lot of jumping moments. It came to the point where each new scene reached its peak with a leap, and this gradually eliminated the amazing effect, because you were a new kind of what would have happened. <br /> <br /> Although it contains almost every classy in this ghost type, their work has been so good that it has maintained a fearful fear factor. It contained elements from The Shining, The Sense Sense and The Changeling (in particular, The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for good old panic!
