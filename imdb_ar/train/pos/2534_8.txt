The world, which frantically works in isolation, finds a way to determine a meteoric impact nozzle that carries a new radioactive element. All the science and technology talks (phony) in the 1930s are there, including the idea that radioactivity can cure any disease if properly discharged. When he calls his rivals - who have been expelled from the scientific community and ridiculed him - to witness his discovery, they suggest a "joint" trip to Africa ... Of course they end up robbing a lot of doctors. Rokh discovered the original, giving him only the remaining credit. In addition, a weak weak who looks like a comedian supporting actor from the worst Abbott & Costello (Luton) literally steals d. The wife of Rukh the young cup (Drake), which lies upside down to those scraps of human. Having grown horns like deer will not make a dr. Rukh (Karloff) is a friend, so he begins a secret revenge mission ... Kill 2 of his opponents and d. Bennett (Lugosi), the only person who helped him ... In the end surrenders to the deadly radiation that allowed him to start retaliating for him but (to the extreme estrangement) to spare adultery and bad excuse for the human being she had married. He behaves pretty well, with Karloff & Lugosi being very good. Check out the hysterical room scene ... other characters are not worth mentioning ... recommended, like all the old Universal horrors ...
