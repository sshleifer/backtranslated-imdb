One of the best parts of the Sundance program is watching movies that you may lose without a doubt. Unless you are a fan of real art, you may not catch a lot of documentaries. Only a bunch get any recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare is a prominent successor to a strong documentary about a dramatic production group at Luther Laket Corrective Complex in Lagrange, Kentucky. Each year a group of prisoners present a Shakespearean play. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the band where the roles are chosen, interpreted, rehearsed and eventually acted. <br /> <br /> The film is full of wonderful verses for those of us who have not been exposed to prison environments. Despite the signs we already know (convictions, criminals, murderers, etc.), we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as they think about human feeling. Incidentally, the play that was chosen for the year of photography was The Tempest, with its supernatural focus on forgiveness and redemption. All actors struggle with the importance of play in their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary, like a book, the best thing you can hope for is to experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare behind bars was a personal revelation to me. "O brave new scientist, he has such creatures."
