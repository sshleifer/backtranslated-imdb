Carlos Saura Carmen is one of the greatest achievements in the world, not to mention Spanish cinema. It is capable of arousing interest in Flamenco in its brilliant adaptations of Bizet with strong physical strength. At the same time, we see the effect of creating and rehearsing a new interpretation of Carmen by the principal dancer / director and dancer. The line between life and art is wonderful.
