"Gandhi as husband and father?" It has always been discussed by people in India. "Gandhi ... my father" is a story that little is known about. Definitely an insight into Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the film for story and film. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah performed well. Most of the movie scenes will be pretty wallpapers for your desktop ... Mission is commendable. Traditional Indian folk music as a background in certain parts of the film gives a good sense of events. <br /> <br /> However, what I did not quite like was the narrative style. At several points, I found the tone exaggerated. <br /> <br /> In general, Anil Kapoor worked well. I would recommend it as a "must-watch-once". 10/08
