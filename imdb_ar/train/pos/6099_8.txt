I still have gravy, late at night, without cables, and the cheap VHS properties to offer from waaaaaayyyyy when, late at night, and all the announcements, when I kept up whatever the odd hour, they would slap this show - I could just register it . <br /> <br /> The series was not about Freddy Kreuger - just the first episode that actually included him as a Broadway announcer. Instead, each episode was a distinct nightmare, using the horrible horror themes of terrible childhood, history, cannibalism, history, money, death, history, and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> From an episode in which a teenage boy inadvertently says "I'll love you forever" to the wrong girl, stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, growing up together ...), to the hostess's ring He came to the house with a strange man, only to find herself in his cabin, where he had a room full of other hosts, and one that I vaguely remember, the comparison of the blind dates of hockey (and the injuries and punishments that accompany it) - dating was certainly the most terrifying of the series. <br /> <br /> One episode featured Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as an enthusiastic pizza dealer with a delicious new secret ingredient. Not original, but still creepy and fun .... <br /> <br /> However, some of the episodes were fantastic. My favorite was "It's a miserable life" where a young man working in the Burger chapter of his parents is trapped when he wants to go to college. Stuck to talk to himself and do small puppet shows with old burgers - until late at night when a strange man comes through the command and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, with a twist of arms - it turns out that each episode evokes the mind that - the last thoughts that pass through the child's head ... along with a bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the episode itself (many Fredes episodes of nightmares were basically two short stories connected vaguely) followed his girlfriend, who was also wounded, but was not killed in a passing car, The hospital is out of control "- are crammed into the most creepy nightmare clich√©s in the hospital, and then some - from snatching your mouth by chance - or waking up during the process - until your dead friend tries to seduce you and drag you into the morgue for a little hug. <br /> <br /> Again, that was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some episodes were a lot more stupid, as in almost all of the videos that were provided. They put the rich as actors for the series, and then no one liked them, thought the show was stunning, and then did not put more video. It's a miserable life available only on PAL DVD in England - but I'll still buy it.
