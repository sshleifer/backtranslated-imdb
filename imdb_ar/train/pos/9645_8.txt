"Presque rien" is the story of two young boys falling in love during a summer beachfront stay. I do not want to tell the plot, because it is not the most important in this film (but you can be sure it is interesting and innovative). The best part of this film is cinematography. The visual side of the 'Presque rien' is extremely amazing and deserves the highest score. It makes you feel enchanted by its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it appears in a rather uneven and complex way. There is no simple timeline and there are no answers to all the questions the film brings. But this makes "Presque rien" more interesting. I recommend this film to all people whose artistic aspect is very important and will not disappoint them.
