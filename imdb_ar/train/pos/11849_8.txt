Unless all of this animation is great. This film is classic because it has two simple aspects: story and character. The characters in this film are beautifully embellished. I felt all the characters, and the relationship between man and animal in the film works perfectly. Beautiful animation and three-dimensional animation did not work in any other film. It's a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero journey. 8 of 10.
