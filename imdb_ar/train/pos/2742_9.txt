Richard Brooks' 1967 film about Truman Cabot's COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion to Oscar-winning Oscar-winning filmmaker Philip Seymour Hoffman in 2005. They play well together (try them on separate nights). It is unusual to find films made 38 years ago that intertwine well. These really strengthen each other. Although different actors play the roles of the killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two blends blend well. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks' films is the weakest, they gave him a different name then Capote. I would suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN BLOOD COLD. Makes for a powerful experience!
