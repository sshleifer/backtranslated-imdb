The second part of "Why We Fight" focuses on Hitler's capture of Sudan Land and beyond, made of Neville Chamberlain and starting to invade Europe. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this series over time was propaganda in its day, and it has become a documentary film of information as well as the transformation of most of the "Allied Alignment" into a historical fact. The FÃ¼hrer raises himself alone with arrogant statements to his people and the world as he says something and does something else when his army moves eastward. The Czechs and the Austrians quickly surrendered, but the Poles launched a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. <br /> <br /> The disparity between the military power of Hitler and Chamberlain looms like the white flag of the Munich Treaty, and declares that "peace in our time" to this day has permanent propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, resonates with greater force as the darkness of the world war turns to Europe, leaving the American viewer with two options: freedom or slavery. In 1943, there was no escape from this simple fact, and the Nazis made their strike effective.
