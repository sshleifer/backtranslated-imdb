"The Good Earth" is a wonderful movie you've never heard of. There are many disasters and big events, but it is also a love story that is not emotional. All this happens in a little over two hours, which is short according to today's standards. Special effects and fashion are very good for time period. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Louisie Rainer was awarded the Academy Award for his specific role. She basically has three feelings only: submissive, hungry, broken heart. <br /> <br /> The presentations made by representatives from Asia and Asia - America are great.
