For the real film, this film is necessary, because it works as a small symbolic story ideal for the films themselves. Yannos Rukh / Boris Karloff is about capturing and displaying the light of cosmic phenomena. This light can hurt, or can be harnessed to do good. On the one hand, blinded his mother, on the other hand, is used to treat blindness ("I can see!" A little girl screams at this light). When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by himself because of the strange power of this light, we see him actually sending a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a very unfavorable negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a show, an entity on the film (visible only, Film theater, when the lights are turned off). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful passage near the beginning, where Karlov / Rukh explains that he is aware of the fact that everything that happens takes place in the light that travels through space for millions of years. The light from Andromeda emanated from that galaxy at the time Where the earth was still molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are clips in the film when this new flag is linked to ancient cultural vehicles: the character of the writer, in the character of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; religion, symbol in the sculpture figures on the local cathedral Karloff explosions with the projector / . <br /> <br /> One has to wonder here whether this film aims to take a look at what was happening in Germany at that time, especially using Riefenstall's film the previous year to promote a system that would certainly continue to do a lot of harm : Victory of will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in the end, the mother (Violet Kampel Cooper) intervenes to remind Janus Rukh of the First Science Base. <br /> <br /> If it was more movies that made you want to stand in the theater and scream: "I can see!"
