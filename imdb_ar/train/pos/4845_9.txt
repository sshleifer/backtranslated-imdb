Hello Playmates. I recently watched this film for the first time ever, and it is also my first experience with Arthur Askey, I must admit that I am very impressed with this film. As an admirer of black and white films in general, the passport to Pimlico, the tulip mob and Tommy Trinder (who seems to be far away), this film appealed for an old British teaser. I have noticed that there are those who criticized Askey's performance here, but in my opinion the test of time stands as a fine example of comedic representation for 40 years and if anything is added to the picture by creating characters rather than stereotypes that seem to dominate movies now. If I managed to get this movie, I recommend that you get it, it's a shame that these films do not generally appear on Sunday afternoon anymore. I am also pleased to have the opportunity to see another piece of Arnold Ridley's work (Pvt. Godfrey in my father's army). Thank you
