Although this critically acclaimed film was never shown in the United States on a DVD, another wonderful film, "Housekeeping" by Christine Lahti, was released in the same year. But if you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVDs, this should be the small masterpiece in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the Internet as well. Davis is complemented by a wonderful story, as well as unforgettable performances by her supporting crew, especially Claudia Caravan and the late Jean Adele. Surprisingly, or perhaps not, this movie and its stars were not recognized at the time of the Oscars, as did "housekeeping", but deal with each other - you'll be glad you did!
