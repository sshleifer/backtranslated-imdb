There are a lot of crap that came out of Hollywood recently. <br /> <br /> A friend, sending me movies again and again, as a surprise, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and could not stop watching, it's a drama, but with a strange twist. Imagine if Romeo, as in Shakibir, has a superpower. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take note of the new Russian cinema, telling stories not about big bangs and cgi. It takes a simple basic hypothesis and tells a story, without a scene. This is very much like an Asian movie with a dark Russian twist. Granted it was not perfect, but nothing at all. You know what power is but never explained, and do not fully realize until the end. It becomes secondary to the feelings of the story. I do not want to see a new version, it's very cool as it is, the Hollywood system, as usual, will scare it. Representation is top notch everywhere. The steering and camera work is much higher than most crap out there. Glory to all concerned, I will turn many people into this independent saga. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find i, see it.
