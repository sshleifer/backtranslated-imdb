My children happened to stop in this movie the other night, and when things started to appear, my interest really aroused. I had to go out for a bowling tour so I asked them to sign me on the DVR so I could see the rest later Well, I just finished watching it and the front of my shirt should be soaked after crying on the buckets. It was a wonderful film, although I almost felt the pain and the pain that these girls suffered. I did not guess in millions of years why Alicia was transformed from this beautiful girl into an anti-social gothic. Maybe that was why my shirt sank because I had the same pain as Alicia. I'm also what I was asking for this film, but I'm sure I'm happy with it. Very impressive, very impressive. Great for those who like good drama or tear shake.
