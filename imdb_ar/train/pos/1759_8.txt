I'm not sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, I'm not sure if it can be applied. In the last few years, cinemas have become full of comedy films that are so stupid that we do not smile. Films that do not meet these requirements are therefore considered "serious comedy". <br /> <br /> Does the 40-year-old Virgin correspond to this group? It's up to you in the end, but in my opinion, this is a very funny film. You have to laugh a lot, plus they offer social commentary through some really wonderful characters and attitudes. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure there's a virgin over 40 years old, and even people who do not fit in exactly the same specifications may feel specific by a character in the film, especially men. <br /> <br /> The story, as the title says, revolves around Andy, a shy, silent man who brings together the movement's characters and sees the survivor with his 80-year-old neighbors, whose favorite group is Asia. <br /> <br /> Cal is Andy's colleague at SmartTech. He thinks Andy will be mentally ill until Andy's secret is revealed. It is clear that Cal is sexually deviant but seems to have got what he wants from the opposite. <br /> <br /> David is an emotional man who is still in love with his ex girlfriend who escaped with another man. Jay, a man in a relationship seems to have been influenced by his constant deceit and actions. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of the young people between the ages of 13 and 21 have already seen this film, but it really does not have the age limit to enjoy it. So, if you have not seen it you will enjoy laughter, with social commentary, from going to your video store and the convenience of those deep independent movies and depression. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD Rewards that you'll really see from top to bottom.
