This was the eighth and final film of Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix who retired from films and would have died the following year. It is still an efficient thrill, the machine was completely turned off, but ?? There was something missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series have always been interesting, and sometimes fascinating, and the film has always been atmospheric, but not just the same as all of them hanging on the screen, as did Dix. <br /> <br /> The couple who go out for two whole weeks are willing to get married in the heavy rain but are frustrated when the potential bride first disappears and then discovers that she is already married before she gets angry. Has the potential groom been postponed, even when a private dick has hired him to find her suddenly shutting him down or weakening him, or is love blind? Who is twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is fine if there were a few nice moments of Lenore Ober in the following film at Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful as a loan from Boston Blackie. And also the only promenade where the whistler itself must be wetted from sagging in the rain, unless the sea foam is sprayed into the sound. <br /> <br /> Much has happened in this last hour, which is worth seeing again and again as usual for lovers of this genre like me. The Whistler radio series began in 1942 until 1955 displaying nearly 700 half-hour presentations, almost all available on mp3 and based on what I have heard so far almost all worth listening to as well.
