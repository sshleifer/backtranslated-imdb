This stunning documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of brave women in Cameroon's judicial system - policewomen, lawyers and judges. Despite the enormous difficulties - lack of means, extreme poverty of people, multiple languages, multiple legal precedents based on the country and the religious / ethnic background of plaintiffs and defendants - these courageous and powerful women make the difference. <br /> <br /> This is rare - it's a really inspiring film that brings back a little faith in humanity. Despite the horrors we see in the film, justice is not achieved by these diligent and diligent women. <br /> <br /> I just hope this film gets a wide show in the United States. For more people who see this movie, the better.
