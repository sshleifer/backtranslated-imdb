If you have not seen this great movie about life in the 1990s (at L.A), you've missed a special experience. This is one of the most surprising and powerful films ever about American life in the 1990s, but it is moving into today's world. It covers everything from child rearing, prejudice (over-the-way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc. The list goes on. This story accumulates to its ultimate climax, and when it does not matter anything else, it always returns to love with friends, family and love of life. It helps us to search deeply within ourselves and make us look for what we want from life. It makes us ask ourselves questions. Do we do enough for others, do we like this, etc.? ?? Relax and enjoy an emotional film that has been beautifully accomplished and I am sure others will enjoy it for life. <br /> <br /> Note the performance of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Klein and Danny Glover through this entire film. These actors are amazing and truly show the glow and true meaning of any message sent to us all. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after watching this movie for more than 10 years. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy the great soundtrack and do not forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly and try to figure out it's symbolic of the film? Hmmm ... I forgot that this is probably the serious Steve Martin I acting role in any film he has ever done. He also does an excellent job in this film. This may be a surprise to most of you. Relax and relax and enjoy a really good film industry .....
