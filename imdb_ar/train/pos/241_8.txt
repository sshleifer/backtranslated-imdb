I'm tired of judging people for "historical accuracy." It's a movie! The writers and directors are supposed to put their own role in the story! There are a number of completely inaccurate films with history .... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans .... If you want to see a few older actors doing what they do better, I suggest you see this movie and do not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, and the story of one of the greatest actors of our time.
