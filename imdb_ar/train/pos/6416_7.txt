The men of honor play a leading role in the Cuba Gooding Junior Championship as a real diver, Carl Bracher, who challenged the Navy to become the first African-American marine diver. Sometimes he was beside him and sometimes his opponent was a man who really impressed Carl Bracher. His name was the President of Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro). On Sunday in many ways paid, aggravated and helped Carl to become the man who wants to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this film. His portrayal here is as liberal and powerful as Denzel Washington in Hurricane. Through every scene we can see his passion, motives and goals to achieve his dream. We can see the struggle within him as he begins to make his father proud. I also liked how the director performed and raised a lot of tension in some of the main diving scenes. Encountering a brasserie with a submarine during a rescue mission is heartbreaking and wonderful. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I can see is the support team. The characters of Cuba and DeNiro are very complex and exciting to watch. Which makes you a little sad when they have to press their heads with such supporting figures two-dimensional. Evil lieutenant. Hanks, the Sunday wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric diving school colonel (Hal Holbrooke) and Cuba's love interest are the characters who discovered that I did not have much depth. What could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was more time to develop them. Why was that Colonel always in his tower? How was Sunday's wife very bitter and always drank? <br /> <br /> There is another strange question that must be this. What happened to the wedding of Carl Bracher? I mean, if this film tells the life of this man, will not his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's just me. The men of honor, however, is an ideal example of victory and faith that encapsulates the human spirit. This film will inspire and feel the conflict of this man. Which I think was the reason for telling this powerful story. My hat explodes for you Carl Bracher. I really admire your power. <br /> <br />
