Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! I have never seen a documentary film about globalization until I saw Mardi Gras: Made in China. This film has no novel and combines real footage and sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China living within a factory complex. They play with toys, jump rope, and dance. However, most of their days and nights consist of work, work, and work - but the footage of their work is bright and amazing to watch. The owner of the factory in China is surprisingly open, so much so that he hits the effects of globalization at home while "punishing" the workers. After the Mardi Gras beads stretching from China to the Carnival, the film reveals how the local is connected to the world through humor and interesting and interesting footage from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the cultural introduction of factory workers and senior Mardi Gras to each other through photographs. Here, the movie comes in a full circle and shows how the images can be a touch point and turned. The film is not a preacher at all, does not move guilt, and allows the view of everyone to attend. In the end, we - viewers - come to our own conclusions about the complexity of film and globalization.
