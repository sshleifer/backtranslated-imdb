Before watching this movie, I thought this movie would be as great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was the last movie Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong I had seen before. As far as sex scenes are concerned, I was disappointed, I thought that the sex scenes in Dreamquest would be as fantastic as the Flashpoint sexual scenes but I was disappointed. Except for the sex scene in Asia Carrera, any sexual scene in this film does not make me feel good (you know what I mean). Great Jenna Jameson does not do this kind of sexual scenes for what she can. Felicia and Stephanie Swift, both young girls disappoint me as far as sex scenes are concerned. <br /> <br /> Although it is an adult film but if you leave aside the sex viewer, this movie is very good. If typical adult film standards are involved in this film, it certainly raises adult film standards. Story, acting, direction, groups, make-up, and other technical things for this truly wonderful film. The actors of this film did a really good job, they all did a great job. Dreamquest certainly increases the quality of adult movies.
