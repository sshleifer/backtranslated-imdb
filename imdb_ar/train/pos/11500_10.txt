If Mulder is looking for his real father here, he is Darren McGavin, the first exe files, and it is regrettable that there was only one long season that the producers of this show knew they had a classic mode on their hands and in 1993 along came Chris Carter with Ma I call it Night Stalker, X Files. Both will go down because the classics are my opinion, where the two move viewers to a level of experience that can only come once in a while, and in the years X should appear in Darren McGavin, where Agent Arthur Dalis is helping our favorite hero, Resolve issues. I pay tribute to the man who I think so, well done Chris Carter show a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if you did not watch the X files and this special show I never knew about the night stalker.
