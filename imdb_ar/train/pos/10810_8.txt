Very good done film. Do not stay in your memory. The best described as the romance of flying or war, so that the flight parts realistic and virtually error free. Airline enthusiasts like me will enjoy this movie even if they are attracted by airplanes, unless they have any sensitivity or have never been in love. It is good and exudes charm. His reading of the High Trip is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Boom
