When John Wayne filmed the Alamo story he built the whole Alamo group in the city of Brytsville, Texas that still exists and attractions. As long as this exists, we will have a set for future Alamo interpretations of the screen. One of these films with Dennis Quid and Billy Bob Thornton has been in this century. <br /> <br /> But I will say that the Alamo: Thirteen Days of Glory is the best Alamo story filmed. John Wayne is a good film if it is overrated, but John Wayne with the redesign of the story to fill John John's character traits. Brian Keith plays the role of Davey Crockett here and provides a great explanation for the volatile border personality. <br /> <br /> It is much closer to Professor Lone Tinkell's book about Alamo from Wayne and he read the years of the book before I can testify. Tinkle's book was listed as a source in both films, but Tinkle was alive at the time when the film was finished and Wayne was not satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was about the right age for young William Barrett Travis, the ideal fighter for freedom who by the way was a slave. Again in the day no one saw the cynical contradiction in that. The only thing unexplored was not Travis's excessive sex drive. Casanova was in the southwest, so he kept wonderful notes of his anomalous invasions. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets the bleach is Jim Bowie, played by James Arnes here. He was a hero in the Alamo to be sure, but his career against Alamo was obsessed with. He was a smuggler and a slave trader, and he was a con man everywhere selling land that had a dubious title. But his heroic death certainly replaced him. There is no hint of that in the Arness photography nor anyone else I've seen from Bowie on the screen. Of course he designed the knife Bowie, according to his specifications. This man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the main asset of The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is a complete depiction of Antonio de Lopez de Santa Ana, the president of Mexico who comes personally to quell the rebellion provoked by the North Americans who settled in Texas At the invitation of Mexico. Unfortunately, these Americans came up with some preconceived notions of freedom that did not go so far, at least for white people. Raul Julia plays the role of Santa Ana, who is still the most controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also the villain, but he was the best production in Mexico until a real reformer named Benito Juarez came. <br /> <br /> This film was the farewell performance of Lauren Green, who appeared briefly as General Sam Houston. Green was not my concept of Houston, it was very great for the part, Houston was in its early 40s in 1836, and it was not the patriarch of Texas yet. But within his limits, Greene does a good job. <br /> <br /> To see a romantic story about the Alamo story, see John Wayne's copy by all standards, but for historical content I highly recommend this film.
