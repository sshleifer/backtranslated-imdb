I love this show, it is sure to be the winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's time for our ass kick girl is not the nice kind. The cast is fantastic and all episodes have good plots. Everything was put well, and I thought more. To put them together it must take some time, because it was not in a hurry to just slap something together. It's a fantastic show altogether.
