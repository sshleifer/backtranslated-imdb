The performance of the Oscar caliber of Peter Falk in a written role of the Oscars. I loved the exact and balanced exploration of a long marriage - how often do we get it in films, where the film usually ends when the boy and girl meet? It is an adult film, a complex landscape through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife and son - how they adapt to each other in the past and grow through the story. Moreover, she has given me about 10 big laughs from the abdomen, and I am one of those people who usually sit carelessly when the rest of the audience laughs. This was one of the few funny films I saw. Great original jokes.
