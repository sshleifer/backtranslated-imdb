Rating E <br /> <br /> I have never had a Nintendo 64 but I have played several times. In my opinion with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I have played this game several times and good every time. If you have N64 and do not have this game you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side scrolling video games but the Super Mario 64 has a 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is a little weird but there are lots of things you can do in the game. You can play the role of Super Mario and once again you must save Princess and 120 Power Stars from Bowzer. You can do this in a three-dimensional environment. Super Mario 64 is a very enjoyable and good N64 game and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
