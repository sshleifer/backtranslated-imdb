"If Ned Kelly had been born later, he would probably win the Victoria Cross Award in Gallipoli." It was like Ned's Bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially the country of Victoria can be said as Ned Kelly and recognize it immediately. In Gerta, still a hero, the life of the city of Gerre depends on the tourism he invented, but in Mansfield they have not forgotten that the three policemen who were "killed" were from there. <br /> <br /> Many of the buildings he has visited in his life remain. From Old Melbourne Jol where he was executed, to his post office in Gerardy. The cell in which he is held in Grita is displayed in Penilla, and can be visited on the site of the Anne Jones Hotel and the station and even the records where he was caught in Glenroan. <br /> <br /> Evidence for everyone can be found in the film's events (except his interest in love) throughout Victoria and in police records and even in the Sash that Ned obtained to save Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is untrue, and what has been neglected would justify the actions of Neds. The horse that was stolen by "Ned" was actually stolen by Wilde Wright (the man we returned to the box after going out of jail). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported to be robbed and therefore could not steal it. <br /> <br /> Jerilderie's message is more than before. It is not a justification for self, but a biography of Ned, a scheme of what he represents and who was protecting him. So, go on and read it, watch the movie, and then decide what Ned was representing.
