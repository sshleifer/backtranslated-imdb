Gerard is a somewhat overly optimistic writer. He is also gay and Catholic subject to Catholic guilt and something of a fortune teller, or so it seems. On a trip to "Flushing", Christine was "tempted". When Christine discovers that her new boyfriend is a little of the hard trade that he fancied from afar he decides to stick to her. After all, the other sex forced his compensation. He then realizes that the three former spouses of Christine have all died in violence. Did Christine kill them and would he or her boyfriend Herman be the "fourth man"? Melodrama Verhoeven is an extraordinarily hectic mix of eggs with a delicious mix of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of sexual excitement and excitement for OTT and plenty of red. A lot of time seems like a dream and we can not be sure that what we see is real or part of Gerrard's imagination. The fun is to know that. Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely beloved figure where either Gerrard Kasper or Hermann the Ascendant means that we do not like to get to any of the men on them. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerrard's failure could not come soon enough. Great performance also, from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and the best Verhoeven film easily even to his wonderful film "Starship Troopers".
