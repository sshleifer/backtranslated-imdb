This film has a great representation, a great picture and a very strong story line that makes you really think about who you are and how you define yourself and how you fit into whether you accept to play a role or be liberated ... There are already excellent comments dealing with these aspects. I want to comment on the official setup of the film. Basically, it's two people on the roof. There is a unit of space and time, with two heroes, and the radio serves as a chorus. Many directors have turned the Greek tragedies into a film, and many directors have portrayed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but in my opinion, no great way out, like Ituri Scola, came close to the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies in the story line and official preparation. Masterpiece.
