The mind plot is about light like feathers down. But the advantage here is the classic rejection of the boy and girl we used to "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" are now absent. Instead of casual dating, the two dancers are former lovers Bec Becker and Cherie Martin, who have been in love for days since their dance. <br /> <br /> Of course, since you are a musician in the 1930s, there are problems in misunderstood romantic romance, flirtatious flirtation and a slight irritation from a subversive experience with ginger bicarbonate. Thus, according to the great tradition of diminishing financial resources, there is nothing better for the best Hollywood artists to make an offer. <br /> <br /> The impressive figures from Irving Berlin are scattered throughout the show. Top hats and evening dresses are saved directly to the finish, which remains refreshing change. Fred and Dagger out again for the charm of the world ... and the charm of the Navy. Everyone and everything again is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Pure classic absurdity at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we know that it must work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
