I have not seen this movie in years, so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember that I was thinking that this movie is a double Braveheart movie. It is simply more realistic and has more authoritative personalities. Ridb Roy seems like Rob Roy imagines that he looks like a chaotic, light-haired hair with simple clothes. Liam Nesson has a Celtic look for him. He looks like a Scottish and most importantly Rob Roby is a comparison that infuriated some people but compares it with Mel Gibson like William Wallace. Gibson is supposed to play a legendary man whom he described as a 6-foot-6-inch giant while Gibson was almost shorter than his foot. The story contains a little romance, conspiracy and a weak story. Does anything look like a brave heart? But instead of a film calling for "freedom," freedom and nationalism, we get a film that says honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting film. Much like a wrestler. The wonderful cast William Nixon is a very strong leader in this endeavor. The story is fascinating in how it deals with heroism and humanity. The scene in which Mary is raped as she walks outside the burning house with a look of real Scottish power, followed by the semen of the crotch in a state of extreme panic. This is something that the champion in Braveheart will never do. Overall this is an amazing and virtually flawless clock. Go to see him!
