Keep in mind that I'm a fan of this genre, but I've only recently seen this movie for the first time. How I overlooked all this time was a wonder to me. For me, this is a better film then "Non Hay" which he highly praised. It is a wonderful western with an excellent representation and a wonderful story. The DVD is in beautiful black and white with fantastic cinematography. If you love West or James Stewart, you should not miss this movie.
