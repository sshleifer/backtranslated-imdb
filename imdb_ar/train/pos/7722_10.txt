This movie contains everything, broken hero, beautiful girl in distress, noble personality with tragic drawback, and really wonderful robot. Forbidden Planet has maintained this magic over the years and has not lost its flavor with frequent scenes (although the sexual attraction of young Anne Francis helps greatly in this outcome). <br /> <br /> The filmmakers will learn about young Leslie Nielsen, who depicts handsome and handsome Commander Adams, although those of us who are fond of him in comedy roles may be slightly surprised by his appearance in a serious role. Walter Pidgeon, a distinguished and noble man, is also distinguished as a scientist with a secret identity. Other supporting actors deserve a nod, especially Warren Stevens as the stunning and resourceful "Doc" and of course the charm of Miss Francis, as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> This film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, no less. The credits are called "colors," but those of us who tried to link the old versions of Theremin will recognize the exotic and nervous wines that are sometimes used in the audio track. However, it lends to the strange and alien scene scene of the mysterious and forbidden world of Krell. <br /> <br /> Special effects are also very attractive. I remember my fear when I was young waiting for the next appearance of the invisible "Id" monster, and when I finally filmed in one battle scene, I was literally shocked at my toes in wonder and awe. The unmatched magic of art is exploited in the stunning scenes of the scientific complex Krell as characters make their way through various labyrinths and corridors, guided by the mysterious Dr. Morpheus. <br /> <br /> I remember feeling some jealous measure that Dr. Morpheus would have such a wonderful game in the form of Ruby Robot. The character of Ruby is very charming and in some respects looks more humane than some other characters. Viewers of follow-up programs such as Twilight Zone and Lost In Space will learn about the recycled Robby in some of these episodes, although I remember that he never had the original Robby character. <br /> <br /> I confess that I do not fully understand the intricacies of the plot until I am large enough to understand the various signs of Freudian psychology and the risk of unleashing the fears and anger that are usually present in anger, but we have trained ourselves, through will power, to submerge And control by adhering to community codes. Although the key to the story is evident as soon as it is revealed, it is still unknown (or perhaps deliberately ignored) by Dr. Morpheus until it is pointed out by the clear leader Adams, who forces Dr. Morpheus to confront evil within him. He still gives me goose bumps when Commander Adams pushed Dr. Morpheus down before the Kral machine that gave him superior intelligence, which opened the doors of flood from his consciousness to the power of the Kriel machine: "Here is where your mind was artificially enlarged, aware that it still lacks the ability On the operation of the Great Machine, but your subconscious has become strong enough. "Zowee! <br /> <br /> My favorite Forbidden Planet movie is likely to remain my favorite science fiction film, and it is still good for all time and classic for its carefully designed story, fantastic visualization and insight on the screen.
