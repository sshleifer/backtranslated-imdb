If you're a fan of a great author like Jim Thompson, it might be unnatural when your work is turned into a movie. This is not the case with Scott Foley's delivery of "Sweet After Dark". Classic Noir Suspected Sexually that follows closely and equates the original text. They are Patrick and Rachel Ward may be offering the best in their careers. Bruce Dern has always made him beat him. Like Thompson's, this film creates a dark and surreal world where emotion prevails over logic and the double-intersection is unattainable. Must see for all the great film lovers Noir. **** !!!
