I wanted to see Valentine's Day since I saw that Dennis Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they played in some of my favorite movies ever. When I saw Valentine's Day, I was amazed at how strong the story line really was. It kills me to see that their rating is low because it was not terrible at all. The actors and actresses played the fantastic parts and the way they ended was wonderful and cunning. Some of the scenes were unreasonable or a bit bad, and I admit in some small parts that it was a bit boring, but in general it was fun and fun without a stopover. She had a quirky story line of mind that made you guess the whole way and not worth it. I recommend watching this movie at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day because it is sure to save you a lot of cold. Oh, and do not pay attention to the trailer or evaluation, please, no ...
