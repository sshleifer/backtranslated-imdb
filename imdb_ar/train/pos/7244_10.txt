This is the only long film about the bridge world. The first 10 minutes found a bit slow, but then, the film became perfectly perfect in describing the professional bridge players and how they go to earn a living. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I do not think that the player who does not have a bridge will get the charm of this film. <br /> <br /> Some dresses are really beautiful, and it is unfortunate that the film is in black and white - I can only imagine its shape in color. The way of shooting media is very fun. There is no way on the Earth Bridge would be like this ever. <br /> <br /> Watch them as fast as you can, and tell your friends about them.
