ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old boy (acting very well) in football. He is directed by Malone's cousin the night before his big game in an adventure with many transformations and turns that include Jim's bags, a drug lord, some motorcyclists, some cops, some prostitutes ... and the film keeps us guessing which characters are on either side of Aspects of the law, what is the contents of the gym bag, and what gender. Parts of it reminded me of a LOCK STOCK and two of the smoking drums. <br /> <br /> To me, ROLL has enhanced three views I've seen before seeing ROLL. These opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it looks like such a wonderful place to spend a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in Australia. Filming in ROLL was particularly impressive. I loved the colors and the stylish lighting in many sights. <br /> <br /> 3. The Australian woman is hot!
