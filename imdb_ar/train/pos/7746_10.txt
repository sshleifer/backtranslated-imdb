Those who know the dEUS group, know the main singer Tom Barman. Take out this movie like creating music, it's a mix of everything. This comedy, although it is mostly ridiculous and ridiculous, is a drama, but none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least, and have no real goal. <br /> <br /> The film begins Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes of several people, some of whom have nothing in common, but will communicate with each other during the day and night. There are many key characters: the teacher who writes books that no one reads, a young researcher with a sick taste of death and his sister, an exhibition owner, two young men in constant contact with the law, a man working in a movie theater and two small women. Throughout the film, a man walks in the wind. All characters face their problems, with their families or friends or with life itself. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Antwerp and shows many beautiful stills of the city and harbor. Today's events are not easily explained, I would recommend watching the film simply, there is much to be described. But I can say this, Barman has excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not rock music really) to adjust the mood, especially as the concert is full of excellent music. <br /> <br /> This film is an experiment on itself, it will not leave you more wiser about life, perhaps just that you have to live it and do not waste it, or have any wrong moral facts. <br /> <br /> In short, see it, is definitely worth it!
