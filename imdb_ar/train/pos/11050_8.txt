Well, magic works in mysterious ways. The movie, which is about four prisoners trying to escape with the help of a mantra, written by another prisoner for centuries, was a mysterious film with a surprising ending and a lot of suspense. Even if they contain something of a play (almost everything happens in the dungeon) they were never boring and their behavior was good. According to the "cube" tradition, which I felt was besieged with characters and even criminal, some sympathy developed, only to change your mind through the twists and turns of the story. Some events have caught your eye and there has always been a touch of madness in the air. Overall an intense and entertaining and since I did not expect anything (hired by a friend), it was a positive surprise!
