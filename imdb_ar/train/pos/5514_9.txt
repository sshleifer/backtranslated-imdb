I watched the first part two days ago and today I saw the second part. Of course, the two parts are different from each other, so I shaken a little with everything I've just seen. I felt a consumer knowing the inevitability of Che's death; for me, the whole movie was flooded. I suppose this is exactly what Soderberg wanted to feel, and the inevitability that slowly develops for his death. The second part was very pessimistic compared to that, once again it was inevitable but in Cuba it was positive and Bolivia was very negative. No mention was made of the movement's policies in Bolivia, which it rarely encountered in an educational way. For me, the unforgettable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the prisoner and the more moderate talk with the Bolivian official, asking the official Chi for the farmers' failure to support his revolution. I did not think that national differences play a big role as they did in the Argentine-Bolivian conflict. I thought that Soderberg was treated admirably with the inevitable supply problems of the revolutionary conflict; how to get food without antagonizing peasants who did not have enough of themselves. I was struck by how difficult it was to try something as Chi tried. I think everything is timed; is there enough anger at the government to start the movement? In Bolivia there was not. Che realized the terrible echoes of the revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the film: if not now, when, 50 years from now. Very sexy and sexy thought. Make every effort to see it.
