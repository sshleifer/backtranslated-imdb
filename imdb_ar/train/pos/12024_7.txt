The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you do not have to see the original. Unfortunately this is also the biggest drawback. It was good to include a few original characters in the new story and see how their lives evolved. Sinclair as in the original excellently provides the best comic moments moments because it tries to deal with embarrassing and confusing situations but the support team is not as strong as in the original film. Forsyth is congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original
