I'm not tired of saying that this is one of the best political thriller films ever. The story is fictional, but it clearly deals with Kennedy's death. An honest and honest lawyer (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and carried out by one man, Daslo. Although all other officials want to close the case, he continues to investigate his team. The script is written tightly and fast and holds the tension to the end. The only part that deals with Milgram's experience about the authorities is (though not uninterested) a little misplaced. The ending sequence - an explanation of which is really Icarus - was partially filmed in slow motion and condensed by a Moricon soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
