This is an unusual and unique little West, made mostly because of its story about the unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and who puts it at one point or another in the film. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting movie to watch but not to be a real west too. The film was made in accordance with the usual "1940s / 1950s" style of western genre films, so fans of this genre should not be stopped by its somewhat unusual main hypothesis. <br /> <br /> Because Venice is actually the main drawing device of the film, it allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the film, all connected naturally and the story makes a whole circle at the end. Without this, the film was too chaotic to watch, because the story often moves from one dangerous event to another, with different characters constantly. How amazing they even managed to put White Erb in all this. But they are not really critical. I liked that the film and its story were original and how the film seemed to move from one event to another. The film gave some sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's also a very cool movie. I liked the settings used by the film and it seems amazing that this was actually the first western director Anthony Mann. Fortunately, he continued to direct more Westerners later, which often led to the brilliance of James Stewart in the lead. <br /> <br /> It was a great and bold choice to choose James Stewart as the main leader. He is one of the most successful and most talented actors in acting, so his choice as a cruel weapon seems like a strange kind. But Stuart is surprisingly convincing as a strong man and shows how diverse he is and how he can act as an effective actor. <br /> <br /> She also has some other amazing actors in the film, which are mostly unrelated to this genre. Shelley Winters plays the lead, as well as two well-known actors, Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis, in some small roles. <br /> <br /> A real Western with lots of traffic and entertainment too. <br /> <br /> 10/8
