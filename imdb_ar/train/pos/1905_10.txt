Quite simply, the coolest and coolest comedy movies of all time ... it's definitely listed in the top ten personal list. This one also gets a ten solid scale rating. The millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to take the mature path of life and avoids all the responsibilities required. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal companion Hobson (Gilgod) went shopping at Bergdorf Goodman and rushed to Linder (Minelli) for her petty thief. The chemistry of Arthur and Linda adds electricity to the rest of the film. There is a hilarious group cut abundant. In one of these scenes Arthur (drunk in most of the story) knocks on the door of the wrong apartment and receives deafening threats from the "human siren" ("My husband has a weapon!"). Geraldine Fitzgerald plays the role of Arthur in the ruthless love grandmother, Sir John Gilgod steals the whole show with his acidic looks (re-Oscar for this house), and Christopher Cross presents the theme song (Oscar Winner) "The Best You Can Do with it"). It is a shame the death of the late Dudley Moore last month (March 2002).
