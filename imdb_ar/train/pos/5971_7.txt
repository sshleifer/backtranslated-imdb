Skippy from Family Ties moves from Clean-cut to a metal kid in this wonderful film. The film seems to have been made in reaction to all the turbulent parents who claimed that metal music turned their children into evil or made them kill themselves - except in this movie a demonic dead star tries to come back from the grave (using Skippy's help). Although the plot is vulgar and vulgar, it is ostentatious (for example, the evil green haze that takes off the girl's clothes) and the soundtrack makes the film Farhana (and big). Of course, there is nothing like Osborne playing the role of a preacher asking what happened to the song of love :). Definitely a film about having a few friends in order to laugh well. While you are in it, make it a double feature with the Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there is a "wicked rock bomber" (as mentioned in the video box) a black leather digger killer with a margin. Must see for cheesy movie fans.
