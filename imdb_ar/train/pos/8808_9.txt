First of all, I have to present it to people who have gathered this thing together. 9/11 is a very sensitive issue. Making a film that is daring to be controversial about it requires a lot of courage. It is shameful, though not surprisingly, that the film was banned in the United States. <br /> <br /> However, I think the movie is awesome with a few weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian part, which is reminiscent of the work of Majid Majidi ("The Beautiful Children of Paradise" and "The Color of Paradise"). Like those films, the section shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a group of Afghan refugees in Iran. The clip is absolutely beautiful. The same applies to Sean Bean's clip which is also wonderful. But just as some of the footage is beautiful, others are very brutal. Alejandro Gonz√°lez Inarrito does a Mexican act just like Amoris Perros, who feeds the gut and does it as savagely as he can. Most of the section is a black screen with many sounds that run in the background. These voices of journalists were shocked at the crash of the second plane, those who contacted the house from the burning towers and left messages to their families, those who were angry ... He brings this with flashes of people jumping from the towers. A very difficult section to watch it and will not forget it. <br /> <br /> It may be very difficult to see some passages for Americans because some passages can be interpreted as "you are not the only ones suffering". In particular, the Egyptian and British sections not only say so, but run the tables and say how much suffering the United States caused to other people. <br /> <br /> I will also mention special passages from Bosnia - Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although the latter may look terrible in its place, in fact it is not). <br /> <br /> However, not all passages are fascinating and I especially mention the passage from Israel which, in my opinion, is very weak. Although the idea was good (the journalist is at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, his story is shocking because of what happened in New York, which many of us who live in countries at war) can recognize. This is a terrible thing, and this clip ends as the entertainment reporter tries to get some time to broadcast at all costs, a man who says he has seen and hopes he can go to the TV, while the soldiers and medics scream "because". The section failed to capture any drama of such a position. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see him, you should do so, unless you are conservative in this case, d better stay out you may feel offended. But if you are not, you may learn how many of us outside the United States lived on September 11.
