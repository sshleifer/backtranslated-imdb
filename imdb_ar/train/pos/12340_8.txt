There is already much to complain about in this film version of the Molnar Sufi play - Farrell looks good in his title role, but his readings are frankly stinky. It also suffers, in large part, from being the first film to use the rear projection. Groups look false. <br /> <br /> There are two strengths in this view, although the dialogue readings are lame, but the visuals are perfect. Rose Hobart, as Jolie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, where Joseph Cornell reduced the programmer EAST OF BORNEO just for her footage: adopting the elegant visual orientation of the original Lamford. Its great beauty and simple performance (although they are dependent) help to repair some damage to the sections associated with this film. <br /> <br /> However, one of the features of Borzage is the mysterious power of love, which is the treatment of heavenly passages that make this wonderful, from the arrival of the heavenly train to the journey to the "hot spot". H.B. The performance of Warner here, as always, is perfect. <br /> <br /> So here we have a flawed but very interesting version. I think the 1934 version of Lange is the best, as are the celestial scenes in Henry King's version of Carousel, a musical remake of a lighter. But I still enjoy this version very much and I think you should give it a chance.
