It happened in the movie "Shower" in the foreign films section of the local video store, which I have seen several times since its debut as a farce or comedy. After that, I got a copy of the purchase at an economical price and I am happy with my luck. "The Shower" is a story of three men, a father and two adults, each living with life changes as the world around them changes in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting aspects of this film. <br /> <br /> Besides the wonderful features of the local and Chinese colors that give the setting to this story, the difficult but untouched relationships between the only men and women involved in the story, all lie against the backdrop of the bathroom in the village. <br /> <br /> The story of the family goes from strange to understanding and made me happy because I knew these people. Add to the main story many small characters, pigeons customers, their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is a film that walks away from smiling and touching its warmth and humanity.
