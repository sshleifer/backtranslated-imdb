Spaced Invaders is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. I do not understand why this film did not get better critics, it's funny, harmless and delicious. I saw it for the first time, when I was 11 years old, and I really fell in love with it ... Two days later, I got it on VHS: - until today, I showed it to many friends, and they all loved it but nobody knew the movie before. I think this is the problem, almost nobody knows it, so no one can like it almost ... This movie has never had a real chance. It's sad that SI has a comedy like Monsters Inc. "Space Balls." Well, enough discontent - what I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh, watch it! Scum of the earth!
