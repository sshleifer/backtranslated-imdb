To all the miserable people who have done everything from complaining of dialogue and budget and this and what he wants ... Who wants to hear it? If you miss the idea of ​​this great movie, this is your loss. The rest of us who love this film strongly do not care about your opinion. I am a slender man who has seen thousands of films in my life, and this film stands in his own being, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely realistic account of what happened that night. It is the amazing love story that has been tried at all. I know that this is the sarcastic nineties and that the millennium has everyone in a state of confusion, but come on. Someone complained in this comment panel that he made a lot of money! How lame is this? I have delivered packages of money in every civilized country on the planet, the world's highest-grossing film. I will be next to the majority with pleasure this time. Well, you cynics, it's time to crawl under your rock again.
