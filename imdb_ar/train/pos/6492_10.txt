I'm not a very good writer, so I'll be brief. The World in War is the best documentary I have ever seen in World War II. I have seen different documentaries from World War II (not only English / North America) and this documentary seems to be the most complete documentary in World War II. I think he could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but he does a very good job covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / fair to all. It does not exaggerate nor diminish the roles of different nations. Contains many original footage, including colorful footage and numerous eyewitnesses (made in the 1970s when many were alive). She has great music and narrator. All in all I gave him this 10/10, because it is good. (I have not seen specials in a DVD version so I can not comment on those)
