First of all, I would say that Edison Chen is too hot and that Sam Lee seems much better than the former XD! This may be one of the most watched movies to date; it shows the background of the Cambodian style of poverty. Cambodian (Edison known as Bang) revolves around killing people in order to survive; I have done so throughout his life. The duty of Sam Lee (Wai) is to seize the Cambodian forever. There is a lot of violent work but it has a good story to it. The film shows conflicts between these two characters; they both hit each other like angry dogs. Go and see the PPL ... strongly suggested! (GO HK FILMS)
