PM Entertainment's production of this shot is enough to make John Wu say, "Enough already!" Of course, not quite as beautiful as Woo, but he accomplishes the exploitative task in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret policeman in the near future. When his wife is framed to kill the governor by a team that uses cyborg like him, it is up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson gets on duty as Van Damme because he plays a heroic heroine and his wicked villain Cyborg. Why did the Academy fail to notice that? Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, explosive vehicles (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shooting. I particularly liked the truck that fluctuates in the air before approaching the touching truck explodes. My little other favorite involving a girl in the neighborhood comes to perfection in her karate simulation without. It's just a chance to show some of LAWNMOWER MAN's cheap effects around 1995.
