The spoilers! Classic 70 sex litter! Swedish Gal (Helga) is what made this film so great. It was beautiful, but what really happened to me was the extent of her nationality. It exudes enormous amounts of sexual activity throughout the film. Her best sights were when she was motivating herself. When she was on the screen, she became terrified. <br /> <br /> Also, Dr. Julia (the sister of the neglected male focus in the film) was very visually interesting. Although most of the 12-year-old girls have mammals larger than Julia, she knew how to use the little she had and watched (especially those with a silk blouse and a black skirt) that attracted my attention mercilessly. I've also got a love of the leading scene where I stripped the bat from her face. I do not know if I've seen anything ridiculous at the same time. Classic stuff!
