One of Tarzan's best films is one of his most active films (and drawings). <br /> <br /> After one or more years of Tarzan, Holt asked Hamilton to get a wealthy friend from Safari to return to the Elephant Cemetery to collect ivory. His friend also arrives carrying the clothes and perfume that Holt hopes to use to retrieve Jane from Tarzan. Before they can leave Holt finds his map stolen and becomes a hard dash trying to catch an exploratory trip. When they finally take the thieves, they find that the entire party has died and they are surrounded. They have no choice but to fight their way and soon find that they are outside the pan and in the fire. Eventually, Tarzan and Jane appear and face more adventures. <br /> <br /> A notorious film is heavily censored to reduce graphic violence (even by today's standards, PG 13) and to remove all hint of nudity (there is a nude swimming scene for several minutes including Jane Full of nakedness, only recently restored). Obviously watch the restored version of why this movie was reduced by 20 minutes at run time for the TV. Due to its restored version, this film is mature, romantic, touching, full of motion, and anything else the film must have. It's a great movie by almost any standard. The best of all is the kind of film that plays well as a stand-alone adventure. You do not need to watch the first movie to enjoy it, but it's a movie that deepens the characters and features that were created in this original film. . It's amazing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> If there are any drawbacks in the film, the film may not have advanced in age. The rear screen is often very clear. Gorilla suits for many monkeys and some other effects are more unusual and unconvincing. But at almost every other level, this film is first class. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to yourself to see it. Make yourself a large pot of popcorn and crease it on the couch and let yourself drift back to a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
