It's a wonderful, western film about a self-interested man (Jimmy Stewart) climbing up to Clondike to get gold. On the way, he is upset by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntyre, who performs a wonderful evil performance), who objects to it. McIntyre threatens to be a dead man if he returns through his city, which is, unfortunately, the only way to return to the United States. The main part of the story revolves around the quiet town of Clondick Dawson, which is turned upside down by new residents of McInter. Ruth Roman, for example, who came with Stuart and his two companions (JC C. Felipe and Walter Brennen, who plays Stuart's best friend), builds a salon (Hollywood's front-house prostitute) and tries to run a town restaurant and hang out a place to work. It paves the way for McIntyre and his children to leave. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of this Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just a little smaller, with 99.9% making it very special without a sense of cheap reproduction. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country boasts a beautiful cinematography on site. The scenery is wonderful. Stuart offers one of his best performances (almost equal to his biggest success in 1954, the rear window). I suppose he can be considered a vulgar, because he starts alone selfishly and learns how to play this kind of existence in the end. However, played by Stewart well, he makes this character very human. And the world-class support offerings. In addition to those I mentioned, the wonderful French actress Corinne Calvette is very good. I must separate Walter Brennen as well. He seems to specialize in playing better friends. His relationship with Stuart is very moving, because at first he is the only person capable of taking any human out of a cynical man. The script is well written, and Man's direction is flawless. Masterpiece. 10/10.
