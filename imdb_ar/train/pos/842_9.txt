The Matador is a brilliant, dark and impressive melodrama that is shady and impressive, outperforming the mediocrity thanks to two serious and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, which was never the best here, and is always reliable Greg Kenner, who has played his best role here since then Jack Nicholson played gay neighbor in as good as he gets. A great plus goes to writing as well. Brosnan presents an intelligent and sometimes very bad dialogue with Gusto and the slow friendship between these two different people is quite convincing. The story takes some unexpected turns and keeps the viewer always guessing where to go next. <br /> <br /> Nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music, intelligent editing and non-traditional filmmaking are sometimes a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time do not know how to label the film. But this also thanks to a well written text that keeps the viewer (I am anyway) on the edge of his seat.
