Well, I'll go against this film. Being a fan of horror who have confessed to themselves, I sat down and did not know what to expect. After two or three minutes, I found myself scared (very rare). It is clear that the film has a small budget and is centered around the Charing Cross station but the films lack money and do not distract attention from the story. Yes, the story is a bit distant and does not explain itself very well, but The CREEP is a collective action and starts cutting down and cutting off anything that comes. Message for ladies! There are certain parts of the movie that must close your eyes in or at least across your legs! You will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> Everything in every movie is good and makes a difference to watching a good slash film that really frightens
