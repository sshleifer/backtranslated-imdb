Warning!!! Tons of dead giveaways! Do not read if you do not see the series! Or, you can, however, <br /> <br /> They are few words to describe a film that claims to be the last one and comes out with another; liars, cheating, and maybe even some words that can not be pronounced. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the series was out of date, and wanted to stop seeing it, or that the people who wanted their hero (or Villian) stopped last, it was. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a mockery of Wizard of Oz, then a child named John Doe, the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and leaves Freddy's territory. A woman in a hospital / a place to take the children out of their feet meets this boy, and at the same time, dreaming of a man and a water tower and promising a floating secret in her mind, goes back to Springwood to see this frightening vision and soon discovers that she is a Freddy child. Springwood only if his daughter might be his hostess. In addition, fear entails. This movie seems to have hit the nail on top of everything you want to know. <br /> <br /> This film contains a lot of humor and the appearance of a veil, such as Rozan Barr, Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and a young Brick Meyer playing the role of a young stoning who sees a false vision of flowers and Iron Butterfly in "In- a-gadda-da-vida ", then stumble into a parody of Mario's Super Mario of some kind. This movie will make you hate this movie, or you like Kruger more. Best of all.
