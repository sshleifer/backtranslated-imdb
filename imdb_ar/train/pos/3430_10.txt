I caught this in a show at Sundance Film Festival and I was in awe at the absolute power of this film. It is an examination of the psychological effects of our brave soldiers who join the army in the hope that they will protect and serve our country with honor and that our government will take care of them. The film details the psychological changes taking place in the boot camp where the soldiers become "killers of their country" and enter the war and the following effects as soon as they return home. It also depicts the effect of killing on human psyche. He praises soldiers and never criticizes soldiers for unlike other films, but criticizes an unprepared regime that does not meet all the physical and psychological needs of returning veterinarians. <br /> <br /> This film is strong, exciting, emotional and thought-provoking. It is an invitation to arms to support our forces not only by buying posters and going to marches but by actually listening to them and helping to support change in the way their health and well-being are treated after the killings. <br /> <br /> The best movie of the festival so far, **** / ****
