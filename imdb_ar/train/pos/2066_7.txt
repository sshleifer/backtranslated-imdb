It is easy to forget that after the series later developed a plot more foreign plot, once wrote XX files such as "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry", where foreigners were not all of the young gray men or the punishment of the control of the mind, but may surprise you Actually. <br /> <br /> The "frightening analogy" begins with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant that somehow takes off in space and time, not a mile from the "walk" - and ends with the pregnant gorilla being kidnapped. It's a wonderful moment. The subplot is annoying - yes, we got it, and zoos are bad only when they are not - but the ideas inside are brilliant and visually powerful and very memorable, covering a largely ignored angle of abduction - why would humans be the things? The only foreigners interested? <br /> <br /> In the end, it was not classic right away, but it was fun watching it, and it went on again, very memorable, and basically, it's something you can not imagine doing in many other programs.
