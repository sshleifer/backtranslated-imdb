I got Bill and Ted's first film for Christmas and I had to get a second movie when I saw it in the store. This (I think) was just as funny as the first story but it's more funny. It was funny how they had their own hell and how they had to play death. The funny thing is that they played it in stupid little games like Idea. The only thing I would like to change is being the "station and death" in the band but otherwise it was wonderful.
