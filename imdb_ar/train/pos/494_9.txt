This is the beginning of the new and intriguing Star Trek series. It contains "back to earth" - a kind of feeling with a darker script and less "impersonation". <br /> <br /> Characters need more time to develop but have potential. One fairly disappointing thing (with every Star Trek series really) is that they portray this bleak picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture of everything else. (Earth has stopped war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters here are two, the sub-commander T'Pol, a volcanic and communications officer Hoshi, a human being. The Hoshi is very stocky and T'Pol was designed to be a "Vulcan boy". <br /> <br /> Some crew positions feel too American (unlike the international sensation of a TNG crew) but create interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> It's a very good pilot for a very good series.
