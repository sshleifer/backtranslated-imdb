It is a good bet that most of the rule is covered or, at least, we can say with some certainty that this is not a shortened version From Reader's Digest. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are high, and are consistent with other BBC classic standards such as Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe London Dickens looked, looked, and thought a lot like this. There are occasional slight absences - some athletes launch a pistol with a rhythmic cover in 1840 or 1820 or whenever it happens. <br /> <br /> The actor also praises. Susan Borden is a polite and honest heroine who works quietly. She is also nice, in a mature way, her beauty by her emotional nature and not by any surprise. Denholm Elliott is the guardian (and more, as it turned out). Burden and Elliott are two of the very few characters who are fluent in language. Another is a former sergeant forced to evil by evil. Another is a small boy, poor and helpless. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone else has written this. He has all the characteristics of Dickens - poverty, tragic deaths, capitalism forever, generous rich man in his house surrounded, hidden fatherhood, mysterious motives, impotence or blatant malice of the judicial system. Well, not the judicial system as a whole, but the church, which was obviously a court that decides matters relating to the distribution of property. (So ​​I gather from Wikipedia). Became so severe and so badly that he was completely renovated in England in 1973. Twice, Elliot's character describes it as a "curse". The most impressive scene involves a money-laundering creditor chasing a retired soldier at the last gym during a fencing lesson. The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male figure I remember from Dickens. The tenant and the less-paid tenant lend threats from his seat and the sergeant moves toward him and exercises a minute with the saber after each other. Each advance makes him closer to his torment, while the old creditor with the crimson face retracts to his seat. <br /> <br /> There are two things missing. Often, Dickens will stick to one or two interesting lines of dialogue. ("Humbug!" Or "Law is the ass.") Not here. "Dark" home is the right address. Secondly, there is practically no "ideal types" of Weberian - there are no Mr. Micawbers or dodgers of mollusks or scavengers. Thirdly, the atmosphere, the whole spirit, is relentlessly depressing. Followed by another ordeal, usually associated with money or some shameful Piccadillo of the past. <br /> <br /> Oh, my God, it's frustrating. It seems as if the author was breathing his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew. Poverty, okay. He knows poverty. But one wonders what Chancery did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment. <br /> <br /> I might add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series - and the best in two ways. There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a bit faster. Jarndyce's Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce is satisfactorily explained in the foreground, rather than searching in the shadow as a mysterious "curse", so the plot is easier to follow.
