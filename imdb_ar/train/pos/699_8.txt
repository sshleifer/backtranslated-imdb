I have not seen Insomniac Cabos for a long time and for the first time I say, I found it very good. If you love Dominique Monaghan, you'll love her. The pit film happens inside his mind - does he do it? The representation of anyone else is a bit rushed and fragile and some scenes can be reduced but they work in the end. The additions to the DVD are as great as the movie, if not larger for Dom fans. She has a lot of explicit moments from the group, the actions and a wonderful interview with the director. Anyone who has ever been in the independent film industry will love watching Tess (the director), Dom and everyone else on a very small close personal group trying to show this creepy little movie. It was very fun and I am happy to have it in my group.
