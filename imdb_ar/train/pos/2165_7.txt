The display of "motivation" is a very satisfying experience. The movies that are unpredictable are such scarcity, when one comes as a "motive", it is something to embrace. The script is very logical and creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronin, and Bill Paxton provide reasonable performance. It was possible to run this as a zombie film, but the "motive" is much better than any dull "zombie", and the originality shines in almost every scene. You feel that something like this may already happen, although the scenario is quite fantastic. From the "pickled" open up credits roll, you will be intrigued. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - Merck
