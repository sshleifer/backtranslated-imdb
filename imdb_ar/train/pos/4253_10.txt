Really excellent movie, one of the best I've ever seen. Effective and simple - just like life, sometimes crying sometimes laugh is beautiful. Not much of anything, just as supposed to be. I really liked the idea of ​​the film, no one is bad or good, they are all or all of them, they make mistakes mostly because of the pressures of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others, and more importantly you have reasons to get angry - But in the end the anger disappears and then you need to let the love come back even though it is difficult, there lies true happiness. <br /> <br /> Wonderful actors and players, the film makes you really feel the film. Pretty cute. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing him, especially if you want to see the lives of Italians.
