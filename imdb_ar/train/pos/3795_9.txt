After watching this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to hear how to get a copy. Jim McKay made a recent (question and answer) about the film and then presented his paradoxical position: how to obtain a film distribution portraying minorities (women, non-whites) working to resolve controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, adolescent mothers, , And how to write a sincere script in all these subjects being the memory of the mid-thirties. Multi-ethnic and multi-national audiences, most of them adults, were impressed with the wonderful film story, the detailed characters and the wonderful portrayal of "True Teen Life." However, most teenagers left the building - which led me to believe that this film is best viewed for adults with children, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults felt, "Teenagers should see movies because it's about them." Thus, distribution questions - how do we put our hands on them? The Internet (retail) will be a great way - it's a movie that will be buried, like "puppies" or other modern radical teen movies - and McKay appeared to be responsive. For his credentials as a writer / director, McKay was sensitive and detailed in his work - an alliance with the Crown Heights neighborhood where the film was made, where he worked with actors to portray the characters in their own vision of what they believed to be - with disturbingly realistic results.
