Oh, where are you going, little boy, small ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're in two places, turn and you're in the fourth ... <br /> <br /> I remember these shows when it was first broadcast on Disneyland. I remember sitting there, depressed by Werner van Browne's explanations of rocket science. I have seen that history, science, and humor were all intertwined in an intriguing story. <br /> <br /> That was 50 years ago. The performances are back in the Disney Treasures series, and what their treasure is. I watched them last night and night with my 8-year-old daughter, who initially did not come into the room, but changed her mind later when she saw they were moving in part. As I watched her, I saw her, and by the end she was almost as engrossed as I was. <br /> <br /> You turned around and you are a small wife and have children for you ... <br /> <br /> Certainly, some expectations about getting to the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still very accurate, the overall display is still impressive. I found myself thinking that my daughter's teacher might want to show her in her class, not only as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as fun and easy to understand for lessons in history. <br /> <br /> Turn, turn, turn around and again ... You wonder how much has changed in 50 years.
