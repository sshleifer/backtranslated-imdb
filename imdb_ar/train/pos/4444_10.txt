It seems that most Italian horror fans hate this film because it has nothing to do with the first two demons. With the "Third Devils" in the title, one assumes he will. The problem is that this film was not meant to be part of the series of devils. Distributors only "Demons III" above its original title "The Ogre" to take advantage of the popularity of other films. The new version of the American DVD for this picture contains the title "Demons III: Ghoul" on the Art Box, but the film itself says only "Ghoul". I do not know if previous releases were titled "Demons III" in the actual movie itself, but this new version seems to be just a little white lie. If you can get past the "Third Devils" in the title, you may have some fun in "The Ogre". It starts with a creeping introduction and stays pretty creepy all the time. There are no movies and movies slow slowly, but I still take them out. Do not expect to be like other demons movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it.
