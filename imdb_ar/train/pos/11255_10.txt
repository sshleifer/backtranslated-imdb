This is without doubt my favorite Le Carre story and turns into a silver screen with all the love and care a person can want. I read a review on this site that seems to find obnoxious characters but I think this misses the goal. All Le Carre stories are mainly love stories and this is no exception. It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it was set. Treason is the key to everyone for the sake of anyone. Pym breeding is very close to mine, so I find it chilling. Peter Egan is in his best roles and the late late Ray McNally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy De La Tor, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are in the lead. This cast is the dream of the Impresario Theater. The story should not be spoiled by an ill-conceived description, but suffice it to say that it is about the destruction of a slow but ruthless young man who descends into espionage and treason. All my sympathy lies with Magnus Pem and his only (non-sexual) love for Bobay (Rudiger Weijang - as wonderful as ever), his only real friendship, but by another definition of a long series of betrayals.
