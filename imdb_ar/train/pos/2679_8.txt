Comical, near the piece less mood piece of land, if the LSD inspired more than the devil, we must remember when it was made! After the stunning SM opening (which is the same not as it seems), we move to soft focus, dream, imagination or memory ?? Lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is a Franco film that Lang praised himself. A beautiful and intriguing film unfolds at a fast pace but enjoys richness within every fold. A rare film that soak inside. Old Jess can make 'em when he tried. Extremely superb central offerings including Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon are invincible. I did not mention Lisbon sites - ah!
