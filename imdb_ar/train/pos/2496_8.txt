No garbage - no where so near the garbage. Not original? This is the last thing that can be said about "2.4 Baby". of course no! Although it was an unusual track for the BBC, it was funny, funny and funny. I particularly liked Blenda Lang and John Pickard - who I think were fantastic. Gary Olsen was very good as well as all the other team members .. I was never entirely new about why he could have been hiding so read here today about the death of Gary Olsen a relatively young age. I hope they will make more comedy of this kind, and much more of them (and show them here in Israel).
