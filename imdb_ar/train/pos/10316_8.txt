Remember these two stories proudly and in the first, which was identified in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for the exam day, the state test. The boy is puzzled by his parents' concern because some of his friends have already done so and are finally going to take the test. Upon arrival an injection and curiosity are given to find out why. The examiner smiles and tells him that only to make sure he tells the truth. The boy asks, puzzled again, why not? After that, the parents sit anxiously waiting for the message to appear and declare that the state is sorry, but the level of their son in English has exceeded the national figure and asked politely whether he wants a special burial. The corker of the closing scene! The message of love was a warm story about a romantic relationship between a girl of the past and a man of the present. Which turns into a strange story of past fascination charges and dig deeper into the pages of history at present. Beautiful story with intimate conclusion.
