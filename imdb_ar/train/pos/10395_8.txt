A great Arab adventure. The former king, Ahmed, and his favorite friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabo Black Narcissis), are looking for Ahmad's interest in love, which was stolen by the new king, Jaafar (Conrad Vedat). There is hardly a moment here. They always invent new adventures for heroes. Personally, Ahmed and his mother found it somewhat boring (there is no need to ask why John John, who plays with Ahmed, is in fourth place in the credits). Conrad Fayed, always a playful actor, makes a wonderful evil, and Sabo has a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who sometime finds himself in a bottle. I also really liked Miles Malison as Sultan Basrah, the princess's father. It brings amazing games from all over the world. Jafar bribes him to lead his daughter with a mechanical flight horse. This may be one of the best children's films of all time, but the special effects are terribly dated at present. Children will certainly make fun of overlapping images when Abu and Ginny are on screen together. The scene with the giant spider seems particularly terrible. Although most of the younger generation may have thought that King Kong looks bad at this time stage, the animated animation of Willis O'Brien is a thousand times better than a puppet on a chain that does not look like a spider. 10/08.
