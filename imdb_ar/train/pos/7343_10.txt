Why this film disappeared in mystery is an absolute crime. "Conan" may be the only sword and sorcery film. The brutal violence, wonderful personality designs, and good speed make this one of the best fantasies. It's definitely the biggest animated film targeting an audience I've ever seen. This does not resemble the usual overheating Bakshi style. It is the departure of Bakshi, and in my opinion his best works. I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves.
