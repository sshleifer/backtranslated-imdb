John Tortoro once again proves his remarkable skill, playing the role of the Russian genius in Russian chess as he prepares for a return tournament and establishes an improbable relationship with a gadabout resident (Emily Watson) at an Italian hotel in 1920. They fall in love, Which climbs the social mountains (Geraldine James). It's a wonderful love story, and its glittering chess game makes it look like a brain. But despite its origins in the story of Nabakov, it certainly is not. Romantic elements and a sense of time and place overcame psychological analysis. John Tortoro, who appeared in the film "Barton Fink", "Brother, where are you?" "Big Lebowski" proves that he does not rely on Coen Bros films to confirm his status.
