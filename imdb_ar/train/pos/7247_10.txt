I wonder what Luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something, like Bella Lugusi Junior or David Hennessy, there is a child from the dark shadows who wants to Forget the dark shadows that exist). Anyway, in the EMI Thorn video, there is no music around the opening credits ... but the music is great once it appears. With the Italian movies, the movies are not as good as the music ... My favorite show is with the boy with the robot arm that follows the lonely alien across the desert, the alien says why you follow me, I answer Tommy because I feel so ... A foreign response to the way you went to Tommy say West then Alien says well, I'm going east, so after a while of walking, the subject playing in the background looks Alien to the top and sees Tommy sitting on the petting pet hamster rock ... Tommy looks up and says to Alien, What took you long ... I love this movie ... touching my heart. The boy with the robot arm needs a door and a foreigner is set up to become a papa in the desert. . . Oh yeah, they need water too. . . The WAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) is in no way just a western fucking movie / another nuke with a boy with an arm robot and Alien and Trash and a few good guys with an average chick with an iron claw and a CRAZY BULL that looks like Wez in Warrior of the Road. . On Sunday afternoon on Channel 57 (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) after the church I was going back to the house and found it on. . . Much . . Often. Love her. 10/10
