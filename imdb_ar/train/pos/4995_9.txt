I do not think most of us tend to apply the term "must-see" to the motion pictures, but I was very impressed by the quality of the film and it deserves a "must-see" character from me. <br /> <br /> Mandy, played by Shannon Lee (the daughter of the late Bruce Lee and the late sister Brandon Lee), was recruited by Martin, a professional thief to help pull a diamond from a museum of a criminal group and get a generous reward for it. They only know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a couple of love birds), earlier rejected by Mandy and Martin to get the deal, are also planning to steal diamonds. <br /> <br /> How each pair of robbers plan to steal the robbery is a thrill to watch. Things are going the same, because Martin and Mandy find themselves a step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooted in these thieves because they find that they need each other to survive from the crime syndicate. , Who are not at all happy that the diamond is not in her hands. <br /> <br /> Lovers of the movement will not be disappointed, because there is a healthy dose of gun battles, martial arts, and direct combat. sequence. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that it is not only the procedure that holds the film, but the romance and laughter (and I do not mean that you have a single character diffuse in motion movies) is sneaking in. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to root the bad guys, but we see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie and another not to miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
