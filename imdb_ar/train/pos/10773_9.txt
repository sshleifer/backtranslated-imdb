I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not only for rock lovers Luciano Legabo, but for all movie buffs. Because they are honest, moving, funny and real. Because Ligabue is a storyteller who is born and loves films, and every frame of his films is made of love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most of the first Italian films are poor and this film, by a stranger, is a real joy to watch and listen to. Because Stefano Akursi is wonderful and reminds me of Andrea Bazianza, who was, like Fr√©chia, beautiful, talented and good and lost his life because of heroin, which he shows to Legapo as he is, not ugly and ugly, without indulging in easy morals. Because it is a film that speaks to our hearts, our ears and our souls. Because I lived the experience of FM radio and it was so. Thanks, Luciano!
