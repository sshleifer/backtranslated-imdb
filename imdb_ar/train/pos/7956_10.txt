It is simply a classic film where the voices of humans coming from animals are really what their thoughts are. I do not know if my video version has lost a certain place, but it never shows how the dogs came out of the hole. It also shows animal survival instinct and capacity tracking. Put the humans in the same position as the ants will be the helicopter out. For once the original movie is improved by a remake as audio was removed over the first. Only the use of animals is what can work in a film of this kind because the use of people had to be moved the story by turning it into a murder, proving that animals are more interesting than humans
