I honestly think this was the best version of the World War I saw all of them. It was fun, but it was also educational, I learned a lot from the film, if I could do that movie. My favorite part was when the soldiers killed the robot and the other came from behind him. In the last film war in the world, I think it should have been like the first, and it would have been better. But by no means gave this movie an excellent 2. <br /> <br /> If they make another movie like this, I'll definitely see it. <br /> <br /> Thank you
