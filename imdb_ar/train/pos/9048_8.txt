I resisted seeing this film and realized why it was not a great success in the theaters. "October Sky" feel and oh look very familiar. and he. All collusions and emotions have been explored by other films - perhaps better. But despite his familiarity and resistance to all Hollywood forms, this film wins and is admired at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of heart, mind and spirit. Just as the characters of Steven Sondheim's MERLILY WE ROLL ALONG stand on the roof of her apartment in the hope that her new generation ("what you call it, you call it a miracle"), Sputnik will have a similar effect on young people. Rocket boys from this real story. While the battered town residents of the town of coal in the 1950s reject this event, Homer Heckham sees Sputnik as his ticket to life in the mines. <br /> <br /> The leading trend and play makes the journey of the missile boy Homer and his colleagues seem new and new. Particularly affect the sub-plans related to the young Homer school teacher. Self-control is evident in the portrayal of their sensitive relationship. It is also remarkable that Father / Son Subplot, who anchors the film. She played absolutely everywhere. Even Homer's mom gets her moment without clich√© or break-in. Her warning to her husband is gracious and wonderful. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> The main set of videos you've despised contains a tag next to this movie that says you'll love this movie or that it will return your money. For one time, I agree with them. You'll never see the October sky again. <br /> <br />
