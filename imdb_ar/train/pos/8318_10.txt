Excellent Movie Representation by Mary Alice, Philip M. Thomas, and Irene Kara Young. Tony King was very realistic in his role for the Satan. This film was one of the last "All Black" movies that were often in the 1970s. Unlike the "blaxploitation" films of that era, this film was already a plot, and it was well done. The film's soundtrack, written by Aretha Franklin, was famous on the R & B charts at the time.
