"The Men of Honor" - a true story about a proud and persistent black submarine (Cuba Gooding Jr. is wonderful) is definitely a wonderful film that touches Wesley both and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. Great acting is the main reason to make this film something special and very enjoyable, a great experience. The charismatic Robert de Niro enjoys President Billy Chandi, a harsh and homeless president - and writes this role practically. This film alongside the brilliant 15 Minutes (2001) is the latest proof that it is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "The Gentlemen" includes a great show from Cuba Gooding Jr., who was one of the most promising young actors since "Boyz n the hood". "Gentlemen" go directly to Jerry Maguire, "as good as it gets" and "instinct." Cuba Gooding Jr. He is a brilliant and wonderful actor and I am ready to get a lot of great movies from him. The Men of Honor also contains an excellent series of stories and perhaps the most exciting diving series in the history of the film. It's a wonderful movie and I can only recommend it.
