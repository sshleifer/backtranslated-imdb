I have just seen Holly with another film on child trafficking and sexual exploitation entitled "Trade in the Film of the Sea Festival". I must say that Holly blew the trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie on many different levels. From a purely artistic and cinematic point of view, it is amazing. Audio, camera angles, direction and representation are all mixed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way he deals with the subject is good and delicious. It presents the issue of sexual exploitation of children in an educational and accurate manner. The first filmmakers made a great deal of attention to detail, really understanding the nuances in the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. Often when dealing with a theme of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic images of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all this without falling into this typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see Holly in two separate film festivals, once in the United States and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have not seen an audience move more. Just listen to the conversations after the examination, ask people what they can personally do to combat sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both because of its cinematic value and its theme.
