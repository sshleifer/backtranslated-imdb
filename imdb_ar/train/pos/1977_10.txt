I really liked this movie. I remember once when I was in the second grade, my teacher showed us a 16mm film. However, this film can be somewhat frightening for second graders such as the scene where Bill kills Nancy and sees Vagin's face for the first time on screen. One of my relatives is tired of watching this movie because she studied it in the music chapter. If you're a teacher and you've rated the people who produced this great movie, I'll give them the A + tag.
