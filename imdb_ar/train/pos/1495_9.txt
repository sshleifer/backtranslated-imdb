This is a terrific Amicus terrific choir, with 3 wonderful stories, and fantastic shows! , Just disappointed the last story. All the characters are wonderful, the film is extremely terrifying and disgusting, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are dazzling in this! It's a very consumed story and my favorite story should be "Sweet Sweets" III, and all characters are very popular. Some expected, the last story was very disappointing and nice! , But the finish was really wonderful! These are awesome awesome anthologies for Amicus, with 3 wonderful stories and fantastic shows, only the last story is disappointing! , I say she should see it! <br /> <br /> The first story ("Method of Murder"). This is a wonderful story, with a lot of suspense, and the killer is really creepy Dominique, and has behaved well too! This was the perfect way to start with a story, which is mostly unexpected, in addition to that the double finish is amazing, and very scary! Grade A <br /> <br /> The second story. ("Wax"). This is a strong story everywhere, with fantastic performances, but the end is predictable, but it's still creepy, and it has a lot of suspense, Peter Cushing did a great job, and I could not believe how young Joss Akland was young, I really enjoyed this story !. Grade B <br /> <br /> The third story ("Desserts to Sweet"). This is the best story here, because it's too creepy, unpredictable all the time, it also has a nice touch too! Christopher Lee did a great job, and Chloe Franks did a great job as a little daughter, and the end was amazing. I do not want to spoil it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I have ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> The fourth story ("Abaya"). This was a really weak and unusual story. John Burtoy annoyed me, but the end surprised me a bit. Ingrid Pitt was as wonderful as ever, yet boring, and it was executed several times before, and where was the creativity ??. Grade D <br /> <br /> The direction is great! Peter Deauville does a great job here, doing great work for the camera, great angles, adding some scary atmosphere, and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> The Acting is awesome! John Bryans is wonderful here, because Narrator, he has some great fonts, I wished he had more screen time. John Bennett was very good like De Dete, he was very intense and was good at the end! , I loved him so much. Denholm Elliott excellent where Charles was weak and showed fear and was very loved and loved the expressions of his face. Joanna Dunham is amazingly wonderful! , She had a great performance in what she had to do as a wife, and she had a wonderful chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams was an incredibly creepy like Dominic, and he seemed creepy, and the work was done very well! Peter Cushing is as astounding as always, and amazing here, he is lovable and center and charming, and as always, he has a lot of seasons! (Cushing's rules!). Joss Ackland is as wonderful as always, and looked very young here, barely knew him, his tone was not too thick, and played a different role I loved him! (The Akeland Rules). Wolf Morris is creepy here, and he did what he was doing well. Christopher Lee is amazing as always and amazing here, he is very enthusiastic, very focused, and as he always looked at the intense look on his face, it was wonderful at the end! (Rules me !!). Chloe Franks is adorable as her daughter-in-law, she is fairly creepy and has provided one of the best performances for kids I have ever seen! , I loved her. John Pertoy has annoyed me from here, he was very nice, and he is quite strange, as he had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid is a beautiful house, doing her usual work in vampires and doing it well! <br /> <br /> The team stayed well. Overall you should see! **** of 5
