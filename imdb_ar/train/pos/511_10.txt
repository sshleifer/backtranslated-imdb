I saw this film for the first time almost 21 years ago when it was ITV (Days Ago Cable and Satellite) Matin√©e. I was out of school with mumps and I was completely wrapped up in the film. I got it on the video I bought about 10 years ago and I want a copy of it. David Neven is my favorite actor all the time and I think it's curious that he was more than once looked at the Oscars. I also think that the queen should have mounted it as he did easily in the film industry if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. The way the film moves from black and white to color and back again has been done well and the film has excellent actors such as Roger Levy and Marius Goring and the early appearance of Richard Attenborough.
