Well, I do not agree with the other published commentary. Pedras is much better than them Magnolia or any of the other films that have been mentioned. <br /> <br /> Especially when it comes to unreal characters, I think someone wrote this just because he did not live in Spanish society as I did (and I'm not Spain), it's a real movie with real characters, and it was done by one of the best actress Spanish Antonia San Juan. It is better to be a European film than an American movie. Well, we are different societies. I personally do not like modern American films very much. I love classic films and some American films but they are very few. <br /> <br /> It is a film about the constant constitution of someone, whether we like it or not, we all make mistakes, but some can know the mistakes.
