Unfortunately - I stumbled into this show late in life. I've just caught a few loops (about three) before being canceled by ABC. I loved the characters, the story - but most of all is the wonderful actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I knew (Bridget Moynahan was "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), Jay Hernandez (Carlito's: Rise To Power) and Erika Christen (Swimfan). I enjoy watching young actors and they deserve, and I felt that this presentation will push their careers forward. I hope this will be put off at least on the DVD, and the World Bank will probably receive it for the second season at some point? In the meantime, I watch him on ABC's website from the start.
