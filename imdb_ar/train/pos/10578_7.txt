"Footlight Parade" is one of many brilliant musicals produced by Warner Bros. in the early 1930s to ward off recession. The 42nd Street series and the Golddiggers series were also produced during this era, and literally, millions of Americans forget their problems for a short time and enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> While most of the films produced the great talents of Joan Blondell, Robbie Keller and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade had James Cagney's incomparable. Almost ten years before his most famous musical works, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". He dances here in most of the original dance styles, and usually his arms fall down beside him, and his legs are all kinds of ripples and kicks. It's easy to see that he enjoys himself, and that makes us enjoy him even more. <br /> <br /> While almost all music shows appear at the end of the movie, they are worth the wait. I think this film was manufactured before the production code was installed, so some of the costumes and scenes were very small. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> No matter what the plot is, I just know there's a lot of laughter and super-actors. Besides those mentioned above, Jay Keby is at his best here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
