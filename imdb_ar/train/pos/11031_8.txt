Best movie in Sly. It's a delightfully fun movie with some interesting characters, powerful shows and a stylish Renny Harlins accent. Stallone is rarely interesting in his motion films, and he certainly looks at the part regarding motion scenes. This was one of the best motion films of the year and one of the most exciting and fun movies of the 1990s, a classic of the genre. As a Stallone fan, this is one of my best memories. Lots of wonderful work and Slay in the form of a major business man. Thrillers appreciate this movie because it contains all the hallmarks that produce a good film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rucker and John Lithgow. ****
