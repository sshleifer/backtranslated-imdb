Those who know who knows "The Legend" Kelly and hope that this film is a fine portrayal of his life, may be disappointed with the creative license obtained with this film (for example, Naomi Wat's character did not actually exist), but if You look at them purely as a piece of entertainment, they carry very well. It is not hard to look at the former Ned, including Yahoo Sirius, Mick Jagger and the former Carlton champion (Australian football rules), Bob Shetty, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some film filming site in the area where I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes and Ballarat.
