Ireland's first animated film is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. They are real warts and every story is different from any of the other Oscars and any other film this year or any other year. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film carries Abbot of Kells, a village in which Ireland builds a wall around his city to prevent Vikings from destroying the town if attacked. His nephew Brendon, a young monk who does his best, but faces the anger of his uncle by doing things in his time. When Edan arrives from a legendary monastery from a ruined monastery, Brendon drifts toward him and his warm personality. Aydin offers a lot to shake his uncle to teach Brendon how to enlighten. In order to help Aidan work on his great book, saved from his ruined monastery, Brendan goes out into the woods to get materials for making ink. While outside the walls, he met Ashley, a forest spirit that developed friendship. Unfortunately, Abbot discovers that he has gone out of the wall and there is hell paying. But the underlying distance is the Vikings ... <br /> <br /> Forget what you think you know about this movie that you are wrong. Even as I explained it, this film does not do justice. It's a simple story with a lot going on. It's a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world, through the coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside the walls. (The film says the world is a dangerous place and does not stop even if you build walls). <br /> <br /> It is a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all forms of life, including darkness. There is death, destruction, joy and happiness. It has no sugar coated. People die. Crested monsters. (I have scared some children), but in the end there is hope. Frankly, the darkness in this film does not resemble anything in any modern American film. Forget the "sadness" in the film Pixar, this is the real thing, it is refreshing and shows how it became so homogeneous Pixar. <br /> <br /> It is Genndy Tartakovsky-esquire (Samurai Jack) animated film and is based in fact on the Celtic art of this period. It's a movie that does not look like anything else. Here again another movie takes the frame of the film and uses it in every possible way. The images are designed to fill as much space as possible. The movie is often treated with things to make it look like a page in the legendary book Kells. It is beautiful, stunning and best described as artistic life. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore produced a feature film. I can not say more. It's a masterpiece. It's one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.
