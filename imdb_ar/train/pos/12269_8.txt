Four men, astounded, do not go along with three exciting girls who go to a remote forest area to look for a bear. A mixed team of sects competing with veteran Vietnam veteran Jesse (an actual cameraman of Alberto Mej√≠a Barron) is surprisingly surprised to see that he is not dealing with any outsiders on his own soil. Director / co-author Pedro Galindo III connects the gripping story at a steady pace, creates a great deal of nervous tension, and provides a good amount of graphic cutting with a brutal cut-off set (bad throat dissection and hands being blown away with gun rate as spot highlights Specific dim). All qualified actors present strong performances, with the praiseworthy work done by Pedro Fernandez as a gentleman Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as Alejandra, Charlie Valentino as Charlie the Friendly, and Tono Mori in Maurizio's novel. Better yet, Marisol Santa Cruz, a delicious blonde and a pretty brunette, Adriana Vega, provide some delicious candy to the eyes by wearing lovely bathing suits. Antonio de Anda, agile cinematography, breathtaking Sylvain scene, the powerful Pedro Plasencia degree, shuddery, stirring, well-developed characters, 76 minutes running time very tight pleasure further improve the overall sound quality of this explosion even horror / hybrid action winner.
