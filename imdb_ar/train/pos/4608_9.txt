Jackie Chan is considered by many film and martial arts enthusiasts to be one of the greatest stars on the silver screen, and Police Store has reinforced his reputation as a potential successor to the late Bruce Lee. If The Dragon enters the so-called bench mark of my greatness in the 1970s, the same can be said of Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Forget the Rush Hour, or any of his efforts in the United States - the only film that truly depicts Chan's distinction, let alone kick his start as a mascot to kick hard, crush the bone, as well as his cinematic life - This is the story of the police - the first film in a series of successful cop films, which were exhibited in the mainland, Hong Kong present. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of his efforts, such as Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Evening Name - and frankly many of them are pale compared to the police story. In those films, we saw a less "stupid" version of Jackie, he did not have the opportunity to utilize his combat abilities to the fullest, not to mention that the sequence of fighting was not as good as those who made efforts like Drunk Master, Police Story for example. <br /> <br /> The thrill of this film is unusual and is the best in any motion picture. The sight of the mall literally is of some sort and must be seen as thought: the flying glass pieces, Chan that is left hanging outside the bus only by his walking stick while a crazy man walks through the streets of the city, and Chan successfully using all kinds of non-living objects and propaganda devices as weapons to fight the wicked. <br /> <br /> Since he is known to have fractured and broken every bone in his body and put himself in harm's way, Jackiez's insistence on showing his diversity as a bearer in himself by not relying on one is somewhat testimony to his reputation as a Kung Fu . Especially since he has bruises to show it. Thus, he has proved that he is not a foal of one trick when it comes to preparing diverse and smart-looking movements and getting out of them. <br /> <br /> A wise story, there is not much to discuss but what it lacks is narrative, it compensates for end-to-end action and counter-sequence. As for dialogue, it is not a huge aspect of the film - and that's why most Jackie and martial arts fans care about the movement, unlike the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the The Matrix, there are no wires or CGI, or any form of computer deception involved. What you see is what you get - and what you get from Police Story is a wonderful epic of Jackie Chan, full of stunts and pulsations. It is better than miles from Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all his other American efforts. <br /> <br /> Police Story is an excellent film and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Jackie Chan, but not sure who to watch first.
