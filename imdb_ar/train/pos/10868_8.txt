I always thought that this would be a long headshot and boring heads full of taking a fixed, dude interior, I was wrong. "Elections" is a very exciting and very touching drama, with a deep and realistic look behind the origins of the trite rituals. The characters are constantly connected, and although you are always an exhibitor, they remain strange, but it is still possible to feel the thrill of certain decisions and the ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie To has created some truly luxurious images because of the contrasting contrasting lighting and shadow contrasts in the atmosphere. Although there is hardly any action, the end is still appalling in its brutal portrayal of brutality. A wonderful movie deserves more attention and I have come to some extent.
