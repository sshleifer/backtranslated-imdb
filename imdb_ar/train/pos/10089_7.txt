. . . Or type on a computer keyboard, they're likely to give this movie a name labeled "10." After all, do not show elephants that kill during the film. Does not imply that anyone has been injured. On the contrary, the Lord of the Elephant Walk, John Willie (Peter Finch), complains that he can not shoot any of the pets - no matter how threatened they are - without a permit from the government (and points out that these permits are not within The world of probability). Moreover, the elements conspire - in the form of unusual drought and human cholera epidemic - to leave the farmhouse of Wiley vulnerable to complete destruction by the elephant people (as indigenous people call it) to close the story. If you see the current version of EARTH, you will find that the performance of "Elephant People" will be lower today.
