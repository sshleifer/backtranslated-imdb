This is an excellent little movie about the loneliness of the only man. Philip Harel in the role of Notre Dame is somewhat like a combination of Robert De Niro in a taxi driver, Inspector Clauso (in his novel) and Chunesse Gardiner in "Being There" (Peter Peter Sellers). He's single but he has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he's making no effort at all! <br /> <br /> He has a portico that challenges any hope of duplicity at all - his friend Jose Garcia in the role of Tesserand in the same ordeal, but at least makes a brave effort to overtake his extended virginity (28 years old and confesses that he did not have sex) never). <br /> <br /> Very good outdoor shots of Paris and Rouen, where the two programs travel to work. They try various night clubs and places but to no avail. My theory is that they are trying the wrong places - they go to the "youth" nightclubs more or less. They should try out the kind of older people they have, and the older they are. <br /> <br /> Harel becomes increasingly isolated and performs a little effort from De Niro, as in the taxi driver, urging his friend / colleague to go and challenging some bloke who pulled a pretty-looking girl into a nightclub. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
