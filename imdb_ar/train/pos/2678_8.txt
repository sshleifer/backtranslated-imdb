Hey now, I can not claim that I watched all the movies of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and there is certainly a lot of them, but this is one of the best (strangest) of the lot that I have seen. I would say he was probably in his first back in the late sixties / early seventies, and anything recently was very strange to me, and it took me a lot to say. Anyway, this looks like a big bad dream that seems to be parts of it being realized at different points. This woman is an actress or something and performs in a theater in Berlin where the acts of torture are performed "fake" to an estimated audience (?!) And they seem to face this problem with the dream. It seems that what is real and what is not present in this film is that the real things are in a sharp focus and dream things are not. It seems to exist in the case of deja vu. I would not say that this is perfectly logical but strange, fun and enjoyable. Berlin's footage makes it look like a lonely and scary place, adding to the atmosphere. The ending is very sudden, although the film ends and the tape ends, I do not think there is a need to let you know that it is over at that point. My version of Anchor Bay was Euro-Trash, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I can not get enough of this crap. But it's a good crap.
