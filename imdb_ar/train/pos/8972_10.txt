The discovery of Jean Jan Svanmaguerre's film opened my eyes to a full imitation of Czech animation, of which Jerry Trnaka was a pioneer. Ruka is one of the most technically impressive animated films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Potter wakes up and settles his plant. Then go about making a pot. But comes the huge hand that destroys the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of its own. He threw out his hand, but soon returned and imprisoned him in a bird cage where he was forced to carve a stone hand. Put it on the subject, the fainting of exhaustion, but he completed the task in the end. <br /> <br /> In a magnificent series of meatsinima, the potter uses a candle to burn the strings of the obvious puppets, which keep him in the eye and escapes to the house. He closes himself and is accidentally killed by his beloved factory when he falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern films that seek to be realistic (why?). The hand, for example, is clearly someone's hand in a glove. Everything else is mud. The tendons are visible and are part of the narrative, making them an introduction to the series of films. The strange atmosphere: that hand that has been pursued in a little panic has succeeded in planting it more than many horror movies combined. <br /> <br /> The film is clear but avoids being completely manipulative because of its simplicity. It is a tale of artistic freedom and tyranny that can not help win the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right.
