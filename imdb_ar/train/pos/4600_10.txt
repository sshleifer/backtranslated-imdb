This is sad, this film is the most important thing that should be at least the best 250 films here. This is still the best action movie ever done. Today's motion movies are going badly. Actors and directors of excitement do not know how to do it and just fight some just how not to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The stunts are very smart and wild I do not think we will ever see the likes. The start where Chan and his team go to chase the hill car across the hill town is amazing. The stunts at the end of the battle are for me the best stunts in the battle that have ever been shown. The end trick that slid down from the pole collides Jackie's glass is badly injured.
