Although this series lasted only a season, they only stayed with me for 20 years. It was by far and above all my favorite time in my favorite cartoons. I would give almost anything on a DVD or any format I can get. If you find any way to see this series I suggest you take full advantage. This series was the first series (in my opinion) to have a truly coherent story spanning several episodes. He also made me really interested in personalities and what happened to them. Hick Goose character is actually scared me sometimes. He was a stranger at the time. The group leader reminds me too much of a mix from Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / rights holder of the series and can put it on a DVD, please do so by all means !!!
