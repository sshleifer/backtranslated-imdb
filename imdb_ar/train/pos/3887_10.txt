I was able to remove this satellite, but I would like to have an original version in a format that we can use here in the United States. Eddie is truly glorious in this performance of San Francisco. I do not remember laughing hard in the parking routine. My wife and I enjoyed this tape and worked on Glorious and I just wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more offers available.
