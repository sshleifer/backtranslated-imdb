This frightening and painful modification of Stephen King's great novel is characterized by central presentations by Del Midkeff, Fred Goen (who has died sadly for several years), Dennis Crosby and some truly heinous influences. The director Marie Lambert has a great sense of visual elegance, and has managed to make this one of the few editions of King's work that is not only worth seeing, but truly impressive. For the people who think that this person is not alone in the dark (in the end with your warm girlfriend), it is not surprising that, I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" will crawl you out.Some horror movies like this one or "Texas Series of Saw Massacre" should not be seen in a group.
