I can not believe that others have taken such a serious view of all this. God, I've had a lot of fun rooting out Cassidy Hop-Hop. It was a great tribute to Western series years ago. It was not meant to be a great cinema experience, but it was. What if there were no special special effects. It was fun, a tongue in the cheek, see the old Westerners. Man, relax and enjoy.
