A huge rumons fan. I like the carmoons, and I assume that if you hate them, besides being a strong supporter of Bush, you may not like this classic. <br /> <br /> It's much better than John's happy teen movies, such as the 80's. The boundless best of the American pie that is rattling us now. <br /> <br /> There are some other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ... and Class of '84, Three O'Clock High and the Cheesy after sweeping (seemingly impossible) edge of the river. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it is more fun and fun, plus you can wake up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
