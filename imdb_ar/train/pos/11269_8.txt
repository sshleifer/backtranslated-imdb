Have you ever wanted to know how much Hollywood can get away with before officially activating Hayes? Well, unfortunately, it has "Convention City," so just watch "Tarzan and His Mate" to find out. For 1934, there is a great deal of sexual connotation and even exposed meat. Just take a look at Jin naked swimming. While it is often thought that Tarzan is an adventure film made for young children and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally mature. More than 70 years later, it is still as exciting as it was when he appeared. <br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope that drives the nature of the taboo, it is a fascinating adventure story. I've always enjoyed the jungle movies that plagued Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, but there are few films called great movies. "Tarzan and his colleague" is the best long-standing film of this genre. The sequence of attacks on safaris by monkeys or indigenous people is still able to create tension today. Also, the animals are all very cool (especially the monkeys designed rocks). The act will not win any major awards soon, but it is certainly more than appropriate for this type of picture. The film was stolen again by the cheetah, the smartest monkey in the forest. One of the most entertaining Hollywood examples before the icon there.
