This movie is bufoonery! I loved it! The "Jacky Chan" and his friend "cowboy" made the movie quite enjoyable, quiet and funny. The film is a rare combination of a good fight against evil and (in some way) the wonders and pleasures that grow. Long Shao Yi takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "Dragon Master" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboys", which include the implementation of intelligent and deliberate ways to escape the study (assisted by all family members, ), Competition in somewhat childish ways (and interesting from stupid) to get a passion for a local girl, competition in "football" (you'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they find themselves in the midst of a battle to save a load of precious artifacts and the lives of many people. <br /> <br /> The movie contains dangerous moments. But they are not depression, but inspiration. Children are not lost in this exchange, but actually used against evil. What I really liked about this movie is how it ends. The usual confrontation (which was itself fantastic), but well, you'll see. Let me say that it truly embodies the spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> Silly, ingenious, meaningful, nostalgic. Wonderful movie
