The film has a great story of the type written. It features all the usual components of Colombo. The way Lieutenant Colombo deals with the suspect, how the mystery is revealed to him, the Colombo dog, the cat and mouse play, which is wonderful in this game, and also fortunately, some good comfortable humor, which mostly includes the character of Colombo. Everything is written despite the fact that it does not even have a truly original concept. Colombo was found by searching for the detective novelist / homicide more than once in the film Colombo. <br /> <br /> It is also a very well-directed film by James Frawley, who was released after 5 other Colombo films, in '70 and '80. The film was elegantly furnished and some great sequences are truly memorable. <br /> <br /> It is one of Colombo's slowest moving movies, although there is no very long running time. This method and approach do not always work well for Columbo, but in this film, it does not work at least thanks to the acting performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of Columbo has either starred in a famous big star or a star from the early days of filmmaking, where the film was the killer. This film tells the story of Ruth Gordon, 81. She has not starred in many films throughout her career, but is still known to some, most of her role in "Rosemary's Baby," which she also won the Oscars. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting, which some people might not like. She won four other Oscar nominations throughout her career, before winning the Rosemary's Baby Award in 1969. She has some wonderful interactions with Peter Falk in their sequence together. <br /> <br /> The movie stars also still young GD Spradlin. I say a young man because I only know him from his latest productions of his career, although he was 57 years old at the time of Colombian production. He is still alive but has retired from acting since 1999. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Colombo is better than usual. <br /> <br /> 8/10
