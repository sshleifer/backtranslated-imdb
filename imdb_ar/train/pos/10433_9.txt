American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna for the plane bound for the United States. On the train he met a French girl Selene. Although they met the first time, they spoke like close friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse Celine begged to accompany him for a tour of Vienna. Then the romance began. <br /> <br /> At first they were wary. The funniest scene was listening to a CD in the music store. They looked at each other, though their eyes did not touch. After an in-depth conversation, the relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their friend. Their deep love for one another was expressed in words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, you will not come as you like. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last for long. Spiritual harmony is most important for love. <br /> <br /> The script and excellent performance resulted in a huge success for the film. 9/10
