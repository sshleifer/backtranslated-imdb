It was not the most successful television project ever done by John Cleese, and I felt a "strange state" with a first draft that was moved to production before any revisions. There are some silly ideas around and even some smart ideas, but the whole story unfortunately does not add much. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is shouted, though Dr. Watson, a bit electronic and all. "Oh my God."
