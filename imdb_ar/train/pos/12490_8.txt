Allen and Julie go into a cabin in the mountains after the death of their daughter one night. No one knows who killed the little girl, but that's why they go to the mountains. The couple move into this cabin and are chased by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about them. <br /> <br /> This movie contains a lot of horror and contains a lot of the parts that made me jump. Some parts are predictable but there is a part I did not expect from time to time. It was a good film that was not one of the most spectacular films in the world, but it was still scary enough to make it good. <br /> <br /> I also liked the end because it left the viewer to decide how to end. It's also a kind of sad film as well as a good horror film.
