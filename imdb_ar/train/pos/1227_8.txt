This film caught on the local film channel, and I enjoyed watching the movie. Contains all the elements of a good teen movie, and more - this film, apart from dealing with the relationships between boys, girls, sex and the like, also addresses the issue of steroid use by young people. <br /> <br /> The film feels this real reality - there is no loud music, no special effects, no explicit scenes - which were appropriate for this film. This feeling makes it easy to connect with the characters in the film - some of them may know where we live from. <br /> <br /> In general, a good and fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 10/8
