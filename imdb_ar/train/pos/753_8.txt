A story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jenny (Judy Foster) is the most headed in the group - but wants to get out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) believes she is more mature than the rest of them. <br /> <br /> This is not new to what we have seen many times before - but this difference has a big difference - it is accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and was surprised at how realistic this film was. They've got dialogue, clothes and attitudes quite correctly. Even the main song of the film ("On the Radio" by Donna Samar) was a great success before this appeared. This film hit me more strongly than any other teen movie at that time because I could understand the characters and call them I knew high school girls who were like this! The film was dated (of course) but it captures a time we will never see again. <br /> <br /> Acting is good in all respects as Foster performs best. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and good. Scott Boyo (who plays a small role as a girl friend) has played one form or another with a teenager. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - a basic show if you have reached 1980. The movie has a R rating worth (lots of drug abuse and insults) but must be seen by all teenagers. Give it 8.
