I caught a little of this concert on public television and I knew I had to bring it. All the children at the Royal Albert offer excellent and often exciting performance. Also pure - no synth, no x-rays and bright smoke, and no great entrance (and an amazing, serious and appreciative audience, all of whom left their rockets at home). <br /> <br /> Fans of cream (or if you only hear them); if you're a fan of the blues; if you're a rock and roll fan, you will not be disappointed when you play this DVD and listen to it. You will also never lose this DVD because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get what they have!) It's very good and can be read back; you'll want to keep it handy.
