This is a neat little crime drama that packs a lot at 65 minutes running time. He has all the right ingredients - the mysterious body, middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kincella) and owner Tobin (John Miles), a mysterious assassin on Tobin's loose and emotional interest in the form of Mary's female scientist Mary (Patricia Wright) who helps solve the crime. There is also a wonderful conclusion to the firing taking place in the stone chopping yard. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the wonderful idiot near the beginning of this film where Lieutenant Corrigan refers to the dead woman as Tatooed Tilly "before the forensic doctor reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing huh?). Later also, when he was Tobin stalks the killer across the back yards, suddenly appearing as he walks in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did not catch him!
