I do not think this was a representative challenge to Richard Harris. This was an uncomplicated plot, but interesting. It's a good movie to watch when you do not want to do a lot of thinking, just want to tell a simple story. The Canadian scene was breathtaking. Beautiful autumn shots alone made the picture worth watching.
