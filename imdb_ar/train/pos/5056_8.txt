The radio did not work around the clock and seven days a week, when I grew up in England in the 1930s, so my child's watch was a treat when we had batteries and accumulators to power. So the few programs I heard left a big impression on my little brain. The third program I remember was "Toytown", one of all the animals in the zoo, and Gray Owl talking about the animals he knew, which he called his "brothers." Just recently, I learned that Gray Owl was not really "Indian", but the praise paid by Seo Schiff made sense to me, "A man becomes what he dreams." Can we all dream about changing the world and its usefulness, such as Archie Gray Owl Belaney? You could influence the new Gray Owl on world leaders to clean the environment.
