Is an idealistic narcissist; in this case, the lawyer (and killer) Tom Capano is portrayed. <br /> <br /> Catherine Morris is sympathetic to a victim, Anne-Marie Fahey, but at first she is the victim too much. We regret this position, but we are disgusted at the same time after we have seen his victim of many other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad part is where you actually get help in assessing her own issues, and Kabano was actually killing her psychologist. It's hard to believe, but it was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a veil with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as a mother of Kabano. All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a real murder, you will want to read Anne Roll's book for fine details. 10/08.
