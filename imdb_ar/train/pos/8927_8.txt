Claire Dennis returns to the subject of her exiled parents, the men who follow the bliss in a firm manner, without paying attention to the emotional consequences on their families, but while Ninet and Bonnie live from the previous film in a narrow world of Marseille, our examination of Louis Trepour at The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the border Swiss French to the halfway point around the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Once again, the film begins halfway, with Lewis, in his 60s, adapting to a patient's heart while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We know that Lewis is not a stranger to violence because his compartment is the site of smuggling and shooting regularly. Lewis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow and guns close by. Dennis is not in a hurry to move the event, and we must patiently understand Lewis of his daily activities and the few people who deal with them along the border including the son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, indistinguishable with long hair and a mustache from the mustache) He rejects it as a "madman":, as described as a dedicated parent of two. There are many short scenes that, although seemingly irrelevant, create an impression of Lewis and his queen. Mrs. Goddard worked in a delightful camera here. The dominant metaphor is Louis's heart transplant, which he went to Korea and then to Tahiti to find another son, who was not found, and where the new heart of Lewis rejects him just as old Sydney refused. We are used to short scenes in Dennis's film that can not be explained: Nénette Astride Boni feeds on a spoon. The campaign shot Bonnie's father, then the shortest picture of Bonnie shot in the head; Lewis's scene in the morgue with a corpse with a scar laying but the body of Sidney. The implicit meaning of the last two years is a real or imagined rejection by the Father that kills something that can not be defined in the Son.
