These films chronicle the life of William Castle. He made a series of low-budget horror films in the 1950s and 1960s that he sold with tricks. In "13 Ghosts", you need viewers to watch the ghosts (they were colorful and the movie was in good shape). The "Tingler" had play seats equipped with a bell to disturb the audience when a monster escapes to the cinema. "Marabre" issued a life insurance policy for all members in case they were scared to death! The movies themselves were very bad but the tricks pushed people to see them. This document interviews Cast inspired directors and actors in his films and daughter. He also enters his house and the type of man who was (by all accounts a wonderful man). The documentary is passionate, very funny and very persevering. It's very short (less than 90 minutes) and there is no dull moment. Must see for fans of the castle and horror film lovers. My only complaint - there were very few sequences displayed from his picture. This is by this great thing.
