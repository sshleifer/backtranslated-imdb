New York City, 2022: The impact of global warming, the oceans have disappeared, the grinding of unemployment, scarcity of water, energy and food .. The population of New York exceeded 40 million. This is a small gem of the picture, not least because the depleted future of resources is a reality for us as citizens of the twenty-first century. <br /> <br /> The low-cost titles of this movie are great: they are tuned to music, a low-tech video sequence composed entirely of archive footage from the dawn of photography until 1973, Into a polluted and crowded hell in less than two minutes. Short and unambiguous, really memorable. Budget constraints are also behind the somewhat unimaginable cinemas and other constraints, unlike the premise with the brilliant story. The sequence of police stations is similar to that of the television detective program in the 1970s, and other internal organs appear to be essential at best. The budget may all have continued to try the "future" Chelsea Soylent Executive's Chelsea West apartment with modern goodies, which means that other costumes are routine, and some of the incorporation shots are overpopulated and the outsiders seem to be all apparently filming a smoke filter. <br /> <br /> An unforgettable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a rare and sumptuous meal summarizing their community: they have real Bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomatoes, apples and beef, and we really feel the evil appreciation of the rich privileges of someone else . <br /> <br /> Robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly moved in a place called the "home page", depicts him immersed in images of plants and animals that were as beautiful in the world as he remembered them, Thorn jaundiced that the future has gone bankrupt, among other atrocities. <br /> <br /> This is one smart movie, and its main message is as it is today as it was in the early seventies. Yes, I know that we have not yet eaten the dead, but with the longevity that drains our resources, the rising poverty gap, global corporate capitalism, and the destruction of undetermined habitats that lead to climate change, the permanent prediction of "Soylent Green" may come true.
