I enjoyed this film as a child when it was introduced, and to this day I still do. A simple story involves searching for a kidnapped girl and an adventure literally literally from a paperback. They have actors that were more famous today. This should not prevent the viewer from giving him a whirlpool. Wayne Crawford plays the role of Jake Speed. Sure, he may bite some elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this film is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar. I'm not surprised many people know about it. Other films in the theaters must have been overshadowed by the '86. I saw it again then on cable TV. It may be difficult to find because print runs out on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD from the ebay website for less than $ 8! Cool flick.
