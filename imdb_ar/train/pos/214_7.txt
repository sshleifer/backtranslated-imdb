The old Voodville team from Willy Clark (Walter Matau) and Lewis (George Burns) were some of the most famous players but they disliked one another. After more than 20 years, they agreed to meet with each other for a special TV show ... but they discovered that they still hated each other. Willy's nephew (Richard Benjamin) is trying to get them to work together. <br /> <br /> He achieved great success on his day and won the George Burns Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) loved him. Neil Simon has written up her hardcore nonstop. It was fun but it was not Willy's dementia and everything. I also did not like Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and that something around him rubbed me in the wrong way. Also his character here is caustic until he gets sick quickly. All that aside was such a pleasure. Burns burns at the bottom of the platters easily, and even Matao was good. Their verbal battles are the best sequence in the film. Benjamin is also very good as Willy's nephew tries to work the two together. For me it is worth seeing Burns alone. This jump began his career dramatically and two years later he had hit "O God". This is good just good - not fantastic. The Matthau character makes this really difficult. Give it 7.
