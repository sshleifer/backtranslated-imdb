Although Chris Christoferson is good at this role, who does not want to see Elvis Presley instead? With drug addiction and the fall of high fame may scare the Elvis agent to be away from the film, it was a mistake. This was an ideal film for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is not great, Paul Williams and Barbara Streisand did a good job of creating an original piece of music for this piece. It is a love story to some extent, a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story was dying. Also, Gary Bossi is perfect again in a non-perfect role.
