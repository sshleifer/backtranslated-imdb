Fleet, an RKO production in 1936, was adapted for Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in a complex romantic comedy. Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had many similar romantic films together, RKO helped them create a compelling story that included community-related attitudes at the time of their making. Follow the Fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> The general story of the film revolves around Bake Baker, a sailor in the US Navy played by Fred Astaire, and Sherry Martin, a former partner in Love and Dance, who is now a singer and dancer playing by Roger Rogers. Their story begins when Beck is on the ship and his colleague Belge Smith finds a picture of them together. Beck reveals that the last time he sees her asking her to marry her, he suggests that they even try to meet her when they are on the ground, hoping to have a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The next major scene begins with the second scheme of the film when Kenny Martin, Sherry's sister, is refused entry to heaven where her sister works unless accompanied by a gentleman. She turns to find Bilge behind her with a bag full of drinks, so she plays it as if she were waiting for him and also buys his entrance to Paradise. Then she finds Connie Chery telling her that she is depressed because she can not get Chery's luck with the men, so Chery points out that she gets arrangements from her friends while she is on stage. Kony gets on more than once, enters the banquet hall again, and approaches Bilge again, which is astounded by her sight. This second romantic story begins between Bilge and Connie. <br /> <br /> During the remainder of the film, the story and the rising actions are transferred between changing comic dilutions to the couple's problems that create many ups and downs within the overall conspiracy. Bake and Sherry crossed the first moments together as they competed in a dance contest and ended up winning, reminding them of the success and happiness they had achieved when they were together. Similarly, Billge can divide Kony through his romantic attempts to appease her, and retire to her home. <br /> <br /> This series of happy events soon follows unsteady measures that lead to the decline of the rising movement. Shack left Shire the night before to retire to the ship before midnight and told her he would come to her in the morning. Unfortunately, the ship begins its course after the return of colleagues, which angered Chery and left her to think that Beck was still a typical sailor looking for a good time when he was on the floor. <br /> <br /> The mood has been changed once again when another sub-segment is inserted in the film when a "big shots team" is touring the ship. This alternative scenario is used to create a buffer between the stories of the main relationships of the film, as well as help build trust and the meaning of good public Bake intentions. The concert was interrupted by the sleeping music coming from Bake and his friends when they missed a report on the company's deck. And Bake begins happily to entertain them with some dancing, which ultimately helps to bring happiness to the mood of the film, as well as to bring happiness to the sailors. <br /> <br /> After returning to the interlocking couple stories, Chery tries to prove to Bake that she does not need to help him get a job. Unfortunately, Bec does not know she is testing the performance well, and goes to a good word for Cherry when he listens to his friend in the studio talking about the wonderful lady test. Beck takes it upon himself to help Chery get out of tinkering with her water, making her unable to sing properly and destroy her audition. In addition to Beck's mistake, Kony spent all her money to repair a ship that she hoped would take over as a captain. She had also planned a great date for dinner when he was supposed to come, but Belge was aware of her intentions and hopes of getting married soon and was no longer interested, so stop them. <br /> <br /> The remaining part of the film continues with the same coordination of mini-falls and falls until the peak point is reached between the spouses. Using changing stories helps build interest and passion within each couple, dealing with both happiness and pain during each struggle. Interlocking stories are also able to communicate with each other as well as integrate other unrelated subgroups to help move narrative into closing scenes. <br /> <br /> Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have countless movies that combine romance, comedy, song and dance, Follow the Fleet is a unique film for actors who successfully use sub-chart techniques to help Narration between the two main characters.
