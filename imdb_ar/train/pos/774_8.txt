I think it's a nice movie. I think it is a very romanian film through the landscape and atmoshpere. I think it was not meant to be sensual (sense is a result and not a purpose); I think it is very natural. I think it is humane. I think it was interesting. I think the actors never made me think ... waw lame acting (they are not Sean Connory & co), as the movie does not represent Blocka Block, it's like a movie ... normal ppl that can act ...; I think the movie I think he made me feel things (or feel them again :)); I think I'm not a subject; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... I know that.
