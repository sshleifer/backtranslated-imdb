With this theme, it is very easy to take cheap photos. You know, the legged man tries to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar is doing a great job of making Gerald a real person, a person who cares deeply, and as a result feels his plight trying to live like Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he seems hot! The chemistry between him and Jolie Walters is electric. These two personalities are affectionate toward each other, and even when they look at each other at the breakfast table. Even the sub-story line that is potentially cheesy for corporate acquisitions is unbelievable, and you'll finally find yourself cheerful! At least I did!
