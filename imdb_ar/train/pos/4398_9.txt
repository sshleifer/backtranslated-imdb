When I heard that this film was directed by Ange Lee, she made sure to see it. The Taiwanese director was famous for "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" a few years ago and then moved on to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now, his attention is drawn to another American icon - civil war. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in Missouri, a union state with a sympathizer with the South. These never formally joined the Confederacy Army. Instead, they have formed outlaw gangs, called "bush pirates," growing their hair for a long time, and sometimes confiscating union uniforms that they wore on their normal clothes. <br /> <br /> The film depicts their moral dilemma, the high drama of the times, and their supposed heroic missions to kill shopkeepers and farmers who helped the union. There are no stars in this film, unless you are considered a "jewel" singer, well portrayed as a young confederate widow as a star. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire was filmed as a young German farm girl who used his heritage because the Germans were supposed to be sympathetic to the union. This young man is an excellent actor, full of young people who have performed their roles and includes wonder and subtle perceptions as he is subjected to the horror of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is the freed slave who travels with the pirates for his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. It performs well and always. <br /> <br /> Some of the representation, however, is wooden, especially in long conversations that revolve around ethics. And their fashion is very new. The theme of the "Southern man" of morals and a look at the hats and literature of women shows up a lot - especially as they are the point of killing all the men they pull from the arms of their women, and then burn the shops. Houses. <br /> <br /> Although I do not think this will go down as one of the wonderful Lee Ang films, I found myself fascinated by them, despite the slow parts and the excessive length of 140 minutes. I was interested in what was happening next and I felt sympathy for all the characters I encountered as real and incomplete human beings confined to the forces of history. <br /> <br /> It was not as much work as usual. The film, however, is still recommended - especially for civil war buffs. <br /> <br />
