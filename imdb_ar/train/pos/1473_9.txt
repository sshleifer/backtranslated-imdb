Keep in mind that any film (not to mention the documentary) that affirms any kind of truth will generate a detrimental and consistent derision, from those who do not actually have any suggestion and / or find the facts, those of whom you are no doubt professors Psychology, cinema and soul bosses will find that this film is unnecessary, after all, you already know that everything can be known. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us in the minority like me, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" .... mostly fantastic, and worth watching for those interested in films, psychology and modern philosophy. <br /> <br /> Director Sophie Vinnis is similar to Scott McClouds, a Slovenian philosopher, sociologist, psychologist and social critic Slavoy Zizk in many films and identifies the scenes he discusses. Cover the image of the "bird" (Zizek take a boat to re-create the snapshot). <br /> <br /> Lacanian Psychoanalysis, does not necessarily scream, a very enjoyable evening ... But it! If you like movies that are ... have some knowledge of psychoanalysis, Lacanian (symbolic, real, imaginary) is a slightly simpler term at first, but the scenes chosen by Zizek and analyzed make it remarkably clear what was always for Me, a very abstract theme. In fact, it is best to have a knowledge of the films that are discussed more than the terms used, which become clearer with the progress of the film. <br /> <br /> Why I like this film is not because it chooses great films to analyze or reveal fascinating facts about Lacan, but it shows in a very practical and intelligent way, where the film meets psychology (according to the philosophy of virtualization). <br /> <br /> Why "music sound" kinda fascistic, why is "short cuts" for more than just class and isolation, why birds attack the "bird", what is there to see the mind of the "alien resurrection," what to do Planet "Solaris" wants, what relationship "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" to each other, and what the hell is the presence of David Lynch in the movie after the film ... Well, Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the sound in "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith" may be the strongest and most vivid films at the moment it turns into a feminine female self. Ma, Zizk admits that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina, they are disgusting and must be hidden from children (joking, it seems ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a great documentary, anyone who has ever seen a movie, and I think it means something more than what was mentioned literally, should try to see it. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in Slavic Zizk, this is a must, much less drier than the "virtual reality", more direct than "Zizek!" , Which are other false documents, on "Elvis for contemporary cultural criticism", because it is called "Perverts Guide To Cinema" in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The role of the misguided" does not revolve around the role of sex in cinema. Zizk claims that cinema is ultimately a perverted art, because it teaches "how to desire, not what you want," and that it is the only contemporary artistic form that can allow the expression of these desires. This is not a film about the discovery of reality in the cinema, but about the search for cinema in reality, and how important it is to raise it. It's hard to find, and it's a bit tall, but it's well worth the problem, and one of the most "watching" movies I've ever seen.
