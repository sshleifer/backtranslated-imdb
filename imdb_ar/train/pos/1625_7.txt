Amazingly good movie! She has a good number of good jokes through the entire movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extreme to show how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes, we followed! <br /> <br /> The plot barely escapes being called "tacky". And the fools are always an addition to the fact that the film for a strange reason does not play with this card to a large extent, so that the plot line offers two women with black hair working as evil side of our chakra. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave it 8/10, but let's not be mad.
