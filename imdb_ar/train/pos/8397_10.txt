This movie got all the ten votes I gave! Thanks guys for making a movie worth watching. I have made it clear to the world that you can still write, direct, produce and star in a black movie without negative stereotypes. The poetry was also wonderful, where he hated poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I saw him last night, where she fell in love with my lover again. I will add it to my film collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about quantity .... <br /> Thank you again, and best wishes and blessings to you!
