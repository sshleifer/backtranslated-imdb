You can imagine the difficulty of a movie better than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all go "Chick Flick" on me. I'm a very strong and wonderful man, a muscular man, thought to have been one of the best films in the last twenty years. <br /> <br /> The acting was great and the story was fantastic. This is a wonderful medicine for heart and soul. It was not the best representation nor the best movie. <br /> <br /> I knew very well that Mercedes Rohl, along with Holly Hunter, Joanne Blright, Edith Evans, Cisse Spacek and Judy Dench are among the greatest actresses to appear in the film. Of course, Kloris Leichmann (also in this film) may actually go beyond my point of view of her talent and diverse roles that have emerged over the years. In any case, this was a wonderful team. This movie was a book you can not put, and when you get to the last page, I wish more ... still more. I can not over my life understand why this movie is rated here on IMDb only 3.9 <br /> <br /> This rating here is absolutely amazing to me. Or maybe not. Maybe I really understand her well and that's what makes me really sad. It is so sad that films such as "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" have risen significantly from the charts in popularity when they were in fact at least in the opinion of viewers have got " R "classification ... r This is for" garbage ". Hello, I realize that there are so many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but it is a sad comment when this wonderful and powerful film looks ... unusual, director, actor, written. <br /> <br /> Obviously he was at the Oscars too .... how sad. And how predictable. My summary is that if you want to see a strong, happy, sad and beautiful story? Watching ...... Preferably owning this movie ...
