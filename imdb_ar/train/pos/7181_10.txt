He has been wearing eyeliner for nearly 6000 years in Egypt. It is really not so much of an extension as to be in the twelfth century. I also did not realize the series is floundering. There is a second season broadcast now is not it? It's amazing to me when comments are made by those who are either familiar with or do not watch any show at all. It is a waste of space on the boards and the time of others. The premiere of the series may have been a little painful as the actors began to appear in their place, but this is expected from any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can not wait until the second season starts in the United States.
