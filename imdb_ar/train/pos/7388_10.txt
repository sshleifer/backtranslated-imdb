74 Oscars were very good. The work of Whoopi as EmCee was very funny and light. I personally liked her latest appearance, which got some cold comments because of coarse language and nice jokes, but that's good. The audience seemed to like him. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen, and Sydney Poetier made this Oscar to remember. <br /> <br />
