This was one of the best programs ever offered for television. Full of ambiguity, intrigues, shifts and twists. Compulsive presentation. I was lucky because I saw this in the UK. Maybe they made a mistake in arranging the episodes, I can not remember that, but it was at least a regular time every week. My friend and I are hooked from the trailer, and none of us like the American series normally. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew that this was something special. We missed some episodes, and made you sad and mad for a week, we lost those stray rings. Gary Cole was very wonderful, better than his Custer role. Lucas Black made a great show for the baby, and Paige Turco was also at its best since the five. Of course, Nick Searsi, as a honest friend long suffering. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and confusing bits, which I suppose would have been explained later, and will undoubtedly be in a later series. . Make this finish weak, and you can say they killed it. What made us go? Why did they do it with one of the best performances ever? Shoot the exec.
