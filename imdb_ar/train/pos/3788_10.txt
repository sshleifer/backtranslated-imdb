This movie is awesome. It is real and stop, but at the same time completely insane. It is easy to fall in love with these characters, because they have many different minds, but each of us can refer to them at least. In Canada, we do not have many films from Eastern Europe, and for the few that I've seen, Loners is one of the best movies. It's very funny, magic. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go to Loners.
