Great entertainment from start to finish. Great deals from Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some transitions and many action scenes. Making the film for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as a tough sheriff and Railsback as the "evil villain". I recommend this movie to all adventure lovers! 10/10
