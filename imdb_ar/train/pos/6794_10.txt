I read through most of the comments posted here and all I can say is that most of these posters suffer from significant problems in life. Unlike most game shows, this offer was fun. Mr. Schattner, who was glamorous in all he did, was once again the success of the show. It's a champagne personality that really shines like a beacon wherever it goes. It's fun and makes you smile, and that's exactly what the show does too. The dancers and quizzes, fashion and round about it were just added to the attractive offerings. Although there is a lot of money at stake, it's fun. The pressure (stress) found in most game shows is not here. Many people who posted messages complained about the amount of time they had been blocked with dancers and choosing questions, & c, like Millionaire did not waste a similar time. All I can say is that most of you have lost the whole concept. The idea here is that you enjoy and enjoy yourself. There is something for everyone. Qustions to test your knowledge, eye candy (dances), suspense, Mr. Schattner's fun and fun character ... Well, if this does not work for men, I'm feeling bad for you; if that's not enough, you get rich! I really miss the show. Of all the games that have ever been shown, to be frank, I hate gaming shows, this is the program I really like and miss. The only other game I liked was Match Game.
