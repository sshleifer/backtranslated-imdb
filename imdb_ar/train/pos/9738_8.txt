Dear, we do not like it when our interests develop in the love of the supernatural hero, do we? <br /> <br /> Something has happened to people, they have lost their ability to enjoy it, a simple feeling of satisfaction and love. Story / Comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed out loud five times at least I am not ashamed to say tears in my eyes were also several times. The actors, the acting and the screenplay are great, I watch a lot of movies in all areas, and I have never seen a film of this kind been successful. Those who disagree please tell me where I can find some! I'm sure the book is very good but I think you should judge it based on its merits.
