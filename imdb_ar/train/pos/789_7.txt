Crush offers a mix of drama, humor and irony so I find that English develops well when it comes to heart issues. Known for directing John Mackay this wonderful scenario of forty-three friends in a small town in England. The three professional women who had rejoiced with the men formed a ceremonial night for the women, who gathered together with the jinn, flags and desserts included in endless chatter from the dates of their wrong behavior or needs. Andy McDowell once again surrounded by the British (and where I find him most exuded) is quite enchanting as her mistress in a prestigious school shares a younger man. The little town chatter contradicts jealous friends who refuse (cast a large supporter) with their relationship. A series of unfortunate and brutal events unfold and show us many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this film is friendships and the end just shows us that. This is the kind of movie you love or hate, and that's why I think there are a lot of mixed reviews and not that great success that was achieved when this movie was released. As I'm sure most of them are discovering the film now. I enjoyed this movie very much and strongly recommend to those who like such films as "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a funeral". Not to mention that soundtrack is an exceptional experience that captures those critical moments.
