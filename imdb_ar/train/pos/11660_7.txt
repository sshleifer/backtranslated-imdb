A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of ancient Celtic. The story is about the famous Kells book, which is believed to consist of monks from the small island of Iona, off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Narrated by a young trainee from the Abbotz family, he goes into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce knight without a pagan myth. Hoping to recover a missing artifact. <br /> <br /> True movies are in animation. A shaded cell in a bright and inspiring style of deep complexity that led to a seemingly less simple look. The Secret of Kels draws much of the artistic style of the legendary Cartoon Network series "Samurai Jack" for its ingenious use of markmaking and rear depth, and creates an influential Celtic world that lives under the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> <br /> History may be very inaccurate and imagine lifestyles lacking in realism but these facts are totally irrelevant because the film puts itself in a world of fantasy and Celtic mysticism. Jungle girl is a wonderful addition, and in my opinion make the picture as it is, sliding from branch to branch. Appearances and disappearances as a mysterious vagueness reminiscent of the legendary Cheshire Cat game of Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kels is an absolute pleasure. For all races, all ages, it's a beautiful part of family cinema. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to feel awe, but to like it!
