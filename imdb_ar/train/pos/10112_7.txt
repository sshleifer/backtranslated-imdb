This was originally caught again in 1996 in one week at the cinema theater. I was very touched by this and my feelings did not change much. <br /> <br /> A documentary about Edward D. Wood Jr. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. These include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller and Bela Lugosi Jr. Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from films or some strange recreation. It was interesting (to some extent) but was this really required? I have seen all the Wood movies which are awful. Wood had ambitions but he did not have a great talent for carrying them out. I would not say it was the worst outlet ever, but it is there. Do we really need to rely on a very modest filmmaker? I love the fact that they did not try to make Wood out to be a kind of saint. More than a few of the interviewees (especially Lugusi Junior) hated the man to a great extent and came up loud and clear. She also completely ignores his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. It is still of interest if you are a wood lover. The best interviews are with Vampira (who rips Wood) and Dolores Fuller (long girlfriend).
