The film Neil Simon Sunshine Boys, starring Walter Matau and George Burns, is a funny comedy about the strange bond of life and its shortness, but laughter is always a bitter taste. The vision of Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) are two major theater comedians who have now lessened the ambiguity of the difficult and persistent age of aging. You can only feel angry and blue. Willie never surrendered and continued to look for work, while Al tired of the players and retired to home at home to his daughter. The couple in his old age were really funny and sad, but the scene was out of brawl and quarrel, and neither spoke of eleven. Now if they work, they should go back to doing one of the best old TV show stories about the comedy story. Meet an explosive and free for old questions ??. The Neil Simon scenario gives the story a melancholy spirit. Blues and Blue have been able to achieve a lot of gags and laughter, and they have also achieved a good mix thanks to the great couple Walter Matthew (Best Actress Academy Award) and George Burns (the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor). The actors are very authentic and real, and their harmony seems to be working almost together throughout this time and this fact can not be held between them. The film also explores his playful reality as the story tells how the Love-Heat report that connects actors is an entirely real part of the stranger, but at the same time the things that are usually understood in life. My rate is 7.
