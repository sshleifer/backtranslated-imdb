And-it-hi !! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have a fun, independent chick in the early 90s of the New Yorker. Together with her friends in the party, she meets a mature Turkish salesman. It is an old story for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It is comforting to see that a winged woman is superior to a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us dodgers who may feel that their only skills are the ability to maintain them while they are hammered and refined for good concerts. <br /> <br /> In a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I never liked her, but this film makes me just want to watch all her movies. There are attractive properties that have mastered her personality. If you want to laugh well and have a good time, be sure to watch this movie. Repeated views are a must.
