I actually liked what I saw in this cartoon so far. Sure, animation is not the best, but frankly, it's better to see these types of graphics quickly and at a lower cost than the old one that was implemented quickly and at low cost (which often happens - it's just a good-looking technique when a lot of time is spent) And effort in it). There is nothing wrong with the corner lines and eyes with small black dots - in fact, I think it really cute. As a child I never thought the design of Scooby-Doo was particularly great, but I think I might like to know it better. <br /> <br /> In any case, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, true or not, but I think he has the most potential for some depth. Sure, the presentation does not focus on the original "puzzle-solving" theme, but it was just a tired old version anyway. Do not get me - I'm sure a book will be able to bring a lot of attention to the traditional endeavors of Mystery Inc. (Which was lacking late), but at the same time this show is a fun deviation from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but it's no longer just comic. They are still cowardly, but they finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same as those who indulge in over-eating as before, but now seem to be continuing their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's legacy. <br /> <br /> I used to find most of the original Scooby Doo jokes. To be a pure and unintentionally funny coward at best, but this offer actually exercises the ability of true humor. Also, I do not like Cassie Kassem never like Shaggy anyway, so the new actor does not bother me like other people do. (I still think Billy West was the best, though) <br /> <br /> In general, though not a great cartoon in the entire animation history, it is still one of the other scooby embodies.
