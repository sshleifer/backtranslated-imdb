I was absolutely shocked that this offer had been canceled. Continue for one year only. I've just started watching it and I like it. It's a show that can reach what friends have gone to. It was humor and was very fun. <br /> <br /> They are almost two brothers and two sisters living under one roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the part of the oldest brothers and takes on a larger parental role. <br /> <br /> This must last more than a year as it was wonderful. Amazing view with best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
