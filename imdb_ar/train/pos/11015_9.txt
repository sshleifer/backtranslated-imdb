This film is directed by Finnish Rene Harlin. Stallone is Gaby Walker. Cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renee Harlin knows how to run Action. Stallone needs this role to get back on track. Snowy Mountain is a very good place for action film and it is best to take out the film where the snow, snow, cold weather and bad are more than the Finnish guy. Good work! The music in the film is amazing. The bad guy is John Leto, and other stars Michelle Rucker (picture serial), Janine Turner (strong medicine). It is placed in a beautiful place and is a very sexy movie. In general a good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme äääliöt: special version for collectors, with good additions. Comige will soon be in Finland directly to the video.
