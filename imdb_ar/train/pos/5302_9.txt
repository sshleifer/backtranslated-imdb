This movie kept me entertained. In comparing this with my serial mom, Mr. Waters returned to his side more assertively. This is not nearly polished. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. A message about how to change a person's success and fame - but more importantly how people change around you. <br /> <br /> There is no wrong moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are fairly caricature ... but I want to believe that this is what Mr Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's great to see how Mr Waters evolved ... this is really his best. Action.
