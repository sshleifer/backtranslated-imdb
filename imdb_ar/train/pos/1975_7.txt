It seems that it became fashionable to rip "Basic Instinct 2" so much that a large part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released. It seems more fashionable to destroy Sharon Stone, who has represented us all? Now fourteen years old, unlike most of us, still looks great. The first comments on this film were so evil that I had to see it myself. In my opinion, this film is hardly as good as the original film, but it is not as bad as most claims claim. Michael Katon Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, nor Henry Penn and Liora Parish are Joe Ezetheras. "Basic Instinct 2" is just an amusingly entertaining medium, and besides adding the original score to Jerry Goldsmith, it still looks pretty much like its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, where Catherine Trimell creates an evil sensuality, which can occupy a great place among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is a smart actress who is not afraid of risk and can play in the camp in her spare time. Unfortunately, it seems to be the main goal for those who enjoy the dust from this fire. It has become very successful, a very big icon, and like all the actors who have reached this level, it is time and now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood fans. <br /> <br /> The rest of the team is fantastic, offering much better performances than materials. David Morisi is a far better and more interesting actor than Michael Douglas: his flawless representation, gives a thick and complex dimension to a one-dimensional character. Since it has more time on the screen and is the focus of the film, it can keep your attention from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend Basic Instinct 2 as a great movie; I just express my disapproval of most of the comments on this site and my conviction that the agendas other than the movie itself make up the opinion of most onlookers.
