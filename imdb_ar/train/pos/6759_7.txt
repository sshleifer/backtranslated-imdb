Where the pavement deserves to be a famous film directed by Otto Breminger, the man who gave the world Laura. This time he got the same stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. Tierney here is not sufficiently used for a more supportive role while the lights are directed to Andrews. <br /> <br /> A hard-core policeman used to deal with a group of thugs plays in a very powerful way until one night he accidentally kills the man in his arrest. When a taxi driver (TOM TULLY) is questioned, he continues to investigate the murder but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the daughter of the taxi driver (GENE TIERNEY). By the way, Tierney looks rather elegant for the girl she plays here and does not seem to fit the dark background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> The story takes a bleak turn during the investigation, which deepens and reveals that the dead man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero. In the end, turn into a moral story with Andrews developing a conscience about his crime. <br /> <br /> It's as wonderful as a Noir movie with offers capable of a strong support crew. A good entry into the field of Noir, Bremer took out strongly and played well by Andrews and Tierney, though slightly ill at her character.
