I am shocked. I was shocked and dismayed because 428 IMDB users who voted before me did not give this movie a rating higher than 7. 7? - This is C! If I can give FOBH 20, I'll do it gladly. This film ranks first on the top of the modern comedy group, along with Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most fun films ever. If you know _ anything about rap music - you should see this !! If you do not know anything about rap, learn something! , Then watch this! Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" fail to appreciate the inspiring genius of this unique film. If you love Bob Roberts, you'll love this. Watch it and vote it 10!
