As a child I preferred the first Care Bear movie because it looked very dark. I always sat and watched the first one. As I grew older I learned to do better. What I think is that the film is too dark for babies, but the older you get, the more you learn to be proud of it because you understand it more, it does not look as dark as it used to when I was a child. > <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first film, everything is much deeper. May contrast with the first movie but you should ignore the first movie to watch this movie. Cubs are very adorable, and he attributed the scene to "Flying My Colors". I tend to annoy everyone by singing it. <br /> <br /> The sound track is great! Big hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I've downloaded it all and listen to it, listen to "Our Beginning" and also known as "Reminder" at the moment. I always preferred this audio track to my first track, though I absolutely love the Carol Kings song in Care-A-Lot. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is fantastic, and the animation in all the movies is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat and watched it after about 10 years and I saw that the animation at the time was excellent. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There are not a lot of backups from others to say this is a great movie, but it's awesome. I do not think it's weird / weird. I think it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this film revolves around how Care Bears and Demon, Dark Heart. The sudden ending and again, surpassing any "Pokemon Movie" issues with Care Bears Moral leaves an impact on you. Again, this film can teach everyone at all ages morality.
