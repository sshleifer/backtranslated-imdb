The Spirit of Will Eisner will fade with the TV screen after many other offers developed from comic strip pages or comic books. It is ironic that this is the only and only adaptation (even at the time of writing) of the intelligent, wise, cracking, and supernatural Eisner hero. <br /> <br /> The story says that Republic Pictures was interested in making a copy of the film and was negotiating with the copyright owner in the mid-1940s, but they were never able to close the deal. The play on the screen has become the serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of Republic's best games. Perhaps so, because this studio had a tendency to tamper with material borrowed from comic strips, pulp twigs, radio and comic books. <br /> <br /> As for this 1987 film, it was clearly a failed experiment for a proposed television series. While the old comic-book reader, like me, may be a bit harsh in criticizing one of the edits, the uncommon viewer of personality may be able to make some new observations, clear from any preconceived notions of what the screen version should look like. <br /> <br /> Well, while sitting and watching the story unfold, with the characters interacting amidst a wave of crime, the little lady (my wife, Mrs Ryan) named one. "This can not decide whether it is serious or not!" This well describes both the soul and its creator Mr. Will Eisner, the real creative genius in comedy. <br /> <br /> The film is an honest attempt to put the world of Eisner on screen. Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Eileen were very good. Although in a contemporary environment, he was still in the tradition of "old days" as far as fashion goes, you know, when men and women were still wearing hats! This final point (and labyrinth) stands out, and this is that the director and producer made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters the appearance of Will Weisner as much as facial expressions and body language. We say, glory to them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's too bad for any series to follow! Oh, well in today's animated world, comics appear to be a hot element. Some top producers and filmmakers may be able to produce a first class SPIRIT for the big screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6/4/2008. Now, see everyone who goes to the movies at the Multiplexes shopping center poster that announces the new film for THE SPIRIT, (which will be released on Christmas Day, 2008). Well, then we'll see what we're talking about. Just keep your fingers crossed! To connect ............. <br /> <br /> Second Update: We saw the new film, delivered by Frank Miller for "The Soul" two days ago. Well, we've got our wish; but is this a good thing or another case of "be careful what you ask; because you might get it?" Please read our writing elsewhere at IMDb.com. THANX!
