This is a film for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates the atmosphere of Nuer for post-war Germany. You get absorbed in the dream and you just leave at the end of the credits. The plot necessarily comes second, but it is still an exciting story with challenging issues. Just wonderful
