Well, I think I'm emotionally attached to this film because it's the first film I went to see more than 10 times in the cinema ... Help me through my master's thesis, or rather prevent me from working on it! <br /> <br /> But to watch it again several years (and many movies) later - what a small well prepared gem! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow perform more convincingly, and Jeremy Northham is the ideal Mr. Knightley - where does one meet such a man ??? << <Sigh >> >> The Role of Sophie Thompson as Ms. Beats is her best acting (oh, napkins, sorry!) And the rest of the crew is not too disappointed - Tony Collett brings a lot of Muriel to Harriet, Ewan McGregor is magically enchanted - Caming and Juliet Stevenson are the ideal "impossible" couple! The atmosphere of the film - Although cinematography and artistic decoration go, they are a case of visual overload. Very very beautiful, but may be a little more austerity feeling better than the period. But the good thing is that the film does not take itself seriously, and there is a lot of fun - and some wonderful adjustments - that prevent it from drowning in the sacrament of Merry Old England. <br /> <br /> My favorite of particular is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and acting here, and the closing dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley beautifully. It is a pity that the scene of the final proposal continues for a very long time - cut off shots (I can think exactly which ones!) And it would be more in line with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Hey Gosh, I just realized (by reading the imdb listings) that I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three films without realizing that he was - it seems he got a lot of things for him, as an actor, just Being an English heartthrob gentleman! Well, I think I need to pay to visit my video store ... <br /> <br /> A nice movie. My favorite adaptation of Jane Austen so far - although the sensation and sense of Ang Lee is, frankly, the best film, this film is closest to my heart - and I have certainly seen it several times! See it if possible - and not too hard on its small flaws. <br /> <br />
