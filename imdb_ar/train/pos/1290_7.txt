Yes, I remember this one! Many years since I actually saw. The story was completely surreal, but wonderful! What anyone who classifies and reviews films to take into account is what the film is about. It's the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Certain movies - like this movie here - are aimed only at plain and comic nonsense. These films can not be classified from the point of view of critical references. Of course, these films lack quality, lack a sophisticated story, often lack first-class acting, but if they meet their basic premise - that's fine. I do not have this movie here on my favorite list at all, but I still think it was fun, it has some very interesting sequences and a good story. Brian Bonsal is an intelligent actor anyway.
