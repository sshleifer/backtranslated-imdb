Lisa Boomer (Ida Ghali) is a prostitute adulterous businessman who inherits a million-dollar life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash during a business trip. Initially she is suspected of being responsible because their husbands will be aware of the time recently changed, so she has insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and INTERPOL worker on her tail just to be sure. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece to take advantage of her inheritance, but insists on getting it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch, now known as Boomer, is trying to protect her from her husband's lover, Lara Florakis, who is trying to kill her both for her share of the money she believes she deserves. This is where the masked murderer begins brutal killings. Lynch is as usual with our hero initially suspected by the Greek police and warned of leaving Athens by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistelli is a familiar face in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then assisted by local journalist Cleo DuPont (Anita Strindberg) who helps him investigate the killings. They say that anyone else can destroy the movie for anyone who has not seen it, so it's enough to say that there are a lot of red rangers, most of them to keep Mystery / Thriller fans happy in this Giallo.The No Shame DVD story. Of English and Italian soundtracks. It also has a very attractive degree just for the good Nikolai Bruno that will stay in your head for a while .... All in all first class Giallo.
