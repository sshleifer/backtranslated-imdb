Rumors that he soon has that father? The favorite star of the award-winning Swedish disco has reached its climax, and the band is disappointed with English-language singing and eager to perform in their mother tongue. Soon after, the problems began to emerge in a partnership between Eve and narrow, and recordings became less frequent. The band was dissolved, albeit informally, in 1982 and lost pop music as one of the most famous artists. Although they never acknowledged the existence of any truth in these rumors, the fact remains that ABBA would not have been a great success if they had only registered their mother tongue. If you want to appeal to the largest media market to make money around the world, you have to meet the needs of native English speakers. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to me how this small island lies within a stone's throw that could have been far from the European continent for the most recognized, though not the most widespread, language in the world. Everyone speaks little English. Whether it's simply "Hello" or a common word - you'll find an English speaker almost everywhere. Pedro Galindo obviously did not agree, because Trampa Infernal was never translated into global consumption until it was recently released on the DVD for the budget. This is a real shame, because in fact a decent polite film is much better than many native English speakers. <br /> <br /> The movie is released in a somewhat unfamiliar area of ​​the gun duel. Two anonymous people are being shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex looking for each other for the inevitable final confrontation. After some thrill and two near misses, one of the pistoleers comes out victorious. After that, we learned that they were just guns and balls and that two of the contenders were actually young people from the local town. Nacho and Mauricio are the toughest rivals, and Mauricio has always tried to prove himself better than his gentle rival, but he has not yet succeeded. <br /> <br /> Later that night, as the victorious gunman celebrates his victory with his girlfriend Alejandra and his friend Charlie, Mauricio enters the bar and says he faces a final challenge to his glorious enemy. He says that this will be the competition that will prove to the city once and for all who deserve the utmost respect. Nacho is hesitant at first because Alejandra warns him of continuing competitive risks, but eventually succumbs to pressure from peer pressure and agrees; he hates his morally superior partner. <br /> <br /> They plan to go to the remote area of ​​Filo di Cebalo, because recent press coverage has reported that many people have been slaughtered because of what locals believe is an evil bear. Mauricio suggests that whoever kills the animal can be considered the greatest and also promises that it will be the last battle he is waging against his opponent. <br /> <br /> After visiting the weapons storehouse to store weapons and ignoring warnings from the guard of the elderly stores, the group set off after isolated forests. Hunting Hunters They know that the "bear" is actually a Vietnamese veterinarian killed still unaware that the war is over and considers all humans his enemy. What began as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival where the malicious killer stalks and kills her. <br /> <br /> While I was studying in Madrid, Trumpa picked up a Mexican student who lived in the next bedroom for me. I remember that the version I saw was wrong and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the end of the final credits, which meant that I could never see the final scenes. Luckily, I recently came across the budget DVD on Amazon and immediately added it to my collection. <br /> <br /> The Gallindo slasher project is an amazingly good effort to outperform its skilful direction and passionate plot that tries to cover areas that do not usually come close to curly films. She is actually so good that she reminded me on more than one occasion of the classic Arnold Schwarzenegger predator. This is particularly evident in scenes that show a masked killer creeping across the jungle and chasing the panic squad as they struggle to escape from the Maniacs Stadium. <br /> <br /> Although Galindo is clearly aware of the specific qualities (the brave man uses a glove-clawed glove alongside Freddy Crogar), Trampa also tries to add something different to the standard template. While most of the run time plays according to the concrete rules of the class, the last third preaches an important step in the individual, where the madness itself takes place with a submachine gun and lures the hero on his lair in the final confrontation. From here on, the film switches the species quickly and becomes almost a moving film, which will inspire your taste or will disappoint you. Another slant tried to walk in these two ways is to enter the lousy 1980s "The Majorettes", which is not necessarily a good thing. <br /> <br /> As with many Latin movies (especially Spanish clicks by Almodovar and Aminabar), Trumpa has a subtle hidden story, which is successfully transferred without destroying the shaved viewer. Indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and may not always be the winner. It is a sugar-coated point, but it is processed precisely enough not to detract from the fun of the feature. <br /> <br /> Trampa may be a cheese, but it deserves to be seen and recognized as one of the best late chips. The killer looks great in the fearsome army clothes, the white mask of Valentine's Day and the original attempts at work. It may lack the gravitas enjoyed by most faithful honest horror, but it has enough suspense and creativity to warrant at least one watch.
