I have seen this film once in or near its release 36 years ago (1969). Although I can now remember only parts of it, I am eager to see it again. The parts I remember, right or wrong, include mustard gas in trenches and Susie Kendall as German spy, where some erroneous sexual services are provided in the back of a closed truck for military information. The musical result was particularly memorable in the Gone With The Wind passion and I would like to hear it again. There must be a commercial reason or copyright for this film not available. Anyone know why? I doubt anything related to the lack of quality or interest.
