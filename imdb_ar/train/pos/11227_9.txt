Hidden Frontiers - It's more than just a fan's imagination - it's a thoughtful and systematic series to keep Star Trek worlds alive and growing. From a pleasant little fan project to a well-known net chain. Hidden Frontiers contains something like this for all its star trekkers. Set in Star Star Trek Time Lines: Next-Generation Time Lines / DS9 and Voyager, Hidden Frontier addresses topics and issues raised in the other Star Trek series with story collections using characters, intrigues and sophisticated storylines. Star Trek Hidden Frontier received the social context stories that Gene Roddenberry failed to display on the screen and showed the evolution of characters in long-term space assignments - real things happening in nearby places as well as spatial wars and exciting conflicts. In the "Green Screen" studio, Hidden Frontiers brings you a group of actors on screen and in your hearts. The big cast plays a good role together and adds time and energy to the project. The innovative use of green screen technology, props, make-up and fashion works to make the hidden border worlds of Star Trek enjoyable and reliable. Hidden borders have gone where a few people go to the science fiction world and thrived once they get there. Hidden Frontier offers a great complement to a well-thought-out web site with interesting discussion forums, access to creative staff, producers and actors, and a fun weekly conversation. I would recommend taking the time to download and watch.
