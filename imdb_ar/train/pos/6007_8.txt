If you do not hear this movie from Walt Disney Pictures, do not worry about it. Will be classified along Disney's other films designed for educational purposes such as Family Planning. <br /> <br /> It was co-produced with Kotex to teach pre-teen girls about menstruation, presumably. He learns only on a superficial level, so he does not go into heavy details about the "head-head" sequence / reproductive system. <br /> <br /> The movie features elements of Disney World, such as turning the page and using animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to find this movie, so if you can find the movie, it's all right for you.
