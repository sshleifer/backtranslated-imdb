At first you think that another Disney production film, may be good, but it's a children's movie. But when you see it, you can only enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10 years old and now after 8 years I still love it! Danny Glover is wonderful and can not play the role better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and perfect for the part. Tony Danza is very reasonable like Mel Clarke. You can not help, but to enjoy this movie! Give it 10/10!
