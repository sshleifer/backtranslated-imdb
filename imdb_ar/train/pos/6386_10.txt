Disney, the name of the movie that once defended everything innocent and suitable for all ages, finally began to realize that in order to survive it needs to become more diverse. This diversity has been very clear in the past two years. Films such as "Tarzan" and "The Emperor's New Groove" have tried to stay away from the traditional song-based routines of Disney's past and to a new unknown territory. "Atlantis" is the boldest step yet, but remember: it's STILL Disney. The first serious film coming out of the Disney Animation Studio is a big achievement for them - in fact it's so dangerous that it makes it into PG. Perhaps the reason why so many families feared seeing him last summer. <br /> <br /> But despite the most mature theme, it is still a film Disney wanted to draw from families, not just mature audiences, so the plot must have been kept simple enough for children to understand, but Interesting enough to keep it away from the worlds of The Little Mermaid and others. <br /> <br /> So what we got is actually a potentially elaborate plot, unfortunately suffering a blow from that condense into a 96 minute film. In the end, this is a motion film about Atlantis, not about the show that precedes it, so we are concerned during the first half of an hour with as many sequences of screen bombing possible without losing consistency. Suspend your disbelief about how characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find a detailed Hollywood movie! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, go to James Titanium "Titanic". Both films show a boat in some way. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about love, are we? Yes, as with so many films, the main males (one of them Milo Thatch, the disgruntled archaeologist) and the eminent lady (Keda, the vulgar Atlantic princess) will fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as cliche as I expected. By the end of the film, for one time, the characters that were touching / feeling / kissing were calmer. There are many points in the film where attractions grow, but not only in the "Little Mermaid" playground (a good thing). <br /> <br /> You may have realized that this is something rather a clich√©d film. He shouted. You have a prominent hero and a hero, backed by more than half a dozen crew members who go to the campaign, all give their moments during the film. Many other characters appear, it took a few minutes of screentime, and then disappear. Does not it take genius to do mathematics? 96-minute film focusing on work and photos, and with a large cast, has very little time to expand the characters to a large extent. So what do you rely on? Cliches, and lots of them. Every character simulates something that was done a thousand times. You have a disgruntled world, an attractive princess, a square-jawed colonel, a rich eccentric, a maniacal turtle, and a Russian girl Fam ?? Do I need to continue? <br /> <br /> I do not know why this is for anyone? I found the nature of the tongue in this movie very amusing. Well, this is supposed to be a serious click, but do you really expect Disney to give up on every feature of its history? At least, the book has tried to come up with an intelligent dialogue always, and sometimes it is somewhat inspired. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it was these great images that put ice in this cake. CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and dwarf characters, which were a flaw allowed to Titan Titan. Down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside artist in the comedy industry to create designs, making the cartoon style in the film. The visual presentation of the entire film owes much to animations, much more than any previous Disney picnic. This resulted in a conflict with Japanese animators "Nadia" due to the overall similarities in the film with the animated series mentioned. After I have not seen this card, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> With the picture, there is a sound. Gary Rydstrom chairs the sound team, and what are the soundtracks! From the opening shot, the sound stage is lively and fun. James Newton Howard treats us with a dynamic musical result, complementing the film in every way, never looking out of place and always helping to build or subdue it. <br /> <br /> I may have missed the goal of what the creators intended. For me, the film is an exciting adventure, albeit more serious than any Disney film before. If you do not like the position of your smiling tongue, the visual effort may be fun. Heck, at least the legends are much healthier than what can be said about other Disney efforts (* cough * hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown up by this movie. I always comment not to endorse with any animated film? After all, the laws of the real world are often broken in the center of the animation. So relax and enjoy the trip, and everyone may find something to enjoy in this movie.
