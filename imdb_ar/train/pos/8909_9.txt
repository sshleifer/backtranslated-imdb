This one is well known so I will not dig into it. The basic story revolves around two teenagers who discover about a strange bubble of goo that reaches the earth across the meteor. Human contact with this mud ball burns through flesh like acid. They also absorb human bodies making them grow larger. No one believes teenagers (Steve McCain and his girlfriend) and when they do it in the end, it seems that the point can not be stopped. He's done well with his age, and unlike many other fifties, the pace is very fast. The story is so unique that it is worth watching for any science fiction fan and the old monster. If you can dig a serpent snake in the 1980s, be sure to get a new version of '88 'as well.
