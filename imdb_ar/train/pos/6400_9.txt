This film is a wonderful example of storytelling. Great acting. The story is inspirational without excessive or fake manipulation. There were a couple of points where they might have made a boy better or worse than they really were, but considering that it was a Hollywood movie, they showed a wonderful grip. There was not one explosion appearing in the film, although they had one chance. The film, with suspicious parts, was not converted into motion film. And then the story focuses on an unusual man in normal times unfortunately. Well done!
