I always love this wonderful baseball movie! He has good reps including two awesome actors and two of my favorite Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this film are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Lungo, Tony Danza, and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay or Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has great special effects and acts from all actors of the film! Baseball sights are all realistic! Music composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits the film well! Some of the actors who reminded me of the actual baseball personalities. Ray Mitchell's character for Tony Jackson reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConogee's character Steve Stefley reminded me, and Jay O'Orn. This is a great movie for baseball fans and others, and I highly recommend this movie!
