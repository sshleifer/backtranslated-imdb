One of the great things about many wonderful Chinese movies that you can find, if you're lucky, is in video stores, they are very accurate stories about real real stories. Farewell, my concubine, the Emperor and the murderer and this film are perfect examples. Filmmakers take a real story and work hard to create a film without compromising facts for dramatic or commercial comfort - the hallmark of much of Hollywood, especially Disney movies. <br /> <br /> In this story, we are following in recent years the performance of a local artist known as the "King of Masks" to master the art of change in Sichuan. Besides losing his only son several years ago, he is looking to find a male heir to continue his rare art that dies in a society that prevents females from doing such work. Mr. Wang is sold by a slave trader. Everything is fine as he prepares joyfully to pass his art. But the son finally discovered that he was a girl. From there, the story became very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera - the regional opera style of Beijing Opera. My Concubine farewell fans should look carefully at Mr. Liang's portrayal of a male playing the role of women in Chinese opera. This may help them to understand that the players of these female roles may not have been gay or castrati, but they have psychic people to the point that they do not know exactly about their sexuality.
