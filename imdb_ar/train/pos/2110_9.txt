Much has been written about the film's scheme, the wonderful performance of the acting, the script, the melancholy, the sweet atmosphere, the wonderful direction - what can I add? See only one of the most exciting scenes of global warming, the most beautiful and impressive scenes ever shot. It is Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (the shopkeeper - Mr. Matushik) is recovering from his broken marriage and attempted suicide. When he leaves all of his staff, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. All of them politely reject him. They have all plans on their Christmas Eve. At this stage, there is a deep sadness for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives his career performance and this scene leads me to cry easily. Luckily we have a happy pleasure for this very special scene. The new employee, the homeless boy, is the last to go out of the store to a beautiful snowy street scene. Mr. Matoshik is desperate to approach this boy and ask him how he likes to spend the evening with him, and will treat him with all the wonderful Christmas food that may have never been seen in this boy! Lonely like Mr. Matuschek and together they can get a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene moves me. If you can get the fun DVD, look at the great track where Frank Morgan presented himself as Mr. Matushk and the director of the film - the talented Ernst Lubitch. This film is a joy from start to finish.
