It's hard to put your finger on this one. Basically, I suppose it's a comedy about a drunken rich drunk falling in love with a poor (relatively) poor girl who wants to marry her at the risk of being abandoned by his family. <br /> <br /> These are funny moments, romantic moments, and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and makes his character self-loving in some way, Lisa Menelli is a convincing paper like the belligerent opposite that attracts him, but John Gilgod steals the show as a cynical butler at Arthur. <br /> <br /> It is grainy but great fun with memorable soundtracks, and ran for about 3 months in our local fleapit.
