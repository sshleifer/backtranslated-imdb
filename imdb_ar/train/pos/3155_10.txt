I hope the 1970s program will return to television. It was the greatest show ever !!! They have to make rings between the other rings but of course it will be confusing. But I hope you come back and will make more episodes. Please come back ... the show was very hilarious. You can not laugh without seeing a ring. There is a really funny part in each episode in addition to that the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other. Those were the best episodes. "This 70s is the best" .... it will always be and will be the best show ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They must make new rings.
