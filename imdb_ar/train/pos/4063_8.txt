The castle in the sky is undoubtedly Hayao Miyazaki's film. After seeing him for the first time, I am happy to say that he does not disappoint me. On the contrary, you can get your time value, that means (regarding Miyazaki movies that matter), this is nothing short of excellent! <br /> <br /> Castle in the Sky, which was produced early in his career, predicts many of the brands in his subsequent films, with strong (but young) characters, forced to grow because of external circumstances, and helped by exciting characters Very interesting (and sometimes lovable). And of course, the usual battle of nature against civilization, flying machines (lots of them !!), beautiful scenery ?? But unfortunately, no pigs (at least I noticed it, after all I saw only once). No less, Miyazaki had already received his first theatrical performance two years ago, with Nausika, which was a rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his great authorship. Castle in the Sky is part of these two things, with a movement full of the first 30 minutes, similar to his television series Conan, and his directed episodes from Meitantei Holmes. Here we met Chita, a girl literally falling from the sky, to discover Pazu, a young boy working in a small mining town in the countryside. Fascinated by her memory loss and suspected of having a relationship with the mysterious city of Labota, Paso was designed to help her know where she came from while fleeing the army and a gang of air pirates. As the film progresses, the plot becomes heavier and more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at its best. <br /> <br /> The sound track is very spirited away (or vice versa, where Castle in the Sky was first produced), and like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts at a very light degree, which gets more complicated and more appropriate Beautiful with the progression of the plot! <br /> <br /> Note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation of the two main stars, although Chita Anna Pachin has a very thick tone (that actress was still at that stage of her career), and goes to Mark Hamel in the role of Moska, to make up for the evocative villain yet! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this person!
