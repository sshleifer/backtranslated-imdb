Basically, I like Verhoeven because I enjoy a wonderful sexual psychology story I saw in the film "Basic Instinct". It's really a great movie I enjoyed so much. It is clear to me that I am watching this film Verheven as well. <br /> <br /> Well, it was his former direction before the "Block Instinct" hit "Basic Instinct" and that's why I was so curious to see this film and yes, the film achieved my hope and expectations. <br /> <br /> This "Fourth Man" is a wonderful sexual psychological drama that is a little complicated for some audiences. The story revolves around a gay writer named Reeve (Krabi), an alcoholic who lives according to his moral values ​​and sees many visions that might warn him of an accident in the future. After his lecture, an attractive woman called Christine A mysterious past that you do not want to reveal. She had sex with her in her house as a boy. The next morning, she saw her close, muscular boyfriend on her desk. , The person who met him at the station. It is strange to meet him and tell Christine by inviting him to her home. <br /> <br /> That's it. I do not want to reveal the entire story because it is a film Verhoeven and the end of the film really amazing! <br /> <br /> In particular, I like the character "Reve" which was brilliantly played by "Krabbe". I mainly like his acting because, as a gay person, I am very similar to his character and yes I love his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr. Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. This film was made: 10 out of 10.
