Many people disliked this film, but I blame two facts - 1 - they want to be like the first couple of American pancakes. And 2 - trying to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The one I found was the best of the six, and I love Dwight perfectly. The plot is predictable, I will say so, but then what is teen comedy? Wild trip, dirty deeds, etc., are all incredibly predictable, but still funny! I say that this is worth watching, I like it, and I find it hilarious. You do not see it while comparing it to priorities because there is nothing. <br /> <br /> After watching Naked Mile and this, it became clear that all American Pie movies were circling around, and just about, wrestlers. It is FINE by me. <br /> <br /> See. Enjoy. Love. Achievement
