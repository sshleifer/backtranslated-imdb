The audience in 1936 must have been surprised by what they were watching: a beautiful full-length technicolor film. I can not say for sure, but this was probably the first one (3 strip). Anyway, it still looks nice after 70 years on a DVD. In fact, how good it is, it's great. <br /> <br /> Kodos should go to director Richard Bolzovsky, director of photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures, and DVD-MGM Home Entertainment. They all met to offer us one of the best films in the era of the classical era. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was fantastic: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. She gave a nice message in the end, although many people probably were not happy with her. I can not say more without spoiling things. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Dietrich did not look better off, and I do not think, and certainly never played such a nice character (Domini Infelden). Charles Bauer was a male star and an emotional Domini object, but some small characters were the most interesting to me. Such as Joseph Childcroft as "Patos"; John Carradine as "The Divine Sand"; most memorable for me at least was the dancer Irina, played by Tilly Loos. Wow, there's a face and a dance that will never forget them! I've never seen anything like it in the thousands of movies I've seen. Just seeing her doing her thing was worth the price of a DVD. When looking at her autobiography IMDb, she was in only four films, but they were all well-known. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who is really famous for "Sherlock Holmes", is also here as C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his day. Incidentally, Childcroot will be recognized by classic movie buffs as the man who played the role of arrogant sales clerk in the big song "The Shop Around The Corner" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> Fine things, photography, colors, and Tilly dance are the things I'll remember best about this movie that contains a lot of good and bad things that are all integrated into one movie. If the last half hour was better - although I admire the end - I would classify it higher. Sure, film collectors want to add them to their collection.
