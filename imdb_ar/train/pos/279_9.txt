I like how this game can make you literally jump out of your seat as you play. The way the screen jumps and blinks when you hit it is very realistic at the same time that you should remember it is just a game and you do not already have it. Sound effects and sound are amazing. There are lots of different weapons and caresses that you can throw and you can even choose the talismans that make them stronger or not. You can get this stone which can expel the enemies while reclaiming Mana to blow up your opponents more magically. The best part is that all the time you play, you really feel the shock and fear of what may lie in the next corner or what may jump behind you. If you'd like to get the full experience, try turning it on with your headphones.
