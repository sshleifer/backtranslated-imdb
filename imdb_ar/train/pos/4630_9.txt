This is the second Eitan Fox film I've seen. The great actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, also has a secondary role in this film. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Verzer) and Yale (Alon Friedman); the Palestinian who joins them and Ashraf - ). There is a kind of friends / sex in the city around him (mostly gay), and they all just want the war to end so that they can continue their lives safely. <br /> <br /> But, that's friction. No matter how many posters you put or the number of raveings for your peace, the war will not end. Many people have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to continue for whatever reason. There are many on the Israeli side, here and there in the United States, wanting only everything and not thinking about peace. There are many on the Palestinian side who will obviously be unemployed if peace comes. It is in no one's interest to end this war, and children are suffering. <br /> <br /> This is always in your mind as you watch this funny and attractive film. Will not go away. You know something tragic will happen, of course, happens. With feelings of feelings on both sides of force and revenge as an incentive, tragedy always occurs, and this makes this version of friends / sex in the city of adults. There is no surface. It's real life and it was a nice thing to see.
