I did not hear about Robert Roy McGregor before the movie "Rob Roy," but the film is definitely worth watching. Liam Nison, who plays the role of character, plays the same spirit in the role he brought to Oscar Schindler, and Jessica Lang also does a good job like his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one person who is likely to get your skin crawling. <br /> <br /> All in all, this shows well like "Braveheart" (probably better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood releases two opposite movies and takes them in England. very good. He has also starred John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Fleming.
