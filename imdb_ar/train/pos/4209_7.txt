"Pickup On South Street" is a high-speed play about a small-time criminal who suddenly finds himself involved in the activities of a group of Communists. The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic manner and the momentum is maintained with some great adjustments. The use of a wide range of different camera angles and close proximity contributes to the overall impression of continuous and energetic movement. Samuel Fuller's style of directing and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald is excellent and there are many scenes that through its composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Ace pickpocket and repeat the culprit Skip Skip Mcoy (Richard Widmark) plunges into deep water when he steals a purse from a young woman named Candy (Jean Peters) on the subway in New York. She was used by her ex-boyfriend Joey (Richard Kelly) to deliver her to one of his contacts in a communist organization that was unknown to her, and was carrying the secrets of the US government recorded on microfilm. Two FBI agents were following candy and witnessing theft. One of the agents continues to go to an air apartment and the other, Zara (Willis Boshi), visits Captain Dan Tiger (Morphine Vee). Zara explains that the FBI is following Candy for several months as part of their quest for a leader of a communist group. <br /> <br /> In order to identify the starch, Tiger calls in the "stool" called Moe (Thelma Ritter), which, after giving a precise description of the method of "cannon" at work, lists a list of eight potential suspects. Once Tiger sees Scape's name on the list, he is immediately convinced that he is the man who needs to be tracked down and sends investigators to arrest him. When Scib is brought to Tiger's office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger's offers to drop any fees if he cooperates with the investigation. Skip Flip and arrogance. He obviously does not trust Tiger and denies any knowledge of robbery in the subway. <br /> <br /> Joey Candy orders to know who stole the microfilm and then retrieves it. Candy takes the title of Moe for Skip and when Skip returns from his interrogation by Tiger, Candy finds his house and knocks it unconscious before stealing its money. When she recovers, Scibe asks for $ 25,000 for microfilm. Joy was told about Scib's request, and an air chief gave him a gun and ordered him to retrieve the microfilm by the following evening. <br /> <br /> Scip & Candy are attracted to each other, due to their unstable and evolving relationship. To develop a means through which they can get rid of the police attention. But it soon becomes clear that resolving the issues with the Communist gang will only be achieved through more direct action. <br /> <br /> Scibe Kandy and Mau are depicted as characters living in an abnormal world where they are forced to face great risks on a strong and convincing daily basis. <br /> <br /> Moe's work as a police informant depends on her knowledge of people in her community, but these people also know what she and anyone else are doing. Of them can seek revenge at any time. They seem sly and uninhabited on the street, but have a weak side too because they describe themselves as "an old clock evading" and provide the funds to be able to get a proper burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island. Her belief that "every buck has its own meaning" leads to the sale of any information regardless of danger, friendships or principles, but there is one occasion in which it rejects and this proves death. Thelma Ritter definitely deserves Oscar nomination for her role. <br /> <br /> Jumping is a violent criminal who does not care about his victims and has already been convicted three times in the past and lives under constant threat of life imprisonment if convicted again. Nevertheless, he continues to pursue his criminal activities, and strangely, philosophically, when Mo betrays his place and then ensures that the Ministry of Education receives the kind of burial that you highly value. Candy Hawker is a former person whose activities constantly put her at risk but her stiff outer back makes the warmer side clearer. Both Widmark and Peters are ideal for their role, and Ritter depicts the different aspects of their characters in a wonderful manner and conviction.
