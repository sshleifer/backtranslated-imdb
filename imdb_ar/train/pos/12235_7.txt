The "Amazing Fusion Man" is a Z-type production that is fantastically full of vitality and vitality, so that every maniac obsessed with self-respect must see it himself! The ideal way to describe the low-budget 1970's jewel is like a slippery version of Hammer's "Quatermass Xperiment" ... just a thousand times! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of a catastrophic space mission, but it turns out that he is pregnant with a terrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes his dissolution! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve gets out of the hospital, leaving behind a sticky pudding and retraction of the body parts. The doctor Ted Nelson should find him urgently, since the disease put Steve with a physical appetite for the human body. The premise may seem quite stupid but this is a very fun click and has great makeup effects from Rick Baker's hand. It's like a rotten pizza and its heavy breathing makes it look like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that the scenario of William Sachs does not waste any time on boring scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The dissonance begins immediately and continues until the last moment of the film. Just enjoy this ridiculous horror and try to stop your mind as much as possible, because if you begin to think of many stupid script, you will miss the opportunity to enjoy all the fun!
