I did not expect much from this film. I got a ticket for an advanced check. I just got out of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in line for 40 minutes, and there seemed to be no cool air flowing through the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once sitting in the theater, fatigue and frustration, the film began, I did not know any of the actors at first, but the flow of the film was perfect. From the beginning, I was a consumer of the film, and became more enthusiastic with every passing minute. I think this film is destined to be classic in fiction / fairy tales. The actors were fantastic, the pace was perfect, and the finish was magical.
