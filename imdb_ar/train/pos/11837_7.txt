It is a wonderful film in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and easily illustrates that there are a lot of producers who make visually great films like anything coming from a Disney studio. <br /> <br /> There is one difference from Disney's normal price that this Dreamworks movie does not include some judicious side kicks to ease comedy. There are no sudden moments where characters turn into a song. I am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film will not appear in Disney's image: the birth of the soul. But it is done with taste and not attack at all. The "soul" was a wonderful breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is yet another example of the fantastic mobile fare. Once it was over, my children wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
