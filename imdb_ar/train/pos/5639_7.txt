I have read other reviews and found some comparison between the real life of cinema v (for example, what it takes to get to the music school), Britney Bashing, etc., so let's focus on the film and message. <br /> <br /> This film has rated 7 out of 10 for the 8 to 14 year old and for the family movie. For average adult males .... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I love pop / rock, I am 45. I know Britney Spears but I did not realize they already sang the strongest so I read credits and these reviews . I did not know her poster on the wall, so I was not worried about any "self-promotion." <br /> <br /> I watch movies for entertainment. I do not care about acting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the film and does it distract me? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the message. The greatest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (another full story) that has been seen with the message in mind, because this is an area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and sexy, great for children. I found that Texan twang began to fade during the film, and of course there are only so many ways to deliver a surrender / not surrender message, so it was a little predictable. Although the great message ... must be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful family movie, but to get a watch of its own, get Hannibal.
