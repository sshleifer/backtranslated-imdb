As a man who saw all the seasons, I can say that JG surprises me constantly. I mean, after seeing him move from laughter to paranoia immediately over the course of the seasons and after every little nod he made you think he was a gangster, I thought to yourself: Well, he's a good actor and he can get into the bandits' skin. But seeing him open his eyes and struggle for his life, I mean I almost felt the pain he "made" believe he was passing through. I was so impressed by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely better than their generations and more. But for the time being, either old or dead (Brando), it's fine that it produces less films and offers "lighter" than it used to be. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films where he plays a completely different role. Can you recommend me some of his older films with unforgettable performance?
