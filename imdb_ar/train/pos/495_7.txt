<br /> <br /> There are STAR TREK canon - lots of it. From the law we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new objects, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE ignores a lot of ST. An unfortunate fact for a long time serious fans. As one, I assumed that producers would take at least a look at the first few episodes of the TOS and return from there - but no. <br /> <br /> Turtles, like much of the technology, look much more modern than they found in the TOS. The old-fashioned Starfleet laser pistol, a slow-moving gold effect - that's what I expected. Also, I did not expect to hear pure sound effects based on a beep sound similar to TNG but away from the sound effects of the TOS. <br /> <br /> At the earliest view of the TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see Starfleet with a more formal military side - a little bit of the ancient maritime land. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is a military symbol in STAR BLAZERS more than in the ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It is good that Captain Archer is not sure of the needs of the universe (unlike Kirk, who has never lacked faith in his application of human justice), but within the institution everyone seems to be equal. Unprofessional, not sure, far from the sense of official military service than what exists in any of the ST series - and that says so much! <br /> <br /> The opening song of informal country music symbolizes family journeys rather than the adventures of an important military ship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE looks forward to often showing us a mysterious and warm exploration of human relationships rather than taking us into a historical, bold and courageous exploration of space. <br /> <br /> You have chosen Adrian Paul to play Captain and the older man to be a doctor. However, I liked the actors most of the time. Linda Park, a dancer from the Boston College Hall, is sure to develop well. The personalities of the crew seem to have been carefully constructed. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE has started to operate stronger than the last three STAR TREK series. Let's hope a good future!
