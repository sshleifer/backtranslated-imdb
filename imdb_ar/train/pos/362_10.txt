In 1985, Steven Spielberg produced a memorable and powerful story from a young African American girl, Seely (a role for the first time at Wobi Goldberg), who lives in difficult times. The story begins in 1909 when Omar Sealy reaches just 14 years old. She gave birth to two children to her father. Sally has her younger sister, Nitti, who is inseparable from her. A widower puts his eyes on my intention but their father gives his seli. It is the beginning of an era of terrible abuse and constant domination. Women are inferior to men, especially since they are African American women whose rights are less than zero. The story of Sealy is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a great feature film and a reduction of his appreciation for Spielberg. More drama, "The Color Purple" and "Schindler List", should be a good idea. Amazing surprise. Whoopi Goldberg knew it was a funny and funny comedy, but the roleplay like Celie is a wonderful word that can really bring her to heavy drama. Danny Glover had a bad "Mister" bad. I have not seen him in this evil role. Program icon Oprah Winfrey is as wonderful as Sophia's will. <br /> <br /> Warning! Get ready to get a number of tissues with you when watching this movie. You can really connect with the story of strong brotherhood. Especially if you have a close relationship with your brothers as I did with my sister. <br /> <br /> Mr Spielberg applauds!
