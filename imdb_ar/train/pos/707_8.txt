I have to be honest and say I have not seen many independent films, but I thought this film was good. The direction and cinematography were shared without distraction. The angles, settings and lighting used to create a world of nightmares in which the main character was trapped. Many of the memorable, unforgettable images of the film stick in your mind for a long time after it ends (always a sign of a good director).
