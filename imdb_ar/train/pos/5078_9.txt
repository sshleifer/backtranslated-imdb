This one stood for authenticity. I'm fed up with watching Indian films, which are a collection of Hollywood and Bret films. Some shortcomings were inevitable, however, this film is a must. The portrayal of Syria as a clean, conscientious policeman (unlike those starving brawls we usually see) was wonderful. He has come a long way from his work at Nerukku Ner. I liked the film so much that I had to own it. I usually do not practice the kind of reckless violence films, in a way I've really felt for every character, so I can not really bring myself to call it "reckless" violence. I do not appreciate excessive melodrama and emotional scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil films. I love this film at all because it lacks the same. ACP Anbuselvan's reaction to the loss of his wife, not exaggerated, is a heartache and makes me want to make my eyes out. There are certain times when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it in the cinema. You do not want to do this when you watch this movie. I really hope Gagini will be released soon.
