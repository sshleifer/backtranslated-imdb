I saw this movie the other day when I hired it, and I thought it would be just another film with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane joined boxing because she wanted it. I thought this film was good. I gave it 8/10. This is how good it is. In addition to the film with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. So she was in only six.
