The acting is great, but for people in this area in the 1980s and they are now Detroit car engineers, it's a great movie. I work with a Japanese supplier so makes this movie more funny. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno was showing his time last night at the Tonight Show! Seems like a beautiful young man here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, with a drag race on what appeared to be Woodward Ave, was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Leno also has some bad cars now, it would be nice to see a new version of this with his modern car set. I'm sure that Vette's blaring film in the opening scene was his own car. <br /> <br /> A typical film in the eighties. Watch it and enjoy it. No computer born crap!
