I love this movie I'm Mexican and I was in the least offended. In fact, I think this film should be shown at police headquarters throughout Mexico. It is a sad fact that our police system is as corrupt as a three-month-old corpse. It bothers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other mud are liberated by paying a laughable fine or living like kings inside jail cells. We must have someone like Krissy, a personal Denzel Washington. A bodyguard has become a retaliatory entity. Kidnapping is a thriving industry here (at least in big cities). I really wanted the kidnappers in real life to suffer the same fate as Crissy. That would be great (sorry, I'm upset!). MAN ON FIRE is a wonderful movie you can not miss. It may be difficult for some of you, if you are not familiar with translations (Mexicans do it all the time while watching American films) but the effort is worth it. Some of the editing is a bit mysterious ... like TRAFFIC, remember? (Another fantastic takes over Mexico's corruption). The film starts a bit slower, but the speed is increasing frantically in the second half. I swear that you will be delighted when you watch Denzel Washington send the wrong actors. Its performance is no less than excellent. The end (no spoilers, well !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll love it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. "Must Own" DVD set! 9 out of 10
