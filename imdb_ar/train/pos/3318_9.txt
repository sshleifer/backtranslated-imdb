Very nice movie with a wonderful background from Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and addicted to light films, this made me feel great. Lots of laughter and lots of original baseball scenes with real football players and real references to previous Bosox failures. How fun to watch a baseball movie without having to take on Kevin Costner, who was overworked and self-serving and trying to make believers a critical audience? Jimmy Woodrow did a good job as a lovable young couple suffering from "Jimmy" Busox. It was a little strange and came out of the left field, but there are already fans of the fanatic Sox and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team. The film faded quickly and ended, although it was predictable, but he had the charm and passion of many other popular films, without being more than a ton. <br /> <br /> Willie Garconson was also delighted to return to the screen. I miss "Stanford Blatch" forever famous for Sex & the City. It's always funny, even when he does or says very little. <br /> <br /> So buy yourself two square seats, some popcorn, and prepare for a fun time. "Fever Stadium" is the winner.
