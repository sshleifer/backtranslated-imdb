I grew up in this classic Western series, and as a child I always consider it a treat that allows me to stay awake on Sunday evenings to watch it. Bonanza is still re-viewed infinitely. <br /> <br /> The series tells the adventures of the Cartwright family, who live on a farm near Virginia, Nevada, during the Civil War. Their farm (called Ponderosa) is run and defended by the widowed father, Ben, and his three unmarried children, Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom died years earlier. <br /> <br /> Cartwright is a hardworking, prosperous, honored and respected family in those parts. Ponderosa is great, so access to the limbs requires a lot of horseback riding. Also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so on. Needless to say, few of these cruises pass unabated. Despite his hospitality, you should spend a lot of energy on Cartwrights to defend their farm from the intertwined, or protect themselves from the townspeople who are jealous of their prosperity and starry reputation. Cartwrights do quite a bit of firing their weapons in the air and the like, but do not shoot only to kill them when absolutely necessary. They are involved in various affairs of the town, even political life in the territory of Nevada. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements of this series is the fundamental warmth that always exists (despite occasional differences) between Ben and his companions. Three sons and (despite repeated differences) between the three brothers. Now, one sibling may hit every now and then, but generally has a good reason for it at that time and his anger does not last long! All characters are drawn very well. Ben Ali was portrayed as a successful man and a noble man with great integrity. The eldest son, Adam, the most rational and brothers in the brothers, left in the middle of the chain. Hoss Middle Brother, is a cute giant of teddy bear, has an unsatisfied appetite to eat and is a little timid about ladies. The youngest, Little Joe, is a handsome magician with a hot head, by contrast, he has a way with women. This trio of brothers enjoys many romances, but their interests are usually eliminated at the end of the episode or prove that marriage is impossible, for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The actors are all stars in their roles, including Bernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Balker (Hess), Michael Landon (Little Joe) and, of course, Lauren Greene as the patriarch of the initial family, Ben. I also love the farm cook, Hoop Singh, who plays Victor Sin Young. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful job full of great Western values. Cartwrights are always noble heroes and most bad guys are bad guys. If there were more Western programs like this vintage on TV these days!
