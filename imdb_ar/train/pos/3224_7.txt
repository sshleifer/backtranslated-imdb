I watched this movie and I expect what I got: good science fiction cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a wonderful job with a very limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to act under these two constraints: you have almost no dialogue, and because you play hard, a military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like a singer asked to perform a great song while muffled and taped pipes. Despite being verbally and explicitly handcuffed, Russell launches with an amazing characterization. His robot becomes human, despite limitations. Fantastic job! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaac believes that he will be subjected to history as a wonderful carrier of the prominent villain - the person you want to see and conceal. Connie Nielsen was nice, soft, maternal, and wonderful. I'm not sure my impression depends on her representation and her physical beauty, but it was hard to look up. Unfortunately, Gary Bossi's role was small and very limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is perfectly standard, with a good number of weaknesses, but since it has a sense of comic books for science, I do not see what is wrong with some weaknesses. At the end of the story, the good guy wins, and the audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yeah! <br /> <br /> The type of taxpayer who thinks Russell did not do a good job in acting is the same kind of reward that the whole thing missed.
