So I turned on the digital subscriber channels one night two years ago and I thought I spent half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to get started. With such an address, I would imagine it was some exploitation of 'B' around the girl inner city gangs. <br /> <br /> It was no surprise to me that it was not at all. Instead, it's a well-conceived story and well written about a young woman who accidentally enters female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to practice sessions and getting attention while observing his spells. Since he does not really want to be an angel (except by following the wishes of their father), they convince his boss to take them instead. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in a smart and believable way as it goes through different experiences about its quest. For starters, the boss does not want her brother to face the female boxer. After doing so reluctantly, there is a problem in the alignment of her games. Then confrontation with her father when he discovers what is going on. Yes, the interests of love develop, but they work to strengthen the plot, and talk more than an interesting reaction among humans with its combat-related consequences. <br /> <br /> All in all this wonderful little sleeper movie seems to have little heard of. Later, when I saw the much-acclaimed "Million Dollar Child", I thought that "wait a moment, it seems familiar." Needless to say, I did not watch the "Hart War" that night.
