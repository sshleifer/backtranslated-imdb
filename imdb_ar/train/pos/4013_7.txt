In the opening scene, the desperado-wearing eyeband of Hawkeye has a soft forehead, but when Johnny follows Pueblo, a scar appears above his patchy eye. This is just one of many continuity in this sharp western spaghetti, but instead of detracting from the image, it adds a special flavor to the actions. <br /> <br /> Another happens when Sanchez, in his three deaths, turns bodies to be searched for their identities. "You can not imagine the number of fake bodies in our town." After a direct disaster, Carden (Lawrence Dubkin) appears to collect his bounty with no required poster in hand. <br /> <br /> As for film director Johnny Yum (Mark Damon), he appeared with the clipboard alternately on his left and right hip throughout the film after exchanging firecrackers with Karadin after the baromoe fight. Johnny went to San Margo at the request of his uncle, but he would have to avenge his death by his deceptive wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her brother-in-law Pedro (Luis Fanner). It takes time to get there, but it is a fun trip with one of the best recorded musical scores. As for this saloon battle, I got out of the kung fu sound effects every time I hit a punch. <br /> <br /> Consider some exaggeration in the story? After fencing with Pedro the first time, Johnny scans a small amount of blood from his lip that runs to tarnish the entire Pedro face. Similarly, when Pedro walks around Baby's little film later in the film, he does not interrupt, but by Johnny's arrival, Bibi's face is covered with blood. <br /> <br /> Johnny Day may be one of the best types of Clint Eastwood in it. As a Johnny, Mark Damon is a reasonably fit place but without the outward appearance. Karadin appeared to be a substitute for Lee van Cleef's mandatory personality, without being a bad person. At first, the exchange of identity between Cardin and Johnny was not logical, but all that was tied at the time the film ended. You know that all the followers will end up getting their dues; the time limit for each part was part of the expectation. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with Nick Adams of Western Classic TV "The Rebel". In this film, Johnny got his name from a gun battle he had made in Yuma once. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable element of the story relates to the way things were associated with evil Samantha who pulled strings behind the scenes all the time. After shooting at Karadin, she overcame a quick dip before Johnny could take revenge. She is still alive, it seems that Karadin is trying to shoot and miss her, but it does not take too long for Johnny and Sanchez to follow in the candy where she died without water - Karadin was targeting her canteen.
