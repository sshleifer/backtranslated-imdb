He won two Oscars for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris trying to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated woman who is interested in helping him, but soon finds that she loves men. At the same time Jane Kelly is located in the beautiful girl Leslie Karon. His main partner in dance, I must say that they are wonderful on the ground and others. The famous French singer Georges Guitari also sings.
