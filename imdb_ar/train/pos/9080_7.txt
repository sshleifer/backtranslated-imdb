Maybe I need a vertical check, but I thought the film was very good. CG was not too bad. I've seen what's worse. The look of the creatures (I mean the good creatures and the bad snake) was wonderful, the scenes of motion involving the snakes were really good, I thought. There are some lapses in logic sometimes, and the story is not always logical. But for the creature's advantage, there are many worse. The other creatures looked up from other films, so they were not entirely original. I think the essence of the story is original, despite its resemblance to Godzilla (the American version of the big budget) that I loved so much. I liked this movie a lot, but I still say it was very good. I also loved the music. In general, I think Dragon Wars revolves around 7/10
