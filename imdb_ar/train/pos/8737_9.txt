The critics say that Antz is the best. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can not remember a Pixar cartoon, unlike my Toy Story, that I was laughing hard. The animation is clean and the story is original and does not preach. The voice amounts are making this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant that raises a lot of trouble. The hopper is a wonderful description of how always Spacey, like Hayden Panetiri in the role of Dot. There is also fantastic support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I can continue. The script is awesome, funny and sometimes impressive. It lacks Antz social messages, but what we have is rock entertainment. 10/09. Bethany Cox
