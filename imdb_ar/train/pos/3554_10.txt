Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hate each other while they are doing this film and in the years that followed. Brando asked Sinatra about some singing lessons, but Sinatra (who was really angry at the fact that he was portrayed as Nathan Detroit, wanted the part when Skye Masterson wanted to be the star singer in production and did not want anyone to be better than him. And Marlon gets back up at the diner where Sinatra ate cheese pie so he had to keep eating, eating and eating.In recent years, Sinatra has named Brando the title of Mumbles or Mister Mumbles because of the way he talks.
