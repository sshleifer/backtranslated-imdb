This was amazingly clever for a television film, and quite true to my experience of the ill. It has already been well studied, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who had a similar experience, because it contained all the small details. The characters were well drawn, and the performances of Mary Winningham and Allison Lohan were wonderful. I think the most I like is that they made them specific and intelligent, and there was no reason to relieve the illness of the house (there was no "diet out of control, because of media pressure on the girls, the pressures we will not address ..."). Her mother was not completely unknown - often on television, they would deal with an issue that everyone has some awareness of and tries to tell us that their heroes are the last people left on earth who do not ("Diabetes? All oblique, Doctor, please explain all this to me as if I were a little boy, "etc.). It was wonderful that her mother was a psychologist and she did not even see signs. Beth's scenes were not full of mystery and excitement, and focused more on the need for pessimists to secrecy, beyond their control. The scene in which Beth told her that she would end up crying, if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Well, so I liked those pieces. What did not work well for me was the end, which returned to the area of ​​television movies that we know and do not like in particular, but I think they had to conclude. "You, too, can cure your child's eating disorders, if you have a lot of money and live in America ..." <br /> <br /> I can say again that I really love Mary Wenningham. It's a great.
