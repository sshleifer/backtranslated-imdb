Most of the movies around New Orleans have been shown to be very bad and laughably inaccurate (for example, do you remember "The Savage Bees"?), But I will skip it. <br /> <br /> Here's one that does not make a mistake. Accents are not too bad (yes, the tone "Yat" here are the most Brooklynes of the South), the city of 1950 is shown the way they were / without the "tourist" footage mandatory, they understand the drama well without trying to make everyone "quirky southerners". <br /> <br /> One of the few films that bring justice to this city, and a good movie to take off ..
