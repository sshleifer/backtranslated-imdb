I thought Mr. Dreyfus was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his role just as well. It was interesting to see how Richard Dreyfus hesitated to replace the dictator against his will. But he became more confident and relaxed over time. Since everything happens for some reason in life, I think he was forced to replace the dictator because he was supposed to stay there for more than a year. I think he stayed because he was supposed to see the quality of his life compared to the poverty he experienced in Barador. I think he took a lot of things as a foregone conclusion in life and he needed to get a real check of reality by staying in this country as long as he did. <br /> <br /> But ......... Anyway ........... For this reason I gave this movie 7 out of 10.
