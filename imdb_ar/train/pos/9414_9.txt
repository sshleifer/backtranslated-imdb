Although most Americans know little about his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing array of work - especially in the 1940s and 1950s - from dramas to exotic comedy. I love his own comedy movies well, as they are good performing and look natural and real on screen - much different than the usual fare from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It is said that this is the film that sparked my interest in these films. The plot was so strange and so nice that the film was unlikely to have been made anywhere - except the Ealing studios - which had a fondness for "small" films like this one. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a small, nerdy scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment in order to create an indestructible artificial fabric, although he does not work for the company as a researcher but in the work of the guard! Therefore, he tends to sneak into laboratories (either during the day if no one is suspected or at night) and try his hand at innovation. Over and over again, he was arrested (like after the laboratory blew up) and gave boot until one day actually succeeds! Then, despite the importance of this discovery, he launched a series of completely unexpected events - and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful satire that makes fun of industry, trade unions, government and people in general.
