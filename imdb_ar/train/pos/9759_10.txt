I think I got this movie when I was a young man. I remembered watching him as a child, but I could never find the film. I remembered the good of my opinion, Andy, Babit, greed, King Ko Ku. I have looked high and low for this film and I still have no luck. But one day when I was out of my childhood home I found it. We were reunited. I am 17 years old now. I still watch him. All the time actually. It's one of the most popular movies I have ever seen and enjoyed. I personally think that they have to work as a complement. Yes, yes indeed. Now I'm thinking of getting a tattooed bird tattoo somewhere on my body!
