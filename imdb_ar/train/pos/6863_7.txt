The movie makes a wonderful suspense with the action of the wonderful slow camera and drama addition to a pleasant experience and watching. Director Brian De Palma mimics Hitchcock (often called "Rip") with this movie, and the wide-angle DVD (2.35: 1 is necessary to fully appreciate the camera's work) and many scenes with people hiding in each side the lost track For television). <br /> <br /> The downside of the film, at least to anyone with a kind of moral standards, is the general neglect of all characters, including a cop played by Dennis Franz before the New York Police (who has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still appalling, with a fairly long shower scene by Angie Dickinson, even 25 years after it was released. The film contains many exciting scenes such as Dickinson (if that's already in her close-up) and Nancy Allen is not ashamed to show her body. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first thirty-six minutes run out, and although it is clear who is the killer, it is still very good fun and fun to watch all the time, especially for the males who go to naked women.
