I watched this movie in the early hours of the morning when I had to be asleep. This, in and of itself, was testimony that the rescue was a binding film for spelling. I think Bormann did a great job in directing this film. How expertly the early scene with hill folk and Banjo duel was done. It was well demonstrated at an early date how the inhabitants of the area were isolated and simple. An example of this - near the end of the "fencing", the boy playing the banjo game was smiling (love the banjo), but when Drew tried to shake hands with the child after the "fencing", the child was too reserved to respond. The river trip did not leave you bored, certainly. The rape scene was brutal, but it was necessary to show what the group had just faced in this Georgian rear zone. I think my shocking home shock then has been done well. Some said he was not affected by this ordeal. I do not agree - if you were really interested, he was not responding to the whole procedure that followed immediately, as Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and chased the toothless man. It was confusing when Ed's other man was later killed, at the top of the abyss. The arrow appears to have been shot while a spike was raised and is expected to die, but then I realized that the arrow he had launched earlier had finally come into effect. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a wonderful movie, I frequented between 8 and 9, but after reading a letter from a disgruntled voter gave her a "1", I gave it a "10". The logic of this individual was based on personal bias, rather than on an objective point of view, and his vote was clearly an attempt not to reduce the rating.
