In this sequel to the classic 1989 thriller K-9, detective Dolly [James Blochie] and his dog Jerry Lee returned to fight crime, but this time collaborated with another investigator [Christine Toochi] and her partner, named Doberman Zweis who did not fit Jerry Lee very well . Dooley is not in line with his new partner either. That changes all as the movie goes along. The film condenses because a man really wants to kill Dooley the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes about the death of Dooley's wife, which do not really look like the tone of the film because the rest of the film is a sequence of action and jokes in the back of dogs and jokes fart and jokes about dogs that throw bad guys in a certain area. I know it sounds like a very low humor, but some are very funny. I did not see this movie for jokes but I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is that I admire James Belushi and the second is for the series of events. James Belushi is more entertaining than in K-9 and the series work in the best too. It was good to see more characters from the K-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. If you're a fan of James Belushi, you'll love this movie.
