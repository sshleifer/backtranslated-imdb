I think part of the reason why this movie was created ... is aimed at us players who are already playing all Nancy Drew computer games. There have been a lot of movies recently adopted on video games, I think this is one of them. <br /> <br /> So this film does not follow any book. But it follows parts of the games. Buy and play all Nancy Drew games as soon as they appear. The games from HerInteractive are dedicated to "girls who are not afraid of the mouse!" Some of these games actually won the Parents Choice Awards. They are not only fun, but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my young children with me to go to see him and loved him! The 10 years. The old woman started playing her first game at Nancy Drew the day before she took her to watch the movie, and she enjoyed playing the game so much, I thought she would enjoy the movie too. I was right ... She did not like this film alone, but she could not wait to get home to finish her first game and start another game. <br /> <br /> My other daughter is just seven years old and she also likes the movie, but she's still fairly small, and she's playing games so far, but she enjoys watching her sister play sometimes just to see what's going on. <br /> <br /> Games are based on children aged 10 years or older. All the games usually get pretty downhill reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information about games, check out Herrenterative Games Nancy Drew. I personally thought that the movie was good and I will buy it when it is played on DVD.
