From watching this as a child. Although I probably find it awesome now, it was a kind of terrible stuff where I was seven years old or so. I also remember working on a mystery on a Saturday afternoon while watching it, so I did not much interest. However, the scene has been burning with rolling rocks in my mind ever since. I asked many people if they had seen this shot but to no avail. Twelve years ago, someone said he might have seen it, but he thought it was just a dream. Piffle is fantastic like wind. It is not a dream, my friend. Do not dream again now, I have not seen her since, but I can not wait to find a copy and add it to my VCR. Anything that can remain embedded in my eyes for 23 years is worth the "10".
