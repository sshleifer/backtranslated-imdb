{Potential spoilers are likely ... You've been warned in advance.} <br /> <br /> This is one of the best music shows and favorite musicals of all time! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter, and Ray Walston). As we all know, sometimes flashes (not to mention songs) are lost to one of the performances in his transition from stage to stage. This, for the most part, is not definitely the case here. <br /> <br /> Groups are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can only love them, and Michael Kidds is a very amazing choreographer. (Very happy to know they used the original Broadway designer) <br /> <br /> All actors "wear the ball" (ie have an unbeatable chemistry) to achieve perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon both have the ability to believe that he is the owner of the oldest permanent floating crap in New York, and the most conspicuous gambler betting on the most delicate things - like his fever of 104 if he does not take penicillin. Jean Simmons is sweet and attractive perfect for Sara's role (although it is true, the own singing tubes are not as wonderful as Isabel Bigley or Jos√© de Guzman) - doll task with a golden heart and leadership to all heal. (On my list anyway), Miss Vivienne Blaine, she is remodeling her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide - Hot Box singer and dancer who wants to end her 14-year engagement with Nathan in marriage, and rid herself of the psychological cold Which he presented to her. <br /> <br /> First, Glory to Stubby Kaye and BS Reel while returning their roles on Broadway as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There were no more gamblers than these men. <br /> <br /> Brando is wonderful, as usual, and although he did not get the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forgot that - because he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as Sky Masterson. "Luck be a lady" gives me chills every time I see him leading the figure. It is particularly interesting to hear him say "Daddy ... I got the apple juice in my ear". <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and fun in a role that suits her appearance, her voice and the way she carries herself. You are precious for a long time for her not only to win Sky (or, in the end, sincerity), but to help people overcome gambling, drinking and other sins, and live a life with God. Delivery to "If you're a gorse" is great, at the very least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. It's perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parts that the Broadway crew Sam Levin was unable to see (a wonderful actor, but the season was pretty ... go to the picture). I really enjoyed adding the song "Adelaide" ... I wish someone would sing such a song to ME. Frankie, his cold behavior goes beyond the limits of this film. But more importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> When talking about Adelaide, Vivienne Blaine is just pure perfection in this role. From her dialect to her "Adelaide Lament", she is so wonderful. It is also my favorite part of the entire film. It really makes you feel Adelaide ... especially when you cry right before and then again through "Sue Me". I still have not decided whether I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and Peck" ... maybe I love them equally. In both cases, it's great with them as well as "Restoring Your Man". (I'm sad because they excluded the "storming" of the film ...) It's so wonderful, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the entire film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is their language. It's a mix of high-class and colloquial streets. Do not use "it", "I" or "this". It is always "he", "I will do" and "that is." In general, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals of all time, one that you should take time to watch each time you appear. My only complaint? Do not "marry a man today." Now this is a good song.
