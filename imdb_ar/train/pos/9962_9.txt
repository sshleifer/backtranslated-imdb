I was a little scared to watch this movie because of its rates. But living in titles in Italy like this has never happened and I like the move so much that I decided to try it. How surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance I've ever seen, deeper than just "winning." It is impressive, well written and well-directed. Raya is a strong personality, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she is very mature and focused and knowledgeable about her talent (and what is the talent of Rutina Wesley, VKMY fell into the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is, frankly, inspirational. Also, the fact that she is not a hot model chick (see Jessica Alba, Bryana Evigan, Gina Diwan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her attractive and real. Seriously, why this film has been rated so low? You can understand between the first five minutes it's a good job. Really really good I've even cried at the end of the movie. The dance procedures are just a disease.
