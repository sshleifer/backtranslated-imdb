I am a fan of television films in general and this was a good film. The presentations made all the time were very strong and there were fluctuations I had not seen before every commercial. For me it was somewhat like the CSI Mediterranean meeting. <br /> <br /> Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter was like Nicole Kidman? Are they connected in any way? I would definitely watch him wear it or rent him if it was a video. <br /> <br /> Didi was wonderful. I did not see her in many things, and she did her work very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you're in mysterious TV movies, check if you have a chance.
