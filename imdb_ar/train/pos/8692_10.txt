I used to love watching this. I had no idea it was part of a larger chain. I must have been 6 years old or so while I was on TV. I thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination for something that was clear that it was in the chair stack for bathtub games. My parents recorded this TV when it was first broadcast on NBC. The bar was up to Sanka's old business coffee along with a few others. I plan to return home sometime soon and I will try to record the tape on my computer so that they want a copy of it. If any of you would like to contact me, I think you can do this through IMDb. I'll keep you informed and notify you when I have the offer in digital format.
