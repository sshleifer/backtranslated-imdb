The witch does not even begin to describe the "saving grace"; it's absolutely irresistible! Anybody who ventures into this movie will leave with a high morale (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethin (Brenda Blytheen) lost her husband, but her problems are about to get worse. Ghalia left her and left her no money and debts owed. Facing losing everything, she has to figure out a way to get a lot of money ... fast! She gets an idea when the gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson) of the town's famous gardening expert, asks him to advise him about a plant he grows secretly. Grace immediately realizes that his factory is marijuana, so they decide to use their gardening skills to grow a lot of high quality grasses, then sell them to repay their outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> The most prominent quality about "saving grace" is its potency. Every character is very sympathetic, and only in the first twenty minutes or so, the film cheer non-stop. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if that means turning a blind eye to some illegal activities. <br /> <br /> Acting is first class. Brenda Blythin is one of the best actresses in Britain, which is why. It transforms what can be a caricature into an individual who lives and breathes in full. She is a nice lady, but she is not stupid. Craig Ferguson is equally friendly of when. He is a deadly loser, but he is so beloved that it does not matter. Cast the rest of the cast in this category too, but Tcheky Karyo should be referred to in particular. The French actor always has a halo of danger to him, which suits him well, but he also has great comedic skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "saving grace". All about magic. One of the problems I face with British humor is that all the energy seems drained from the film. Not so here. The film is completely loved and always entertaining. This does not mean that "Grace Saving" is just a lovable movie that will leave you with a smile and a good feeling. Although this film is not a comprehensive comedy, it boasts of viewers or three scenes no less than hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is any problem with the film, its climax is a bit confusing. Questions are answered, and the end boasts an unexpected transformation. <br /> <br /> See "Saving Grace," especially when you have a bad day.
