"Der Todesking" - the second full-length film by George Buttegret (the first notorious film "Nekromantik") has no character or central figures, but instead the thematic continuity in the suicide. The film consists of days of the week. A series of pieces, each characterized by the self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, production values ​​are low and worrisome, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is very effective. It makes you think sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike other Buttgereit works, they are not very sinister, but there are some unpleasant images like the castration scene in the Tuesday episode, the decomposing corpse and various suicidal acts. The last (Sunday) episode is very frustrating and full of pain! - Awesome only if you want my opinion. 10 out of 10 - Check out the postmodern shock! The disturbing art in its purest form!
