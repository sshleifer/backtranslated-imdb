I saw this film for the first time in a theater in France a year or so ago. He came and went with a little noise, but I enjoyed the beauty of landscape photography and wonderful wildlife scenes. (The story, though nice, but it is really transverse.If you really think about it, there's no way for most of what can happen in real life.) I've seen it again tonight, here in the US, on a DVD. Again, they all have very limited distribution. Blockbusters had only one copy of it, and I do not remember that he was playing in art houses in Cleveland. <br /> <br /> Appears on my TV, photography is not breathtaking, although it is still beautiful. Wild shots are still wonderful. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old and the fox is less convincing the second time, when you know where you're heading. <br /> <br /> However, as I said, the story is incidental. It's a nice movie to watch, and if you like wildlife shots, you should find this wonderful.
