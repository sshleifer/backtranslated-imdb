Tarzan and Jin live happily in the forest. Some men come looking for ivory and return Jin to civilization. But Jane likes Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jin and is determined to bring her back ... even if that means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is rare - a better sequel than the original. "Tarzan, Monkey Man" 1932 was good but had some terrible special effects and kind of clouds. This one has far better effects and much more adults. There are tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot up to an empty point of death - no one really cares), but it was 1934. There is also a lot of blood and violence (for the 1934 film) and unpolished prints do a long underwater underwater nude ! There is also clear sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are depicted alongside nothing and (implicitly) sleeping together and having sex - without being married. This will not bother anyone today, but in 1934 this was very radical. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film is well directed and fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement. Weissmuller's vision in this misty lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes, and Jane's clothing is also revealing. I still think that Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane but Wismuller is as perfect as Tarzan. everybody is fine. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan there. Worth seeing but not for kids!
