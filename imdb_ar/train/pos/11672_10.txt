Excellent pirate entertainment! It contains all the good ingredients to keep one's attention - a tale of conspiracy suckers, flaming lady pirates named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who attracted to Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is on a secret mission of his own. They make a wonderful romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is a bad pirate who is weaving his evil network of division and invasion. I have noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick and he plays a supporting role, like Mrs. McGregor, protector of the young princess Batma (Alice Kelly). <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful scene filmed from beaches, ships and the bay. Much of the work is also due to sword fighting clashes, ship battles and bold jumps to Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard a ship!). From the flaming redhead herself, I once heard in an interview with Maureen O'Hara that she boasted of the great leadership of the bull and could also outshine Flynn in the sword fight of those days but there would be no need to put her to the test here. <br /> <br /> A very interesting film.
