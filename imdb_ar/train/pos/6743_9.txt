Dana Andrews is one of those actors who probably saw them in more than a dozen films, but they did not really score me. He is often a little coherent, he plays the same kind of roles and looks a bit like Glenn Ford, which is a little underestimated, he is a representative who needs some effort to really appreciate him; but once you click on the right movie ... <br /> < > That's it. Bremerger's moody look on New York's dirty and cruel bones is like any fuss in his fifties, and Andrews is his element in the very tough cop Mark Dixon who knows not only how the game plays forward: he hates criminals a lot to always play with. In the early part of the film, he accidentally kills a witness in a murder involving an illegal crap game created by a gangster and hated by Dixon for personal reasons, and spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring him to his kind of "justice". Along the route in which he is involved with the wife separated from the man who killed him (Jane Turney) and also to try to keep her father away from the crime. <br /> <br /> Joseph LaChel has brilliantly filmed a hard and brilliant dialogue from Ben Hesht and a truly powerful end to elements of the tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time. This is another light of the ages and may be my favorite movie of Brimanger so far - it's all Something good as Laura ushered in more.
