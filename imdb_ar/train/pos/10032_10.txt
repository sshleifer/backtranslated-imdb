I loved this movie since I was 7 years old and saw it on the opening day. It was impressive and beautiful. I highly recommend seeing everyone. It's a movie you see with your family pretty much. <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, long scenes of disaster, nudity / nationality, and some languages.
