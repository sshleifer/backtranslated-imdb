Clara Bo (Hula Calhoun) is the daughter of the owner of the Albert Gran Farm (Bill Calhoun), who is primarily interested in playing cards and luxury with friends. She is interested in riding in the countryside until engineer Cliff Brock (Anthony Haldan) shows up to build a dam. One of her father's friends Arlette Marshall (Ms. Ban) is competing for his attention. His wife, Maude Troyes (Margaret Haldane), appears for the supposed final. <br /> <br /> Lots of "code presets" like nude showers. <br /> <br /> Great photography sites in Hawaii.
