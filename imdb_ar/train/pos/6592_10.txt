I have not seen this movie, but I have to. After reading all three books of Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku) are actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The thesis that Peru migrated to Polynesia is still alive and well. Since this crew does not have GPS, and only an old-fashioned radio (tube) with 6 watts output, it was at least a heroic journey. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this email if you can tell me a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I will be interested in buying it.
