I must admit not to read the original M R James story though I have read many of his other miraculous tales. I've also seen most of the previous Christmas ghost stories for the BBC (BBC) and this story, in my opinion, outperforms most of them, just equal to Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can not really hurt a view of the hill - the trend and "mood" are perfect, as are the acting and lighting, of course the story and writing. I totally enjoyed this and I can only hope to get more of this quality from the same manager and production team. I understand that the BBC is planning to do more (not necessarily based on M R James's stories) so it's promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
