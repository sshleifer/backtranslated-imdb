There are two things I like about Elvira, both bigger than they are, and they keep on covering up: her intelligence and talent. The movie is the best thing to show how funny or how it captures attention. Looks like a common clone of Mortesia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, who inherits the property of one of her distant relatives only to discover she is the heir to witchcraft. The comedy in this film is the best of it, but it could have been scary and chilling. It's mostly fare in a campground with many bad horror movie references in it like a hooligan mob or a heroine fleeing flights and bumps in her wake. My favorite part is when you use their wonderful end to break the chains and keep them closed in the cemetery. The end is very sweet as if it were written by Bradys, but the Las Vegas Act in the end seems very great for this type of film.
