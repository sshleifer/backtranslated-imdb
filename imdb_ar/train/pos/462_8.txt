The "Luzhin defense" is, in the foreground, the story of the distinctive chess savior Turturro consumed by the game, and in the background through the memories of the past, it was the life of his childhood and the forces that created the man he became. He worked in good and evil in the forms of his love interest (Watson) and his former "mentor" (Wilson) respectively, and you have a sad drama with touching moments and humor mixed with the scenic beauty of the Italian Como Lake and the intensity of high chess playing. An excellent film for those to dramas in the time period, the metaphor of the author's pesky chess game composed by the joy of ecstasy is a reference to the hidden intelligence behind the film.
