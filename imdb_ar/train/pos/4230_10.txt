For Colombo fans, like me, this is a ring of episodes that has made the reason behind the popularity of Colombo and how it was really good. Roth Gordon is a day (as always) in the role of smart crime novelist Abigail Mitchell. Abigail seems to be calling her nephew to sign some papers that make him his heir. She has not overcome the death of her niece, and is convinced that the husband of her dead niece (Charles Frank) has done this dirty deed. To say more would be out of the question. Mariette Hartley has a malignant role as a personal assistant to Abigail. This episode of Colombo is in a category in itself. It's a well-made television movie. I highly recommend it.
