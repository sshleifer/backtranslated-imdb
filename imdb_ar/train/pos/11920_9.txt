Christopher Lloyd is funny and truly credible as the "head angel". This film is much better than the first, but it has great special effects. The first film did not have a much better plot and writing. <br /> <br /> Well - written for kids, but adults have a lot of fun as children do. Tony Danza plays a very realistic role in his role - but this is not a taxi meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good, appears to be very human in his emotions, and shows some real, powerful talent. For change, nice change. <br /> <br /> See at least once - it's worth the effort to catch him.
