Probably the best film of the year for me. This little French film focuses on office secretary Carla (Emmanuel Devos), who spends her days doing other unapproved men's jobs, being the source of their sarcastic conversation and lunchtime, which is very obvious to her because she is partially deaf and who reads the lips. The change is changed when Paul Paul (Vincent Castle) is hired as an assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, for a very different reasons, bond them. Carla is attracted to Paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive to what seems for the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs to help her. He owes money to a local gang and devises a plan to steal from him that will include Karlas' skill in reading the lips. I think the main thing that drives the way the film is higher than the average thrill / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the entire film, regardless of the other characters on the screen, you can feel this amazing bond between Carla and Paul. I can not remember when I saw such sexual chemistry between two representatives. Emmanuel Devos made a great show (she won the French Cesar Award for Best Actress). You never feel you're watching a piece of acting, it's really Carla. Chameleon like Vincent Cassell is also wonderful. He makes the figure quite attractive and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and when I finished watching it, I wanted to go back to the cinema and get involved with them again.
