Stargate SG-1 follows the intergalactic explorations of a team called SG-1 through a device called Stargate and all the surprises waiting on the other side of the worm. <br /> <br /> After watching this series sporadically for the first few seasons, I did not know how well this series would be, 10 years after the last episode I saw. My impression was that the series was wonderful, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple series of science fiction, it is one of the most science fiction good, interesting, long-term, and exciting. And why? It works on a fantastic premise. <br /> <br /> This serial value far outweighs the value of the film on which it was based and I think it is a good example that television, as an intermediary, with an appropriate hypothesis, is capable of presenting something that does not constrain time for the film. The sense of intimacy created by a long series of time, the viewing of characters and their circumstances progressing over time, is astonishing and adds only to the ability to suspend kufr, all due to superb writing and a lot of devotion by all crew. Star / SG-1 continued, Stargate SG-1 has been in great adventures for the last 10 years, but he never feared the challenge of moving the plot, and made room for some different time periods for the show. : The first few chapters, perhaps until the fourth and fifth, have focused largely on exploring different planets and positions, keeping the rings relatively unrelated to each other if they are not always directed to the imminent threat of Goaul'd. <br /> <br /> - From V to VII there have been more episodes that are increasingly focused on fighting Goaul'd and preventing attacks on the ground. After these seasons, the exploration of the planets was only a justification for placing sg-1 in a place where Goaul'd / replicator / ori <br /> <br /> - Season 8 may be the most mixed. Contains a stream of episodes that include simple earth issues that barely mention Stargate, but the last episodes feature some wonderful replication moments. <br /> <br /> - IX and X travel together because they have the same new enemy and not Jack O'Neill. Both are good accompaniment, although the first few episodes of season X are a bit weak, because they look a bit more SG-1 and their human loss / Jaffa after a battle to the Orient. <br /> <br /> Basically, after Season 7, exploration was pushed into the background, which was in many ways a disgrace, because of the potential and ambiguity of each planet (episode); on the other hand, it has made many great episodes of conflict So persistent that the changing nature of the exhibition still works and shows how bold the book was bold. <br /> <br /> I think the series is tough. Our high quality ends well puts it in comfort, and my feeling is that it can go on; the people concerned were all great professionals and the narration had a lot to offer. The last season of the return to the first nature of the series was executable and was very welcome, but things end up as they are. <br /> <br /> In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it's a bit hard to find it ending. However, the big picture, painted by hundreds of people over a 10-year period, is a spectacle of beauty and a true testimony to the dedication of the staff, prominent actors and personalities that we will always remember as a group called SG-1.
