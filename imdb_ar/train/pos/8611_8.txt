I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I recorded them while watching so I can review them later. I really enjoyed the second sight more, as I was able to absorb more intelligent dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought the way this story developed was thought-provoking. I was very impressed by the way Natalie interacted with her daughter's friends. At first she seemed to provoke a lot of enmity, but once she started interacting more pleasantly, I had to see how this visit would unfold. I was not disappointed. Gradually, the secrets Sarah kept about her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not perfect, a flawed man like most of us who wanted to free her from a tyrannical mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately she had to learn in a painful way sometimes to love someone to give them his freedom. The filmmakers who watched the film to the end saw a very moving show by Diane Keaton (which was always wonderful, even in some of her most popular movies in town and town). The final scene of Diane Keaton's driving was worth waiting. He revealed that anyone who loves another person should learn that we must live our own lives. We love others, but we do not have them, and we finally have to let go. It is a difficult lesson but it is worth pondering from time to time. Thank you on CBS for this broadcast, it was worth the long wait.
