Wow, I can not believe I waited a long time to watch this movie. I just have never seen him. The plot has nothing to do with me. I do not know anything about football (football). I'm one of those American idiots who have no idea. I have never seen David Beckham before this film. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America. Enough! <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was a mistake to ignore this small piece of filmmaking. What a fun movie. It's full of color and enthusiasm. I had a smile on my face through the entire film. Parminder Nagra is very sweet and lovable, you can only root her. No wonder the US television program kidnapped her. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. These people know how to spend a good time. Beautiful wedding scenes brilliantly. <br /> <br /> My only problem is to decrypt some of the British colloquial languages ​​and dialectically. You run English translations to make sure you do not miss anything. (This is not cash for the film!) I'm sure that viewers all over the world are having trouble understanding the ever-changing vernacular in American movies too. <br /> <br /> This is an ideal history film. She has a great sports plot like Rocky, and a strong sense of femininity that empower women. I saw him with my wife and a sixteen-year-old niece, and we all loved it. I strongly recommend it.
