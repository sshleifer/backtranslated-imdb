A beautiful postcard from New York. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not crawling waiting for the comic toilet joke to appear. He never did. Teenagers loved it too. My son Natasha Henstridge and my daughter Michael Fartan. My wife and I commented that we can not remember the last time we could sit with the children and that everyone enjoyed something. This film tells a story that felt comfortable but not old or finished. The end came with a twist which we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and you are willing to let the story unfold then this is for you. As a man needs a lot of attention when it comes to romantic movies and that's what he did. I highly recommend it and we need more of these movies to watch.
