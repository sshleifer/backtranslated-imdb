As an unprecedented person in sports, it seems that it will be difficult for me to enter football (or, as we Americans call it, football) - under the title "Bend It Like Beckham." But I must say, this was a wonderful film! The English-Indian Jeseminder Bahamara (Parminder Nagra) and her friend in WASP Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I will say on the British and international way) and adore soccer player David Beckham. But the parents of the traditional Sikh Jeseminder do not agree (her mother offers a really troubled description of the early football of the film). Well, so maybe it was kind of clich√© in that sense, but you'll love this movie! If you are like me, you go to this movie and do not know the definition of "bending" in football ... do not worry, the film explains that (I also did not hear of David Beckham before this film). We all know that Keira Knightley was a great success: a few months after BILB's debut in the United States, she starred in "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."
