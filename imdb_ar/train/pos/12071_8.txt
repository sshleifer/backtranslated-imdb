Nicholas Rogge's projects are at least varied, but not less interesting. It is clear that "irrelevance" is, first of all, an air-conditioned play: it is bound to the words "linked to the room". However, it is useful to watch this film more than once: the main themes are not presented openly, and more than that, it takes time to adapt to the twists and turns of the four roles of the four heroes: Einstein, McCarthy, Monroe, and Di Maggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is guilty of Hiroshima, but he imagines the simplicity of sexual contact with Monroe; Monroe is tired of being seen as a Bembo and longs for intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his powers of charming but undefeated fishing Demaggio is insecure about his personality, obsessed with himself, and prone to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of their destruction. Each character has a turbulent, abusive / abusive past and a dubious future. Gradually, we see that mania itself is the main theme. America's obsession with its icons and cultural customs after the war can not have fans' concerns about something: peace of mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the theory of relativity, the proposed unified field theory, and indeed the universe itself, all the aspirations and interactions of Rogge's supporters seem slim. After these aspects of the physical universe (everything quantum, trust me!) Affect us when they are applied to the development of means to destroy us. Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb (without naming it) is not an anachronism in itself, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. In fact, all of the references in the script can only be accessed by a well-informed viewer: one event with the events of the fifties / personality communities and how it affects us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its script are either very cinematic, very clever, or very vague and obnoxious. In the end, however, perhaps not important. <br /> <br /> Long life has flourished :) <br /> <br />
