Daniel Darius, the leader of a famous orchestra, suffers from a heart attack while finishing a concert. Suddenly, we watch him arrive in the small town he left years ago. Since he left too young, after changing his name contributes to give him a new personality. I bought an old school building where I planned to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One can expect a man at his center to have all the comforts of the world that he left behind to be installed in his new home, but no, Daniel has developed a harsh winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> The local priest, Steege, who has a small choir in his church, is calling to see if he can take care of Daniel, but Mosul does not want to return to music. Daniel begins to explore his new world. The people of the town leave him alone. He had an impression on Lina, who works at the local store where he goes to get the food supplies. Little by little, he wanders and decides to take part in the choir. Lina will eventually fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> Initially, the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected. When they get to know him better, they come to accept him and make him one of them. His new attitude is not liked by women who used to be responsible. The choir members are a mixed crew, but they are aware of Daniel's change in the way they interpret different songs. The new piece of Gabriella, the battered wife, has a major impact on her life and the lives of her fellow singers. <br /> <br /> Daniel's thoughts about the ammo clash with Stig. The sudden deputy begins to see Daniel in a new light; he is a tortured man who likes to read pornographic magazines before he loves his wife, Saif. His ideas clash with faith, as Saif points out. Stijg decided to try to put an end to what he considers an unhealthy effect for Daniel by dismissing him as chancellor. <br /> <br /> The choir invited to participate in a competition moves to Austria. Daniel, now completely in favor of Lina, has an opportunity to show her feelings for her for the first time in his life when she begins to doubt their relationship. Daniel, who is late for his own concert, gets to hear them making extraordinary music, though he does not. <br /> <br /> Kai Pollack, the director of this very attractive film, shows that he was the man who directed her. The story involves scenes from the beginning. A large part of the success of the film goes to the band's crew that were assembled together. William Nickfest, who plays the leading role, is the best excuse to watch the film. Freda Halgren, Nicklas Falck and Ilova Love are an excellent job for Mr. Pollack. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nelson is the composer of most of the beautiful music that one hears. The film at Harald Gunnar Balagard makes the film seem better than capturing different seasons for the scenes in its beauty.
