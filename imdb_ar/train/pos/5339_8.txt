I've just seen "Behind Bedroom Doors," and this was the first flick with a powerful story I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> We start with two neighboring couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Crois and Eric Carrington), Lillian and Gabi Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a lawyer who works for a public defender, Lilian works in real estate, and Gabi is a successful plastic surgeon. Got all this? Now, let's get started. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, played beautifully by Chelsea Blue Star porn. She rents the house across the street from the Fenways and lives on her own. At the beginning of the film, James looks at his window and sees that Abby is engaged in playing with her friend Gigi (playing a prolific filmmaker Monique Alexander) and secretly begins to wonder what will be the case with her. The next day, Abby knew all four of them, and she seemed to be a nice woman who happened to be living an alternative lifestyle. She passes through Vivian, who looks surprised and says to her, "Oh ... I ... not that way." Everything seems to be fine ... until the plan begins to move. <br /> <br /> First, Abe appears in Gap's office naked and asks Gap if she should get a job as a moron. This is where we get the movie quote: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe". "what do you want to know?" "Is Gabi happily married?" "I'm married." "There is a problem ... and let me guess ... your wife stays at home and does whatever she asks for, but she is a good girl." "Yes really." "She's not a bad girl?" "No." "Does this door have a lock on it?" <br /> <br /> You know what will happen next ... Abby continues to run it with Gabi, right there in the exam room. After that, she made a small show in her window for James, who comes and spends time having sex with her. What James does not know is that Teddy Bear's piano with a flashing red eye is really a camera that records all the celebrations (very obviously anyway). Abby sex with Gabe again later, and this time joins Gigi to make it triple. Now that Abby has got something from both men, she asks $ 100,000 each to buy her silence. Has not only ruined James' candidacy for president, but also destroyed Gabi's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabi and James wrestle with their guilt, Abby finds time to lure Lillian - who "experimented" with women in college. It was a long time ago, but you will not know that seeing her working with Abby - she looked like an old supporter. <br /> <br /> While Gigi complies with the plan, she seems to be jealous of everyone her girlfriend sex is having. "It's just work," says Abe. Confessions and apologies, as well as some astounding information about Abby's true identity, seem to have been doing the same with different men in many different places. Jabi and James use this information to answer my father's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now, to sex. The sex scenes were very good, and given that all the women involved in this film except Julia Crois have a long pornographic background, I did not expect anything less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best in the film, and the trio came in second. Monique Alexander became nude only once, but she was a relatively small figure. Julia Crois was a key figure and got the same number of times. I suppose because she was surrounded by the pros and cons of experienced hardliners, and she did not have to have as many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> To conclude, the "Behind the Bedroom Doors" has a wonderful story, which enhanced the general appreciation of the film. I consider it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Women: A (Nicole Sheridan was good in this film - better than her subsequent performances in the comedy Fred Olin Rai - at least she could do the drama to a certain extent. I would have given her everything by herself.Julia Crois was the same as usual.I wish Monique Alexander had more time in this film. <br /> <br /> Sex: B (Strong and strong sex scenes) Nicole Sheridan's performances were almost high-quality, and Chelsea Bleu looked good in their sights as well.The girls' performances were not burning, but they heated the screen.) <br /> <br /> /> I liked the main dialogue and narration, Blue Chelsea performed well for this kind of games and I was impressed with the role of Nicole Sheridan in the drama. <br /> <br /> In general: B This was a nice flick. I'm glad I was able to watch this, as I was pleasantly surprised.If Chelsea wants Blue to do more of these things, they'll be welcome at any time.This applies to Nicole Sheridan as well - although she may be better at performing comedy . I do not mind hardcore girls who can act by erotic movies.)
