I totally agree that "Nothing" is a wonderful movie! I did not laugh too much when watching a movie for ages! David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic at this! They work well together! This movie may not appeal to some people (I can not really say why without spoiling it!) But everyone cares about them! I loved it and highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The steering is awesome and some shots are very smart. They seem to have enjoyed a lot when filming! <br /> <br /> Although there are only two main characters in the movie and there are not many props that actors can pull out make the movie fun to watch.
