It is hard to imagine that this film depends on the true story, and how Christie managed to achieve the miracle was very exciting. Daniel Day Lewis Chameleon, it is really hard to imagine how much effort he has made to create this disabled character. Watching it on the screen is a shocking experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is bright and interesting. Christie does not despise normalcy, but his life is full of joy and joy, although we can recognize the loneliness and the painful unity through his eyes. <br /> <br /> An important factor for Christie's success is his mother's support. Which looks more influential, and the actress Brenda Frecker is also well known for her role in the Oscar for this role, this small young middle-aged woman is all used to make Christie's dream a reality. Very lucky for Christy, as Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as a young Christie, what a performance for a child! Christie's love story is very elaborate and reliable. Christie wants love and nothing can be derived from his right to love, crushed by the beautiful Dr. Ellen Cole (amazingly played by Fiona Shaw, I was deeply touched by her role in the Harry Potter series, the gloomy Batonite aunt, so her appearance in this role is really outside I am sympathetic with him, love is a double-edged sword, happiness and suffering are just next to all else. <br /> <br /> BT, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (in America, BOXER, etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying, God knows why he chose to direct those wastes! Truly a stray career for him, unfortunately!
