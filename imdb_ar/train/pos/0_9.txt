Promwell Hay Animation Comedy. It was run at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as "teachers". 35 years in the teaching profession led me to believe that Promwell Hay's spelling was closer to the reality of "teachers". The scramble for financial survival, the insightful students who can see the truth through the pomp of their pathetic teachers, and the state of the situation as a whole remind me of all the schools I know and their students. When I saw the episode in which the student repeatedly tried to burn the school, I immediately remembered ......... in the classic line ........ Inspector: I am here to dismiss a teacher. Student: Welcome to Promwell High. I expect many adults of my age believe that Bromwell High is out of reach. Oh unfortunately it is not!
