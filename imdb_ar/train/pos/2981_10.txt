Why is this film's crap rated so low ?! I've seen this movie more than 25 times and I know that every line for this movie. Obviously I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the Team New American Masterpieces) are the main characters Joe Cooper, Coop, Airman Cooper, Doug Remer or Sir Swish. Basically, they are referred to only as Coop and Remer through the movie. As soon as the film begins, it reminds us of the rotten, hungry world of over-paid sports, but goes even further to form one called "Townsel". I have to quote this part of the film because it is true with some sports: "After playing in New England, San Diego, Houston and St. Louis, a year in Toronto Arganots, plus one season at Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the beautiful city of Miami." His agent tends: "Minnesota". Let's not forget this important piece of film. So Coop and Remer begin to be in a high school reunion and realize that they are still nothing while talking to their old classmates. Abroad they invent a sports game BASEketball after their challenge are likely to be high school basketball champions. After being neglected, sport has become pro-active in almost a year. During this time they managed to recruit his third teammate in the team Squeak, which is actually a day after the invention of the game. As the film follows, we discovered that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only remaining athletic heroes. The story follows with Zany extortion, the Milwaukee beers and the humorists so it's ridiculous that they'll make you cry for more. Watch it dude, it's hilarious.
