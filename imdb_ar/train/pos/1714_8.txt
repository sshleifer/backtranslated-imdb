Watching the movie I was in a very light mood, as this film is light, but the end of the film is quite unexpected, leaving long lasting memories in your mind. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and his career as a witness during the marriage of the registrar. Suha comes to the marriage and does not agree with her boyfriend, leaving her alone in the street and can not go home and has nothing to live here in this case. It turned out that my father was helping her, that is the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is viewable and the end of the sweet and bitter story on Abhay faces it and keeps you on the edge of the bench. <br /> <br /> dialogues and music are good songs, well, the direction is good, so the scenario you feel is that the movie is slow but you are looking to ask for the story, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> It's a real water game, especially with a light mood. I enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. My rating for this is 8/10
