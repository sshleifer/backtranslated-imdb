How many of us want to be able to get rid of social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Do we dance? Not a movie about dancing. It's about learning about ourselves, getting to know what we're looking for in life, and having the courage to look for it. Mr. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where dance in the dance floor is inappropriate. <br /> <br /> One day, Mr. Sugiyama sees a pretty girl leaning out of a dance academy window. He is intrigued by it, and eventually participates in dance lessons. He is ashamed of his dance and afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dance lessons from his colleagues and family. <br /> <br /> There is a hilarious scene in the men's room at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe were boycotted, a work colleague was also dancing, doing some dance steps. There are many funny and hearty scenes. <br /> <br /> The end is not a fairy tale, but it makes the viewer feel good. <br /> <br /> This film helped me understand the Japanese people a little better. It's a warm and interesting film.
