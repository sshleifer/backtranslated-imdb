I watched this movie for the first time while drunk in a hotel in Canada. While flipping through channels, the Easy Lube section appears. My friend continued to flipping but I told him to come back. Something about the name of plain lubrication just did not seem true. I watched the rest of the film was a very funny curse. Select two credits and go home to find them. Turned out to be the first Chevy Chase movie. I did not remember him. I did not remember much about it, so I rented it and gave it a second look. It's very funny and very sketchy. It's just like KFC except for not funny. I love fingers, easy lubrication, I parts President Da Ken **. Merchants of the play is very very cool. Give it 6.5 or 7 out of ten
