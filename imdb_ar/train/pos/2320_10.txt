This film is not just a great film for basic cinematography (script, representation, preparation, etc.) but also because of its reality. This film can occur in any farm or rural setting. There will be no difference if the film happens in Louisiana or if it will be held in Kansas. The story and the messages it contains will remain the same. This film shows family values ​​and communication with an older audience, while at the same time presenting young behavior to young viewers. Anyone who watches this will stay away from something I personally touched, I know I did. The number of home arrivals is very close to home so that the tears do not burst every time I see them. The end emphasizes the importance of farm safety, and everyone on the farm should watch this film. Lack of attention and lack of interest makes you in serious situations. <br /> <br />
