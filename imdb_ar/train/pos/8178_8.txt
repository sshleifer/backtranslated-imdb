Not that many movies have really exploited the fear of going to a dentist that benefits many people. Those in the profession have some scary tools that look real. Give the book Dennis Pauli, Stewart Gordon, and Charles Finch to draw the most shock from your seat in their hypothesis. <br /> <br /> Corbin Berenson, with a very fine performance, is Alan Feinston, a specialist dentist who jumps his tracks early. Being an unbalanced obsessive-compulsive disorder, he begins to talk about thoughts of decay, so that he imagines them when there is nothing, and also equals the corruption of society in general. After seeing his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) get her with a boy pond, he decided to punish her. At the same time, he is under pressure from the victim of IR.S. Agent (Earl Bowen, known as Dr. Silberman of the Terminator franchise) to provide service in exchange for replacing the client for his mouth on Finston Financial. He begins to recognize everyone around him that he is somehow disintegrating, and he continues the killings as police investigator Gibbs (permanent welcome Ken Keane) picks up his trail. <br /> <br /> Director Bryan Yozna clearly has great fun with the script. Allows for some really bad and amusing scenes that only lead to creating sympathy for the victims as the audience craves. The text gives the characters of Finestone some fine lines of dialogue, which is overall and entertaining in general, with large doses of black humor on the court (like Feinston ordering the victim "to take their tongue out of the way!"). Brooke and I.R.S. The client figure in torture scenes is particularly effective. The effects of makeup are mostly very good. The film does a great job of maintaining its forward momentum, and Feinstone, thanks to his hard drive to perfection, moves from a respected professional to an uninterrupted killer in record time. <br /> <br /> Foree, always gorgeous and fun to watch, is lost in the role of the standard detective, but there is some fun watching Bowen playing his role in baseball. Hoffman and Christa Sawles provide a very appealing eye candy. Mark Ruffalo can be seen before fame in a small supporting role. But this is all that Brinson showed him drowning his teeth (excuse me for using this expression) in his leading part of the plum with complete faith. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Dentist" is rated as one of the most original and interesting horror films dating back to the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
