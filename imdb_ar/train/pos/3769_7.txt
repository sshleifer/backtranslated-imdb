Oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. When I was a kid, Oh, this movie was worth the Oscar for me. I thought it was completely hysterical. One of the best movies I have seen. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a little stupid, but come on. If you enjoy an "excellent adventure", you should probably enjoy a "fake trip". This was the movie before "Dude, Where's My Car?". This one just is really funny. As I said, it's just a good time. Should not be taken seriously and if you enjoyed first, you should love the "fake flight". It's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. Just for your pleasure, watch it, leave it, and remember it's a silly comedy. That's it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
