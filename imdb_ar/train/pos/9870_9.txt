With a relatively small budget for a $ 60 million animation film, people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios did an amazing job. <br /> <br /> They have brought together modern digital animations, casting great talent from Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a very enjoyable family movie with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your friends in the herd . And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to form a herd. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, you receive a strong political message about connecting with people who share your space - you may need to see all world leaders! <br /> <br /> David Newman - another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - offers a superbly non-intrusive degree to date, moving the work, and sometimes a positive eavesdropping toe. <br /> <br /> The overall appearance of the film is incredible. The land of the imagination is intensively colorful, quaint and believable, heaters, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were delighted with the facial expression of Ray Romano's ?? DoDo comes from. "<br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things that can worry or frighten children to a great extent - but it is true. <br /> <br /> It will be a great movie to watch in theater and home buying.
