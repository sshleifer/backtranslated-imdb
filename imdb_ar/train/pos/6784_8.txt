I like Ronald Coleman, who is the focus of his eyes, and is the colleague you see in movies like If I Were King and Kismet. I love him as a summary of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. Coleman is not my favorite incubator. <br /> <br /> But in the film "Double Life" precisely because his role as actor John John was indifferent to him, Coleman was recognized as the best actor Oscar of 1947. He became the best known part of him. <br /> <br /> Coleman is a representative who is already taking the way very seriously. He has just finished running a successful comedy of literature and is a cheerful fellow. To change the pace now that the play has ended from Broadway, Coleman brought Revival to Othello to New York. Unlike what you can get. <br /> <br /> His leading wife is his former wife, Sain Hasso, whom she loves so much, but can not change his mood when he is at work. Coleman loves her so much and wants her back. But he is heading towards a mental breakdown when he begins to confuse him with the jealousy of Mor Othello and Chaho with her role as a Dismona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters is a poor waitress picked up by the depressed Coleman. Of his madness and ended up like poor Desdemona in the play. Was killed in the same way and is now important for the murder of Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Coleman's performance is so good that one wonders whether this is a professional risk to actors? I was trembling to think about it. Were there any unresolved murders in or near Lawrence Olivier and Orson Welles and then they drafted Othello. <br /> <br /> I could never buy the story for that reason, but I certainly commend Ronald Kollman and what he did with the piece. I'm sure there was little regret in winning the Oscars because one of the other candidates was his close friend William Powell for life with the father. Others who participated that year were Gregory Beck for the Gentlemen Agreement, John Garfield's Body and Spirit, and Michael Redgrave for Mourning Becomes Electra. <br /> <br /> Coleman gets the support of the rest of the actors including Edmund or Brian, who finds himself in the unwanted part of Casio's passionate fantasy of Coleman.However, you will find no equivalent of Iago in A Double Life, and no one urges jealousy, all in his mind. <br /> <br /> That is one of the most cultivated minds of the last century.
