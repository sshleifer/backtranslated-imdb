Salva and his wife Bagardo were on the sidelines of the law for most of their lives. We see them wandering around in an underground car, where they made them get lame donations, nobody gives them anything! I do not have any redeeming qualities, which is to discover a realistic program on television that gives him an idea of ​​what to do next. The debt and the trade show prove to be a winning combination, which Salva has benefited from. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo were in prison after the sudden death of a priest who was critical of the duo. It appears to be normal for the reality program. He transforms himself into a personality similar to Christ who is an instant success in the program. Espe, a meaningless and productive woman of the show, can not escape the way she has already given her extraordinary attention. Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his eventual success. <br /> <br /> Jordi Mola, who was his first film director, achieved some success in the way he played the role of television. Spain, which was exposed to these types of programs, saw its share of the stranger, which the director felt was an attack on the public and wanted to tell his story from the point of view of the people who make a fortune from the naive audience. <br /> <br /> The cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Mola, like any actor deciding to direct his first film, was more effective in focusing on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Vidu, David Jimenez Cacho, Franco Francescanto, Florida Chico and the rest responded to the new manager.
