I almost did not go to see this film because I remember that the Penguin March was not very exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if you went to see it on the opening weekend, but after I went, it was amazing; the fact that photographers can take impossible pictures is simply worth your money. You can also see different habitats, different plants, animals, and natural phenomena that will not shock you - because you will never expect nature to be charming and dynamic - but also touch your soul and raise the question of humanity versus the world, how our lives deviated from nature to the point where we take for granted Of natural beauty and miracles that are the essence of our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of the earth or the environment that embraces trees to appreciate the sheer amazement of this documentary. You simply have to be a curious spirit questioning the value and miracle of life. Enjoy!
