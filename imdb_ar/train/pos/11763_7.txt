I think everyone has a return sometime. That's exactly what Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), a resident of TAV, intends to do in The Best of Times. Yes, the guy who became very crazy with the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" plays football. In this case, he seeks to re-play a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But former teammate Renault Hittauer (Kurt Russell) will not easily agree. <br /> <br /> Granted, it's not the best film for any man. But Williams and Russell are in fact a good comedy team. It is likely that some of the names in this movie will give you a laugh (to say the least). check it out.
