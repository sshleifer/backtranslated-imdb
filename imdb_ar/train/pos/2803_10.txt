As the world champion in the previous Okinawan Karate, I love films about sacrifice for sport. But this film revolves around much more. This film is very good and very deep. I recently suffered a very serious injury and a catastrophic lack of emotion. It almost extinguished the lights for me. This silly little movie touched me so deeply that it reminded me of what life was supposed to be. This is a film about life. Live your life for yourself and respect others. Empowerment. God bless "Bend it like Beckham" I think it is a real gem.
