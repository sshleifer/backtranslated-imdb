I first watched this movie when it was aired on the Trio channel, which expired a few years ago, and I recently saw it again - no ads - on Sundance. I was impressed the first time and found it more attractive in the second viewing. Yes, some sectors are far from perfect - Commentary Amos Jetayi hysterical emerges like a painful thumb - but collectively, 11 09 01 is a complete success. The best part of the show: the stunning final part of Shuhi Imamura, which has been misinterpreted by contemporary critics such as the heavy-minded Mick LaSalle in a way as an attack on the "terrorists," but they are now being discovered as a witty anti-war challenger; Samira Makhmalbaf, Deep with the victims of September 11 with a frank interest in the children of Afghanistan; and Idrissa Ouedraogo, a crusade of amazement on Osama bin Laden - a serious and almost successful pursuit, like Osama's. The slice of Youssef Chahine is a noble experience if it fails and has at least the courage to remind the public that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are essentially US foreign policy and the CIA, and although Sean Penn's personal study is still misplaced, All in all, a basic view and a better scene than Oliver Stone's retrospective World Trade Center.
