This is a very entertaining movie. Some of the reviews I have read in this forum have been written by people who seem to think the film was an attempt at a serious drama. It was not that way ... It's a very fun movie, it's played in a cheeky way. It is clear that all actors enjoy entertainment with us. The sequence of battles is full of vigor and, above all, unwarranted. The so-called "green death", which has been used on several occasions, is not, as I read in one review, "heinous." Two reviewers were severely critical of the martial arts battle between Doc and Seas near the end of the film. Hey, lighten up ... Again, I mention one and all this is a fun movie. Each stage of this "battle" was introduced, which was added to the fun side. The actors were not trying to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way in which the ultimate fate of the "bad guys" is handled. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie seriously and simply watch it for entertainment, you will spend 100 minutes in a very fun way.
