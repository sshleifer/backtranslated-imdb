Well ... Vivah film is very good, but it is typical of Sorag Bargatia. Featuring various aspects of Indian families, weddings, etc. The film is more than good, but it is not very good. <br /> <br /> Another important point in the film is the direction, music and representation of Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor of Indian film --- a girl hated by the mother. The story is that the film is a bit common, but it's good, good enough to make a film out of popular movies. <br /> <br /> The subtraction point is a popular Bollywood story. Overall I would say that twice I have to watch the movie, if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and of course love!
