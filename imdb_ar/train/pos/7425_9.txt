Barbara Streisand is a tour of power in this Hollywood story. Her performances and songs are unique and are especially in the wonderful movie halls. The scene in which Christopherson met the unexpected audience, against the wishes of the fans and her people, only to manage her through her outstanding performance "Woman in the Moon" is one of the best examples of a film about how great a performance can win an audience. It's real. The scene where Evergreen ranks with the best in the work .. all live, without a verbal synchronization, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a singer, but she does. She's a great singer "with One More Look At You, who earned the Oscars she received and Paul Williams for Evergreen, and Christoferson also had his moments far above most of his film. From 1937 (Janet Ginor, Frederick Marsh) although I will always enjoy Judy Garland and James Mason's musical remake of 1954. I have not seen DVD yet and I do not know its quality.
