My son was 7 years old when he saw this film, and he is now on a Russian fishing boat and said that the film he was so impressed with and which has been in his mind all these 39 years is the movie The Legend of the Boy and Eagle. I have asked if it is possible for me to get this for him. I'm sure a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he was on board this ship for 3 months and will have another 3 months before his contract expires. Because we have Indian blood related to this film. On the 27th of January, he will be 47 years old and I would like to receive this film on his behalf. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the last 17 years. As we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crot Soto, Deerfield Beach, Florida
