I bought Halloween, which is not really a terrible film, but it could have been a lot of things. She had a lot of historical value, played by a very talented actress / actors, and not a daily event that the actors could play such a role and be fairly believable. There were some parts that were modest and a bit confusing, but I did not say that the whole movie was terrible. Once you think about it, grab the 1800s in New Orleans and make something out of it, it's very hard, and much harder to get the actors that can strongly denote these parts. But the only big problem I encountered in the film was that most of the actors who played the role of the free colored people were mostly light-skinned Africans, and were not global in portraying others who were not light skinned. One of the old Creole stereotypes that still exist. The choice could have been chosen by a wide range when it comes to hue, although many Creole are aware of the colors. Instead, it was possible to choose actors who were looking to white in one way or another in the sense of the word. The actors did a great job, the script could have been better written, and overall found that the shows were very reasonable.
