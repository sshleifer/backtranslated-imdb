This is a great movie. I like where he climbs ning to get his finger, and stalks the skeletons, but fortunately he escapes them, opens the window, and does not notice them. Xiao Qian very very beautiful. When the needle stuck to Ma Wu's butt, hysterical. And when he says love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between the great sevine as well. Then also the part where he eats his cakes while watching the man kills a lot of people. Then you see chanting poems as he runs away from the wolves. Romantic love scenes, Xiao Qian and Ning look cute together. Add comic timing, giant tongue, and you have horror, romance and comedy, all at once. Not to mention wonderful special effects for the 90s.
