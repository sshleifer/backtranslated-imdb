It is a beautiful film that is well behaved by all the players. It will make you laugh and make you cry. The end of the film makes me mistake every time. If you want to see a great movie, that's it. Jimmy Stewert offers brilliant performance and Frank Morgan as Matuschek. Morgan's diversity is not surprising. William Tracy as Pepi is a great comic entertainer and offers some of the most important films and lines. Felix Bressart offers a great performance like Perovitch, an ambitious stumbling shop worker who pleases those who work with them. It's a simple story of how close coworkers can become and how two people who have a great antagonism toward each other fall in love despite extraordinary circumstances.
