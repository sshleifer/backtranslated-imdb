Forget the "religious" films that have monopolized the TV / movie market ... this film has a real sense of it. Although it can be considered a film with cheap emotional measurements, it also carries a message of forgiveness and good morals in general. However, I did not like lighting in this film ... For a movie dealing with such a subject, it was very bright. I felt that it had dispensed with the general appeal of the film, which was almost an unforgivable sin, but the well-known actors and their performance resisted this censorship. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching ... Buy DVD.
