This is one of Hong Kong's best films (movement) around him, and has a tense and exciting story as well as great fighting scenes. Sammo contains everything, romance, drama, excitement and a great hero as well. It was the only martial arts film that interested me in the plot rather than just waiting for the battles. Sammo fans - this is a must (see also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
