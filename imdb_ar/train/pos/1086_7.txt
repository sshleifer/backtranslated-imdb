This film is a bit unusual because it got a very slim plot and the film itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. While this makes it quite different from the normal Grant movie, it is still very fun and enjoyable. It seems as if someone said, "Let's follow Carrie around and watch her worry about all the minor problems that arise when a home is being rehabilitated." In view of what is an interesting actor in the film and the great support he gets from Mirna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. While the film has very modest excuses, it benefits the most from materials. It's a great movie for Carey Grant fans or for the whole family.
