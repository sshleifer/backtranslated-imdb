I just returned from a show two hours ago, and I was very happy with the film when I left the film. It's very intense, and closer to crying in a movie sometime. This is credited to Adam Sandler, who performs superbly on many levels, and is probably worth the Oscar Award for it, if he did not come out early in the year. Don Cheadle presents his usual wonderful performance as he plays straight man with troubled Adam. <br /> <br /> There is some humor, but most of them are really funny compared to the moments of tears, where Adam deals with his loss and without struggling to help him. Adam plays two levels well ... When he is mentally stable, he is funny and loved, but when he is stable, he is good and less stable. It is strong and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who likes the drama drama about friendship and hard loss.
