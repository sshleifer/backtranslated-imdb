Thank God ABC picked up this instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is Wonderfalls Meet Dead Like Me in the best way possible. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the experience of death and fate early in life makes me admire Brian Fuller, but I certainly enjoy his productions. I also enjoy the turbulent floors, the pies, the modern games, the gravel and other harmful elements: while the "Bortonesque" a little, I certainly think that this enjoys its own place that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderful playground for creativity. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood collide with each and make them in reality logical and make us want to live life to the fullest!
