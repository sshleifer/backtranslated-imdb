Well, I finally hung on to Rock 'N' Roll High School, almost 30 years after it turned into a midnight movie in 1979. (Latecomer and I, perhaps first watching this summer's new documentary "Patti Smith": Dream Life "sometime around 2040!) No, the film does not feel a little dated, and yes, it was worth the wait. By PJ Soles, and the battle she and her colleagues conducted at Vince Lombardi High University against their new repressive director, Miss Togar. (Danny Perry, in his "Worship Films," describes Mary's and Ronov's performance as "Evil Eve Eve Jordan.") The storyline of the teens versus the story of the establishment is reinforced with some silly humor (those explosive mice, those giant mouse, Hansel and Gretel's auditoriums) and some really exciting tunes. Number one in the evil Ramones original band, and that band of the baker graduated dozens of her greatest songs during the film, including five concerts at a grand ceremony. In fact, it may be a scene Riff is dancing hard on the "Teen Lobotomy" in this explosion is the furthest moment in the picture. The initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Di and Markey in their Ramonesmobile car, later retreated into the street singing "I just want to do something to do," is very delightful. The film ends with an explosive confrontation, I think, the dream of every child in high school. Things really fun. On the side level, Ramones was one of the top bands I saw at a concert, so I was very happy to note that a DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How old are the bad guys I found these translations necessary, I wonder ....
