Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) science fiction movies in Hollywood. But a long time ago he was bringing out masterpieces of public excitement in his native country. The story is a basic fascination hypothesis, nothing new or enchanting. Verhoeven believes that he can improve it by adding a series of dream sequences, which instead of identifying our main character and status, are used only as a means to push the expected plot. The scenario was solid, with dialogue helping to mitigate the effects of a poor story. What made the film at least good was good acting. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as a "tortured artist", and his supporters were also good. Also, Jean de Punt adds some film life at least to the film, which helps make Verhoeven seem at least able to be a way out. 2 / * * * *
