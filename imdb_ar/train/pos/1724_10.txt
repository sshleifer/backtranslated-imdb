This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German prisoner of war camp, Stalag Löft III, during World War II. This is the same POW camp that was the scene of the massive escape that killed 50 officers who were captured by the Gestapo (and later turned into a very successful movie of the same name). <br /> <br /> While other prisoners of war at Stalag Luft III are busy working in their huge three tunnels (known as Tom and Dick & Harry), two adventurous British prisoners have come to the idea of ​​building a vaulted wooden horse that can be placed near a fence And to shorten the distance from which they will have to move from this starting point to freedom. The idea of ​​building their version of the Trojan horse came when they were discussing "classic" attempts to escape and watching some prisoners of war play a leap in the compound. <br /> <br /> Initially contains one, and later with two prisoners of war hiding in the interior, the wooden horse can be carried out in the compound and placed in the same position almost, near the fence, on a daily basis. As the POWs jumped over the horse, the fugitives were busy inside the horse by digging a tunnel from the bottom of the jumping horse while placing it near the wire, under the wire and in the forest. <br /> <br /> The story also details the risks faced by two of the three escaped prisoners as they traveled through Germany and occupied Europe after they left the tunnel. All three prisoners who tried to flee had already hit the house (successfully fled to their main base). The wooden horse gives a very accurate and accurate sense of tension and the events of the prisoners' outbreak. The film was filmed on the actual locations along the route traveled prisoner of war in their escape. The Wooden Horse is made at a much lower budget than The Great Escape, The Wooden Horse is more realistic if not more exciting than The Great Escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat in order to reach POWs to make their escape a good one. <br /> <br /> The storyline is clear and the acting episodes are correct enough to keep up the tension throughout the film. The Wooden Horse relies on a book of the same name by one of the fugitives, Eric Williams, which is by far the best escape story for prisoners of war turned into a movie. Some of the actual prisoners of war were used in the film to rediscover their presence as prisoners in Stalag Luft III. I gave this film ten deserving.
