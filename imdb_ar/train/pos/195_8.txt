"Show People" is a delightful silence directed by King Fedor and starring Marion Davis and Billy Haines. What lies both in this charming comedy about a young girl named Peggy Pepper, who talks about trying to savanna it on the big screen. Although it has been successful in comedy, only what you want to do is "Art" until you move to the Higher Arts Studio. Patricia soon became Pippoar, a very good example of her friend Billy. <br /> <br /> Many stars in the Silent Age appeared in "Show People", including Davies herself without curly hair and makeup. I'm sure when people watched the movie in 1928, they knew each of the back in the detailed lunch scene; unfortunately, at present, it is not, even for movie buffs. In one part of the film, I met Charlie Chaplin. In another film, writer Elinor Glenn was referred to, and Fedor himself has a veil at the end of the film. The other stars who appeared on Show People are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, Hart, Littress Joy, Flowers Flowers, Rene Adory, Rod LaRock, Eileen Pringle and many others. <br /> <br /> Davis was adorable and the comedian was alive. It is shameful that William Haines surrendered to movies - he was nice and active, and deserved to be a big star a day. <br /> <br /> "Show People" is a simple story that is brilliantly narrated. It is also a look at an exciting era in the history of Hollywood, featuring performances by two great stars.
