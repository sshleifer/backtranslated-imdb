Multiple huge chills down the spine! I am surprised at the presence of people they did not like! I saw him at 10 am and I'm still scared! I've seen hundreds of horror / horror movies! I scream out loud, I'm 22 years old !!! I mean, well, voice acting, not good, maybe even a B movie. But a real look of terror, sound effects, flow! From the start, it hits you again and again with horrible, unforgiving scenes! Too many cliches yet do not fail / surprise! You know it's coming, coming, coming, BOO! And you are still jumping from the chair. Grab a pillow and blanket, contact your closest friend and do not see him at night! Hats for the Japanese!
