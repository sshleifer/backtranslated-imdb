I just watched this movie on DVD and I thought the acting was very good, but the whole story left much to be desired. This film has the same texture and look of panic at Nidel Park or Cowboy Pharmacy. It is hard to believe that humans can live this kind of lifestyle; the weakness of society, where their full existence depends on the use of hard drugs, crime, violence, sex, and total lack of self-esteem for anyone or anything, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is a prominent role in his role as "Burned" former pornstar John Holmes. Cast is a good support. However, this film is dark, dark, annoying and frustrating. The murder was brutal, but the daily lives of these people were also brutal. Unless you have an interest in these crimes or you love John Holmes, this is really not a film you see. If you want to see a documentary about murder, Truman Capot in the 1960s in Cold Blood and starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are much better.
