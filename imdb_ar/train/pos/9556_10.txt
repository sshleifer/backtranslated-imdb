When the local television station first launched, it filled much of its schedule with old British programs. "Close your daughters!" It was duly broadcast, and I - swinging through the opening of a few seconds of the movie - popped into an empty bar. The best thing I've ever done. <br /> <br /> The actors are beautifully suited to their personalities and bring them a joyful life, complete with appropriate accents (Christopher Flemming will leave you in stitches, as does Houdin and her family). Double entrants are abundant, mixing wheels with proven lines inside the wheels and matching the characters, and spreading the ballistic vision brakes in each scene, and issuing the missing comments on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> The movie was shown to friends a few years ago, they called this piece "Lost Treasure", for the actors of the story. To this day I can only address the thought of dialogue. If these gems find their way into DVD, I'll be at the front of the line.
