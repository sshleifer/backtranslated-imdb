What a good movie! Finally an image reveals an unknown side of the rock: the illusions of fame. The famous rock has become old and forgotten, not music. With a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy may be the best rock and roll movie I have ever seen. Much better than the Spinal Tap for example. why? Because in the still crazy, mature people. They have a different view about the rocks, about love and about life. They want to catch up with their crazy young people, who miss so much. Behind the same story, we see personalities with their own personalities, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Have fun watching this (listen to great soundtrack!) and finally think about your future. <br /> <br /> Goodbye!
