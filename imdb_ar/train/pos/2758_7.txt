This film revolves around the potential friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> Personal evolution in this movie is excellent. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and George is an innocent man who yearns for love and care from a "natural" society. The acting was excellent, and the best actor award for the award was well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fictional scenes in the film highlight the fact that George is miserable about his family's abandonment of his desire, and his desire to be treated as a natural person. A song that is played repeatedly also promotes this message. The film shows that people with a mental disability are good. We treated them with discrimination and neglect, a fact that the scene shows up with George giving a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we can understand and share the world of these people, we and the mentally disabled will become very happy. <br /> <br /> I have been attracted to the film and the emotional experiences of the characters. It is an influential film of good spirits.
