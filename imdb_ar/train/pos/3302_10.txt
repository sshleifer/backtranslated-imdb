Perhaps the hottest Indian films - Pakeezah does not fit into any of the common traps associated with Bollywood (ie fatigue, farce, wholesale and the unsuccessful imitation of western film themes / films). Pakeezah is the original in the sub-continent and authentic, almost Madam Butterfly looks like in the plot. The characters are well developed, although they are sometimes calculated according to today's standards, they are aware and convincing. Urdu-speaking circles in the era of Bakiza were masters of minimizing the way in which dialogue conveys the minute details of the age! Representation (especially "looks" and dynamics among characters) is a pleasure although nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those who do not know the traditions and traditions of Muslim India. <br /> <br /> Besides, with a captivating scenario is a beautiful musical result, enhanced by the protagonist displayed a prominent leadership of classical Indian dance (kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not take her leave from the audience without the viewer feeling that he / she is part of a truly memorable film experience. Pakiz√© is definitely the top of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be parallel.
