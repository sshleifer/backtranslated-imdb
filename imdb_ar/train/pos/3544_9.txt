Men and dolls should be one of my favorite musical films of all time. It's a very interesting film to watch and no more. It embodies what people have forgotten about the musicals that were presented for entertainment, not for evangelism. At present we have Rent and Chicago which are great lyric plays and good movies but fail to bring us a solid entertainment with no restrictions. The only thing that bothered me in the film was Marlon Brando, the guy could not sing! It was very disturbing to listen to him sing and speak when I could not understand him. If not for Marlon they would have given this 10 stars. Guys and Dolls offer old entertainment that we rarely get these days. Watch it to spend a good time!
