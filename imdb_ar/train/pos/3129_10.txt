This is one of the best reunion specials ever, with Adam West and Bert Ward making fun of themselves and relaxing while doing so. It's amazing how much effort has been made in the details, especially the restoration of the 1960s feeling, the Batcave, the Manor, the costumes, and the actors selected to play the smaller versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero and Frank Gorshen! This is worth 90 minutes of your time, and all the fans of the classic TV series "Batman" are happy in 1960. I notice that the Batman videos were from the movie, not from the series itself, perhaps because of legal restrictions. Let's hope the three chapters of the show are coming on DVD.
