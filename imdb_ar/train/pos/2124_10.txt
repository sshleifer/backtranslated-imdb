This is a really classic film in the story, acting and film show. The wonderful actors all over the film, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the most prominent figures. In real life, she was very admired, she loved Jimmy, and already gave him his first acting roles, and helped him to be quieter with his appearance on the group. The "chemistry" between the two was always clear, very warm and pleasant. She was a pretty young woman and beautiful in portraying her character. The story of these two young men, how they eventually met in the end witch to watch and pure magical entertainment. Presentations on heart temperature are also provided by other supporting actors in this wonderful story / film. I give full warmth to Miss Sullivan's best 10 films in this classic golden age of cinema, which is particularly attractive to all generations. Must see for everyone!
