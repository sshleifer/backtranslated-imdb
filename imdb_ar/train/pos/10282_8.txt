If your idea of ​​excitement is chasing cars, explosions, and dozens of people shot, "House of Games" is definitely not the right movie for you. If you love and appreciate drama and suspense, then by all means, watch it. <br /> <br /> The story of "The House of Games" tells the story of a respected psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Cross), who tries to help the patient and participate in the mysterious world of deceit led by charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say anything more about the plot would spoil the thrill. Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says he saw the twists coming. Just like a smart phishing artist, this movie guides you to his website and calms your vigilance. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting and well designed, and the dialogue is clever and witty, acting well homogeneous and charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic figure and wondered why Mamet Lindsay Cross looked physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cool and far away. Moreover, her imposibility is fundamental to the plot (at some point, I think that the injury of her sexual self-esteem is an essential part of her motivation ... I will say no more). <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a gloomy look on the underside of human nature that concludes the disturbing ambiguity. You'll get noticed every second while watching, and you'll stay with you for a long time afterwards.
