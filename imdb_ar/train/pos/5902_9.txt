As a Westerner views the view of another culture and imitation of Marriag, Just Married finds a charming and fun. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. But this is the case in this Indian film. He told us in a new sense of humor that we were learning from Abhay and Retica who had met only once and spent the traditional honeymoon for five days. As it has been said, it is hard to believe in this rich age of cell phone that such an old habit as arranged marriage still occurs. We see the embarrassment felt by this young couple when they meet on the first night and how they try to form a bond, even though they do not know each other. We see different views about marriage and commitment as presented by other couples also on holiday, from two years married to others who are still unsure of marital commitment. There is a song, intelligent dialogue, touching moments, blending and comparing new ways and traditions. Sure, watching a movie with subtitles loses some of the truth of the story, yet we are still pleased to see it. Some plot was given a little vulgar and the bus incident was a bit cramped and crowded. But the film was worth watching.
