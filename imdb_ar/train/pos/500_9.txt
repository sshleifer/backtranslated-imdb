I, like many hikers (or Trekkies who do not care!) I suffered from seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", I dreamed of a better show when it was over, and I regretted the end of "Deep Space Nine" in 1999. "Enterprise" is wonderful. New perspective, completely different characters, amazing new images, a pop-up song for the intro. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything I did not like. Register me for 10 seasons of this offer. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager", no one misses you! Continue Trekkin 'trip! <br /> <br />>
