I've seen a freebird film and I think it's awesome! Relaxed, soon, the British film industry came up with something fun !! It's good how the guy who met them at the service station in the film is mentioned in news agents, a nice touch. The acting was convincing (I'm a biker) reminded me of some good times I spent in the bike scene. It was good to see the film director involved in acting, and well! In the end a new crop is being mentioned, in Ireland. Is this the basis for a second film? Hope to keep them coming. Fantastic movie, well written, realistic characters!
