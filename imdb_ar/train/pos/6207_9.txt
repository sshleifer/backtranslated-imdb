I've just watched this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Lovers of Hull Hartley will not disappoint me !! If you are not familiar with this film festival ... it does not matter. This film can certainly stand alone. I have to go for the second check ... it was amazing I need to see it again - and quickly !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. It's a very intelligent dialogue, and Parker Pussy's wonderful performance as starring in Faye Grimm. Fay Grim is the latest feature to review the world and characters presented in Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most distinctive feature is the usual use of the cut angle (or Dutch), which is often seen in Hartley's previous works, which appear in various short films, available in Possible Films: Short Works from Hal Hartley 1994-2004, The Girl of the Two (2005). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie appropriately on September 11th. In fact, the adventure of Faye Grim in this story has receded in the face of the changing world after September 11, 2001. Without going into the main spoilers, I see this work, the story scientist as a political and original image of geopolitical courage rarely, if ever , In the foreground of the prevailing fantasy cinema after 911 so far (see Sorena: from the side note - Mark Cobb Exec.) Brod in both films ... the most interesting, at least). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those who are closely associated with the characters of Henry Bean, Simon, Faye and Henry, this film is self-conscious and self-conscious. However, the character of Faye Grimm begins in the film, where it was exactly when Henry Fowl's reign ended, but by the end of the film ... the knowledge and experience of Fei had changed completely and expanded throughout the narrative. What can be in store for the future of Fei and the family lie ... ?? I can not wait until the third part of this story!
