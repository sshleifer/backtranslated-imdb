I was delighted to attend a screening of The Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This film caught my attention briefly when I stumbled upon an article about it in Gallus Magazine. Sounds interesting at the time, but nothing very exciting. Anyway, I've seen it in the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless when the end of the accounts started trading. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films I've ever seen. Photography, artistic orientation, acting, and especially directing, were smooth and impeccable. Nothing is clear to you in this film and makes you think. Something you do the vast majority of movies today is just the opposite. The dialogue was carefully prepared, and although this script is not a chatter from the wall to the wall, the words of the characters are deliberate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of those movies worth watching again and whenever you see it, and more things you notice. It's a very layered and intelligent film. I'm not sure what time or place to play it again, but you should see a specific movie lover.
