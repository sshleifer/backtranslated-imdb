This is one of my top 10 films of all time. Maybe a lot of people who see this for the first time and know little about many features in the film will not understand why I find it so exciting so I'll try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich with historical details and cultural visions, It contains a few minor historical paradoxes, but it can be forgiven completely. The story is an account of the famous fencing between Monk Pinky and the young prince Yoshitson on the bridge of Goju. During the battle according to the legend, Yoshitson was superior to Pinky and became the loyal friar of the Prince. This film is a review of that story and includes war, dark prophecy and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is Mapu, the Buddha's prophecy that 1000 years later its teachings will fail and the world will fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan, after the outbreak of Mt Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) that the world will fall into chaos and that everything will collapse. It is time for devils. <br /> <br /> Next, you have the way the movie solves the training issue of Yoshitsune sword by Tenku (Raven Goblins) of Karuma. The defeated tribes often fled to the mountains and disguised themselves as devils to intimidate the local population. It is said that this is where the ninja tribes have historically started. Yoshitson's portrayal of Goju is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Then there are Benkei, the various breeds of Buddhism, including much of the Inner Buddhism of the Xingun sect. These are all perfectly pictured, and just to add a little, the film manages to transfer the power of meditation and ki energy in a way that makes it an integral part of the story, that is, it uses magical realism to add an extra dimension to the film, but does it in a way that makes it tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> It is full of amazing tales and amazing rings in life for this period. The scenery and costuming are also not quite miss and very authentic. The soundtrack is fantastic, very encouraging and ominous. I also thought that the performance of the actual representation was surprisingly good. Benkei is a great hero in the brood, and depicts Shanao (Yoshitsune) as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own strength, and Tetsukichi makes a shimmering sword for the "ordinary man" and his opinion is less than the lure of murderers who fancy his social impressions. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, to find out why it is good, I suggest you actually dig an old book about Japanese history and see how this story turns into a Robin Hood story versus Little John's almost likeness to a fictional story of conspiracy, violence and vine Infernal.
