After being a lover of Colombo, I was very disappointed in the "Corky Romano". Although it is certainly a funny film, the head of the mob in Falk was far from the beloved lieutenant he played for many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After "Corky Romano", I was frankly surprised by Mr. Peter Falk. However, having just seen "Find John John Christmas" and its predecessor, "Town Without Christmas", for the first time within a week of each other, I must say that "Max", the delightful Peter's Falk character in both films, is certainly memorable and lovable like "Colombo". While some parts of the film are perfectly predictable, these scenes are in no way excluded from enjoying the story. I also wish to record both of these beloved Christmas films, and I highly recommend them whether you are a Falk fan, a Christmas nut or simply someone who enjoys watching a better movie a week. The loss of this movie may end up in the crowds of television holidays, so be sure to find "Find Christmas" before it's too late.
