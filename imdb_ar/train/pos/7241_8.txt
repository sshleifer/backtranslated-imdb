Paul Lucas played the role of a Russian thinker in earning his living as a waiter in Grand Slam, directed by William Dieterl (1933). It's an amazingly funny satire of celebrity building. The waiter and the Russian restaurant girl who played her role, Loretta Young, became beloved to America as partners in the bridge, not quarreling. With the help of propaganda and ghost writer "Speed" McCann (the amazing dead Frank McHugh), they became ads of the "Stanislavsky" system, a "system" of bidding no matter what the person feels (<br /> <br /> given Because tenders are not rational, there is no basis for accusations about their stupidity). <br /> <br /> There is a duel with the Cedric Van Dorn (who appears close to Goren, no? I suspect that choosing the name "Stanislavsky" was also a criticism of another type of system), a pompous pirate played by Ferdinand Jochelk, aired on radio stations throughout America such as Rosco Carnes (another fast-paced playwright in the 1930s). <br /> <br /> Even the bridge players are in a tight field, although the audience is <br /> <br /> above them, unlike in the boxing "rings". <br /> <br /> The wide range of American genres stands out as Preston Sturges, although they make celebrities like "Grand Slam", most of them calling two better films than the pre-code era, where Lee Tracy plays with publicity Speak Speak <br /> <br /> Propaganda: "The Half-Naked Truth" and "Bombshell", but "Grand Slam" has moments <br /> <br />, especially for anyone who has played a bridge with serious points < br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young was already a horse of clothing. (For me, her face looks long <br /> <br /> And also attractive ... The idea of ​​another beauty era, I suspect ...) The film <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, everything that falls Glenda Farrell, who plays The role of his girlfriend Mako forgetfulness.
