Wow, this was another good view of the original American pancake and was not as good as the band camp, but it certainly was much better than the nude mile. Dwight and Erik are leading the comedy in this film, but I actually preferred the dialogue in this film to the naked tilt. The script was written much better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, but most of the comedy came from sex, but that's good because that's why we watch these movies anyway anyway? <br /> <br /> The Rock Dwarf also had a really gorgeous veil, taking into account the intense efforts it made in the nude mile, his scene with the stink was great and he made me laugh my ass when I saw him. <br /> <br /> The film was a clear improvement in my opinion compared to the sheer melody. If you liked any previous American movies, you should love the house of the house, unless you see all the American pie shows as a waste of money.
