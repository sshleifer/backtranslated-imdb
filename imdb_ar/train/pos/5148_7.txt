I do not know what these films are. But films about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make 100% accurate films at the moment when "experts" disagree with each other. So, I prefer to judge one of the films as he tries to say instead of choosing all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start by saying that I liked this mini-series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years have passed very quickly. The series should have been a three-part story, his childhood is the first part. But if they do not have more money to shoot more stories, I'll criticize it ??? / <br /> There is only one real problem I face with this film and this is the truth that is listed in the history book of the road. Especially the second part which is just the entirety of events that have occurred. I would have preferred to see Hitler more humanely (more scenes where he doubts himself and so on). Noah Taylor did it more in the movie "Max" which seems to work better than I think. However, I am happy because this was made and owned on DVD. Just to remember more clearly what happened and watched Carlisle do his best. 7.5 / 10
