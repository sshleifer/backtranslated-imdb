"Panic" is a kind of comedy drama with William H. Messi, Donald Sutherland and Steve Campbell in leading roles. Alex (played by Messi) is the man who kills people to live. But at present he is facing depression and that is why he sees a therapist. Where he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to leave family work (killings), but now he does not know how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> The following is a story of a man during the middle-aged crisis, and facing the usual problems: falling in love with a little girl and all that fits. <br /> <br /> Great performances of acting. Messi is as excellent as the Alex recession. I had high expectations for this film and it was a good film but it was not completely delivered. The story was flat and Clichy .. <br /> <br /> 7/10
