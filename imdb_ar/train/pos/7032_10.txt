The drama club at my school will present this show in the spring of 2002, and I can only hope that we are as good as this! I recently watched this film as a sort of "search" for my league (Rosie Alvarez), and I just want to say, Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! This movie was played directly (with one exception). Jason Alexander, Hey Judy, is there anything he can not do? He was the coolest Albert Peterson ever - I particularly liked all his funny face expressions and dancing through "Put on a Happy Face!" It's so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. Rosie was pretty, and her move from secretary to glamor was absolutely believable. Tyne Daly Farhana as the obnoxious mother of Albert and George Windt was as wonderful as Mr. McAfee, who annoyed him (but I liked Paul Linde's 1963 performance!). Bregita Dao cracks me up as Ursula Merkel. It's really tattered it! Mark Codich was wonderful Conrad Birdy ... "Suffering!" <br /> <br /> There was only one voice I did not understand, and as you will see from the previous comments, many other people did not understand I understand. Xena Phillips in the role of Kim McAfee - what is this? I mean it is beautiful and very talented, but ... looks very old for this role. Unnamed: Er, maybe I'm delusional. <br /> <br /> Well anyway, I highly recommend this film. It will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
