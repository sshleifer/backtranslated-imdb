This was a wonderful episode. I saw a piece of it on YouTube and promised that if it was on TV, I would stick myself to the group for watching. I finished watching it with a friend of mine, who happened to be a lesbian, and we wept at the end. This was a well-liked, well-written episode of the forbidden love between two policemen who really felt that they (in the words of Coop) are "Lucky Ones." It's such episodes that make Cold Case really one of CBS's most interesting and popular television charms. I am eagerly waiting for more episodes and restarting "Forever Blue" because I will always see them again and again.
