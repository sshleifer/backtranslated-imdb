Apart from the usual stereotypes of the 1930s, Eugene Pallet as a tough police investigator, Jacques La Roux, like the Italian "Swarthy" and of course James Lee as the "Chinese chef", this film is the great mystery of the murder in a locked room. For a film from the early 1930s, the "peel the mystery" step by step is similar to the COLUMBO series, except for this film, which does not have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance.
