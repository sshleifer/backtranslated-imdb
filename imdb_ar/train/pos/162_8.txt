For the film "No Budget" this rock thing. I do not know if America will love him, but we used to laugh all the way. Some funny stuff is really funny. Really non-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Shaken actors and music. Cars and even fewer gags in your face will crack things to us. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen some actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them think I've seen it in commercials or somewhere. Basically it shook! Luckily, I got a copy of a friend of one of the actors.
