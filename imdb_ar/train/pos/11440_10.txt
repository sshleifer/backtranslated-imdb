I went and saw the rivers and tides again today. This is the second time in two days and yes, I see movies that I like several times. Yesterday I was amazed by the brilliance of the pictures and the work of Goldsworth. This morning when I threw the coins I received # 29 abysmal (water). Goldsworthy has affinity with water, hence the title. I received a Variable V line that went to Army No. 7. To Blake Art was war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few reviews online from SF Examiner. The critic loved the film but said Goldsworthy's comments hampered his enjoyment of the film. He will only have wonderful pictures and soundtracks. So I was so aware when I saw this second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as king of the world. Well today, I was able to get past the pictures a bit and listen to what he said. Can I enjoy the movie without comments? What he does, what he says goes beyond mere "art." Made me understand water, time, stone, change, etc., I think the man is the embodiment of Lao Tsu or some avatar. Some of his works / words like Zen. Know ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is only shown (apparently) here in the Gulf area. Be a trendsetter. Go to your local cinema and tell them, do not insist that they have to book a movie you've heard about from remote areas. It is called rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
