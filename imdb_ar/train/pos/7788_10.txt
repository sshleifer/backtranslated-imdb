I love Ashley Judd and I think all her movies are wonderful. Ruby <br /> <br /> In Paradise is one of the best. It is a film less than reality that you should soon see for its appreciation. The story of a woman trying to make her alone and refusing to submit to temptations make her life easy. Some of her films, such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill, may have been better at box office and video rentals. They were very good movies too, but take the time to look at Ruby and I think you'll agree that he's one of the best Ashley movies.
