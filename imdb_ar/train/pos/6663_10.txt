This film revolves around a dysfunctional family but not just a dysfunctional family. It is about the family of the father of our nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the separate relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his older son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how Mahatma was forced to kill M. Gandhi, how he was to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom. Every time the engineer Karamchand Gandhi tries and his son approach Mahatma will come between them. This is a beautiful film to do. Akshay Khana proved to be a key actor. Express feelings very naturally. Dorshan Garriwala, starring in Blaise Gurokant Desai's lawyer at Guru, portrayed Gandhi in a wonderful way (as a real man, unlike Ben Kingsley, who made him look like a god). Shivali Shah, a girl from Monsoon Wedding, did a really good job of showing how Kasturba Gandhi between father and son. This moving film as well as the soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" sings in a very unique way. I saw this movie just 3 hours ago (it was shown in Dubai the day before the second day) and when the movie ended there was "Pin Drop Silence" and during the exit from the theater nobody paid another one (Can you imagine we Indians do not pay?) one! There was a holy silence ...
