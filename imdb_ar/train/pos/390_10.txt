The first thing I thought about when I saw these films was: It's not a real film, at least not what we automatically imagine when we hear the word "film." It's completely symbolic, everything in it has metaphorical meaning. So if you are not used to expressing something in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion and spiritual life, you will think it is just a fairy tale ... even a strange, chaotic. For me "Legend of Zou" completely transparent. I love that either. It tells us in the pictures a story about the struggle between light and darkness, the old struggle of humanity, and everyone looking for a sense of life. The film is obviously made by Buddhists. I am not a Buddhist. Religion and vision of the world and man are different. But as far as we are all human beings and we have the same human nature we necessarily have shared experiences and we can understand each other. It's a really nice movie! I am the one who has had more films like this - movies that have meaning. There are plenty of empty stories that are just good to make the time pass faster.
