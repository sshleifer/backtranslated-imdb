While I was enjoying the show, I expected something quite different when I first saw "What I Like About You", I was expecting to find something like "all this" (I'm not sure if it's happening now) but I have to say I like the show and while I do not classify it as a wonderful show, but it is very charming and I love chemistry among characters too (including supporting elements) <br /> I would definitely say it's great to see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I really liked it In City Guy. I've also seen a woman who plays Valerie's friend in a popular magazine, and while I think it was a good show, I do not like her character in this show because she is not just a cup of tea but she's running around well
