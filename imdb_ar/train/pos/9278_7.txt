In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, two other films by Jaafar Panahi I saw, the director produces amazing amounts of depth in subjects that look light on the surface. In Offside, the Panahi seriocomic honor for Iranian women to defend their rights, I do not think it was successful. Not that what he says is not important, of course (which is very bad, like all other Panahi films, the Iranians can not see). But after a while, the film feels flat, and feels as long as 90 minutes. Do not say I did not like it, though. The actors are all fabulous, and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious. But this is not an important job, in my opinion.
