One of the Twilight Zone's favorite episodes. The next day we were at the supermarket in Hollywood Avenue. And my father and I, guess who would have come to us in the corridor! Barney Phillips, but there is no hat - at least, do not think he was wearing a hat. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye and said something like he left her at home, and everyone he met that day asked him about it. <br /> <br /> A friendly young man. We used to see all kinds of actors in Los Angeles in those days. <br /> <br /> BTW, I was a teenager and it took a long time to beat the "three hands" on the other alien! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> is an indigenous Hollywood resident and resident from 1947 to 1963.
