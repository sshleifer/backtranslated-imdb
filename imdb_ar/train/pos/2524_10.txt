I did not expect Gackt and Hyde to perform well as expected, nor did I expect them to be represented in a well-developed technical film with enough plot to keep you interested and versatile enough to make it happen. This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I will look for the next film like him. I particularly liked the fact that he was a vampire film, but he was not a cheesy vampire flick, nor was he more than embellishing this fact. All characters have human attributes. The way in which the characters' growth has been shown has been unbelievably wonderful and makes you feel sorry for them all their lives. I give this movie two thumbs up. Definitely the best film I have seen in the last five years.
