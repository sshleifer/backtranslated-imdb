Although the title may suggest, "Pigs Is Pigs" does not represent Porky Pig. Instead, he is characterized by the presence of small pigs more appetizing than the personality of John Peloschi at the Animal House. His mother repeatedly reproaches him, but does not meet the point. So much so that he goes to another house where the misguided world feeds him more forcibly than any human being he can deal with (but there is a surprise at the end). <br /> <br /> I would say that this caricature often looked like a placeholder among the truly magnificent cartoons (Daffy Duck first appeared three months after his appearance). But make no mistake, they do some wonderful things here. The entire continuum of forced nutrition seems more important today, given the epidemic of obesity on our country. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is not the greatest caricature, but worth watching.
