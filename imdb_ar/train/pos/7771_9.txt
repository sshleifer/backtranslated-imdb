The absolute view of the festival of Douglas Douglas (born by Detlev Circus), written on the wind, draws our attention in every delightful frame. From his famous opening sequence, where the papers fall in the Baroness lobby of the Texas Palace and the wind that walks through the calendar pages in the flashback, the film presses in 99 minutes on all the family plots that it would have paid later, the small screen irons like Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest Long years. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme Americans find, in our dollar-based society, irresistible. Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the troubled heirs of Hadley's oil wealth. The steadfastness of the boy Rock Hudson and the new bride Lauren Bacall are the intelligent outsiders who try to keep the lid on an arrogant boiler. (It is rumored that the story was based on the marriage of Libby Holman of Reynolds' tobacco money.) As always, bad people get the whole scene to chew - and the best lines they spit out. (Malone, in her performance about boosing nymphomaniac with jones for Hudson, gets On the fireworks display of the full of them). Hudson, though good, can not compete with all these emotional feelings. Bacall starts strongly but grows restlessly, which is just a comfortable plot. It does not matter; with a succession of shots filmed in heavy colors, Sirk offers an objective lesson on how to get out of the melodrama that swept the group in America's lush consumer paradise in the late 1950s. He did not do that before.
