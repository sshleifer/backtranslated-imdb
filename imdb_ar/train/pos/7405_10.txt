This movie is simply wonderful! Everything has happened: laughter, sadness, beauty, poetry and truth. All in a simple but intense story - like life! Your attention will not be distracted for one second. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Tell someone Hollywood that you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are many good stories out there.
