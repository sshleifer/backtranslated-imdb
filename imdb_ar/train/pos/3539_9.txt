Good: engaging cinematic battles and wonderful presentation and vehicles are actually fun to drive and attractive multi-player faithful to the film and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: The main tasks are a bit short. <br /> <br /> This game knows what a shooter is from a "good" third person (not necessarily a spy game). Great battles continue in the story and make you wish to complete each single task and unlock all the real rewards offered by the game. The fuss over this game has been lifted, I personally think that you should buy them, communicate with two friends and practice this game. a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a huge achievement from some of the previous bond games, firing a weapon and really feeling you are firing a weapon. It's tied to the side that you're a ruthless killer spy. <br /> <br /> In general, this game makes you excited and satisfied after the completion, and some players who can compete with the standards of the game James Bond "Nightfire" sly to the gamecube.
