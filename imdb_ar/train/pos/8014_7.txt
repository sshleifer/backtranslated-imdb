But if you like puppets, I challenge you to hate this. Basically the same plot that has been renewed (this time New York, not Los Angeles), it is characterized by a lot of fun and fun comic and toning games. Many puppets left the film early because it centered around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I enjoyed it a lot. Fun to watch with your kids.
