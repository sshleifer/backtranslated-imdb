I was curious to know how the critics responded to this inspiring film, so I went to the Rotten Tomatoes restaurant and was horrified to discover that the huge peanut exhibition that the film critics in our nation had shown gave the film an average of 43% (or "Rotten") rating. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, if this movie does not move, you will not have a heart. (It is interesting to note that the same movie on the same site earned a rating of 74% of viewers). <br /> <br /> Critics do not think that's all I care about. After all, I can not think of a more useful useless career. Some people get paid to go to movies (what a hard life) and do the same thing anyone else does on the planet: forming an opinion. But these humps have a way of appearing like their opinion is more important than your point of view, and worse, they love hatred. <br /> <br /> I will give you that this movie is old fashioned (well, except for bombs (f), juices, and a little predictable ... After all, you know from the start that Cuba Gooding Jr., Realism Karl Bracher, will triumph at every turn simply by the way he encounters: strong will and optimism. <br /> <br /> But his performance and the performance of De Niro (like Billy Sunday, a compound personality for several real-life people) Very strong and very inspiring, so that you will be on your feet rejoice in many of the scenes of the film, especially the height of the courtroom.It must be a real stick in the mud so that it is not Moved by these scenes like critics of our nation film.Richael Rappaport is excellent as well as a nice snorkeling student, stumbling certified by Goodrich Prascher.If anyone sees "higher education", this personality reinstates this personality completely. <br /> <br /> On any This, however, confirms what I have always felt: Do not listen to the critics, watch this movie and get inspiration.
