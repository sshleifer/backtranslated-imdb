This is nothing more than a charming story of a middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of dancing in the banquet hall (though it is). It is the story of one person who learns to love life again, and pays all the pressures of work and money to discover joy again. The reward in this film is a brilliant idea in the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan towards everything from dance to dance hall to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... There are a few places where you want to wake up and tango ... and many more where you will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who may be under the impression that all Japanese movies are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
