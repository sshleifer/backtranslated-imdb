Atlantis was much better than I expected. In some ways it was a better story than other films aimed at a higher age. Although this film did not demand great attention at times it has been a great film for all ages. I noticed that some younger audiences expected a comedy but I got an adventure. I think everyone was tired of an endless procession of parody. Many of these children saw only parody. After a short time everyone seemed to be watching Atlantis very strongly.
