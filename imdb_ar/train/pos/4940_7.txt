This film revolves around human relations. Charming, funny, well written, with purposeful text. Morgan Freeman certainly seems to enjoy the group. Music is also good. Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman. I really enjoy her acting. Like women is a good motivation to learn Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets with the nice Paz Vega, the scene takes on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to take care of their lives. 10 elements or less about the flavor of life. If you enjoy this movie, see also "Pursuing Happiness with Will Smith" and his son. This is not an action movie or a naked comedy. All about human relations.
