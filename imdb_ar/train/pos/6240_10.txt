Dog Days is one of the most accurate movies I've seen describing life in modern cities. It is very harsh and harsh at some points, and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, the ends of deep emotional death, problematic affairs, deviation, complexes, insanity. All things are in the major developed cities today. It makes you realize again the unfortunate situation in which people lead society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city has never been portrayed on the screen correctly. I just wish it was a lie. Unfortunately, it is not. Therefore ... 10/10.
