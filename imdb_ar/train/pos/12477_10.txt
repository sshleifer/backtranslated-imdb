I and my family have watched this film often over the years. It is clean, healthy and heart broken. Show us empathy between two families from two countries separated by thousands of miles, and through most strange coincidences, it seems as if the hand of God must intervene. <br /> <br /> 5 yo Jodelle Micah Ferland, who plays Desie, the heart of the stricken little girl, does a great job in representing her role, and for me it was Priam's choice for leadership. <br /> <br /> All in all, 10 out of 10. There are no negatives to this sweet human story. Children of all ages will cry, then watch it happily and gather the viewing family with smiles and good feelings.
