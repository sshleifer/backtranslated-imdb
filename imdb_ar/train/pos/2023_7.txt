The spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I've seen the original version on TV for some time and remember that this production is less of a catch on most of Zeebib's drama. I watched the DVD this week and still have the same impression. It is a good story at first, but it weakens when the hero becomes brave and terribly noble and returns to her miserable husband completely when he is sick and I was very angry with her saints. I assume that this was the "right thing to do" when writing the story and also contribute a lot of anxiety. It was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband because the marriage did not make her more than his possession, let alone continue with the scandals with a lover as I would much like Of the modern audience to see it. But it is hard to keep in mind these days, especially when this heroine has a strong and courageous admirer who is ready to defend her against anyone and everyone. So the story is repeated as in the film. It has been well done according to the story, but it is somewhat annoying by the type of life today. <br /> <br /> Stubborn hero Gilbert has certainly been a saint to support his changing behavior and is often hidden and constantly self-denying and being constantly supportive. I felt it was a terrible shame that when Helen was finally free with him, he was allowed to text just over a minute to fall on each other a quick hug before the titles appeared. This was completely ridiculous when we were waiting all this time through all those feelings dripping on the husband is not worthy of a little dialogue and a good embrace between the hero and the heroine. Instead, the end was as if filmmakers had run out of time or funding or could not have bothered. "Here you are - in one minute, I do what you can do in it, then downplay because the director wants to go home now ....." I left I feel completely dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, very high regards to the representation of Toby Stevens as a perfect and very proper hero, and Robert Griffes is a very bad evil and optimistic. Tara Fitzgerald was sick within the limits of the scenario that forced her to be a largely depressing and sacrilegious victim most of the time. <br /> <br /> However, I like this classic drama and almost all have better scenes than a lot of "modern" drama on television these days. So 7 stars because despite the irritation it is still a good hour.
