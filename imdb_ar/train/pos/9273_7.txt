In Iran, the Islamic Revolution formed all parts of life, including everyday things. But people continue to live, and generally only do things you expect, like going to football to encourage the national team because they qualify to qualify for the World Cup. Except for women, they are not allowed to go to the football field to watch the game. <br /> <br /> A funny little movie follows the small group of women who have been caught sneaking into the football field and the small group of boredom soldiers assigned to guard them in a pen outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to encourage the team (nothing fragile there), and the few human touches on each person's life add a very good commentary on humanity versus ideology. <br /> Amateur acting, good script and dialogue, really fun movie. Bowed like Beckham, kind of - a warm heart and delight in the daily interests and pleasures of people.
