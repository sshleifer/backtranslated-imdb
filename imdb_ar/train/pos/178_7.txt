"The Protocol" is a successful and amazing portrayal of Goldie Hawn as a cocktail cocktail waitress saving one night visiting Arab life from an assassination attempt. Women instantly become celebrities and get a new job working for the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our country be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual although "Protocol" is not as funny as her best film "Private Benjamin". But it is still a good film, and I have laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
