Ethan Fox made this again: moving the heart of the viewer into a modest story that takes place in an overwhelming mess. The film also succeeded in describing the city's magnificent atmosphere no less than Tel Aviv, the city of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and everything was there: lifestyle, relationships, heart beat the city, chaos, and a host of virtuous mindsets in vibrant, vibrant and forgetful cities at all. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend: It is a trip to the heart and mind, with an interesting perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: There is a central gay plot in the movie. If you do not think you're a gay friend, get ready for the challenge and finally see it as "just love". (Do not worry: chick is too hot!)
