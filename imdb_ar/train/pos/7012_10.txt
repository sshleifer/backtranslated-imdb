Despite the tear anger, it certainly film "feel good." All the actors were excellent Will and Will Smith as always, doing the job and doing well. I can go on but I can choose any 10 of the "10" labels and they have said it well and probably better than me. <br /> <br /> But since I must include at least 10 lines to post a comment I will say that Rosario Dawson was well known as a viewer. Her performance was more enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her lead in many upcoming films. <br /> <br /> This film shows that Will Smith has no proof of his ability as an actor.
