This movie is ridiculous! This is exactly what I like about the piece "Guilty Pleasure". This film is easy to condemn because it does not include Pat Brest, Patrick Butch, Marilyn and Eddie's original. But look at the year and do mathematics. Pat Kohn and Butch Patrick have gone beyond their parts for a long time! Time does it for young stars. Yvonne de Carlo, who reassessed her role as a nightly prize, paid 6-0 adults (although she still looks good and still perfect for "Lily"). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Yvonne de Carlo did not give a bigger part. However, it was good to see Fred Gwyn and Lewis in the roles that made them famous! During the two seasons in which the MUNTERS were in prime time, it was the chemistry of Gwen / Lewis that made the series a great success. The rest of the team supported the team members, not to say they did not need them. They have been! The television series did not survive as long as it continued without it. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was very easy. Yvonne De Carlo was the best choice on Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not reach the level of the original TV series, it is still superbly mastered and is one of the best TV shows "reunuin" that plagued the boob tube during the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <br /> '
