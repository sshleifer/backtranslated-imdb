Jenny Terney and Dana Andrews, who were unforgettable in the 1944 film "Laura", were unable to reconnect in the spectacular Noir film of 1950. <br /> <br /> A bitter policeman, Andrews Mark, can not overcome the fact that his father was Of the fraudsters who died in an exchange of fire by the police while trying to get out of prison, and as a result, Mark does not know when to stop using his hands, and this deficit leads to casual death in a short time. (Craig Stevens) <br /> <br /> In an attempt to frame the bands Gary Merrill, Mark inadvertently puts the heat on the innocent taxi, Tom Tally, the father of Jane Turney, who was separated by Stevens. <br /> <br /> This is a thoughtful film dealing with the conscience of a basically respectable human being. <br /> <br /> The end is not entirely optimistic as Mark will have to face music, at least, finally admit what he did.
