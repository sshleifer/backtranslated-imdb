I saw this movie when it was introduced by Mystery Science Theater in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Too bad indeed, that because of the extreme oddity, this film should get a rating of ten because it must see it believed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote this text should be beaten with the children in mind. Really mean, devil against Santa? Visions of hell? Creepy wind laughs so reindeer? Child labor forced with ethnic stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Crowe exclaims during the MST3K show, "This is a fabulous fuel-type nightmare!" <br /> <br /> There are lots of strange hints and theology. Merlin (presumably Arthur Merlin) is camping with Santa Fe in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie, the sky). Santa talks about the child Jesus and sends messages to Mr. Stork to the children who ask for brothers and sisters. There are symbols around the castle that look like pentagon or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have seen him every year since 1993 and we are subject to anyone who can press him for two hours to watch with us.
