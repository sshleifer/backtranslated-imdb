In the opening scenes of this film, a man threw arrows through his hotel room in the bathroom of another man and blew all the lights. This must have been 1936, but he was a director and had nothing to do with the film. Robin Hood did not appear as far as I could see. However, Beth Davis (Daisy Appleby), "The August Whales," was a very young and attractive 87 year old and led one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisy never stopped being thrilled or very sexy with her own nightgowns and so-called swimming suit on her jacket with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase", '46. Even Daisy suggested marrying Johnny in a Ferris wheel upside down and got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a wonderful couple, one supposed to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter. Outside the theater, Davies and Brent had a real love affair, which is a good reason why there were sparks when these two conditions appeared in this film. If you like Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the right movie for you!
