Wonderful! What's this movie !!!!!!!!!!! I am not at all impressed with contemporary Italian directors. Usually do not like the drama. I'm not a fan of Will Smith so think of it as a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's a wonderful film with this original text and a very good direction and it acts well ... Wow ... it's amazing. This film captured my attention minute by minute and I did not like "the pursuit of happiness" (perhaps also because I did not like the representation of the son of Will, who is a very bad actor while children usually look like natural born actors) also last night in "The Day the Earth Was Silent" My sense that Jaden can not act). I do not want to write spoilers, so I'm not talking about the story but what I can say is that this film talks about love, death and other feelings that I do not like watching in movies .... but this movie is a very cool movie. If you have minimal heart, you will not regret watching it
