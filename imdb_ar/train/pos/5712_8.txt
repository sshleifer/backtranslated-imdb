This is a very cool and irresistible movie, and it has been made very technically! <br /> <br /> The movie shows some of the great-looking collections you'll see in the movie "XXX", although it's very clear they are collections, rather than real-world locations. Often if a character falls or an aggressive door is shaken too much, the entire group will move clearly. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were the silent moments, the longer and the longer. It shows that the true heart of Rene Claire was in silent filmmaking. The overall humor is truly fascinating in this film. Of course, musical moments were more than wonderful. This is a really pleasant light and a nice little French musical early. Although the best moments are the silent moments, this does not mean that the film is not filled with some wonderful comic dialogue, which is very well presented by the main actors, who all appeared to be theatrical representatives to me, and in this case worked very well for the film His overall style and nice atmosphere do not worry. No wonder this is good, as this film actually depends on George Bear's play. <br /> <br /> It's a really wonderful film technically, with some brilliant camera work and some other really cool editing, which creates some fast and fun going for a fun sequence watching. There was no dull moment in this film! <br /> <br /> Renee Clare was a smart director who knew how to build and plan comedic moments within films. It is a very innovative film, despite its simplicity, which at all times feels like a completely original and simple film, but never enjoys entertainment. <br /> <br /> The last half-hour is unforgettablely enjoyable, without too much spoiling, and is truly one of the greatest creative moments in the early comedy industry. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with some really interesting characters, all of which are of course very typical and ridiculous and obviously cast because of their appearance. All this adds to the comical and pleasant comedy atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting movies you may ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
