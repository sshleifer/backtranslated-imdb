The film split the side from the beginning and it seems that Eddie brings this uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic funny thing of getting ice cream as a child into the long old traditions of the family together. The film is very rare in this country, but I'm not sure it is available in other countries. I've searched a lot of web sites, and I'm still lucky, phone companies are looking for rare videos and there are queues for a year. Very hints are very welcome. If anyone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and watched the video, it's worth the money and can not make a lot of mistakes.
