The feeling of this film was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. He also played a highly shaken and fragile personality, taking his ability to the edge and really served the role. His personality was really interesting. I can see myself reading the script for this film and being uninterested in Sandler's part. For someone who plays comedy roles in the first place, he played a serious role in what seemed to be his own dodging and contributions. I particularly liked the scene in which Adam's characters were installed and without a motorized motorbike throughout the city. I knew this moment, because it seemed as if he was witnessing nothing but Adam doing away with everything. Through video games, music and many other things he does to prevent him from thinking about the past, he seemed to be riding a small motorcycle with his headphone smuggled out of his thoughts. This film is definitely worth watching.
