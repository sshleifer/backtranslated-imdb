Being the person to put Night of the Living Dead in third place in her top five favorite movies at the same time, I like the parody of the student film, I feel I should defend this film against the reviews that were published earlier. This short essay has always been filled with horror and science fiction marathons, where those who attend this type of music love but do not know how to take zombie movies seriously. This film is an original tribute, not an insult. His purpose is to be funny, and a lot of others who have heard and chanted and salute that he agrees with me on his success. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. The director watched a veil as a news reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you had the opportunity to capture a parody of Alien, Loaf.
