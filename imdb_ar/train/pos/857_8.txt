Greetings back from darkness. A long-awaited crooked comedy by director Richard Sheppard is a graduation concert for Bruce Brosnan. This guy went to Bond. This new guy is quite another thing! I read that Shepard had thought that Brosnan was the beautiful boy of this plum role, but Brosnan proved to be the best Julianne Noble, the "facilitator" ... something that is not beautiful! Do not underestimate how humorous this is. If you go, expect perforated lines and visual eyes with regard to all kinds of sex, murder, religion, sports, business and anything else you may find politically incorrect. Brusnan Cinariwa takes him to another level with great facial gestures and physical movements. So sitting on a bed in the hotel (with or without Sombrero) is fun. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the direct man in the comic Brosnan movie and has a lot of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. Hope Davis plays a small but cleverly effective role as a wife of Kinnear ("Bean") who gets excited when she has a facilitator in her living room. <br /> <br /> The photos and settings are perfect - including bullfighting, the racecourse and the Denver suburb. How often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same sound? This is definitely not for everyone, but if you are far from the center and enjoy the risky film industry, it may be for you.
