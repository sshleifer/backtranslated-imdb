This clearly targets the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it differs in its least-cartoon character (despite the intentional cartoon properties of the leading creatures). The story is not a big story in your face at the end (it's like pulling it on your shirt sleeves) but you just choose to tell a story about the relationships between the different "animals". You know the result, but you can not help sharing it. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the lesser-known actors who cast votes), unlike most Disney movies. They have been well rounded and completely believable, strangely. The dynamics of the group are displayed well and brilliantly revealing the characters and quirks hidden and fun. You will find yourself rooting for them much sooner than you would think. <br /> <br /> Fantastic animation, as you expect, will pray for the chance to go on ice in a movie. Will fall in love with characters, especially the comic relief of prehistoric squirrels and their desperate attempts to bury nuts. I went out and wanted the mandatory goods, especially the laziness game, only to be disappointed the next day when I did not find anything mysterious. <br /> <br /> It is strange to make the film more pure. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
