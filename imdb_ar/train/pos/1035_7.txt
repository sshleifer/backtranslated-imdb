The film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Casablanca but Paul Lucas beat Humphrey Bogart for Best Actor. I do not see why Lucille Watson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, I do not think she did a very good job. Betty Davis, Paul Lucas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States in the first scene of the film. They are going by train to the home of Davis' relatives. Davis and Lucas were underground to stop the Nazis, so they were very tired and needed rest. But when they get home, they are Nazis who live there and have little to do about it. It turned out that the Nazi was interested only in money and wanted to make a deal with Lucas. What is more of a plot but you can figure it out for yourself.
