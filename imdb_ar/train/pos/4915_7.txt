And a somewhat unexpected plot line for the era: there's a plague in New Orleans - and Richard Widmark is the only one who can stop him! All the themes of the Elijah Kazan tag are displayed: waterfront, working men, crowds, runaways, blue collar people, and violence on the backs of someone here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is very effective because Jack Ballance is instantly visible, 0 Mostel in the role of Dom Dwayce Messacast to some extent, but certainly can be seen as his keeper. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as a kind and wonderful wife - I thought she and Widmark were a certified couple. <br /> <br /> He always reminds me of Sinatra in his face and in a quiet and intense manner this is tantamount to complimenting if anything. I have never heard of this film, and yes, you should admire Widmark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to have played this role several times - they are an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself is Mac Goffin, and you have to learn that it has not been in the way that it will exact exactly what it has been in real life - although it is at least small in size - but I found it carries the plot along well . <br /> <br /> Check it out. this is good. *** outta ****
