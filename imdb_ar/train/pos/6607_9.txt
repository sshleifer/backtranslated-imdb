I'll give it 10 out of about 10. However, there are some confusing parts as well as parts that lack forward and have damaged the film's flow / continuity. The story line is superb and well written. You certainly want to watch this quietly to understand it fully. The characters are complex as well as the line of the story, we expect you to be given enough information just to stop scratching your head, it's a film that is all explained in the end. Fantastic animation and combination of femme fatt and noir film leads to a wonderful movie that does not resemble anything else I've seen in animation. It's a black and white film and a quiet darkness in a few scenes, so worth watching on a good TV or plasma. The characters' voices save this film in its English version, but it would be more convincing if there were some French dialects to confirm that Paris spoke, I enjoyed it more in French with English translations. One whole worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have! And personally if you enjoyed this movie, you might also like it; Wake Life & Ghost in Shell 2 Innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.
