New York-based playwright Michael Caen (like Sydney Bruhl) is 46 years old and quickly disappears. With the opening of the film, another play of Mr. Ken is fluttered on Broadway. TV reviewers enjoy fun in Caine and Wessker. Traffic on the Long Island Rail leads to Kane's landing in Montok instead of his East Hampton residence. At the time of his arrival at home, Kayen feels comforted by the tightly guarded wife of Diana Cannon (like Mira), who is unfortunately the heart patient. There, Caen and Ms. Cannon discussed a new play, "Deathtrap," written by young Christopher Reeve (Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), a former Caen student. The couple believes that "Deathtrap" for Mr. Reeve is the desired success to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "The Trap Is Set ?? For A Funny-Who Who-Do-It." <br /> <br /> With the release of Sidney Lumette, the long-awaited song "Ira Levin" from "Broadway" did not start far from its theatrical origin. The cast is still interesting and the story shifts are controversial. The only thing that did not work (for me) was to end the curtain call; sure, I played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun film to see again; the performances have ended - but, too late, the Reff greeting that Cain gave at the East Hampton train station was simplified to "Hello". The location is not really East Hampton, but the mill and pool look similar. And, the sight of love ballyhooed much shockingly lukewarm. But the play was very good, "even the talented director could not get rid of it." Mr. Lumette is not disappointed. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sydney Lometh ~ Michael Keane, Christopher Reeve, Diane Cannon, Irene Worth
