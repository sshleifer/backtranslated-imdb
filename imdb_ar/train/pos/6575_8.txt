Arms and the Man is one of Shaw's most well-known plays if handled correctly, and this production does a good enough job. Helena Bonham Carter, the former stardom of the film, is Rayna, the daughter of a military family, who has a peacock from Patrick Ryecart's fiancee, which hosts an enemy soldier (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the city. <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this production blends well, and if Bonham Carter and Patty Kensett as a maid outperform the rest of the team, they still have land. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen because parents are fun, and the entire game is generally pleased. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
