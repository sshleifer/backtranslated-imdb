Since I saw this movie as a child, more than 30 years ago, I never tired of watching it. From the opening scenes at the Century factory, to the car engine that runs from the rear seat of the car, to the phone answer and was accidentally kicked out of the window by Stan, I think this was probably the best movie of the last day. They then moved to the 20th Century Fox, and although those films were not horrific, they lacked the comic timing of the film. Jimmy Finlison, frustrated their long time, in his last appearance with the boys, appears as a superhero! Quote: "I said goat's milk" his answer to Stan ask him how a ghost milk! Charlie Hall and even Bin Turpin are showing up! I would say all in one of my favorite L & H comedy.
