We were fortunate to see this wonderful film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Upon entering the theater, we got a small card to use for our personal rating of the film. When I looked at the card, I turned to my wife and said, "How many films in your life do you think you can classify as fantastic? Only about 5 for me." But after watching the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while watching the scenic landscape of the New York State film set, she slowly began moving the film into a category at one time. It certainly was good, but the perfectly natural film of the actors and the award-winning performance by a man might unfortunately be remembered by a raincoat wearing a detective instead of this film, the film jumped to an excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there were a few dry eyes at home and my soft and lanky heart was usually melted just like Grinch's and I ended up giving this wonderful. <br /> <br /> This image is necessary for anyone with parents. No violence or nudity, but some strong language.
