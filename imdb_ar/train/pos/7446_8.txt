I can not agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw the movie on a UK television channel, it was shown as an independent movie and if you take the film under this corner, I think it's quite different. I could not believe what I was seeing and got hooked on the spot. The plot may be as bad as the JS offer (that is, there is no plot) but the acting is bad guys, it's hilarious and everything in every film is incredibly trashy. <br /> <br /> It revolves around America more than "Bully" or "Ken Park" without a drama perspective, but it gives a glimpse of American society, more specifically about what appeared in the afternoon of television viewers in America (and I think there is a lot Of them!) Are interested. After all, we're talking about neighbors, right? 100% fun!
