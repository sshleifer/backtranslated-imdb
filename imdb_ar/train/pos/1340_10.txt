This documentary was fun, but it was also long (it took a total of 225 minutes), like Ben Hur Long. But if you are in it, this is for you. But only if you have a passion for movies, just like I do. Since Martin Scorsese is my favorite director (direct and perhaps even ever), this is very cool, especially if you know the style of Scorsese. Because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films. Not the best documentary ever, but it's a jump for Scorsese, which is always good to watch. a
