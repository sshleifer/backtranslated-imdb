Holes (2003, Andrew Davis Abbey) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnets IV was convicted of theft, he was sent to the Green Lake Camp. In this camp, the prison director, two of his followers, Mr. Sir and Dr. Bendanski, ordered camp colleagues to dig holes after a hole after a hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I had no intention of watching the "holes", and I must admit, I only saw the film really, because I admire these LaBeouf Shiites, but even if they were not his fans, it does not matter. "Holes" is a Disney movie that the whole family can enjoy. The story is beautifully written and includes a wonderful idea of ​​incorporating memories of the past. This is not distracting and really gives a great return story. All the cast is fantastic. The young stars act well and add John Voight and Segorny Weaver are fun. Shi Labov explains that at the age of 17, he can act without flaws. It's a Disney movie, you'll definitely enjoy it as a family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failure." - Stanley Yellens III (Henry Winkler)
