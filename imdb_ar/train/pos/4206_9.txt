Scibe McCoy is a pocket pick loser three times, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks Candy's purse in the subway train. What he does not realize is that Candy has a very secret microfilm, a microfilm that pays great attention to many institutions. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller has written an extraordinary drama between the New York City crime scene. Communist spies and suspicious government officials gather to make pickups in South Street a spectacular spectacle from the first minute to the next. According to Dwight Taylor's Blaze Of Glory, Fuller encouraged this adjustment with a heavy political agenda, which many felt at the time was over, but only focusing on its anti-communist leanings was causing great harm. <br /> <br /> Drill a little deeper and find interesting characters like anyone whose face Fuller, the protagonist of the protagonist is one of the protagonist, the crook and the shallow man, do not breed his love of his own, born of his stubborn plan. It is a great achievement accomplished by Fuller, one of the best heroes of the 1950s, and I am sure he was very grateful for Richard Wiedmark as McCoy, all the cool ice-cold smile, his interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters as Kandy Excellent, the heart of the films. The Oscar nominee Thelma Ritter, however, is the actor, and she is as strong and unnatural as the characters around her, but Ritter's weary warmth is majestic. <br /> <br /> It is B film in the fabric but a movie is in progress, Pickup On South Street is an elegant and entertaining real movie is the best in his most interesting films. 9/10
