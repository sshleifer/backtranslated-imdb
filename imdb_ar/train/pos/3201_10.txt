This is an early film "Pilot" for the successful Canadian television show Trailer Park Boys. It was run on executives in a few networks before Showcase decided to subscribe to the TV series. A great actor and funny actors make this one of the best comedy movies. The plot of the film is that these two small time criminals are leaving pets "exterminate" people for money. If you have a dog next door to bark all night, these are the men you go to! But they face a problem when they encounter a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> R categorization of insults, violence, and drug abuse. <br /> <br /> It is not very humiliating (does not actually show the killing of animals)
