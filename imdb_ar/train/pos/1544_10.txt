This is an excellent but hard-to-find movie in World War I espionage in the unbeatable 60s style. From the dramatic drawings of the preliminaries and the great result of Inio Morikon to the scene of the ideal love with nightmare and the horrific scenes of the battle that were produced with the poisonous gases and the German cavalry in the "devastating storm" equipment of the gas film should not be missed. It is a film that captures the scourge of war, cruelty and cruelty of players both inside and outside the battlefield. Regardless of the scenes of the battle, some production and special effects are rudimentary, apparently because most of the film's budget has been saved for battle scenes, but for film lovers in the 1960s, it should not be a problem. I watched this movie for the first time on television many years ago, and I had insight into putting it on the VHS tape. I still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.
