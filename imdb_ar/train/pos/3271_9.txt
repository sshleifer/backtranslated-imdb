I was always impressed with this film, first of all you watched the actors, the acting is great and helps make this movie move well. Cybill Shepherd was given wonderful ratings for her role and they were well deserved. The film begins in the past when Corinne Cybill, who marries her perfect marriage, stops in the picture when her husband Louis unexpectedly dies. Luckily, Louse gets a second shot in life when he agrees to "recycle" back to earth like the newborn Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues his new life to forget his past life while Corrine tries to continue her life. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later when he met the daughter of Corin Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly was flooded with undesirable memories (this is where fun starts, embarrassing situations occur). The heart felt very nice. You will not be disappointed if you give it a chance, you will love it. Very funny and sweet!
