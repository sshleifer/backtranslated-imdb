I really enjoyed this movie. I was 15 years old when this film came out and I can talk about it. This will be a film I will show my children to tell them, and the feelings they feel are normal. It's funny to see how we can get rid of things at such an early age .. who knew we would be back .... over and over .... Fantastic movie !!!!
