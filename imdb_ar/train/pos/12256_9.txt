Kate Beckinsell is as excellent as Emma's manipulative and irresistibly charming Jane Austen TV novel. When I read that novel, I sometimes doubted whether the hero really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: Honestly, she was very ingenious in herself and so much so that she hated to hate her very seriously. However, the interpretation of Kate Beckinsell saves Emma from herself to speak: she is innocently photographed with the fullness of her personality with a complete vision, and one can only surrender and love her (so as not to say love) despite her less friendly qualities. Kate Beckensell is the main reason, but not the only reason why this television series is so exhilarating; Raymond Coulthard is as perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, where he expresses the personal magnetism of this personality to the fullest extent (which is most obvious since this role was not well treated) By Ewan McGregor in Adaptation 1996 for Emma's screen), Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hippon, and Olivia Williams are all as they should be each in their respective roles. This production, in short, is a great achievement and one to be presented several times with increasing pleasure.
