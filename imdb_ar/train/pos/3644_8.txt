The Rookie relies on the true story of a 40-year-old schoolteacher in Big Lake, Texas, who goes to the disciplines. Jamie Morris (Dennis Quid) is a science teacher at a small high school and a baseball trainer. His team lose so badly that the team discovers their coach has played in the minor leagues and can throw 98 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> After beating and betting, Jim agrees that if his team wins the regional team, he will try out the big leagues. The film tells the story of Jimmy being a boy to play his first game in the disciplines. It's a great story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Coed makes the film interesting, offering emotional performance and being supported by an excellent support team including Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes some time to develop, and some scenes are a bit slow, but everything works well In the end. The baseball sights are fun, well illustrated and superbly visualized. The film is not about baseball but about a man's quest to reach his dream. It's inspiring, it's emotional, it's funny. I liked it, I hope you do it. <br /> <br /> The rookie. Starring: Dennis Quid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. 4 of 5 stars Reviewed 4 September 2011 Google Translation
