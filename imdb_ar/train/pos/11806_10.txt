Everything was better in the last days. Even children's TV. The Rock Rockers prove my point quite easily. At the time of writing this comment, I am fourteen years old, but even in my teens, I can not resist the magic of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who already live under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock revolves around a crowd of fun creatures and a game called Fraggles, which lives in an amazing rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rocks are inhabited with many other species such as serious tractors and many living plants. Outside the Rock On one side lives the world inventor Duke and his dog Sprocket (who later became a friend of Jobo Fergal), and on the other a family of universe rulers presumed by Georges. Five of Fraggles Gobo (a leader who knows no fear), Mokey (intrusive and peaceful), Wembley (indecisive and a friend to Gobo), Boober (a local god of pessimism) and Red (loves anything about sport and general discomfort) , Each episode while singing and dancing at the same time care about them. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is certainly a family show - plots may contain complex details that children may not follow well, but the routine song and dance will catch their attention. The characters are strong and beloved, their conflicts believable and their adventures exciting. The Horrible Gorgs, informed Doc and Sprocket, the hilarious uncle Matt Hilarious (the postcard chips are very 80s!) And the last episode, Change of Address, is truly impressive. Let's go to Fraggle Rock again!
