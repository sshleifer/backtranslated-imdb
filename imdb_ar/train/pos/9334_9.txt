The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sex comedy that once starred the girl Bond Ursula Andres. The man was hot in this film .. It was stacked and built like a brick house * @ #%. Ursula was smoking heavily in this film. I have never seen a nurse outfit that is filled before. <br /> <br /> Ms. Anders serves as the nurse who has been hired to care for a rich old man. Even one at home seems to be knocking shoes. One night, the nurse decided to take her grandson's temperature and give some necessary T.L.C to her old client. The old man takes his nurse and this angers the rest of the family. What kind of job did the family rent? Does a strange man fall in her car? How can you deal with the Eighth Kron and the rest of the family? To find out what you need to find a copy of SENSUOUS NURSE !! Italian but highly dubbed in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
