This animated TV series is simply the best way to teach children how the human body works. Yes, this is biology, but they will never tell it. <br /> <br /> I really think this is the best part of this educational cartoon series. I remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton, and of course: members. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, you will find: "Il était une fois l", which connects the history of mankind from the Big Bang to the 20th century, there is also "Il était une fois l'espace" (about space and its exploration) ), But this fantasy is more than fiction and not a description of reality because it happens in the future.
