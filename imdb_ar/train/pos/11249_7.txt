I have just watched 6 full episodes on DVD. Representation throughout the excellent - no doubt. There was not enough work for me to say. No real suspense as such, just a lot of personal development of first-class. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you love a good story slowly and carefully tell it is for you. Peter Egan is the leading Magnus Bem excellent. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the life of the traitor. A man who was supposed to be a loyal member of the British intelligence service, but was psychologically damaged by his unfortunate childhood, until deception became his way of life in everything. As a child, he loved his father but his father was repeatedly exposed to being a fraudster and a deceptive man. They did not betray Pem for ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, guide). Pym is deadly damaged by his father's influence - he has eaten his moral fiber away. He has no real love or loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological things are not light moments in the 6-hour series. Very good though.
