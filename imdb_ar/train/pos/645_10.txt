I hate French movies that have lasted too long, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most telling French film. I saw her twice in the mid-seventies, then disappeared. But I finally managed to see him back in 1999 and I fell in love again. The most obvious thing is that it looks new every day as it was 25 years ago. If you do not see it, do not miss your chance!
