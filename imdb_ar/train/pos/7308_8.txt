With a streamlined story and an attractive heroine, this was a horror film that started it all. John Carpenter brings to life a biting nightmare on Halloween night, when Lori Stroudy (Jimmy Lee Curtis in her early career, and her role in defining the profession) and her girlfriends plan to spend a night of pleasant fun - just to cross paths with a mindless, irrational freak. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from a nearby crazy tribe ... After his sister was slaughtered 15 years ago, he now returned to Haddonfield, the sleeping city of Illinois where his death took place. As soon as he closes his eyes on Laurie after he drops a bundle into his abandoned home, he starts chasing and terrorizing her, turning her fun night into horror while picking up anyone on her way to get to her. br /> <br /> The film industry and beautiful lighting make this frightening horror disturbing, frightening ... with the long, bleak shots that you always feel as if you are tracking the same serial killer serial. Meyers is well hidden until it is completely revealed at the dramatic conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although Halloween is definitely old, it is no less weary. The only idea is to make a goose bump, and this small shock is one of the most famous and unforgettable horror movies ever to this day ... I have produced seven consequences, and in the end a remake of Rob Zombie is just as scary, and has set a new standard of horror. Still exists today.
