In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was the toughest, Superman, or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I discuss a lot of who will win the battle as well. Sometimes we get ridiculous and compare players like MacGyver, The Terminator, Rambo and Matrix. But now we seem to be discussing men like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a meaningless comparison to me that is dead, but fun. If you go to what we saw from Jet Li in the game Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you should say at least that he will have a good game against Chan. It appears in this film as a martial arts god. <br /> <br /> The black mask is about a man who was created with many other men to be high-end combat machines. Their only goal is to win wars that others lose. It is invincible in some ways. Now this is the introduction to the film, but what he does is prepare all the surprisingly amazing scenes of fighting. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a marvel. He can do things with his body and no one can do. This makes it very enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Besides martial arts in the film, Black Mask is strong in humor and this is because of the chemistry that Jet has with his star partner, Police Officer. They're gorgeous together. But to be honest. If anyone reads this review, they want to see if the movie is kick ass in the work section. The answer to that is a resounding yes! Lots and lots of reckless sinister action. You will love this movie.
