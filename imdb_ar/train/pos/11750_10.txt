I saw this in the theater in 86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" "Beirut ... it's the best baseball game I ever had." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end but it will end up having a great time getting there. The training scenes are very funny but the best scene might be when Jack and Renault try to watch football match Falcons v. Vikings Monday Night while trying a make-up dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Ross seem to enjoy a lot of fun with this film, which is very bad as being ignored as a first-rate comedian.
