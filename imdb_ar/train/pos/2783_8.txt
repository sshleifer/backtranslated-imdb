Not one of your tough stories, this is a real power for this film. There are at least two relationships through which less confident writers have added some predictable romantic tension. They save not only this audience but also some surprises at the same time. There are a few moments of Disney, especially near the finish, but they are manageable. In general, it was worth the rent and it was fun and comfortable. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you get a DVD, watch the section where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed her directions and she was fantastic! Next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is the dish that definitely improves with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!
