It recalls the writings of Stephen King and the childhood that are remembered with terror from stories like IT - quite the opposite. There is no horror in childhood that he remembers or seems to suffer from any friends - who are still friends for 20 years. In the end, everything is described as a friendly shout, which may be periodically described as one or more "choices", but everyone is tolerated. There is no * * embedded * because the film and participants in subsequent life describe relationships - all we see are young people who grew up to be the same people. More mature, but basically still the same people, the same power structures. Very amazing! It is not only the fact that people can actually grow up without being relatively hurt by social charters - but also that friendships actually last. In this regard, this film is a small pearl - as one assumes that the aim of this film is: a picture of forced emotions that connect people to each other.

Or they are the balancing weight ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
