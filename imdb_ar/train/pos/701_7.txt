I did not know otherwise, so I thought it was much better not to exclude too much. Make no mistake in that it is not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer so I think she deserves a lot of praise for the work of this film. You can say that it was an act of love to her. The acting (outside Dominique) is a little cheesy and the quality of the film is also not fantastic but for a low budget film well. There have been times when the story line is coloring and there are parts lengthening, although I do not feel it greatly detracts from the person's ability to understand the film. If you love Dominique Monaghan as much as I like, say so. The gasket was fun, and will not spoil it but there is a certain scene that makes buying a DVD worth it quite so you can watch it over and over again. If you like the movie, check out The Pink Mirror, a film by Jagged Edge too. I know Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of paradise.
