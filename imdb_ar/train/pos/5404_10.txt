Everyone who says Pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is awesome. I even shead the tear when Celebei died. I do not cry too much! This film is moving animated film. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of the Pokemon game, Ash and Friends must stop the bad jerk from making Selby an evil weapon at all in his dark card. At that time, Sam and Celebei travel through time and are constantly tracked by game hunters. I like the part about the double battle and Sam has an apricot pokeball (if you've played pokemon gold or silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the presence of the official Miramax instead of Warner Brothers. Putting the mini-film in the end was a great idea. The Pokemon in this movie comes to life more than ever before.
