Well, so the music was badly written and synthetically in general (although Walken and Marner, especially Walken, looked very good). They finally broke the fourth wall by making the king and his nobles sing the "battle" with the ghouls, and praised the efforts of Puss in Boots when they did not know their rights. <br /> <br /> Who cares? He is Christopher Freakin and Walken, who makes a movie based on a fairy tale, sings and dances. His acting style corresponds to the role played by the well-twisted Puss, which seems to put his master in deeper and deeper trouble, but in fact he has a plan he thought of seven or eight steps in advance. And if you've seen Walken in any of his sinister roles, you'll know * the Ghoul who finally hits the dust when he put Walken in the company. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, and a movie that must be seen by anyone who enjoys the unique style of Christopher and Anne.
