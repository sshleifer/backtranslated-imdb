The first installment of the notorious series of horror shows a woman kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men torturing her for several days before finally killing her. She is brutally beaten and spins around her on the chair indefinitely. Her fingernails are pulled, the animals' courage is thrown over her, boiling water is poured on her and finally the eyeball is pierced with a needle (a really sick and bad scene). The makers of this unforgettable offer tried to make it as real as possible and for me this is one of the closest to the snuff movie you can get without committing a murder on the tape. Sure, some special effects are fairly bad but the idea of ​​making snails is a very heinous idea. I have also seen "flesh and blood flowers" which is more subtle and sadistic, but less disturbing. Anyway, this is the one you should see for horror lovers!
