I have always wondered what happened with this magical kind of feeling that the old Slovenian movies looked ... well, in time I was wondering if this feeling is just craving. Or is this "feeling" decided to pack his bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our film history, then never again? Or did it? Because for me, he returned for the first time that I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". It was very old again. <br /> <br /> There are three characteristics in this film that make it somewhat unique and enjoy watching it - the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of colors, and what I appreciate most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (many other Slovenian script writers) And not only (they should think at least). There is no use of words, when you can only understand each other (yes, or better) by other means in use. Just watch Pacovic and car. Uh. <br /> <br /> So, this is in many words only, is why I recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to all of you, as a Slovenian film, no matter what you may hear about Slovenian movies (if you have heard anything, ie .. .). <br /> <br /> Oh, this scene, where Pacovic is dancing on Vivaldi music ... a treat. <br /> <br /> Factor yourself. See this.
