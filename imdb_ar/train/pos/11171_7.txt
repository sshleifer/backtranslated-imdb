In general, this film was excellent for his time and would be interesting for many generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate for the book only that everything is true. The film skips forward and misses some important parts. I found the book and prepared it and I immediately hope that they made a film (because I did not know the movie yet), but later found the film in a Walmart bargaining box and decided to buy it and see if it was what I expected. In general, I give these films 7 out of 10 for their good parts (relative accuracy and general sense of humor) and their bad parts (skip a great time and not a small but noticeable accuracy).
