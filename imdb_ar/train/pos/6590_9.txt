The clever, intelligent, and sexy "invisible man" emerged in 2000 between the usual Sci-Fi lineup, balancing the direction of Farscape's fictional art and sometimes a melodramatic scenario with courageous, cynical plots and modern dialogue. The show sat between "law and order" and "doctor" on the scale of credibility, but there was no denial of the fact that the characters of "I-Man" exceeded the cartoons. Even the characters achieved in predictability such as Keeper and The Official and Eberts were given translations of the formula. Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Vintriska had chemistry evolved and turned elegantly, making them more prominent by the rotor team of writers and directors. The influence of the effects on the plot is never allowed, and the science at times was unbelievably incredible. The low viewing points are still amusing, and I have not seen such distorted experimental episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be commended, and fans have the right to request a comprehensive DVD from the show. Every time I encounter the "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" on Sci-Fi, I turn my eyes and sigh, reminding me of the excitement and potential of the science fiction TV represented by an "invisible man" and the like.
