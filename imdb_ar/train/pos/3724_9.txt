Tiggerland follows the lives of a group of newly drafted men in the army who were called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this point, America knows they are fighting a losing battle, and the director takes us through a 16-track documentary About the lives of many recruits at the Tigerland training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a personal study, not a real conspiracy, but it focuses on the key to the character of Roland Booz, an energized but intelligent man who just wants to escape from the camp. We are taken by several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this is a wonderful story about Vietnam and more importantly about the Army in general. And very memorable. The directors' use of the film and style works very well, because it is very similar to the old movie footage you always see regarding Vietnam. It's great to see how the film shows that all the internal problems and problems were so important to the fighting problems in this battle. The particular scene in which Booz walks away from a training mission, where one of the trainers shows how to use the radio as a torture device that sums up everything about the war in short ... It is absurd. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not only about the nam but about who must decide what is morally right through "in the army". Rating 9 out of 10.
