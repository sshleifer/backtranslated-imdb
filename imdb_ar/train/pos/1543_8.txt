I remember watching this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I want to see it again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? As I remember, it was a particularly strong film, especially the scene that stands out is horses wearing gas masks. Apart from that, I can not remember much about the story - that's why I want to see it again! I've done the web but I can not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - there may not be a DVD or VHS for this movie on the market. I will appreciate any help anyone can give me in this regard. Thank you very much in advance for your help. Best Regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
