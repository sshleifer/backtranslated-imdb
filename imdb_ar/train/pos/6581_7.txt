Looking for Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found the 1985 version this interesting. Wonderful! It was amazing! Kind Russell Russell of movies - strange, embellished, highly artistic, and of course "different". Nero was not presented as much as the incarnated evil, but as an eccentric emperor not yet achieved he would have preferred to have a career in circus. He may have wondered why he put it on the ground in an imperial "leadership" position - it was not much fun, and fun was what he longed for. Klaus Maria Bandaur spent a tremendous time with this role and played it all well. Yes, Nero persecuted the Christians for revenge. One of many who did it. At one point, one of his followers complained: "No one will understand that we were protecting ourselves." Got this right.
