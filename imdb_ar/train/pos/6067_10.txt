Although I tend to agree with other comments made by people who have seen this film, I am ashamed to say that I like it. Often can not find such a huge pile of 80s pap out Wham! Video, so it certainly is worth watching (Â£ 0.79 a night in my local shop!). Watch out for the obvious seams and pressure on the monster costume, the fact that the "hero" is very similar to Keith Chegwin and the classic lines like the following: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "In the end, we meet Kor ..." Kor: "Exciting, right? "Amazing! I also like the fact that although the video box looks very exciting with pictures of a castle surrounded by wild seas and dangerous hawks like a bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other interesting and interesting suggestions about what happens in the actual film, No, I'm not kidding ... There's no really raging sea or violent birds, it's just trying to make you interested ... Classic In my opinion, this movie gets 10 for the value of exclusive entertainment !!
