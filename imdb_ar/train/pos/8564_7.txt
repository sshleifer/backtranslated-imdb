I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers from Romania. This tells something definitely about the value of the film, or perhaps about the lack of universality of the film, but it also tells something about how different the history and even life of ordinary people in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the novel by Marin Breda, a controversial novelist who died during Communist rule shortly after the publication of the book. Tells the story of my intellectual, a professor of philosophy who crushed his life after his imprisonment on false charges at the end of the Stalinist era. Basically, the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle to stay in prison, while the second part describes his idea of ​​restoring his life after his release. His release is only clear. Romania, in its 1960s, demands different kinds of compromises and crimes, but its struggle to survive is morally difficult as in prison. <br /> <br /> The film behaves superbly by some of the best Roman actors. Stefan Iordache who had a leading role would be somewhere else and a great star, we can get a good glimpse of his wonderful acting art. Although suffering from storytelling and occasional hesitation in non-essential details or comic sketches of characters, the film remains an important milestone for Romanian cinema, as well as the restoration of moral and historical values ​​in Roman society.
