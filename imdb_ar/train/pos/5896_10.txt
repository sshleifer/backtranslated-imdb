Really wonderful movie and real story. Dan Jansen is the greatest skater ever. An influential and beautiful film that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jin Jansen battle with cancer and Dan Yansen love for his sister. Of Jensen's important promise to win a gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right to believe that his talent for speed skating was justified. This picture is worth the time. I hope they will make more films of this quality. Thank you for a great movie with excellent actors and an excellent story. It is a very moving story about beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their younger son and sister.
