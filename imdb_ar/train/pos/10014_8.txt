The nighttime listener, Robin Williams, starred as a New York City radio host who was delighted with his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Colkin), was struck by a severe illness. Williams never met the person, who was only in touch by talking on the phone. However, the former Williams friend (a nice post from Bobby Canavel) raises doubts about the boy, prompting Williams to arrange a meeting with him personally. The following makes a lasting impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I'll leave it in this. Tony Collett is also a star. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, as Tony Collett presented an unforgettable portrait of Kulkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also shine as a friend of Williams. The night listener is inspired by actual events, and has a gloomy, almost creepy silence. Sometimes predictable, not thanks to some of the reviews I read before watching the film because of logic, but I liked anyway. I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more than his comic characters so they were an added bonus for me. Recommended. 10/08
