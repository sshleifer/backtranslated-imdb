I just saw this movie, and I fell in love with it. There is something simple for everyone, and it is free for everyone when it comes to romance between Luclan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... There is an undisclosed realization that time is the most valuable commodity and the most obvious when they are together. This idea is taken from several angles, from marriage to ribbons to finding love in less traditional places. The film makes you almost long for this kind of despair when you learn that tomorrow may be your last film. Crowe was particularly impressive in his role for Llan. I have always had a soft spot for the accent, but I almost melted by photographing his character. The way this film was filmed is also beautiful, with music, open background fields, and great acting. Together, this wonderful movie falls on all human feelings.
