An influential film of the four temples in the city in a crisis in Apalachia became synonymous with rural corruption. Each of the four businessmen faces their darkest fears when dealing with a challenging white water journey on a river about to be replaced by a dam. When locals decide along the way to "make their way" with the two interlocking, this leads to many deaths and many trauma to the survivors. Both travelers are wonderful, although Voight gives the driving and the most powerful performance. Landscapes and rural culture have been well captured, including the amazing stunning Banjo sequence. I've seen this in the history of his appearance, not exactly an ideal history film (although we enjoyed it). I remember this as a stunning dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already established. This is not the type of film you can watch every week, but it has a strong punch and is beautifully photographed.
