This step actually prompted me to jump out of the chair in anticipation of what the actors would do! The acting was the best, Farah had to get an Oscar because she was fantastic. James Rousseau was so good that I hated him as a villain and played brilliantly. There are not many movies that impressed me with this film. The cast was fantastic looking at the shock with those big eyes Farah looks like a victim and lived her horror as he passed. Farah made you feel like you were there and felt the same anger that you felt you wanted to hurt, but you also know that it is wrong to do. The film made you on a roller coaster ride and went up and down with each scene.
