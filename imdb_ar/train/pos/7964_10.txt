I was amazed at how much I loved this film despite the fact that I did not really like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do great work with Chance, Sassy and Shadow sounds, and the animals themselves are wonderful. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 72 times already (I know this sounds scary, but that's true!), and every time the scenes of the end still hit me. I highly recommend it to people of all ages especially for animal lovers. It's really my favorite film ever!
