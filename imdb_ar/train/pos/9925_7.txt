When I hired Domino I expected to be very stupid. I hate movies that really have editing, cinematography and Domino just got ratings too bad. The only reason I saw is that I loved Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Wacken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also just enjoy building on adventure stories really. Yes, editing and cinematography were feverish, the story was weak, and the acting was modest, but I still love this film for some strange reason. Domino was very entertaining and very funny. I think it was grossly underestimated when it was released on what I think because everyone wanted more emotional journey like Scott's latest film "Man on Fire" and instead they got great entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hates Domino so much, although I loved her and recommend them.
