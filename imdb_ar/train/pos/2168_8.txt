I saw this movie on television late one night years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that stayed with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis may seem a bit untrue - because of the earthquake, a hidden underground store is broken into the toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town, and you find a microscopic amount of material entering the food supply. The inhabitants of the town begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint on every whim and basic desire that pervades our minds from time to time, and this usually teaches us that we simply must not move. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but for me that was added only to creeping unease as the behavior of city dwellers slowly begins to collapse. There are many very surreal and disturbing scenes that have been etched in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we can all be capable of if we succumb to our most brutal instincts. Did you enjoy it? I'm not sure the word "enjoy" is the right word. Did he make me think? definitely. I'm still thinking about it. Scary things.
