By 1987, Hong Kong had introduced films such as "Spooky Kind" for Sammo Hung's "Chow Yun Fat" in John Woo's famous song "Better Tomorrow", "Zu Warriors" and "Mr Vampire." Jackie Chan has achieved international success on video, but with the Chinese Ghost Story, HK Cinema has made its first Crosse movie in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western filmmakers have never seen anything they like. It was a film dealing with the various components that Hong Kong Cinema has used for many years (the Flying Swordsman, a martial arts that has been largely designed and more than natural) and blended to create a unique film in terms of form, appearance and execution. Forget the poor and unnecessary disciples that produced it, this is the original and the best. <br /> <br /> Director Seo Tong Ching (still known as the best action-dance designer in films such as Woo's `A Better Tomorrow 2 '/' The Killer, under the watchful eye of the legendary producer Tsui Hark, Fantasy Cinema / Horror With a team of experts at his disposal (at least 6 of the martial arts coordinators), the chances of the film becoming a great thing are unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Editing by David Wu (who wrote surprisingly prolific), directed by The Bride With White Hair 2, and the editing of classic titles such as "A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3", "Hardboiled" and the hit hit "The Club") are simply genius . His formulation of high-courage sword battles and climbing trees make him one of Hong Kong's best movie films. Moving fast, strange but never confusing, even today, is the culmination of their art. <br /> <br /> The crew of filmmakers has also made miracles. This is the movie where each shot is a panel crafted with experience. Where the brilliance of the brilliant blue night, covered with perpetual ghostly haze, is the breathtaking platform. It is a film where everything is used to weave a dream-like beauty. Even robes and silk dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become vivid parts of the film, whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes, silk flows across the screen. Even the simple scene in which Hsiao Tsing changes turns the robes into a kind of luxurious beauty, combining each skill in the group to create an unforgettable scene from such a simple act. The collections are also wonderful, giving another earthly sense of the forest, worshiping and cruelty to the hell-scorched, science-filled land of the amazing final. The productive design of Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another key factor in the success of the films is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong films have given us some great music and songs that have added a lot of success to a sequel, but in the Chinese Ghost Story, music is simply vital. From the opening song onwards, music becomes as important as characters. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect combination of modern and traditional machines. Drums, bells, and guitars knock on the sequence of motion for great effect, but they are in the slowest and brightest romantic pieces that lie in them. Here; Psalms, strings and female choral effects create what could be the best cut music that a movie hears in Hong Kong. Add to that the amazingly beautiful female vocalist who plays the love-making in Cao Xin and Hsiao Tsing ("You've never seen anything, but the effect is wonderful." This is an innocent love story for movies) and you have a shining example of the power you can own. <br /> <br /> Of course we have the talent of acting. Leslie Cheung ("Better Tomorrow 1 and 2" and a very popular singer) are as wonderful as the innocent tax collector. His work in comic sequences (fortunately) never ends, and his play with Joey Wang is played with the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who will later land mostly to support roles in films such as Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau's classic "God of Gamblers") has never looked brighter than she does here. It is an example of ethereal beauty. Her tragic portrayal of Hsiao Tsing is stunning. It shows its sad characters for what it has become and what it is to do, but it also provokes exciting excitement in the scenes where men are enticed by their heinous death. Veteran actor Wu Ma (Mr. Vampire, Swordsman) is a great fun like a wise, brave, but very angry yen. He walks on a fine line between eccentric and easily irritated exercises. And what could have easily been a character can harm the film is actually a wonderful and memorable amusing. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and monsters? I hear you cry. Well, it ranges from the somewhat unpleasant zombie movement but the fun / zombie mobile that inhabits the temple (leading to a great gulf constantly being made with continually thwarted attempts to respond to the surprisingly reassuring Cao-shin), to the tasty but effective Lord Black Amazing. With the completion of an arsenal of fierce flying bosses, the wire work is very outstanding. Most of them, to this day, never took the lead. <br /> <br /> But the most creative and creative influence is the tongue of the killer in the spirit of the tree. We first encountered this effect with the camera's "Dead Dead" camera as it reduces its victims to deliver a deadly French kiss that turns victims into zombie husks. But later appears in all her crazy glory. They can grow big and long so they are released through the jungle after prey, tearing the trees, wrapping themselves around the buildings and files along a thin line around the people before picking them up and throwing them against the logs !! So it can be divided open to detect the mouth filled with Fang! It is a heinous idea that deep romantic conspiracy must not succeed. But it is a wonderful, unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> So all this adds up to a classic example of the Hong Kong film industry. A real team effort gave us a really wonderful film. It is a film full of intelligence, invention, movement, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, brilliant ideas, visual images, beautiful music and most importantly its permanent charm, one of the most exciting cinemas of romance.
