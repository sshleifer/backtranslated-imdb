This film contains all that makes the bad movie worth seeing - slow editing, little continuity, crazy dialogue, bad (you might say it does not exist), meaningless story lines, stills that last for a very long time ... and it's perfect to walk on MST3K, not to mention "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": Scrabble on models ... Take a shot - Register your name ... Take a shot - Take a bad adjustment from Foley ... Take a lot, lots of shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason for not being rated higher than 8 is that there is not enough unjustified nudity and because, despite the madness, it only takes one long hour - hell, such a movie should have been at least 20-30 minutes longer!
