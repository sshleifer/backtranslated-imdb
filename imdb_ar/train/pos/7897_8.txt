At first sight, this film does not seem like a great movie. After all the films Bette Davis with only 166 votes on the IMDb and the rating of 6.5 should be fairly bad. But it turned out to be a wonderful and innovative surprise. <br /> <br /> I initially expected this film to be a regular in the 1930s with an antisocial love story, but the film is well built and amazing. It has an unusual and innovative story, which also helps make this film a very enjoyable movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story is played by two key characters, Betty Davis and George Brent. A group of mostly entertaining characters helped them, but the film mainly included two of them. Their characters are involved in a more unusual and intelligent written love story that works as a sense of humor as well. This movie makes a small comedy exhilarating to watch, and this is quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is very short (over an hour long), which means that the story does not unnecessarily waste time lines, plot, development and characters. It also makes the film a fairly fast pace, helping to make this film fully viewable by today's standards as well. It may make the film a bit simple at times, but it never happens at the expense of entertainment or entertainment. <br /> <br /> A fun and simple romantic comedy worth seeing more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
