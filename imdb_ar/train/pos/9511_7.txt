The story of bloody gangs occurring in the Great Depression. He tells us about another infamous assassin, Michael (Mike) Salloyan. Somehow, this time the story turns in the opposite direction: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family were killed because of a dirty game for his boss. He succeeds in his revenge and believes in an honorable future for his son, but he is eventually killed. Such stories never end with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks played a great role in Mike Sallewan, and Paul Newman played the role of Mr. Ronnie (Mafia boss). The film gives a great impression, and we hear the well-known phrase "We steal banks." This film is still worth seeing though you were expecting something bigger than Sam Mendes after his American beauty.
