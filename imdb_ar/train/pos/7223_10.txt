The comparison with Sleuth, the movie that was played earlier in the theater, became clear. In my first opinion, I also thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap, at least for me, is more than a frequent sighting of Sleuth. <br /> <br /> I bought Deathrap in the bargain box at Wal-Mart, considering it had an undervalued Caine and Reefve and was worth $ 6. It was one of the coolest DVD purchases I could not pick up. <br /> <br /> It is one of the best secrets that always delight in discovering movies. It's worth watching. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caen performed superb roles in Sleuth, she was doubly influenced by Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, who was rightly associated with the legendary portrayal of Superman, stole the show in what Oscar's performance should have been worth. I've always felt that Reeve was a great actor and did not get a lot of chances to shine outside Superman movies and a few flawed but entertaining movies like Somewhere in Time, but this film shows that his potential was really exploited and used, thank God. <br /> <br /> I totally enjoyed Michael Kane's performance. It was heavy, and it was tasty and serene. He was watching him working with Reeve and Dan Cannon completely amazing. In fact, thanks to this film, I entered the stage of Michael Caen and began to rent as many things as possible. <br /> <br /> As for Deathtrap, there is enough juicy dialogue here to fill in the "Unforgettable Quotes" section. (Unfortunately, much of the dialogue spoils by nature the most entertaining plot). <br /> <br /> It is really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling the plot points of a more fun and limitless adventure to discover on your own. Needless to say, it is a must. But for me, this was the blindest and most rewarding purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated views are a must. <br /> <br /> It is worth sitting next to Sleuth on your DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I will leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film: "I wonder if this will not happen Be ... well ... just a trivial astral me to engage in such risky and exciting collaboration ... Where I can not rely on any sense of moral obligation ... at all. "
