I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4:00 in my local shop and I thought it looked good for a low budget movie, so I bought it and I was right because it was good. For starters, this film revolves around a killer snowman, so this is something that laughs at him and the way he looks funny compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> It was fine and the lines that Jack Frost said made me laugh "I spoiled you only for smoke" and "World's most falling snow-cone worlds" to what extent was this camp funny? The story at the beginning was very funny and ridiculous. "Jack was smart, Jack was fast, Jack's eyes were concave with candle sticks." If you're looking for a full-blown horror B-Movie Comedy, check out Jack Frost. 10/10
