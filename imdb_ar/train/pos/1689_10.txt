This is a Christmas movie, which is the Christmas "Happy Christmas": both are relatively low-budget movies with no star names ... and both are the greatest and most entertaining movies available, both seasonally CLASSICS !!! "Raid Raiders" come out from the beginning directly with warmth, humor and a wonderful array of characters ... All Five Geek Geek, Clybeker Realtor, MP Russell, Verne's Fuel Distribution Warehouse and many more! You just watch this movie to believe it, and like the "Christmas Story", it continues to improve and improve with every watch, and you can pick up nice little things every time !! Definitely more than a dozen!
