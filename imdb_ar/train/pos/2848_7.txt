New York, I Love You, is a collective work of eleven short films, each showing a clip in about 10 minutes. Shorts are not exactly about but they have everything in common, and love. All in short is the search for love, whether it is a couple or just two strangers. The film features a number of actors, including Shea Lapov, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irfan Khan, Robin Wright Ben, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawk, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a star cast and such an interesting premise, I was expecting a huge film. The problem is New York I love you do not add up. The sum of its parts remains. Some of the clips are funny, innovative and interesting but others do not make sense (Orlando Plum slides / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawk / Maggie Kyo) to the point that they are appalling. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. A wise story, it sounds like something some film students can assemble. Having said that, the film will see some wonderful moments, one of the best is the part of an old couple, written by Eli Walash and Clorets Leitchman, walking in Brooklyn on the occasion of their 67th wedding. For moments like this, which made me viewers, I hope the film is more consistent , Because there is a lot of potential here. But, since the overall story is not satisfactory to me, cinematography and soundtrack has saved everything for me. The editing process was perfect, and the way the film was filmed was very impressive and the ethereal sound could not be more appropriate. In the end, "I Love You in New York" looks like an experimental film, and as with most experiments, there are high and high levels. It's the way the person looks at the film as a whole, which will determine whether or not to enjoy it. It may be helpful for some and wasting time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
