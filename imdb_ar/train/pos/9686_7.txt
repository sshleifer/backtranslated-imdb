An emotional story with an emotional soundtrack. She is about a little girl (with a vocal handicap) who cherishes her green bougie. Parrot thinks and speaks as a human being and provides help and advice to his companion. <br /> <br /> The parrot is definitely the movie star. In times of misfortune and during times of depression, the bird captures the mood in a wonderful and expressive way. The sound is very good, and within a minute or two, you can actually believe that this smart little bird is there. <br /> <br /> In the early part of the film, her flying father gives the brothel hostage and the following scenes the story of the ongoing struggle of Pauli for many years to reunite with his mistress. One of the many memorable scenes is when a bad company is located and is encouraged to spy on people who use ATM machines. It seems that Polly has tremendous memory. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable, but who wants it in another way. Children will love this movie and anyone who keeps the birds as a pet will be delighted with Paulie's weirdness.
