"Panic in the streets" was a wonderful film, but I was a little disappointed. The main idea of ​​a city being attacked by plague in modern times is fascinating, but the film does not explore or develop it. They are well made and amusing, but not as interesting as they should be. The scenario of this film is really weak and leads to the entire movie down. None of the central characters are convincing or really reliable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film was made so well that it compensates for weak text writing. The direction of Elijah Kazan keeps the movie moving and moving at amazing speed. There are some notable sequences, especially the climax of an unforgettable chase. When his direction was combined with better film performances after several years, the man was unable to make any mistake. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Richard Widmark was always a prominent man in the water and doing what he could with a written character. Paul Douglas spends his time screaming a little but doing a good job as well. The lead in the cast are the bad guys. Zero Mostel, best known for his comic roles, is as graceful as one of the best characters in the cinema. Jack Palance, unsurprisingly, is a chilling villain. "Street panic" is disappointing but still worth watching. (7/10)
