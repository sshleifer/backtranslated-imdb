Murder: The film proved to be a good summary of a well-written, well-directed and well-behaved series. Loose limbs that have not been properly handled at the end of the final season have been linked. The whole series, especially the film, has provided a life-like look to life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with a very high murder rate. I began to attract the series before I moved to Baltimore for a long time, but once I lived life here myself, I realized how realistic it was. And certainly the film kept this spirit. I will certainly miss new original episodes of this series, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and their toys to give us a final glimpse into the dark side of Charm City.
