I have warned posters of John Carpenter's classic horror novel "The HE HE Come Home." In a small American city, Halloween revolves around the attempts of serial killer Michael Myers to track down his sister Laurie Stroud, and at the same time dispose of all her friends in very brutal ways ... leaving poor Laurie to fight Michael who seems indestructible. This off-line plot is inspired by the countless knockout horror throughout the 80s and 90s and continues to do so today, as well as the 2007 remake received a bad. The difference between them, that is, simply, that "Halloween" is the best. <br /> <br /> Made on a modest and very narrow budget ... Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and resulted in the subtype of "sexually abused teenagers getting hunted by a knife / ax / chainsaw / psychological veto."
