My first Fassbinder was a great experience. The film and alternative cinema (a small hall, with uncomfortable seats; the audience had to wait until the movie rolls were changed) was a perfect match. <br /> <br /> There were many cliches used in the film, but Vassbender gave it so cleverly that I found them really amusing. The sound was also fantastic (sometimes it was higher than the dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in place. I like the way it was presented after the war. Real fun! <br /> <br />
