Strangely fun effort, where a far-fetched plot involving Adam and Bert and memories of the past in the original TV series was combined. Most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from Bart Ward's "Wonder Boy: My Life in Tights" and I imagine that his book was an inspiration for making this film. Like the book, leave it to the lovers of the original series seeking starvation to get more. <br /> <br /> If you miss this broadcast, it is certainly worth the effort to borrow a bar from a friend you may have registered. I am making a copy for my children now.
