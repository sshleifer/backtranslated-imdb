I agree with many of the negative reviews published here, for reasons I will go to later. But these factories are strong and convincing because talented actors embody the dark truth of the Hitler world. <br /> <br /> Peter Sturmar is as perfect as Ernest Romme, the brutal leader of Brownhead. Every scene he has with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is very wicked, he controls everyone except Rom, the primitive thugs - and it is clear that he is digging Rum for this exact reason. The interaction between Stormare and Carlisle illuminates the way Hitler used brutally Rohm, but sacrificed it later for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone has become a faithful performer, with Geli Raubal, the condemned daughter of Hitler and an unspeakable victim. Deviations. Without revealing any of the sexual filth directly, Gina Malone plays all the horror of the slow extinction of the little girl's soul. She uses her eyes and her voice to point out all the terror that will be visited on millions in the coming years. And it's wonderful! Zoe Telford almost approaches Gina Malone from her portrayal of Eva Braun. Eva is obviously sick, harsh and heartless - but at the same time relies roughly on twisted Adolf's tenderness. The scene of love that has been foiled between them (hinting at the truth of the enormous hatred of Adolf Hitler's self-mass) is chilling and exciting. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber presents a lively performance such as Boetzie Hanfstingel, where Boetzie Hanfstingel performs a lively performance. - about the city, which vents Hitler promises of wealth and power. While the brute like Romm simply liked the idea of ​​crushing the skulls under his shoes, Schreiber's character is one of many Germans who hate Nazi violence but can not resist the highway and easy to money and power. His weak power soon relieved Hitler of respect for his wife, who played with the style and feeling of the stunning and stunning Juliana Margolis. It provides a true picture of marriage and betrayal. <br /> <br /> These presentations carry a mini-series, easily overcoming the script's weaknesses. There is one exception. Regrettably, Matthew Moden's acting segments do not live up to snuff. The long-haired nobleman destroys every scene he owns - the viewer can not wait to disturb the brown-brown shirt that looks good, and look at his anonymous little face in Hollywood. But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now with respect to factual factual errors - Hitler's deviations and cruelty are presented in a vibrant and convincing drama. But the record of the battle of Corporal Hitler is badly distorted. As if the public were afraid of dealing with the idea of ​​evil and courage in the same person, the book makes Hitler look like the pure coward who "begged" for the Iron Cross. As if anyone in the Tsar's army could get a medal just by whining! The film makes it look as though Hitler was a coward in the trenches, when he was a soldier who knew no fear. They also point out that his comrades despise him, while in fact he has been widely admired by officers and enlisted men alike. The frustrating thing is that the mini-series works well in representing Hitler as a monster in honest ways - but they could not resist the cheap shot. <br /> <br /> However, Hitler: The Rise of Evil is a great success highlighted by powerful performances.
