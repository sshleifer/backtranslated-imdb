Well, I'll consider Police Story one of Jackie Chan's best films. The plot, fighting scenes and acts of excellent stunt. In this film, Jackie himself worked as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested the master of crime. After the crime master was released for lack of evidence, Chan framed the murder of a police officer. Because of this, he became wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the Minister of Crime, went to the mall and began to steal crime master crime guides from his computer and prepare to transfer them to Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his statements condemning and employing his followers to arrest her. Later, Chan appeared in the scenes and began to fight all the followers, defeating them one by one. In the last scene, Chan was seen hitting the master of crime. Finally, this is the best motion picture and comedy. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended.
