This animated movie is a masterpiece! Narration, music, animation, and story where everything is wonderful. My girlfriend and I saw her again for the second time and we got more insight. We invited two friends to see the soul with us and enjoy it a lot. When I asked them to come to see him, they thought it was a movie about the horses, but then they realized it was more than that. I loved Esperanza, Spirit, Rennes, and Lil Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who smiles a lot in dancing with wolves. Spirit contains profound symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found influential and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw Spirit for the third time and I want to see it again. I enjoyed Spirit very much because her portrayal of American Indians is realistic, dignified and atypical, unlike the film "The Road to Eldorado," which was a farce because it portrayed American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way. But Dreamworks replaced themselves by making Spirit a great movie and found it acceptable! I hope they will continue to produce more animated films such as Spirit, and I would like to see occasional sequences or results on Spirit if this is done with respect and without templates for Indo-American Indians. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and push to see the soul: the stallion of Cimarron.
