I watched this movie I do not expect much and do not know anything about it. loved it. A good and very narrow plot, and an intriguing hooker shaped like an ugly, fat-haired girl, and a former deception, the pace kept things flowing without speeding. <br /> <br /> A film much better than the director De Battre mon coeur s'est, which was boring and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not quite work was that the ugly girl assumed she was ugly and not fat: solid, certainly, far from traditional beauty, but with so many characters in her face, she captured the screen whenever she was on her. Wonderful. I hope you are in more and better movies than in general. I've seen some of Gil's wife and a little mustache, both of which look like garbage, and I've seen both De Battre mon coeur s'est, and that's definitely nonsense. She seems to have a few going out, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
