This contains some excellent locations but the length of the film can not maintain a thin piece of chip. He is another sailor on film leave, more impressed than Astaire's "Follow the Fleet", but not as good as "in town". <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is cute but Kelly and Sinatra work together well. The number "If You Know Susie" is a joy because they make up the song while singing it. "I have received it" is also interesting with Sinatra who shows his skill in manipulation. Sinatra's single songs are boring and appear to have been included to show her singing and not as part of the story. Fortunately, prominent supporters such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez, Pamela Britton and Josele Iturbi are unlikely to be interested in keeping one watch. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the third bill film and it is interesting to see him interact with the children, something that Esther never did. Dean Stockwell plays the role of a child who wants to be in the Navy and penetrates Kelly's character. He also visits a school leading to telling the children a fictional story about his life in the Pomeranian Navy (!) Leading to his wonderful dance with the animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he dances the charming Mexican hat dance with a small girl with a beautiful face, Sharon McManus, who is attractive and beautiful. <br /> <br /> Very fun but very long. Taste the best of upcoming musicals.
