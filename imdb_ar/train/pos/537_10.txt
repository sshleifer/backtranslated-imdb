For me "a matter of life or death" - it is the best film ever produced. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, he started to excel. It is stimulating and thought-provoking and a mirror of the post-war world and the relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> The Cinema is simply stunning and the blending effect of Monochrome and Technicolor to highlight different worlds works smoothly. The development of characters and conspiracies is almost complete, and attention to detail reinforces the imaginative imagination. <br /> <br /> No matter how often I watch the movie - I've seen it so much - it never fails to touch it. Makes me smile, makes me laugh, makes me think, makes me cry. It is as new as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If only one film allows me to save it and see it again, the "matter of life and death" will be the film.
