Sydney Lumette, although one of the oldest active directors, still got the game! A few years ago, he shot "Find Me Guilty", a proof that Vin Diesel can do it, if he gets the chance and the right way out. If he has retired after this film (a real masterpiece in my eyes), no one can blame him. But still strong, his next film has already been announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's stay with this film here. The list of the cast is incredible, and its performance is top notch. The nuances of their performance, the "real" dialogue and / or the situations that developed during the film are just amazing. The structure (time) of the film, which keeps your toes all the time, blends timelines smoothly, so that the editing looks natural / flawless. The story goes even further, though even in the "normal" time structure, it was at least a good film (drama / excitement). I can only recommend it strongly, and the rest is back to you! : s)
