What is very French about this film is the time it takes to create two prominent characters. This may require a little patience, especially since neither of them is "unattractive" in Hollywood's typical definition of it. However, once you start "stealing" the film rushes forward fast, maybe at times very quickly. But it's a real trip, and if you do not look closely, everything is completely believable. The kind of movies that Hollywood knows was going to fail.
