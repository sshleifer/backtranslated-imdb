This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relations within each family. Every family has a gay son. Stories are intertwined at this stage, but this film revolves around all family members, not just the two sons. The pictures of each family member in both families are well drawn and the story is interestingly interesting if it is a bit bleak.
