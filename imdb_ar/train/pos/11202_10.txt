At first, I thought the ring would be a film more than usual with a normal conspiracy. How surprised I am! Of course, this plot is simple - one girl in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver plate, with laughter and fear, with compassion and compassion. The way it depicts the popular crowds of the show, the girl's attraction power for both men, and the tragic elements that come along with the techniques that open the mind to most of his major films (north-northwest, rope, etc.). Mr. did it so great even before his thirties!
