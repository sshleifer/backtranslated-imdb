The Hanson brothers - Andy (he seems to have done his work together) and Hank (obviously does not work together) need money. Andy comes with a scheme to get a dough that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This film is presented. This is a full-layered roller coaster, which knows exactly what you are doing. As an exciting drama / crime, I would happily compare it to "There is no country for old people". While both films contain a multitude of dramas and characters, "Devil" has become more exciting because of its fast speed. "No Country" is a cooler film and more blues you can really admire, while "The Devil" is a little more fun. There is certainly less violence in the "devil" than "no country". Representation also delivers. Ethan Hawk, who has sometimes been woody in the past, brings tensions, sweating and deer at the front of the headlights to the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the harshest movie scenes and becomes a fast actor, who thinks he can do anything. <br /> <br /> There is no big mistake in this movie. Jumping back and forth without being confusing. The events are out of control, but the movie did not do - writing (from the first timer Kelly Masterson), director (veteran Sydney Lumette) and editing remains as narrow as a barrel. In many categories, this is something of high value, although films such as "Leaving" and "No Country" have taken this film out of the spotlight. If you like this, you'll like it.
