Yes, the poster is an integral part of the work. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was good ... There is nothing really wonderful ... I just hoped it would be grossly gross and completely blot out life. <br /> <br /> Ah, but this can not happen to rich kids now, can it happen? The son of a wealthy businessman does not have a large ballroom and has a beautiful garden trimmed in the front of the little mansion. <br /> <br /> No ... The child is so good that his life is completely shattered. After all, who will lead the new SUV and go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the rich poor children ... in their strange beautiful home, with their schools in the Middle Ages, very clean houses and social parties ... What would the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope they are all addicted to drugs, lose their lives and end up in prison ... so maybe we can see films that do not all revolve around poor rich young boys and girls. Of the surreal world.
