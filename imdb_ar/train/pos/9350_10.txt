Let me say that I love Adam Sandler, watch my covenant and I pay close attention to his actions. <br /> <br /> When he raises his voice, I can not help, but I'm thinking about the happy yelling at the golf ball. Then I was picked up again while Adam Sandler <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a film that slowly begins at first and anticipates feelings in every scene. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always performs great work and is no exception here with some fonts Really great and deserves an Oscar in any film he does <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was amazing in many ways, this was not the most dramatic / best film of his life Professional. But I can remember laughing out loud in many parts of this film <br /> <br /> The support team was also great with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> A great comedy drama in New York City and a new respect for Adam Sandler if she doubted or reassured him how wonderful Don Cheadle was
