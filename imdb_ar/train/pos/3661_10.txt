The experts of the immigrants and the false are "far from the best in de Sica", and those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will have a problem connecting to this masterpiece. De Sika spoke very directly. His Italian does not have a complex self-examination of contemporary Italian directors, a bitter parody of Petro Jeremy, the bitter bitterness of Mario Monicelli, or Viscounti's attention or the cold observation of Antonioni. Tell us de Sica stories like a father sitting on the edge of his children's bed before he sleeps. There is no attempt to think. Miracolo A Milano and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are realistic tales, or what we call magical realism today. The Jewel movie from start to finish and Toto is a kind of personality that you accept with an open heart but this, of course, requires you to have a heart. Cinema in the purest picture. Wonderful.
