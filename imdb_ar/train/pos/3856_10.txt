The film "Man de Verdi" (Fourth Man, 1984) is one of the best thriller films in the world in the eighties. This is the last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with films such as Total Recycle, Pisk Instinct and Starship Troopers revolving around a mentally ill author and disappointment (Jr.) . There he meets a mysterious young story (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a fatal love affair with her. Becomes addicted to her heart and soul and discovers that her three ex-husbands all died in mysterious circumstances. <br /> <br /> De Vierde man is heavily influenced by Hollywood's old film and psychological influence. Thriller by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles. It takes a long time to create a dark and bold atmosphere, and a few moments of intense graphic violence have the right effect to push the story forward. Sometimes the thrill is improbable and sometimes mentions the works of Italian director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> The cast is also wonderful, especially Krabi's performance as a mentally disturbed writer opening the door to his international film career ("Daytime Living," "Fugitive"). If you get this opportunity to watch this wonderful psychological excitement on your TV, video or DVD, do not miss the opportunity!
