I hired this for my son who recently found interest in 9/11. He was a kindergarten at that time and had no idea what was unfolding. I liked the way it was said "documentary". If there's one film I recommend watching 9/11, that's the movie! Usually you see a movie that has well-known actors. No one knew this film. Also, you watch a film about the events of September 11, you hear about one of the firefighters or two who are losing their lives to save people. I did not feel that this had anything from this! I just rented this movie and will definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very good indeed! My heart goes out to the survivors and the families of the victims of 9/11!
