But it is worth watching for Boer, Laurie and Pacino. Entertainment facilities filmed at Green require either transfer to American beaches, as in this weapon for hire, or use of American actors in roles that do not suit them. Bacall fits this part here. I kept waiting for a whistle to come out and check out Buggy. The tone of her voice is simply all wrong for the upper English class. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not talk this way except in books, but Green was sending a message about England, which needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. Another positive note: a whole set of Greene characters was retained. While Mr. Mukerjee looks more Brahmin, at least his nationality has been preserved, and his final conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
