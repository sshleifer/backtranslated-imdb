It was a pleasure to watch "The Man Tainted" for the first time when he first appeared on television in December 2000. <br /> <br /> The infectious disease expert William Hurt loses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them . Now after a few years is now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure where exactly, all I know is that it happens somewhere in this area. In any case, because of budget cuts in infectious diseases laboratory, they are forced to dispense with most of their workers. One of them, a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Mueller (played by Peter Wheeler, known for his role as the irrevocable Robocb), goes there and asks them to return his job. He needs this job because he is divorced and needs to pay for child support. So go there, fighting breaks out, some things knock, serious things. It was soon discovered that Mueller had been infected with a deadly disease. In fact, it's very deadly, one drop of blood kills a person within seconds. Soon after, the disease expert (Hurt) is summoned for a survey and subsequently collaborated with an American reporter. Now Mueller is determined to go home to see his wife and son and will not stop at anything even if it hits all the Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now as I said before this movie is very similar to the fall. We have a troubled person (Wheeler here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) will not stop at anything to achieve a goal there even if they had to kill a few people in the process. Then we have a person-type hero (Hurt here, Robert Duval in Falling Down) sympathetic and determined to stop the opponent. <br /> <br /> A polluted man is actually a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
