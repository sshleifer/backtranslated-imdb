One of the best films for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking about the additional history that this movie adds. I have watched this with nearly 40 years with my wife and son after working tonight and I have not laughed and enjoyed the film a lot for a long time. <br /> <br /> Spend some time and watch this with the kids. This will remind you of how Disney used to be when I was young.
