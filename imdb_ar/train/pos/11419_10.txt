For the first time Claire Dennis is brave and confident of himself. In this description of life near the end of French-Cameroonian colonialism, it explores relations between men and women, in black and white. <br /> <br /> With the black slave "Prot√©e" as the main target of the film and repression, the film introduces taboo land from the start. Dennis builds a picture of life through a series of characters' relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed on the screen. The film's mood is captured perfectly by camera action and lighting (lack of). <br /> <br /> A wonderful speech.
