"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast-moving, lively and wonderfully entertaining musical comedy by Warners which unfortunately is overlooked. Must remember that only to provide the official song for Tinseltown - "Hayay for Hollywood". But the score recorded by Richard Whiteing and Johnny Mercer has a number of other gems, including the charming "I Love Fish Outside the Water" and "Shadows in the Moonlight." The best musical number is "Let That Be a Lesson to You", where Dick Powell and his company detail the adventures of people who found themselves "behind the eight ball," a fate that literally coincides with Edgar Kennedy in the final numbers. The image celebrates and captures the magic of Hollywood all at once, as you get a huge number of comic miles from the maniacal and elegant actors and executives in the double studio. The cast includes a group of comedians with great personalities - Allen Jocelyn as an experienced news agent, Ted Healy as your potential director, Paul Fritz Field as the restaurant's high patron, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall on Friday, Edgar Kennedy Mabel Todd, , The hideous sister of Mona, and Hugh Herbert as her abhorrent father. The "racial element" mentioned in another review here is a ten-second period where Herbert appears in the black face during the false "Gone with the Wind" sequence. It's in dubious taste, but it should not prevent you from seeing other delights in this film, especially Benny Goodman quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I think is the only tape available in this wonderful jazz group. The "Dark Darkes" sequence goes on for a very long time and comes too late, but otherwise, the Hollywood Hotel is a jewel worthy of your time and certainly a movie to be considered for a DVD version.
