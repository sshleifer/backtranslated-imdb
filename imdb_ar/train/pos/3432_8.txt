This is one of those notable films that must be present in the context of time. Darkness was produced in Tallinn in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and great turmoil, not only for ordinary residents of Estonia but also for countless citizens from other former states that were part of the great Soviet empire. In a very tense climate, a young state called Estonia was born. It is known that the newly established governments have experienced teething problems. Estonia has also faced many troubles, with corrupt officials manipulating machinery to fill their dirty pockets by using their selfish means. This is one of the main themes of this film. Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film, but directed by Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He did his best to make as many of the doses of Estonian humor as possible. For this reason one can call it a comedy film of political tones. Since ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this film shows good versus evil. Is not a new concept because it is readily available in most religious books of different faiths. The fate in Tallinn shows us how ordinary people can be overthrown by corrupt governments. A beautiful movie to watch on a sunny day.
