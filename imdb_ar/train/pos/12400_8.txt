This is Animatrix II short, the first of which is what one might call "technician". It contains a lot of references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially with run-time of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human," or trying to direct hatred toward man, because of "their sins against the machine." I do not think that's true; they only use robots to show us that as human beings, we do not accept or open our minds to anyone who is different from ourselves. I would say it does a wonderful job at it. The plot is good ... It plays as a historical document, recounting what led to one of the major conflicts in Trilogy. It therefore carries snippets of fictional news reports and the like. Voice acting is very good, if there is not much of it. The animation is nice, the use of colors, although the painting style is usually realistic, makes it more open to make smooth transitions and other surreal images. This contains several parts of strong violence and disturbing images, as well as a little nudity. The disc contains a comment, not in English but is translated and worth listening / reading. There is also a good and useful manufacture, based on both parts, so I would recommend watching it after seeing the next part as well. I recommend this to anyone who has a Matrix and / or Sci-Fi in general. 10/08
