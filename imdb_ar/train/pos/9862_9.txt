Finally, I got the infamous Ice Age. Apart from maybe not as funny as I wish after seeing a wonderful teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as Disney's production (it's also Fox's first attempt at a full-length CG movie), but it has a huge heart. On some occasions (like Manfred's look after seeing a sad glimpse of his past) I found myself crying. But when the child was reunited with his father, I could no longer keep them. The film has no difficulty walking on a fine line of smoothness and clich√© and can do more than best; the end result is to be one of the most animated creations I have ever seen. Fantastic and funny characters grow fast on you (in addition to great vocal talents) and many of the most ridiculous and memorable scenes, especially Scrat, make the film more than enough reason to give it. In addition to the Dodo scene, which is my favorite and funny scene of 2002. <br /> <br /> I honestly do not understand it, but for some reason it really seems that the CG animation will have the upper hand in the future. But if that just means that there will be more movies like this one (which can forget the Pixar creations) it's really annoying, at least for now. 9/10
