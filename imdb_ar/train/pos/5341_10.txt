CAROL'S JOURNEY is pleased to see many reasons. Representing Clara Lago is simply amazing for a young person, one of the special actors who can say a lot through facial expressions. The filmmaker Emmanuel Orbibi presents a well-judged film with no interruption in continuity, prompting the plot at a steady pace with enough commentary to keep one wondering what the nest scene will achieve. The story of Angel Garcia Roldan tells the story of her story at its best, which seems to be the main goal of the films after all. The plot is unpredictable, yet the events during its detection are quite logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film is the story of the Spanish Civil War because it influenced people. It was a great event in the 20th century, yet Americans hardly know it. In fact, during 40 years of university teaching, I evaluated about one student in a semester he had heard about, and less than anyone who could say anything comprehensive about him - and the sheer number of students was a scholar of merit, all talking to the sheer mass of Censorship in American Education. So, somehow, this film is a good way to start studying for an event, keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled out it may slim a great deal of history. The film's appreciation is therefore directly related to the individual's knowledge. To watch this movie as another film of the age of aging, miss the film altogether. The Left Elbow Index examines seven aspects of cinematography - acting, production groups, character development, conspiracy, dialogue, film continuity, and art - on a scale of 10 very good, 5 average, and 1 for help needs. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above average in all respects, except for dialogue classified as average. The average legal entity IDs for this movie are 9.3, and is raised to 10 when it is equal to the IMDb. I highly recommend this film to all ages.
