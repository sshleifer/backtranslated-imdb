I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it then, and I'm still doing it now. But what I realize now is that this is "quite" for a G-rated film, especially the idea of ​​dying and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work together wonderfully, and the sound of Reynolds singing is appropriate for a small dog. There are some good songs ranging from optimism ("Let's make music together") to the explicit emotional ("home to my heart"). I found the plot good, although it explodes in the shade once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne Marie is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen in an animation. A movie worth the experience.
