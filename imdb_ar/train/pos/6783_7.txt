If you like Othello, you will love this click because half of the film revolves around theatrical production of the play. <br /> <br /> The film has outstanding actors with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as women in Coleman's life while Edmund O'Brien plays the role of Under-Secretary of the Press. <br /> <br /> Some of the supporting players I particularly liked were Millard Mitchell as a distinguished reporter who found Angle and Joe Sawyer, 1940's answer to Laurie Carey, who plays the cop in the case. <br /> <br /> Great moments at this moment with realistic Noir all the time.
