Without Peter Ostinov and Maggie Smith, it could have been so easily Turkey. But it is wonderful. Ustinov at its best, and for fans of Maggie, it is wonderful to see it in its early days, matching to Ustinov every step of the way with timing and timing. For the English in their fifties (and I am in this category), it is always fun to see the sights and sounds of the Swinging Sixties. Although this film spends a lot of time in offices, it has a lot of nostalgia, including red buses, Carnaby Street, Lulu's song, and the delicious little skirt formed a waitress, which England has never seen since in public places. As IT. Engineer, I know that hacking computer tricks are laughable, but not intended to be taken seriously. No great stereotypes of Italians, Frenchmen and Germans.
