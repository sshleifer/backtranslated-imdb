Get ready for her: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I do not know the other works of David Mamet, but after seeing this film half a dozen times (it's always a pleasure to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is very well written, and quickly draws your attention to the middle of the deception, the plastic art, and the hustle of the back room. The movie's feeling is similar to The Sting (1973), and also praises Noir. <br /> <br /> It is a very complex film and will certainly lead you to think about the various transformations and motivations of suspicious characters. Somewhat predictable at times, but its shocking climax is always exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting is great - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone I saw watching the film noticed that it was not a good idea to have a Lindsay Crouse heroine, not just a mascot, smoker, but also a bad hairstyle in the 1980s. I agree, but I think they are nevertheless prominent in this role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this film, the better, just like the newest film Mamet, the Spanish prisoner, because the end will be more impressive. All you have to do is sit down and get ready to take in a dangerously close film of brilliance.
