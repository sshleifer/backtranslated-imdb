I was going to sleep with a guinea pig last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, I turned the channels until I came across this Chinese movie called "The King of Masks". At first I thought it would be a Kung Fu film, so I started watching it, then captured it right away, and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was quite adorable. She was a great actress because she was very few. The truth may have been in Chinese, so dubbed English makes it hard for me to tell you ... but it really looked like a great person. I felt very bad for the girl because she continued to try to please her "boss" but everything just ended. Haha. Even when another grandson attended him, only to be able to transfer his art ... It turned out that the child had been kidnapped, so he was arrested and had 5 days to live. Lol ... Everything you touch in trying to be nice to her grandfather, is just counterproductive. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much he loves her and teaches her the art of masks ... which is just sadness after all the incidents in the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely a gem, and absolutely innovative. <br /> <br /> Scott
