Since this was one of my favorite novels, I was very excited to see this move. I was not disappointed! Yes of course there are some things I can choose, but I think the film stuck to the book, and it was a really good film. Steven King's films often seem to get a bad review, but this is one of the good films. It's a dark story, I think I like it ... and what is better than the dead who come to life .. and something about the animals coming from the grave is very creepy. If you have watched the movie do it yourself for a great repair and now read the book !! It was a well written play. It was possible for the actors to do a better job (I say this only to Rachel, and Elly was very sleepy). I loved everyone very much and most importantly for me.
