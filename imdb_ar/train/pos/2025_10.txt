The Tantant of WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools, libraries and people's living rooms. It is a wonderful story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism, a devastating marriage and mothers fighting to keep her son away from her brutal husband. It's both the stories of the day that we see and hear and I think people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on the real possible experiences that the author brought back in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, a wonderful version of the book and very touching. I'm sure Anne herself was happy with the way she was produced. <br /> <br /> Great and excellent locations.
