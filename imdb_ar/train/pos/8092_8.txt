This film happened when I was 8 to 10 years old on a cold November afternoon. I played all day and froze, and when I came around 4 pm, I took a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not all happy and ridiculous - and was really dark and moral. I captured my imagination. I'm sure it misses the text and is abbreviated at all the wrong places for the Tolkien Cellulose. But it still embodies the spirit of the story, choosing to bear the burden for others, selfish consequences, reckless decisions, and so forth. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaint. But the only place where this film clearly rises above the new films is the acoustic properties. John Hurt is great at this. If you do not like the way your character is drawn, look away and just listen to it. His voice is unusual. I have seen it again several times and always bring me back to that time, as a child, hungry for some magical adventure. That's why I say "lucky", the movie nostalgia for me so I overlooked its shortcomings. But between John Hurt and the imagination of Tolkien, he was still reaching me and still doing.
