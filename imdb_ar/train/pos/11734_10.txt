This should be one of my favorite clicks, unlike the weak Elvira's Haunted Hills ... Anyway, I like the way the film represents the story of the "Wizard of Oz" Goth / Com ... <br /> <br /> Elvira is Dorothy the gothic stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of the good witch (Elviras Aunt Morgana) ... She inherits the very powerful "Robbie" episode sought by Bad and Roluk (her uncle). Friendship Four characters help her inadvertently grow throughout the movie with a dog. There is a show down with her uncle (Wicked West Witch) where Elvira realizes that she has the power inside her and ends up defeating him. In the end, she was driven out by cities after winning their hearts and finally arriving at her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy House in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to an ocher magician throughout the film ... She and her uncle are quoting lines related to their parallel personalities. Elvira: "You must be Em aunt, you must be uncle Remus .... There is no place like home, there is no place like home!" Uncle Finney: "I'll get you pretty, and your little dog too!" <br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira is going through her first trip on the road to Kansas. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, the fact that one of the sequences that "separated from her, mother ... I mean was inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius ... and if you do not spin around her laugh on her spin At the end of her in the Las Vegas "Very Eighties" show then you do not have a bone in the camp in your body ... This movie is a cult / classic camp
