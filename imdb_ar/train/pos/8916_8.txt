Certainly the first film scared me to death. I met him when my older brother (r.i.p) watched him. It was on a black and white TV and not a really good picture, but it intrigued me. Shortly afterwards, my family bought a collection of colors, and as luck would have it, the $ 1 million movie was on Sunday. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up ... and I got so scared I had trouble sleeping that night! I mean definitely it was just a movie but it included a creature that came not only from space, but you could not hear it or see it. So far, after all this time still sends a jerk of the spine. Classic real, even the best classic I've seen scare pants from a new generation! <br /> <br /> The Blob lived!
