Henry Hathaway was bold, as well as enthusiastic, for his love for the people of the early days of US history. However, it is not necessary or useful in commenting on this film to criticize the historical accuracy of his film about Brigham Young and the people of Mormon. In my opinion, Hathaway gave a remarkable direction to convey the Mormons in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the period of time that began with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the date of the film's release. More often than not, he was a filmmaker and a screenwriter, covering Mormon philosophies and teachings in many sectors and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie many Saturday morning during my youth in the early 1950s. It was just over a decade after the movies were released and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, I watched it being built and planted a more curious wonder about who was the Mormon. I bought this movie recently and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway explained in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. Love for the needy or not, 3. Family is of great importance, 4. Listen with respect and care, because even conflicting messages have important points to be considered and adopted 5. Work hard, both individually and in society, 6. Prepare and store for future need days, 7. Hope is a binding link to a higher organism and our daily lives 8. Because there is a unique quality for any group, we appreciate those that have been identified as useful.
