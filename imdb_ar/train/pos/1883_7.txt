An excellent comedy starring Dudley Moore with the support of Lisa Menelli and John Gilgod, who speaks English. Moore was Arthur, a man who belonged to the millionaire family and was about to receive $ 750 million provided he married a lady (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur agreed to the terms, but finally refused when he met Linda Marula, Minelli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed drinking hard and enjoying the prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan a few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy Linda and Arthur, although the latter knew that his life would change in the near future. This comedy is a good lesson for anyone's life. Wealthy people are not usually happy with their lifestyle.
