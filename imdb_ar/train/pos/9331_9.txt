This movie was shown last week, and although it was at that time of the day (around 6pm), the quality of the movies was almost good (at least here on Mexican TV), I could not turn off the TV. The story of Madeleine Moore is really stuck. She does not initially appear as a very sympathetic character at first, but when you see the whole movie, you just want to succeed. This film makes you really think. I think that is mainly due to the great representation of Brooke Johnson. I had never heard of it before and I did not see it in another film, but it was a great job. Greetings Brooke. I hope to see her in another film soon.
