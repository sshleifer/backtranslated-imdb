Although I was in this film playing Sherif Hodges, he managed to make me jump in several places and believe me that I was not that easy. You might say I'm biased to the film, and I'm okay, but I did not see the final product until 12/27/2006 and I was very happy. I'm not a fan of the horror film, but I love old movies "B" and black and white science fiction movies. This film will make you "believe" that you know when something will happen, then it does not happen, then it happens. It will keep you completely balance. I would suggest watching the movie first then the director's notes and special features. It is well written, directed and illustrated and I can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this staff. I sincerely hope to be part of the future Brian and Lawrence projects.
