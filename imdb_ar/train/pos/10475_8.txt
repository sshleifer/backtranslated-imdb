My friend recommended this film, citing similarities with Des Hall, the main character in the film. I think to a certain extent that I can see it and maybe a little more, I'm not sure whether this is an attractive image or not. <br /> <br /> This is a unique work, it's the only movie that you can have this more than a close look similar would be true romance, not for content or style photography or for fast dialogue (whale music is much more, well, relaxed .) But instead they represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians (for example, I highly recommend the Hard Core logo) and this particular film. He has innocent charm, Des is not always the most admired person, but there is something that draws attention to him.
