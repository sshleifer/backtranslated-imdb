This film has a special way of telling the story. At first, I found it quite strange because it jumped through time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the storyline was simple, but it is still very simple and real touching. I met someone the first time, fell in love completely, but finally exploded and promoted to fatal pain. Who did not go through this? But we will not forget the kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that I am impressed that the actors have shown a wonderful performance in showing love among characters. I hope the story is a happy ending.
