I watched this movie about a week ago and I'm still thinking about it. I was very impressed by this film. I found characters very beloved and almost loved because of a mistake. As in real life, although sometimes people are disappointed, as was the case with Leo, who although I loved his character, I was not even more disappointed when he was ready to have unprotected sex despite being aware of it The full status of HIV infection. She was also disappointed with Liu's refusal to give him medicine and the terrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him home on the train. I think this film has really shown why HIV numbers are high among gay youth. This does not mean by any means beating gay (I'm gay) and it was possible to have a good film about a straight guy making bad choices and seem unaware of the consequences of himself and others. The only part of the film that I could not understand was why the gay family did not want to include Marcel in Liu's illness to the extent that he was not allowed to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message from this film is that whether gay or straight people do not have unprotected sex!
