Adam Jones has a wonderful sense of humor. There is nothing I did not like about this film. Cross Id was shot. Adam does a great job, not only in the development of the main characters, but also in the secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every low-budget film there. You do not have to spend much to create something worth seeing. There's something you like about everyone. If you have a roommate is terrible. If you have ever taken a ham in high school. If you are parked anywhere in the city. If you have any kind of humor at all, you'll love this movie. This is the type of film that will be shown for a long time and ends up again once Adam makes a bigger name for him. I look forward to Adam's future projects.
