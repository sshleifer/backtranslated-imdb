Okay. Who brought the cheese. love it. During its operation became a phenomenon. Anorexic Twins became commonplace. Bob Saget started making a check (instead of his funny attitude). People knew who Dave Coulier was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was a humor and always brought home a good lesson. This is where I disagree: I've loved the past few seasons. Like home improvement, when children grow up, there is a lot that you can do with the script. That's why I dare say ... it could have been too late for what happened. But anyway. I gave it 8/10 because of the healthy and funny storylines and because of Bob Sagitt!
