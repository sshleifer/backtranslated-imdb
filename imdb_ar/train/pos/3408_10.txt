I give this movie A + to the huge camp of it! As Maria Riva, the daughter of Dietrich, wrote in her book about her mother, "If one sees God's garden in the context of a high camp, it may be very amusing." And how! I gladly laughed at the excessive result and the amazing dialogue is ironic, ridiculously, fantastically. Viewers who have read novels of Pu'er's wig (which have been parked in the air) will mock each time they appear. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boer rarely look at each other as they give their lines - instead, they stare far away, and their faces are supposed to be photographed in the best corner and in the best light (if you're in Turkey you might look good! ). Dietrich's out of this world. As Riva noted in her book, Dietrich was able to steal Travis Pantone from Paramount and make him design some of the divine gowns, such as the dress and beige chiffon. <br /> <br /> I strongly agree with other reviewers who rave about Technicolor. It's really hard to believe that the film was made in 1936 - the color is wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, if you see God's garden with a relaxed attitude and embrace it brilliantly, you can not. Help but enjoy it.
