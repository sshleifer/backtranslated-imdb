I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a special program. However, paying daisies is my exception. She became curious about the program of commercials that broadcast and gave a glimpse of the exhibition hypothesis. I was skeptical at first, especially after the Six Feet Under. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third episodes and all the other episodes. Wonderful! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a palatable way without getting tired. The characters were attractive, I like Ned's main personal idea that you can not touch the love of his life literally, Chuck without the consequences of her death. <br /> <br /> Most characters have a longing for things they can not own. Along with Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Lund. Laila and Vivian look to their niece Chuck and Emerson and are always eager to get financial rewards for their mysterious deaths. I think the characters are perfect and believable. I love the way Emerson plays black from the rest of the characters since he was an African American; I like the nice cultural humor that comes from him sometimes. <br /> <br /> In general, these visual fairy tales are one of the most valuable entertainment elements I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romanticism for the romans and enough for those who have done the mystery. I hope that the book will return to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.
