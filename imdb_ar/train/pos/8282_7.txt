** Potential spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie that does not work is Wendigo, and when the character of your title fails, your film is usually far from it. The filmgoers' explanation of the Wendigo model is interesting, and can be properly threatened when properly photographed - when Wendigo's fugitive killer sees a flash in his own rearview mirror - for example - the shape of the tree was very good. However, as a monster figure it does not really come into life. We did not get much explanation for her behavior, and what we do not see from him does not merge with the story that is narrated in the film itself, or any traditions in Wendigo have ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons for the monster's failure is that it has not been given enough to do, in the film. When this movie boils up its bones, what you have is a suspense movie with a slightly supernatural element, rather than a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is good, although a little cheesy; filmmakers use landscapes, lighting and time of day to express the mood and mood well. Characterized by Otis's character is truly dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster in the film. May be more effective in explaining his behavior because he has the hungry spirit of Wendigo, who will also be a more accurate representation of the true legend. <br /> <br /> I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason why Wendigo did not work so much is that when the monster suit was designed, it ended up being heavy and uncomfortable (in order to imitate his standing position) On the hooves of the carnation, the walker had to walk on his toes (it was almost impossible to jog or walk or perform in another way. Thus, many of the creature's flashes still remain, and the obvious clear shots are turned on. I confirm that these reports are uncertain.
