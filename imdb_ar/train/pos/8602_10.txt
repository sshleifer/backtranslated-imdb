One would say that, with regard to Nathaniel Hawthorne, his failures were more interesting than his successes. I think the observation itself can suit the Eddie McDonald photos. Especially this one. <br /> <br /> It seems to have many characteristics of a failed film: it's an audio file, and the script, because of censorship, seems inconsistent? However, this film also gets some good points: Rodgers-Hart's good music ("Taka tira la"), good acting with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you do not like it, you will not forget it. This strange film actually leaves a strong and dreamlike impression, and is very likely to consider it for days, perhaps weeks. why? In the 1930s and early 1940s, movies did not have the same meaning as today: they aimed, like the dream, to transform the audience in order to make it forget a difficult reality.

To watch it, as if you were watching a dream.
