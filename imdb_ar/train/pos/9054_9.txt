"October Sky" is a film that steals your heart, fills your mind with vivid images, and elevates your soul. The story of Homer Hickam and his dream of producing a very simple missile at first, especially when the film is placed in a mining town, where the future is as clear as coal blocks in the mine. But Homer can not follow in his father's footsteps. Encouraged by Miss Riley, (a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff, and his friends, Homer tries to turn his dream into reality. <br /> <br /> But as with any life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston leads us to the coal mines, where we witness the chilling plight of the miners swerving under the roof of the rocks. With lighted helmets and bent posture, they resemble insecticides more exotic than humans in the dark. The miners' coughs and blackened faces have always been a reminder of the danger that miners face in their work. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the burden of a mine shaft, Homer's pictures appear and his friend's rocket launches. Under the blue sky bowl, the rockets are placed on a platform and launched into the stratosphere ... Nothing can match the scene when Homer Sputnik sees the first time. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film so granular is the relationship between characters. Homer's father is a hardened classic man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite many arguments. Love and support of Miss Riley is also clear. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. Do not tie everything in the beautiful bow. It's tears on you, flying you. It maintains an atmosphere of reality, which is important in such a film. <br /> <br /> This movie can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue in Homer's life. I did not want to end. Then I realized ... this is what a good movie does for a person. If you have done it, you will not want it to end. And "October Sky" achieves it.
