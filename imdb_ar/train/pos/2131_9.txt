This movie improves every time I see it. There are lots of minute presentations in this. William Tracy, like Pepi, is a joy, a source of acute comic satisfaction. Joseph Childcrot in the role of Vadas, is the only "villain" in the film, and uses his oily charm well here. Frank Morgan, happy as the title store owner, Mr. Matushik, is using his well-known style here. I particularly liked the performance of Felix Presart, like Perovic. Both lists can be equally authentic in every aspect of their role. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Margaret Sullivan performs a wonderful mission to portray a woman who is a little desperate, nervous, attractive and attractive. <br /> This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The film is presented from his point of view, with the action revolving around him. Mr. Stewart is a much more important film to carry, with stunning performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is dismissed from his job, because of misunderstanding. It is capable of conveying the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment caused by this very painful event. In my estimation, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest cinematic actor in the history of the Middle. No one else has ever been filmed in a film capable of conveying what he feels to the public. At the time he made this film, he still had most of his career, yet he was the master of his career. This is one of the best Jimmy Stewarts movies, and also one of the nicest romantic comics you'll find. I highly recommend this film, especially to those who appreciate Stuart's work.
