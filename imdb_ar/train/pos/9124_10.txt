Prevent some of the dubious acting (there are musicians at the end of the day), and this in the lyrics of Quentin Tarenino is "the best rock movie ever ... period" <br /> <br /> I think 8 miles, but without rap - A young musician, trying to set himself up in front of the local community, struggling to overcome a broken house and a rival band. Thanks to sex and truly exceptional performance, this is the true 8 miles. <br /> <br /> Prince has a strong performance, as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Decent scenario, good direction, fantastic plot, amazing performances. We will not forget some of the best rock / pop / funk music that you will ever hear.
