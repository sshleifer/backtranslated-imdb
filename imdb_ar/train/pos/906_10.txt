VIVAH in my best film of 2006! interval! It's in my book one of the top 100 films made in Bollywood. Sadly this film does not contain many reviews and is not very popular. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a real achievement for the director who does it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj has retreated again from the magnificent VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest of nice films I have seen this year. After seeing Don 2 who was CRAP and later Dhoom 2 who beat up Don on this, I finally saw a movie very close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from our beautiful culture and making remodeled Hollywood movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and very much related to the Indian system of arranged marriage, which I would also like to be part of. Our system that teaches us to obey elders, to follow them, and of course to obey their ideas is brilliantly featured in this film! Of course there is no power in choosing your partner, it must be a brief meeting between the couple and it is up to them to determine what appears in this film brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie ..... VIVAH is the story of a journey between the engagement period and the beautiful marriage. The stage where the man meets the girl! They both understand each other. They both try to assess whether they can love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the different that happens during marriage. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is wonderful in the film ....... Shahid is fine ..... Awak Nath and Anoopam are fantastic !! The songs are wonderful. ! I particularly love HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> In general, I must see anyone who still believes in Indian culture and traditions, and I certainly do! <br /> <br /> Go to watch this movie ...... I have to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
