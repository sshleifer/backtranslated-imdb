When looking at some negative publications, you really have to wonder what some people are doing for fun .... <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to watch the movie during its very short play. The audience laughed their heads off. I watch a tape of him writing and still laughing! <br /> <br /> It also has a beautiful appearance, with unexpected reflections of real blades. The late and effective Royal Dano is particularly effective, such as the farmer and Rennes Muloller, the only one to survive. Arianna Richards and Jr. Anderson is as big as lead children. The actors dressed in Mars suits, although limited to silent acting, do a great job. <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for is background details. The film is full of festivities, pastiches, and references to SF films and other imaginations. Take a look at Mars costumes next time. One wearing Marty McFly, another wearing a Ghostbuster, the third dressed as House Atreides, and the fourth wearing a Last Starfighter suit.
