I think many people rated the film, not because of lack of quality. But did not follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some conflicts have not been resolved. The end is just something very real for others, but the journey offered by rich characters and long list of supporters is very exciting and enjoyable. Even cinematography is excellent given the urban environment, and the output is excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is 10 in my book, this movie will take you to places where normal and expected Hollywood text will not appear. They took some risks and did some different things. I think it worked well, I deliberately try to avoid any direct references to the film because seeing it for yourself is the best answer, not accepting someone else's explanation.
