I never heard this film two weeks ago, but its concept aroused my interest when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and spends the night talking. That interested me, but I never expected this to be great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, it is also one of the most romantic films that have been recorded. To my surprise, he was completely lacking in irony from the 1990s. It's impossible to talk a lot about it, because there's no real conspiracy, so to speak (although there are a lot of interesting things you can talk about, it's kind of like My Dinner With Andre, where there's a conversation, but it's not important Only conversation), but let me just say, see. You see it!
