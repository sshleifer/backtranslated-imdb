When I read this drama plot for the first time I assumed it would be like sex and the city, but this drama is not like it. Stories of characters seem more realistic and you are more sympathetic to positions. The concept of drama is similar, where four women guide us through friendships and relationships with problems and conflict along the way. Katie the GP is a dark and sad character who finds it difficult to connect with her and is the best friend with Trudi Widow. Trudy's character is very warm as you can relate to her difficulties with the fact that she is the only mother of four. Jessica is a very single party girl and she knows what she wants and how she gets it. She is a beloved figure, the closest to Siopphan, who recently married, while the love of her husband completely can not help her eyes wandering around with her co-worker. In all the drama is amazingly addictive, if the BBC continued to produce a series can do well. It is unlike other female dramas such as sex and the city, or desperate housewives. This if played right can be cold feet coming. In addition to male cast is not bad on the eyes too.
