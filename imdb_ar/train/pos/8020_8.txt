I found that this movie is Muppets most enjoyable film, because I felt that it was the most lukewarm and has the best comic delivery on most of its lines. Muppets tries to enter Broadway to sell an original piece they wrote, but along the way, they encountered the usual problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. Although there are not a large number of large copies here as in the original Muppets Movie, there are some, including Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply timing and delivering a lot of fabulous fonts, situations in which Muppets finds themselves in. Original songs are also good here, the end is satisfactory. There is nothing else we can say about the film, but Muppet fans must definitely see it. It is the most important part of Muppet and it will certainly be enjoyed by everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
