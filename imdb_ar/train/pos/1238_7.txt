While this film has many flaws, it is actually an interesting film in the eighties. Eddie Murphy reaches the top of his 80s here. Although his character is indistinguishable from previous films, his timing is almost flawless with ideal partners and chips. <br /> <br /> This is coupled with the charming beauty of Charlotte Lewis, making a fun and lively comedy bout. <br /> <br />
