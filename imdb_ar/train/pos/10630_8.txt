I think it is unfortunate that the leading comments on this film include the words "nonsense". I think it is a very funny movie and an excellent entertainment. One must comment that one does not believe that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman may fall in love, have a child and live together with lasting happiness. But it is always wonderful to see it being played in a movie and in which one's heart is warm. is that impossible? There are more improbable events described in other films. Good representation, funny text. The only negative comment is that the story may have been over when the family is discharged from its initial home rather than the extension to explore whether the man keeps any remaining gay.
