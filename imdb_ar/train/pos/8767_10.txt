I saw this movie lucky, just because I passed through a stage where I felt a new admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all his recent films thank God I did! This movie has been suspended with me ever since and remains my favorite! The story revolves around two girls embarking on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend time together before going to college but their journey ended a more complicated story. The struggle they are waging during their detention in Thailand and have become prisoners is very influential and intense. Exquisite acting, extraordinary photos, fantastic soundtracks and perfectly suited for film and highly movable message. I can not even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know some people did not appreciate my appreciation for the film, but swear, this, you should see !!! I promise she will stick with you!
