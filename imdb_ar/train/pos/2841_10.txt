As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I love you with very great expectations. I came out with all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The film begins with two cab mills (Bradley Cooper and Justin Barthe) trying to reach the same area but arguing about how to go. It was so funny, and then the film goes to some of the best actresses I've ever seen. There were four amazing ones among all that good. These four I will start talking about. One shows the Shia LaBeouf as a gift shop in a hotel that finds love in an old lady. The next stage features Orlando Bloom as a music producer dealing with a woman played by Christina Ricci. There is another film featuring Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirble as two people going to a concert, where the Thirble character is impeded. One of the best features is Elie Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an old couple of bickering. You will notice that Nataile Portman is directing the first impressive directing output, writing a comedic about the supervisor, Ethan Hawk and Maggie Q as excellent as a flirting man. New York, I definitely love you good, if not better than Paris Je'Taime 2006. Comics are good, and the film shows how independent films should really be. However, there are no famous directors such as Paris Je'Taime in the film, which is why it was great to live up to excellence. If you want to laugh, I will look for some wonderful dramatic effects, and I have seen a great deal of wonderful performances, simply enjoyed, then definitely go to New York, I love you.
