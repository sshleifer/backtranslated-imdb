A typical flirtation through the reality of Cheech and Chong that includes drugs, vocals, more drugs, cars, driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, comedy stand up, more drugs and SPACE COKE !! It's not as coherent or reasonable as Up in Smoke but it's still incredibly funny, without becoming as weird as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and driving to work. Also funny song Cheech (Mexican American) and song follow Chung. Another prominent sight is the Welfare Office scene with Jones (Human Noise Machine), from the Police Academy series, and the old Laughing Man. All in all, this is a great follow-up to Up in Smoke and it's fully viewable when it's realistic or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
