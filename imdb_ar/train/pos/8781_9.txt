I consider myself a bit of boxing tasting, so there is one thing that prevents me from describing Gentleman Jim as the best boxing film ever made. This is Robert Wise / Paul Newman flick "Someone there loves me." This movie may be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a nearby number 2. <br /> <br /> The film not only tells the appearance of James J. Corbett, but also shows boxing at the critical time of transition. In the late nineteenth century, boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare joints rules to the more "cute" days of the Marquis Queensberry gloves. Sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal scene and a time of acceptance and respect. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look in those days. It is romantic, and yes, even a little hokey at times. But always walked that way. Errol Flynn is ideal, like Jim Gentleman, who is not really a "gentleman" at all but just a quick speaker from a working-class family. Alexis Smith is quite charming as a top-class woman with whom he has a love / hate relationship (and we all know that this, of course, is the love that will win that match in the end). <br /> <br /> At the end of the great "Gentleman Jim" John L. Sullivan (who was not his famous line "I can lick any man in the world" of course ... romantic again) delivers his belt to Corbett. It's really one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism watch "Raging Bull" instead. This is a more realistic boxing movie. But Jim Gentleman is more fun.
