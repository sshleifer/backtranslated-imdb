Shakespeare's plays have a way to transcend time. Language breaks the time barrier one way or another. But perhaps it was the actors who really did it. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (the release with Claire Danis and Leonardo DiCaprio), he was reluctant to deliver another to Shakespeare. To my surprise Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character has played well by fellow Kenneth! Although Iago is a mean evil villain, she has played the character so well that she does what Shakespeare intended to be a charater, a pleasure that the public hates. I must say that the performance of Fishbourne here was also good. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book) alike.
