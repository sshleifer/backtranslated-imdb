I felt compelled to write a review of Space Cobra where I got a good score of 7.3 stars, but a few reviews at the time of writing were particularly positive. Strange situation and hope to draw my positive assessment of people towards the film "anime" old and often forgotten. Cobra space is an unconventional tale of smugglers and marquees who get involved with the three sisters of an old planet, a killer and an evil force that wants to exploit the powers of planets. It's an old film and animation, but what it lacks in modern style makes up for a lot of magic. Space Cobra is designed for the Western audience and is easy to see. There are few references to a certain Japanese culture, which is great for watching anime beginners and enjoying them. Space Cobra himself is adept and lovable. I can not quantify this because of the English dubbing or the intentions of the filmmaker, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The elegance of the Brillish sixties with wonderful music from Yello. Colorful and iconic style There is a constant movement to move the story. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it starts as a comedy and ends in a very exciting note. I can not think of another anime film or a general film that was able to do it smoothly and impressively. You hardly realize it's happening, but it's done with skill and it seems quite natural. You also really feel that the characters have gone on a journey and that their lives have changed because of the whole experience. Check whether you can.
