This is not "so bad that it's good", it's quite good! For those who do not understand the reason, you have a four year old mind (in response to a particular comment ...) Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a spoof for itself, spoofing you, spoof me. This is the most ingenious text in cinematic history. I have a third generation sitting on my DVD shelf next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything that you or I call a standard. I write scripts and this film alone opened a kind of comedy for me, which we have never seen before. It can only be taken in parts ... its exploitative kind ... Now I'm just trying to eat a minimum of ten lines. My comment ended a while ago. We hope it works when it is submitted now.
