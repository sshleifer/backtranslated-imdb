The subsequent chapters of this original series were less than faint. The last seasons have contributed to a three-year ministerial reshuffle of short life. Perhaps if the plug was withdrawn after the first season he would have acquired the following cult. <br /> <br /> Besides, the first season was really Farhana! Intelligent, intelligent with brilliant writing was promising. The excellent drink for the first season contains the right elements - characters / actors, story etc. In addition to the comedy about the original paparazzi reporter had a boot. Nora and her colleagues are "photographers" in the fight, night after night, day after day for the Latrun. <br /> <br /> A lot of things are meaningless to me. Such as how this show, and other virtue of mine - Gross Point "did not make it." If the first chapters of abstract truth are released, and Grosse Pointe on DVD, please tell anyone about it?!
