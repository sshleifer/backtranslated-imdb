A great movie to watch with amazing sights and talented actors, such as Mesa Shimizu and Naiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, close your eyes on the screen and do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the film waiting for what fate will bring to the characters. This film makes you leave your position as a standard audience, takes you, and makes you part of the story ... The costumes and settings are wonderful; especially built in the Okiyas area with skill. She is certainly not Akira Kurosawa, yet she still gets a lot of teacher, especially as the story tells us that we are in the land of the cinema that is far from the rhythm of Hollywood.
