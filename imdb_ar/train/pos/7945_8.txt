I'm a fan of animal movies. If you can take a conspiracy and put animals as key actors, you will usually win me. I did this bond bondage only. They took an old-time conspiracy and put a new role on it. It was a complete success. It is a very typical film. You have an obi-wan of group (shadow) who is wise and logical, you have a lovable but impulsive and unreliable opportunity, and Princess Percy who thinks it should be pampered and praise. These three characters bounce off each other very well. I also like the way they made Chances and Sassi dynamic characters, and they did not delay it. Most people say it can not be good because it is a lot of children's movies. But what they forget is that it is supposed to be a children's film, but this is still far from the actual film. It's a good movie to watch when you're bored and just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without cartoons, an air bud film with a better plot. Without a doubt, I advise you to watch it.
