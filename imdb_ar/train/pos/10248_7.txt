I first heard about this movie after buying a 1976 "snuff flick". I was told that Devil's experience was much better, of course, and I applied for Box Pig Guinea. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had tried to ban this film or the second film, so I got my peak. <br /> <br /> The Devils experience is a short film with no story, no evolution of characters. . Only 3 men torture a woman for 45 minutes. They torture her in a number of ways, such as beating her, circling them repeatedly, forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to a 24-hour loud noise, smashing her hand with a hammer, burning and burning, Her eyes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that much of this film was fake, such as beating scenes. But then, some of them were actually good in regards to yours. The scenes around the woman were in circles that made me feel dizzy when I saw them. Or that the scene that is forced to listen to loud noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye sight. I did not close when watching it but I simply thought "Damn, look good for such a low-budget movie." I enjoyed the dust but I do not know if I can really recommend this unless I have seen most of what this kind of horror offers. 10/07
