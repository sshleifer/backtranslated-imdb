Stephen King may have adapted so far. Not surprisingly, because the king himself wrote the script. The story follows the Kreid family, which moves to the home of Min Gemayel. Another resident is Jud, a nice old man who knows some things about the area. One is the highway that runs directly through their forehead. The other is the road leading to Sem Petary, where children were buried for the decades of animals killed on the highway. Soon after, the cat was found by Elie Creed, the church, dead. Fortunately, this happens when the family, except for Lewis (father), is away from Thanksgiving. Judes moves Lewis to another land for burial, beyond Sematary, where the church is later buried, and Louis is greeted (not politely) by the church. He returned, apparently chewing his way from the bag where he was buried. He may have been buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without spoiling the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the king adaptations I have seen, it will be the most frightening. The characters are real and the attitudes are normal. Mary Lambert is doing a great job directing the proceedings. The suspense is maintained fairly high throughout the film, partly due to the development of the plot. The scene where Gage was killed will remain in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have a conclusion. It's easy to say what's going to happen, but Lambert comes out with some really scary, sometimes disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good movie and excellent compatibility. If you're terrified and do not mind disturbing some of the disturbing images sometimes, "Pet Sematary" is what you're looking for. Non-horror fans will want to avoid this.
