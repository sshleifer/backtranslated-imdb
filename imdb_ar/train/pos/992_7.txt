I had no expectations; I never heard of Jimmy Fox. All I know is that the film has strong personal actors in it. I thought it was very amusing. It was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my attention. For me, Fox is the original. David Morse is wonderful (true, this is not his best role). I thought the chase and the fireworks contributed to the film and well done. I did not expect much and was pleasantly surprised.
