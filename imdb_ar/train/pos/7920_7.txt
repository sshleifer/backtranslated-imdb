Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Rose Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is a regular high school guy. Get ready for a big homecoming, problem-friendly and growing hair in exotic places? You know the usual. But hair in exotic places goes out of control a little when he leaves him on a journey to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) with a sinister case of fur balls. Now she is doomed to walk the world forever as a starving young man. How will Adam get any girls? <br /> <br /> There is no talk of "Full Moon High", but it is a parody and horror. Larry Cohen (Q-The Wing Cervent, The Stave) has as many masks as he can come as a writer / director. After 20 years, Arkin (H20: Halloween) has a nice time in the leading role. If you're a fan of parody like "plane" and "student bodies", I think you'll enjoy a chuckle.
