I do not think anyone along with Terence Malek and maybe Tran Anhong makes the cinema at a cleaner level than Claire Dennis. Having said that, I do not like this, her latest movies, just like her 2001 "Trouble Everyday" (although she's getting too close), which itself is one of my absolute favorite movies. It's just because the narration here may be a bit elliptical because it's good. Make no mistake, the fact that this film has absolutely no plot at all is really one of the best things on the subject, but I think Dennis took it a little more than it needed, so the film flirts with incomprehension, (Such as the main character going to South Korea to undergo a heart transplant, instead of suddenly showing it without any explanation of where he or she is). Some other characters seemed unnecessary as if they were just excuses for Dennis to use the actors they like again (the Beatrice Daly character in particular is slightly distracting because you continue to expect it to be of some importance). However, the film is incredibly accommodating and the cinema is beyond amazing. It is definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Dennis "the famous Beau travail", if not the best. Claire Denis should be the French managers of choice at this stage, better than Leos Carax. I have to admit that the South Korean sequence actually does "lost in translation" better than that film itself (and I, unlike some, I admire this film as well).
