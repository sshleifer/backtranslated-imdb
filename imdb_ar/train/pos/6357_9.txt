I found this a small film and a treat for young children, which is actually more directed to adults with lots of jokes and humor that they only understand. Some things are not suitable for children, but only a few. Otherwise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) encounters a lot of jokes that you can not keep up with, from sexual to cultural to Hollywood and even ethnic. <br /> <br /> The movie is rich in color and looks great on DVD. The little girl here, "Cindy Lo Ho" (Taylor Momsen) is really nice and fashion and the little kids' convictions here are fun. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also gratifying, so this novel increases the level of the film. Its fun to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the theater, although it was "fair", but on DVD, it was much better. I've seen three times and improved each time.
