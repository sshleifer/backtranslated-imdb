"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare In Love, Deo) has nothing to do except painting, going with her friends in a wagon up and down, saying hello to people in town and trying to make everyone know her. I think there were no movies and no television in those days, and the girls had nothing but gossip. I wish I had read a little more. I love Gwyneth, and I think she is a beautiful young woman. She is gifted, and in Emma, ​​the person has the privilege of hearing Gwyneth sing. I look forward to seeing "Duo", where she is supposed to sing. She is brave enough to speak British English with all of these original Britons, including Emma Thomson's sister, Miss Bates Sophie Thompson (four weddings and a funeral, a dance in Lugansk). "Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Trulli, Madley Debley) was one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American Kings of the film, being only the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elswire) and Tony the winner of the Blyth Danner Award ). She hopes to be present for a real long time. Lucky us! I love Emma and I recommend too. It is one of those old stories that are still accurate in those days. Favorite scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I especially like it when you sing a duet. Favorite quotations: Mr. Knightley: "Emma, ​​did not ask me to contribute to the mystery." Emma: "Your whole character is a mystery, Mr. Knightley." I thought you were qualified. " Miss Bates: "She left us speechless, and I say it completely, and we have not stopped talking about it ever since."
