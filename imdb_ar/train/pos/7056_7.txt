Reminded me to complement the famous Cinderella story at all with what they did with one of the films Beauty & the Beast. It's basically three short stories built into 1. <br /> <br /> Well, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! It's so cute!) And Lucifer is fabulous (as usual). I liked some of the newer characters too (Boom Boom was great and I liked Prudence). However, the story was a bit limited, but still very nice. So, I vote 7/10.
