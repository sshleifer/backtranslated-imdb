The last chapter of the Hanzo Razor Trio provides an appropriate closure for this amusing series of samurai. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel and Manji) in the manager's chair, but the style is very similar, perhaps because of Shintaro Katsu's production, regardless of the antidotes. <br /> <br /> Hanso reveals the female ghost that guards the hidden treasure at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he is not late for the fact that she is a ghost, so he begins to rape ... important, interrogated, using the fashionable rotor network device now. The plot takes a series of blind monks who also double their role as loans, corrupt officials, illegitimate wives, breach and necessary reduction. The top Hanzo officer, Onishi, and Abdo, offers typical comic notes, and generally, business as usual. <br /> <br /> Less markedly complex and easier to follow from the first (which spreads everywhere) and a bit of chaos), less elegant, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the best in the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthy On the basis of their own merits. With the completion of the training sequence on brands, forced rape, sword fencing, and the mystery required of Hanzo to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy fans.
