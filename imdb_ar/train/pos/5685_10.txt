Glory to the director and cast for such a realistic film. The courage and the lack of magic and despair brought me to the film and kept me there. I was really impressed with how the dates and information were conveyed in the film: newspapers, letters, etc. I kept the film going fast and did not feel the need to progress quickly once. Personally, I thought all the principles did a great job ... It was great to see Bosworth and Kudro in such difficult roles. He made me want to cry sometimes. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... His performance of this kind usually leaves me in awe. Overall, this is a wonderful movie not to be missed!
