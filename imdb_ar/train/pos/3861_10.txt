2 words: Academy Award. Said Nave. This film was everything in it. Comedy makes me laugh, drama makes me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to compete Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The top representation was the tip of any independent film. Jeremy Earl was at his best for a long time since his appearance in Joan Kozak's program. His lines were accurately executed dynamite and wit I felt the last time in Jimmy Walker too young. I thought I saw the appearance of the young Denzel Washington next when it was the line "my bus !! it was .... gone" that was the real turning point for the film. I loved my grandmother so much that I bought her a DVD and recommended it to her friends. You will bring tears to your eyes and warmth in your heart as you see Tony Donato White and American Bonds Nathan Davis. Through thick (he is held at knife point) and thin (Nathan gives Tony advice about women), the new dynamic duo arrived and emerged from the invasion of Hollywood.
