Prix ​​de Beauté made the cusp of a shift from silence to sound, which came a little late in Europe from Hollywood. Originally filmed as silent, it was released by a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress talking about Louise Brooks lines, but was silently cast in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky enough to see the new, flawless Cineteca di Bologna, a silent Italian edition of the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen talkie yet, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is more pleasing, since all the diplomas are done poorly (Louise Brooks speaks clearly about English, so her lips can not be easy to match.) Also, Fully in silent mode, with little titles and little need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté tells his story visually, through the thrilling and fantastical camera work. The opening is immediately animated with quick scenes of urban life and the swimmers are scattered on a public beach. Throughout the film, there is a focus on visual details, clothing, machinery, decoration, and avatar images such as a trapped bird, a pile of torn pictures, and a bracelet of diamonds. This is silent film technique at its peak. <br /> <br /> Of course, Louise Brooks is responsible for saving the film from mystery. Seeing this makes it even more sad to reflect that this was her last role in the tournament. Beautiful in its brilliance, the film dominates its appeal and also gives a very natural but highly charged performance. Her role here, more than Babest's films, is a woman we can understand and sympathize with. She plays the role of Lucien Garnier, a writer with a jealous fiancé, who longs for more life and secretly enters a beauty contest, with immediate success. And then torn between the excitement in her new and charming life and love for the man who insists on abandoning or losing it. All figures are drawn by a simple margin. Al-Khatib inspires pity, not just savagery: he loves Lucien, but he is a limited man who can not deal with a separate life or attract the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in the story is not the simple baseball game we take with him first, although his intentions may be as king as her fiancé. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** Warning: The spoilers below ************* **** <br /> <br /> The film contains a fascinating collection, including Lucien's triumph in the Miss Europe contest, which is shown through the comic reactions of diverse audience members who end up throwing the heroine with flowers ; Her misery as a housewife, the peeling of potatoes while the cuckoo clock pendulum represents the time behind her; on a silent journey to an entertainment party (in the silent version, this happens late in the film, after her marriage), where Lucian, crushed by her low age, Her strange husband, that she can not go with her presence To; especially the last scene in the show room where you see talk screen test. Louise Brooks may never have been more beautiful than she was here, as the projection beam bounced back into the picture of her marble, her shoulders brushed white, her face glowing under the helmet of black hair watching herself sing on the screen. The double shot of her remarkable body and still vivid image on the screen is particularly poignant: Louise Brooks, like Lucien's, is still immortal despite her frustrated career in cinema.
