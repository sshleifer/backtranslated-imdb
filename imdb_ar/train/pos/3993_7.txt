"The Mother" is a weird, low-budget film, touching at least two uncomfortable things that are not usually explored in cinema: the denial of mother's love for her son and daughter, and lust and passion at the age of three. <br /> <br /> The characters are appalling: You may be a disgusting old lady and I think it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sadness for her. She admits she did not like her son and daughter. She cheated her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals the man beloved to her daughter, not to protect her from an unethical man, and this does not love her, but just because she feels horny with him. She tries to organize her life after losing her husband in the worst possible way, and destroying her daughter's illusions. Paula, her daughter, a fragile loser, accepts her life as she is. Her brother Bobby is a man who has lost his savings because of his wife, who insists on owning her own shop, a terrible job already. Daren joking moral addict does not like anyone, even the same. <br /> <br /> Representation and guidance are excellent: actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very accurate. I liked this movie, but I realize it's recommended for a very specific audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar"
