This film is a true reflection of the Australian trick that has been required to make this country what it is during the last 200 years. Not as pompous as the British, not Gong is like Americans. If any of these countries tried what the crew did, it would have failed horribly. Either because of ignorance from the British side, or a lot of faith in the superior firepower on the American side. "Genuine" Australians are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their lives from adults. Just look at examples like Gallipoli. Paschendale. Tobruk. New Guinea and Vietnam.
