Before I watch this movie, I see a lot of comments, which everyone has a wonderful vision of the film well or badly ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to point out is the representation on Woody Harrison on behalf of it, may not be In many parts of the film, but when he appeared or even presented, I was struck by the "message" Will Smith and Woody Harrelson tried to create and perhaps escape the entire plot until the end to understand the truth of what was going on. <br /> <br /> I'm not a very emotional person, I think the good deed should not have remorse or pity. But to do the show of salvation, there are not many films that from my point of view can show this. Someone can do that. <br /> <br /> I agree with someone who commented on this film showing the acts of "suicide", but I do not think this is the "message" the film is trying to send, but "sacrifice." A bit to the extreme, but this is the message in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This movie has potential. The representation is worth every penny, the script is incredible. From someone who does not like watching drama movies ... if you love drama it is a must.
