I just have to say that regardless of the low budget size of the film, it must appear around this world of films. We no longer read this much, instead people want to watch movies. Having this series on the DVD, made me want to read the entire series, and I want more. Please provide all 8 movies. Please do not change any of the characters too, it spoils the effect. Because I grew up to love actors who played characters. Please submit all 8 movies. I want to see the message, and to see the message that these books and now the movies are here to be filmed. We did not get this enough anymore. Awesome job!
