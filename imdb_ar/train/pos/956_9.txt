The simple manual camera on the film gives some documentary feeling, and also relates to the films of faith. <br /> <br /> Do you feel bored of those Hollywood-style clicks with mysterious guys getting important links that will be envious of? You get fed up with a single married cop living, an absolute man, but a family, personal donut and tough fisherman? Have you ever wondered how it looks like real police work? <br /> <br /> Well, for you, this movie is showing you. Located in the north between West Germany and East Germany, the former DDR, an employed post office employee begins its work, a new school of politics. She soon finds her way around the usual customers, and she's used to life as a policeman ... but that's not fun. <br /> <br /> Other German crime films such as Derrick and Der Alte et cetera have respectable officers to speak quietly with suspects. These policemen here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder. This good and realistic dialogue makes an interesting view, even if you know that part of Germany is a bit.
