Wow what a loop! After last week, I saw Melissa make a permanent veil about Annie and Brandy's friendship. But that was not even something to see Melissa's porridge after its launch. Her vision hung around her crew as she scribbled and shouted at someone to get her bag, and it was the most fun thing ever on reality TV. She continued yelling at people outside the group to get her clothes "all" like someone else wearing one of her hideous clothes. Melissa Are you 40 years old and still throwing tantrums? Then Joan begins to contact me and Brandy with every name in the book, and get up and stop the show! Both rivers are spoiled, leaving only the supply for a long time to maintain high ratings. Melissa cries and refuses to interview an exit, just prove to America what everyone thinks, you are a spoiled child. Wah wah I can not get in my way! I like the way Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Melissa to think her way, and then she did exactly that. Melissa is by far the smartest racer and clearly deserves to win the entire game.
