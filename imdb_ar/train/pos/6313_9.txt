Cosimo (Luis Guzman) is said to be in jail for a perfect robbery. Since he was behind bars and can not do it himself, he must leave it to his daughters Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Soon, there are five men organizing the crime - five men with very little brain capacity. The brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are welcome directors of Collinwood (2002). It's a crime comedy that is often very funny. I can only laugh when things get worse with these people. Actors play these characters. William H. Messi plays the role of Riley. Isa Washington is Leon. Sam Rockwell is a Peruvian. Michael Jeter is Tutu. Andy Davoli is Basil. Gabriel Union plays his interest in Michelle's love. Jennifer Esposito plays a love interest in Peru Carmella. George Clooney (producer also) plays Jerzy, the man tattooed in a wheelchair. This flick is very fun. I would definitely recommend it.
