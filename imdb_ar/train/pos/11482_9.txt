This film was mainly shot on a handheld camera by actors. In some ways, the book makes fun of deadly memoirs in other ways, video memos about the killers full of Columbine attacks. Although this film does not answer all the big questions, it only gives you an insight into how easy it is to overcome them. Through the film, we show you how actors shortened lead guns illegally, made pipe bombs and came up with a Zero Day action plan. The actors (if you could call them) were wonderful, they obviously used a lot of their own lives, but at what point I found out they were actually acting (you should try Tom Tom Cruise). The use of CCTV and the 911 operator was in the end a genius, but I'm not sure if we need the last scene. Overall though a really good movie on a very difficult subject.
