Director Sidney Lumette made some masterpieces, such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico.But, but he was not lucky in his latest work. Gloria (1999) was pathetic, and Find Me Guilty was interesting but unsuccessful. Now, Lumet presents his best film in decades, and in my view, a real masterpiece: before Satan knows you're dead. I think this film is like the rebirth of Lumet. This film has an excellent story to it deeply, it has many layers.Also, I think the end of the film is perfect. The offers are great. Philippe Philippe Seymour Hoffman brings, as usual, a great performance and is, undoubtedly, one of the best actors of our time. Ethan Hawk is also an excellent actor, but he played down my point. His performance here is fantastic. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially Albert Finney the Great) but these two actors bring huge performances that have unfortunately been ignored by the pathetic Oscar. The film has a good level of intensity, partly nks to performances, thanks in part to a fantastic script. Before the devil knows that you are dead is a real masterpiece with an ideal direction, great script and excellent performance. We need more movies like this.
