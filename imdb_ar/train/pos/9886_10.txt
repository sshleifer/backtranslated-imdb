This is a visually stunning film. The pictures of the Mexican desert, the old palace and the characters in their beautiful costumes ... are all a real work of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a little loose, but that's because it does not mean to be realistic. It is taken from a book called "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and is supposed to evoke the isolated Latin American atmosphere "far from God, very close to the United States." The enormous debt that Eindhra owes to her grandmother is the symbol of the international debt burden of Latin America, despite the many layers of meaning. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate a slow motion film, rich in texture, yours.
