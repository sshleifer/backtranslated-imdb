The San Francisco and Captains Courageous are two of the greatest parts of Spencer Tracy, a very curious film about the war and its effects on some people. They gave him a starring role in two films: Spencer Tracy and Fortune One in the only film they created together and Gladys George as a woman who loves them. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone are two World War I lovers, the character tone is almost as weak as a hill in the boot camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy still plays the role of the lovable younger Wallace type that MGM imagined when they caught him away from Fox. <br /> <br /> Tone has a chance to take it when he can enter the church tower sitting on the nest of a German submachine gun. He has learned to shoot now and shoots York's sergeant. But Alvin York never changed because of the war as it did with Tony. <br /> <br /> Tony's convalescent battle in a hospital with Gladys George is left to look for him. Tracy goes AWOL himself to visit his girlfriend and he and George get something to happen. Later when Tracy was reported missing at work, she married Tone and George. Tracy breaks his heart when he returns and learns of marriage, but sits in a step. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie deals with Tone by applying wartime skills learned in gang trade. He is a successful man now and George does not really know what he is doing for a living. I think you can determine the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that gave me some problems is that I can not believe that Gladys George could not figure it out. She is a smart girl in the streets, and her role is much like her role in The Roaring Twenties versus James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Recently about The Roaring Twenties, the evolution of Humphrey Bogart's character there is similar to Tone's although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, there are elements of The Gave Him A Gun that can be found in the Taxi Driver program and in the classic Clint Eastwood, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The sequence of World War I battles is well organized by director Woody van Dyck. For some reason Leonard Maltin produced this film, I think it is much better than the credit.
