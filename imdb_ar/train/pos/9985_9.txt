I have watched this movie in Winnipeg recently - fit, considering the location used. I first read Lawrence's book back in the seventies, and for me, it has always been a very strong picture of aging experiences in our society. It resonated when I was young and had more resonance now. When the movie came out, I was anxious to see if the story would continue. I was quite impressed, especially with the performance of Ellen Burstein. She managed to give us a complete human being, although the personality is eccentric and generally wise - someone who does not want to live with him. It's great to be able to see your favorite characters truly alive.
