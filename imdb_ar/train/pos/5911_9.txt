Remember Ralph Bakshi? The man who was a cartoonist on Terrytoons, then at Paramount Cartoon Studios, and then, was a director for Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, this is Konskin. And it's actually very good. Elemental, but good. The film is shown in Harlem Nights (no, duh, it has been a practical title). But with the twist becomes a violent film of the Disney film, South Song. <br /> <br /> It is about Sampson (Barry) White) and the rush (Charles Gordon) rush to help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped at a roadblock and ends up in a shootout with the police. While they wait, Randy hears without hesitation his fellow scoundrel Scatman Crothers, and begins to tell Randy's story of "three guys, whom I knew, just like you and your friends." The story of Bape in the animated cartoon is listed against live wallpaper and footage. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear (Voice of White) and Preacher Fox (Gordone Sound) decide to pack your bags and leave their southern settings after the bank has mortgaged his house to a man who turns him into a brothel. Access to Harlem, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox found that he no longer did everything. They meet a man called "The Simple Savior", a false revolutionary leader who claims to be the "cousin" of Black Jesus, and gives his followers "the power to kill the whites." In a playful play in his "Church," the Savior acts savagely with the black symbols of persecution represented by John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon before asking his parishioners for "donations." <br /> <br /> Rabit is the first to stand up against Madigan, a very racist, gay, gay, and Mafia guard who shows his disdain for African Americans in various ways, including refusing to shower before an expected meeting with them Do not deserve it). When Madigan discovers that Rabbit is taking his rewards, he and his colleagues, Robbie and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called The Cotonel. <br /> <br /> A black stripper distracts while a LSD sugar cube is dropped in its drink. Madigan, under the influence of his polished drink, is then maneuvered into sexual contact with a typically gay man, then shaves into a women's clothing model of a racist, something racially embellished, and graduated from the back of the club where he discovered that Ruby and Bobby had died. <br /> <br /> Then, as he was recovering from his delirium from being a drug addict, he was shot randomly and shot by the police after shooting at one of them. <br /> <br /> The rabbit, Bear, Fox and boxing rush off from the boxing arena as they explode. The story of the live action ends with the escape of Randy and Pappe while they were shot by several white policemen, but managed to get her alive. <br /> <br /> This film was controversial at the time of the release, and was re-edited by the director several times under the title, Street Fight, which is obvious, because Street Fight is a 2005 documentary film about racism in the streets. In fact, this film contains the same theme as the documentary. <br /> <br /> This caused Brianston Pictures, the distributor of this classic Tobe Hopper movie, the Texas Shainsu Massacre, to stop working. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but because of racism, Bryanton took over the production of Bakshi. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. The animation was great at the time, the plot is logical, and it is really very funny. <br /> <br /> The final result: 9/10
