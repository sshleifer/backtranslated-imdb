It was a very funny film, and I want to have this for my classic collection of the seventies of the last century, and I have to see it again, and I know this group of characters, people I've met over the years and ask me to search for this comedy. Unfortunately, DVD or VHS. Red Fox is always a clown of comedy, Pearl Billy a wonderful match as his rude, rude wife, Norman Jr. with a secret not sure if he will have a future if he is out, Dennis Dogan is a crazy funny man. Miss Dobson Hooker with little heart and conscience. Love, lust, alien family relationships, this film is eligible to reappear, comedy performance with a range of events where this can find its way as a new image, I think finding the cast will be extremely difficult perhaps impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld plays The role of Denis Dogan, this dedicates a few episodes of Seinfeld that also brought me back to Norman is that you, keeping it as soon as possible is certainly impossible as if it were impossible to reform a pretend friend girl and betray a parent. The film was a wild advice to a taxi driver who reminded me of Kramer's episode of a tip from the box on his lawyer. (Episode of Seinfeld) Parents there is a jaw drop moment, fun more fun than she screams me back.
