The documentary begins by setting the perspective for several light years. A traveler walks our white way with the sounds of our earthly life, as a memorial to space (possible?) Outside the earth. <br /> <br /> The documentary contains footage of Willie Dickson and Robert Johnson and skips James and Jay Lenoir. J.B. clips not posted. From before. The narrative from "The Blind Willie" Dixon. However, this is done by a representative. The film features the work of all these early men followed by blues music, followed by covers and explanations for musicians, such as Nick Kaif, bad seeds and others. <br /> <br /> The death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall song) is a remarkable event in the story. Lenoir got political engagement, and was considered the Martin Luther King Association and its peers. His political interests can be found in his subjects. <br /> <br /> Blues music is found as the original music of America. Blues is roots and the rest is fruits. <br /> <br /> The title "The Spirit of a Man" is after Willy Dixon's song.
