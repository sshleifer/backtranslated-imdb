Police Story is an amazing series of pieces set for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and courage. Some of the thrills here are among the best and most dangerous of Jackis, where the battle of the entire mall may be the greatest battle sequence for Jackie, the more brutal and less comedy, then Project A or Drunken Master says at the end of the battle, you can feel the pain of the impact. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the film does not stand up to this kind of quality, as it is a police movie somewhat exciting with some comedies. I always prefer JC in films like Project A where his natural comics shine. At the dangerous limits of some Police Story elements, it does not work for me. Having said that though this still exists with the best Jackies movies because of the amazing workmanship and awesome sights. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong movies, avoid the DVD version of Madbalij in English because it is a really awful stick for translations. <br /> <br /> Great erotic works, well, the film is a good starting point if you have not seen the JC movie before and deserve to watch any of the movie lovers 7/10
