While always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would be just a "B" rate film but I was amazed at the acting by two main characters. All the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. The plot was fascinating and unique with excellent moral to the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for someone looking for sex, "mute and stupid" or blood and courage. It is an amazingly moving film that presents some bleak facts of life along with the kindness of the human heart and is trivial enough to keep it fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is best on many "A" movies. I've seen a lot of big box office profits. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie.
