I'm not a fan of new movies, but this was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children can watch it together - how unusual! My aunt loved that too. He had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - a modern parrot. One of my favorite, the Wizard of Oz reminded me. The hero, Paulie, the smart parrot, is separated from his home and family and engaged in many adventures, temptations and disappointments, taking into account his decision to always find his friend Mary. Highly recommended.
