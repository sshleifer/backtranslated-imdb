There is something special about Austrian films not only by Seidel, but by Spielmann and other directors as well. This is the real sense of reality that never leaves the viewer during the film. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by storyboards but also by actors who play. At Hundstage, I never felt that these actors were playing, but real people instead. Reality is a mysterious viewer's feeling ... as if the angry pensioner or the only lady in the film lives in your lap. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in Vienna without any painful doubt can identify the people in the film through meckern / sudern (complaining), and the hidden sexual urges and proto-macho men. This is reinforced by the Viennese dialect which, according to many, was made specifically for the complaint as a way of life. As a particularly narrow and characteristic arrogance is filmed for Vienna very well. <br /> <br /> The Viennese suburbs enjoy a vital presence in the film with its dazed and drowsy where nothing happens. In addition, they have become a physical celebration with shopping centers and supermarkets. In the middle are the homes of people who indulge in what they consider to be activities to give pleasure, trying to stay in contact with themselves human, but to no avail. Examples of this are the old woman's sex game with men who have defied rape, the man who loses his temper and hurts his girlfriend and the young woman who starts and irritates her drivers. <br /> <br /> The film contains no soundtrack because it focuses on the natural / image anomaly only. Another feature of Sidel (and other Austrian directors) is his exposure to disturbing sexual images. These include stripping the old woman of her husband, sex scenes in the bathroom, the lady's sex with the two men in her apartment, and so forth. <br /> <br /> In Hundstage Seild, I photographed the lives of people who might eventually be as much as citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. Viewers should not despise or feel sorry for the Viennese in the film because they themselves may become victims of the same alienation and alienation, albeit in different circumstances. In the end, I think Siddle's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relations that was brutally revealed in Hundstage. If the bidder does not surrender to the causes of this evil transformation, Sidel will achieve his goal.
