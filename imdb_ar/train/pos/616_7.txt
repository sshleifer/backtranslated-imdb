If it's possible to label any type of film with "my pleasure in guilt," it would be a kind of public imagination. Guilty is the wrong word for that, however, I am very pleased that I survived from time to time. Stardust is a good imagination for stock, which one should expect from Jiman (or Jiman, as he was). It is not Mirrormask's visual dream, and it is not the panacea of ​​Pan's Labyrinth. It is not the classic The Princess Bride, but it contains only what the fantasy lover knows enough to be perfectly comfortable with the entire viewing. Fans of fantasy must rejoice - the effects of the special effects have finally become so good and cheap that they are now in regular production. <br /> <br /> The story of Stardust includes a young man named Tristan, in order to get the love and consent of the most beautiful girl in their small town of Wall, going on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star. To make matters difficult, however, the fallen star of Tristan is actually a woman called Evin, and he is not the only one looking for her ... Some magicians have their greedy eyes on the eternity that the heart of the star can give him, Direction. <br /> <br /> From there, all of them are predictable, but they include some attractive fantasy elements, some warm comments about the nature of love, and the best part, Robert De Niro as a gay disc. In this note, DeNiro's performance is topical ... It is not the excessive weight that most actors use to portray homosexuals, but it is surprisingly effective performance of a person accustomed to being seen as a rough typecast character (thus a continuous joke surrounds his character matching DeNiro's openness to alternative forms of the acting). DeNiro was not unique to his own image since Brazil, saying something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is the kind of film, perhaps, that will remain on the shelves of children and fantasy lovers for a long time. I can not say that it offers anything new, but it does not really exist. In fact, they are the ones who are most familiar with what they will enjoy most. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
