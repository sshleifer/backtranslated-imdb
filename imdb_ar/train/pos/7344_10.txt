In my opinion, this is a good example of a film that would have been much better if it had been short ten years ago. I doubt it will benefit from modern technology, but it would have been better to have at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> Artists and animators have done a great job. In my opinion, this film can boast the best art in the background and one of the best character design. The animation is very smooth and realistic. Throughout the film you believe in the world you see, everyone has done a great job. He can also boast of one of the most attractive, if not the most attractive, feminine characters, which give typical animations of pennies easily. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a couple of bad ears about this movie that will not make it very attractive right now. First, conspiracy and execution can be compared to contemporary adventure films, and they are already old-fashioned in modern standards. Secondly, given the time it takes, it will benefit greatly from an additional 20 minutes of dialog boxes. Finally, setup was not common at the moment. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A wonderful alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not the novel.
