French filmmakers have been invited to create short 11-minute films that convey their thoughts on the events of September 11. <br /> <br /> Movie clips vary widely in content and quality. Two point to the complicity of the United States in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, portrayed in the film by British director Ken Loach; and in Palestine by Israeli-backed Israelis, which appears in the part of Egyptian director Youssef Chahine ). Two others mention the devastating acts (a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, which Israeli director Amos Gitan called "the holy war" against the West in World War II by Shuhi Immura). <br /> <br /> There are many paradoxes in several stories. The shadows that suddenly darken an old man's apartment suddenly disappear in New York City as the World Trade Tower intersects the earth in Sean Penn's piece, bringing joy for a moment. But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife has already disappeared. In Mira Nair, based on a real incident, a young man in New York City, the son of a Pakistani family, is assumed to be a fugitive, but later proved to be a hero himself, trying to save others in the towers. <br /> <br /> There are exciting moments that are spreading all the time. Luch quotes his exiled Chilean man as saying that hope is based on anger and courage: anger at the way things go, and the courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as the Holy War. Samira Makhmalbaf is a teacher with her young children in Afghan schools who have been exiled in Iran and are trying to tell them about the events that have just happened in New York. But it is understood that they were greatly impressed by a major event in their refugee camp, where two men fell into a deep well, one killed and the other broke a leg. This is a tragedy widely understood for children aged 6 years. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Ouadraogo, from Burkina Faso, is creating a drama in which a son of a sick woman, Osama bin Laden in their village, is gathering his comrades to help catch the fugitive terrorist in order to get $ 25 a US reward. He tells his friends not to let any adult know their plans, because older people will only spend money on cars and cigarettes while planning to help his mother and other sick and needy people. <br /> <br /> Mexican filmmaker Alejandro González Inarrito (the maker of "Amoris Perros") is the one who offers the most powerful and most shrewd part of the show, the part that mostly appears on a dark screen with the audio loop of chants, sounds and Sometimes the LED sounds. The brief visual flashes gradually allow us to see bodies falling from the upper floors of the towers, showing that the clots are the objects that strike the ground. The sequence of orchestral music ends with elegance and stills, with a phrase that appears first in Arabic only, then with a translation added: "Does the light of God guide us or blind us?"
