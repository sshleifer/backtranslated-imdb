<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt like watching it, like having someone keep tabs on every step you make? Well, just remember before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least this is the feeling you feel after seeing a criminal drama film that controls itself, but is a little pathetic. Traces the organization's roots from a small office to one of the world's newest facilities (in 1959), by recounting the story through their eyes to one of his aides, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Chip has been working with the FBI since the first day, and gladly puts his job above anything else in the world and even sometimes his family. The FBI story tracks his life by filming what he does as an agent, and how one affects his personal life. The film does a great job of showing the kind of situations the FBI deals with and how they deal with them. The public can see the Chip stop the Ku Klux Klan riot, hide behind it to resolve the Indian homicide / murder scandal, put the fugitives in custody, rescue the hostages, and help fight in World War II. He even helped bring communist spies to justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a mysterious complex performance, is excellent (as usual) as a little nervous agent who loves his job perhaps too much. One of the best parts of this film is that we see the inner workings of both the family's Chip life and its function. We see him suffering from the death of his close friend and then his son. Also note his wife suffers from abortion, and his marriage faces difficult times. Almost all his personal problems result from his love of his job. Vera Miles offers sporadic but very convincing performance, but less. They were never a fantastic actress, but there was always something very attractive and tempting. Well maybe that's just me? Sadly none of the other offerings are worth mentioning, but the story of attracting attention has managed to keep me very interested. <br /> <br /> The movie industry was impressive, especially the scenes in the jungles of South America. All the colors had a texture that really captures the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the bulk of this film is the direction of the wonderful Mervin Leroy. Each scene was so liquid that it rolled together to tell a wonderful story. It is full of innovative camera shots, some of which have a very hitchcockian feel. <br /> <br /> In general, the FBI Story is an amazing film but has been ignored. Recording time in two and a half hours Some viewers may be scary, but if you get this chance, I recommend jumping to this hour. I enjoyed the amazing performance of Jimmy Stewart, and the charming story.
