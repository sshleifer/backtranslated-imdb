One of the first "original OVA" movies I've ever bought, it still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A set of comedy films that represent science fiction on an unexpected background (for comedy, no background for pollution in the near future in a pessimistic society. <br /> <br /> "Dominion heroes are" Tank Police, "If we can not overcome the crime, we will get bigger weapons," and, as the name suggests, patrol the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, which are actually more dangerous than any criminals trying to catch up. Not all of them, mentally ill and mentally ill on the border, give a new meaning to the phrase "loose guns." <br /> <br /> <br /> Their enemies are equally colorful and fun with the fun and laughter of men, the twin Cat Sisters, whose presence always seems to give Tank a tough time. <br /> <br /> Animation is not the latest technology, but nice Quite the opposite; the colorful palette and cartoon appearance of the characters and mica are perfectly suited to Dominion's comedic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is, again, a lot of fun.The soundtracks for the English version are also very good. I wonder if they have prepared an audio album for that ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Dominion Tank Police is fantastic. It is the Japanese SF cyberpunk program with a lot of comedy, full of characters and completely full positions, making sure they do not take themselves seriously. Highly recommended.
