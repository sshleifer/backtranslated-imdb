Bravo! The space movie does not take itself seriously and anyone can come in an exciting tour of the space camp. The film begins slowly, mixing the usual mix of idiots and pilots in a cloudy soup. But when the situation becomes difficult - the difficulty is solved on their own and does not make an unreasonable change in characters where you can believe there is some responsibility in their small minds. <br /> <br /> The only drawback in the film is that Kate Cabshaw is very annoying as a coach "I'm right and you're completely wrong." I would recommend this lovely night in the movie and vote 7.
