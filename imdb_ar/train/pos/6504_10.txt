My wife and I saw this entire series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. Is not this the "full" history of World War II? No library can keep such a date? But it is the best summary of this history. Lots of details, lots of personal stories, and still keep the overall picture in sight. <br /> <br /> Olivier's novel was superbly written, and of course it was beautifully presented. Interviews from all sides, except for Russian, because producers were not allowed to speak to many Russians. It is worth owning this full program on DVD. We cherish our copy. <br /> <br /> The product does an excellent job of providing images and motion as there is almost nothing in any archive: there are almost no movies about caravans and battles of submarines, for example, but still, the episode on this subject is extremely good.
