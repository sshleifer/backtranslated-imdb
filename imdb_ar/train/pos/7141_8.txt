Since Seskill's death and the absence of Ebert, the show has been left in the hands of Richard Roper who is unable. Roeper is not a film critic. He only criticizes anything he does not personally like, such as country music that is disturbed because "I do not like country music!" Children's movies get the standard "Do not see it now, wait until it appears on a DVD and rent it to your kids!" Roper may be a stupid savior, but in some other areas. The weekly "sit-in" guests for Ebert are better off, but who wants to choose Daisy in the midst of cowboys? All that was said, it is the only show in the city and this alone makes it worth watching. For Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, can you? It's your mind and the thoughts we crave. Do whatever is necessary to save this usurper from his declared throne.
