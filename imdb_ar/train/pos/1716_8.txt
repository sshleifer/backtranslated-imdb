Abhay Deol meets Suha Ali Khan and salutes her "Hello sister!" This sets the tone for a wonderful first movie by Shivam Nair. Suha, a middle-class girl, escaped from her home in Nainital and comes to Delhi to marry her lover, Cheyenne Munshi. But Xi'an does not attend Soha leaves sadness & alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the inferior man of the neighboring class turns to protect against vulnerable Saha and help her get a job and shelter in an aging home. Romance slowly blooms and Suha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Xi'an enters again into the life of Suha. <br /> <br /> A sensitive film with an unusual story, lovingly filmed in Delhi, revolves around sensitive Suha. This well-prepared film contains moments that will remain engraved forever in the memory of the person ?? First critical kiss and Abhay apology fast. Abhai described Suha as "class and to Ladki" hastily adding "he does not like her"; his churidar gift to Soha and asking her about a date. <br /> <br /> Good music & excellent background music. In a scene where Suha rushes and embraces Abhay, the audio track disappears. Sleep conveys both embarrassment and tenderness in the relationship. <br /> <br /> The touching ending ends with a bitter sweet film, whose memories will remain for a long time. I must see that I will rate it 8.5 / 10
