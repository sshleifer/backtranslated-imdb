It was the only time I saw this film when I was 10 years old. I have remembered it all these years where I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just shook me completely. I was on vacation with my aunt at Fort. Worth, Texas and I'll never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this to see me as an adult. It took a lot of research to see what it was like, but I always remember that Barbara Stanwyck was there and finally got the name and comments on it. I enjoyed it a lot, but it gave me panic! Jaqui
