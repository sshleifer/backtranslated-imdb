One of them has already mentioned "to be in the right place at the right time". This documentary was so true that I have doubts about the authenticity of the scenes and I thought it might have included some but it is not. All this is true. The story is not new for the peoples of developing countries and / or poor countries. It sheds light on people manipulating the media, misleading, and artificially polarizing people by creating deliberate street tension, sometimes so much so that the military, intelligence agency or even the government (many believe, led by the United States) uses customers who attack "any" side to excite the masses In violence and thus justify their coups. The naval officer in the film mentions this as well. They want to see the people facing the streets. All these scenarios have been played in Turkey (the pet dog in the Middle East) throughout its history of three coups. Recently, the secret plans of the Turkish military have been revealed, ironically, through conservative religious / conservative media. Opposition to the religious beliefs of the army, where a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to excite people and so on. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unique is that they were filming from within, perhaps by accident, when the events occurred. It is clear that the directors are pro-Chávez. Whether or not this leads to the managers' liquidation and processing of events and information, I will not know. <br /> <br /> Whether Chávez will defend the Venezuelan people against the dictatorship of the United States and the world economy without suppressing any opposing ideology by force and eventually becoming a tolerant tyrant will tell history. <br /> <br /> But Chavez has at least hope and I think it's worth taking the opportunity.
