Jessica Alba Max and Valerie Ray Miller star the original Cindy in this packed series in the air. Fantastic politically incorrect. The quality varies greatly from loop to loop, but overall the level is high and when not, Jessica is always worth looking at. The urban hiking trip from Valerie jumps into a quasi-dark angel of darkness to the territory of the sitcom.
