Well, so I do not watch a lot of horror movies - and the reason for that is movies like "Dark Remains". I caught this on a DVD (amazingly full of features) and it scared me silly. In fact, the only additional thing I thought the DVD was missing was two new trousers. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I told someone about it when I realized that I only saw about 10% of it. The rest of the time I was watching pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would pick me up if I actually covered my eyes. In the few times I've had the courage to watch the screen I jumped so hard that I decided not to search again. <br /> <br /> The film industry is solid and the characters' status is very strong. It is the simplicity of the film that has captured the jump button - it is just a forest, a cab and an abandoned prison - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising thing to me was that even though it was not millions of dollars in production, the effects of make-up really looked! Also, this film is obviously produced by someone who has a great love in filmmaking. Sound and music design really could not use two surround systems like many Hollywood movies. I noticed on the Internet that this film won the LA Shriekfest award - a great achievement indeed, and I think the festival has seen the talent of filmmakers - and perhaps more of this film than I could achieve. <br /> <br /> Turn up the sound, turn off the lights, and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
