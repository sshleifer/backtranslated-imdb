I will not go into much detail about the plot of this film, as other reviewers covered the same ground to a large extent. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed this movie a lot. Peter Falk's performance alone is enough to watch the film. <br /> <br /> A small "Road Trip" with Falk & Paul Reiser in New York State in the fall is the setting for most of the film's events. <br /> <br /> Written well with the target audience in mind. Much humor based on reality and some drama that played well give the film a feeling that it can be your family. <br /> <br /> I really can not say enough about this film but it's a shame to have a nice movie like this that does not get more exposure while other junk junk out there. <br /> <br /> It is great to see Falk with a major leadership role again and that he benefits from it more. He proves that his friend and writer / filmmaker John Cassavits was right to film Falk in many of his leading films in the 1960s and 1970s.
