I liked Top Gun. My interest was held. A predictable plot, develop a decent character and story line. It is very similar to N in that the city's inhabitants seem weak and afraid to stand up to the villain. This film contains some quality actors who have not had the opportunity to share all their talents. Also some actors did not get credit for their role. Denver Pyle was a good-looking man in his youth. John Dahner, Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did his best with bad stuff. It's hard to imagine him as a weapon. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a queer figure. She seemed bored because two men might have been fighting her. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
