This horror film is dark and intriguing based on the idea of ​​religious killing. The story is about a confused man living in Texas, USA, who suddenly began a murder with his two young children after receiving instructions from God to recover the world of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, who directs the film, plays the role of the misguided father known as "The Dead Hand of God" while Matthew McConaughey plays in the finest performances so far as one of the eldest son, Fenton Mix. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides he can no longer bear the burden of his own childhood and uses the memories of the past to recount the story painfully to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Bowers Booth). <br /> <br /> I can not think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to his seat from start to finish, and that's definitely one of them. So if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to because of the absolute power of this movie. <br /> <br /> Directors have filmed this film well, and they are helping to prepare the layout through the good scene. The acting in this film is wonderful, but if there is any flaw, some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people. <br /> <br /> While the concept of this film is too dark, young children help visualize the idea through great acting. It's really a film with a spine and content to make you at the edge of your seat all the time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has horror movies, annoying and powerful or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
