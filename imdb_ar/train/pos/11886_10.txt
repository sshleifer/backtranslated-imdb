I love this movie first, because it's a family movie. Second, it offers a refreshing experience to deal with HIV news in a family, with much less hysteria than I have usually seen in movies. Brothers are very close, but they are not ruled. Their desire to protect the younger brother is noble, but it is not necessary in the end. I understand that choosing Leo on how to treat his treatment may not have been the most popular option with people, but I thought it was the right choice for him. I can not believe that this is a French television show. It had great production values. I gave this movie ten years and I think you'll do it too, once you watch it.
