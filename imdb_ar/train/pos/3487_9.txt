Wrestlemania 14 is not often seen as one of the greatest Wrestlemania, but I personally will put it in the top 5 list, if not in the top three. Best WWE era, in my opinion. HBK has the lion's heart, and it was positioned on Austin as he did, on his way out, of the exclusive class on his part. It has one of the most important crowds you'll ever see, and it has J.R and The King at its best! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? Battle of the Royal Team LOUD pop for the return of L.O.D. I am not a fan of the royal battle, this is another average one. Very predictable, even when you see it, it is clear that L.O.D will win. If we look sunny for 8 minutes or so, definitely. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C Against Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets a sudden pop, with his entrance. Fast, flying, and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would certainly have smacked the surface. Taka wins with driver Michinoku. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> European Championship WWF. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C For Owen Hart Stipulation here, Shina is handcuffed to slaughter. Nice pop for Owen, mixed reaction to the trips. In fact, the game is really less than its real value, which is one of my favorite favorites in WrestleMania, in fact. The two mingle together very well and Owen can go with anyone. Win flights, with Chyna intervention. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Matching a mixed tag. Marc Miro and Sable v. Goldust and Luna. The identification of pop music for Samoor, unheard of at that time, for women. Sable looks actually hot, the crowd eats it! Sable cheers are fixed and break out almost every time in the ring. Not bad for matching mixed tags, he has had amusing instincts, and the time went well. Team wins Sable, when Sable TKO hits. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock vs The Rock Before I review the game, I would like to point out that The Rock showed his tremendous potential, with his encounter with Jennifer Flowers, before his match. Nice pop for Shamrock, great heat time for a rock. It was so short that it was disappointing, and I thought that the end was a bit stupid, although Shamrock's oddity was amazing to see, and the crowd broke it. Rock retains the title, when the Ref reflects the resolution. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dumpster game, WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk vs. New Age Outlaws. Outlaws are not over yet, because they will be at this time. The crowd has already died for this purpose, but I thought it contains some large hard parts, with some pathological bumps. Cactus and Terry won the titles in the end. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kane. Great applause, for the cohorts of the dead. Much better than doing a walk in the Wrestlemania 20, and for a great man versus a big man match, this was really good. It was a wonderful fight, with the Undertaker attacking a patient across the table. The WWE was clever, making Ken look strong, even through defeat. After the launch of two tombstones, Taker finally released the third championship. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Private guest developer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C Vs Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. The crowd goes Monkey U Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. It's really a special match, one of the greatest major events in WrestleMania's history, and you can tell if the JR runs out. HBK gives everything he has, in what was supposed to be his last match, Austin was seldom the best. The runner and electricity of the crowd is amazing, and it is as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with astounding, with Tyson joining to 3:16 through Michaels' dismissal. King said winning the Austin celebration was a surprise, as he was one of the most crowds you'll ever see. They were right on the walnut. minimum. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for Real Madrid. She has everything you want in Wrestlemania, and really kicked the era kick position. This is very distinctive for me, because it was the first WrestleMania I saw in 98. "The Austin era, it started!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
