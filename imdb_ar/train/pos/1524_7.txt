This movie must be classy. It's not perfect, for sure. Speed, although ideal for the stage, is slow in the form of a film like a tortoise with two arthritic knees. Jan Seberg's mistake was directed to be very sweet and pleasant. They show full talent, skill and craftsmanship to represent Joan with intelligence, passion and trust, but unfortunately, the director has misjudged the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In any other play, his dialogue was sharper, and no musical lines. However, processing this film requires that you consider him a lawyer. This film is the case, the viewer is the judge. This is how you should enjoy this picture. 10/07.
