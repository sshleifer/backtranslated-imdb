I have always enjoyed Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very tacky and humble in certain areas and certainly, although they target young children, they are adults in some fields so they can not protect them with the phrase "Oh, lighter, it's a movie for the kids." They stay good entertainment? In my opinion, they are as well and I enjoy them a lot. This one is just as fun as the previous three, and definitely cute. It has some really nice and touching moments because it is the introduction to the fresh and beloved Pokemon Celebi. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third installment, although the third film is not bad, and the entire series is entertaining, harmless and fun of the popcorn family and should not be considered more or less. This film contains high marks of intensity and attention, especially around the peak / end, as with all premiums, characters, while a little more weak than the previous three, I think, are still loved and humorous. These films are the least rated and the most critical of the four adaptations feature length, not worth it.
