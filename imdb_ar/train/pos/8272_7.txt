The family (the mother - Patricia Clarkson, the father of Jake Weber, and son Eric Perr Sullivan) graduated from a family she met in a remote house in the middle of winter. I accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This angers some locals - especially Otis (John Spiridakos) and things slowly (very slowly) get worse. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started watching this. Most of the reviews for this site on this site are very negative. Well ... I disagree. First, it's not a horror film. Horror does not start until the closing 30 minutes. It is very much like a family drama with the elements of terror thrown into it. At this level, it's a good damn good. <br /> <br /> I. Bad Things: The pace is too slow; Jake Weber is a terrible actor. Many of the fears of the wrong dream sequence; barely portraying the ninjidou in the film and the clear vision we get from the nigga in the end are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: a very good dramatic text; Clarkson is excellent like a mother. Some of the big trend with exotic sound effects that are a bit scary; an explicit hot sexy sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot!); Good disposition by Sullivan (only 10 at that time!) And Speredakos Completely. <br /> <br /> I think many people are upset about this film because it's being pushed like a horror movie - which is not. So, if you can ignore it, I think you might want to. I give it 7.
