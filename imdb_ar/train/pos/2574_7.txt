Ten years after the first film, James Peloschi, one of the most talented actors, who has been lukewarm in the past 20 years, returns to the role of detective Dolly for this film. <br /> <br /> If you expect more of the same than the first movie, you will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. Realizing that the battle scenarios for each of the commandments between dog and man may have been used in the first film, this film turns into a little more psychic in his approach as he focuses on a criminal with a fixation with the recently deceased wife of Dowley after he rejects his book and blames Dooley for her death. <br /> <br /> The script may not be the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to demonstrate their ability to represent, while maintaining enough light humor for the first film to succeed, and chemistry between the two stars is there for everyone to see. <br /> <br /> Easy and light film, which may not be worth buying unless you are genuinely impressed with either the first movie or Belushi, is definitely worth watching when it is shown on TV. <br /> <br />
