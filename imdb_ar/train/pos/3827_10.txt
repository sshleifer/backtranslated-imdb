I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - it was a wonderful film, creating a sense of age that is like traveling through time. The characters are really small, Mary is a strong match for Byron, and Clare is young and annoying, and Bolidore is a convincing patient ... all of them are beautiful, curious, demure ... not scary wreckage. In Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as a separate piece of the Shock Film, and I liked it for a variety of reasons, but it works like Merchant and Ivory, and my reading was the best shot of what you should have felt this summer. Romantic, yes, but I revived my interest in the life of Shelly and Peron every time I think of it. One of the nicest times I have.
