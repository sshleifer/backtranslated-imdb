I'm not a fan of Martial Arts, but the video store was almost empty and Jet Li was in the Lethal Weapon 4 and got it free when I rented the other movies, either way. I and my 22-year-old classmate (biochemistry and accounting students) loved half an hour after the film, which produced strange sounds for the Kung Fu and threw Shurikens Permet on each other. I can not explain it (well, maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, a slender block kicking a big block, hitting him, and kicking the biggest movie that would end. I think Jackie Chan with a little comedy and more work.
