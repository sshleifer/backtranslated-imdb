Although it contains one of "Revenge Price Plots," this film is my favorite in the work of Vincent Price. Gallico enjoys the quality lost in many horror characters. When you see him, you feel him, feel frustrated, injustice against him, and cheer him up when he goes to revenge, although he frightens you a bit with his original anger. As the film progresses, his character becomes tragic. He has committed his assassination, but now must be killed to cover it. And again to cover this one up. And again ... your stomach is submerged by its spirit and it looks like its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a cover. Even if the story of vengeance is old, the instruments themselves are original - Gallico uses his trick to kill in more creative ways. It is a shame that this person is unavailable at home.
