I, in my opinion, are a sweet, charming and fun romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was already a boring man. To me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to James' Katherine (Meg Ryan). However, all the participants in this film did a great job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming and fun romantic comedy about finding the right person for any of Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan's fans who have not seen him. You are in a lot of laughter, so go to the video store, rented or bought it, and retrieved with a friend, and watched.
