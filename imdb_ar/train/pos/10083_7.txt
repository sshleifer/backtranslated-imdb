The fact that this film was put on a DVD still tuned to the TV and with a mysterious picture really bothered many film fans ... and rightly so. This deserves much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the street performer who needs a son to pass his craft (rules of the day) and end up with a little girl instead (not the traditional) way .... and the problems that follow. The old man bought the baby at an auction for the slave and soon discovered that the boy was not a boy, which I thought was obviously the case. <br /> <br /> The old man, "Bianlan Wang (Xu Chu) is a funny type with a missing front tooth and a contagious smile.The little girl" Doji "(Zhu Raning) is a girl. What I like is a nice emotional end but this gets a little executed in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, it includes a whole story of drama, suspense, humor and sadness, do not expect a good quality picture for the money you spend on DVD - until To view it on a widescreen screen, rent it.
