I came across this film from a friend who knows nothing about it, and turned out to be a wonderful documentary about a trip on an old ship across vast swathes of the ocean. Thier Herdel developed the theory that the ancient Incas in Peru were able to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on some of the effects in both places, certain types of old ships that we know are available, analysis of ocean and wind currents, In fact, an undetermined quantity in the sea. <br /> <br /> In order to test his hypothesis, Herald and his crew built a ship closely. As far as possible from the old Inca, using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time, and set off from Lima, the capital of Peru, to try to reach the islands of Polynesia, about 5000 miles. <br /> <br /> His theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but covering their journey provides strong support that it is right. The film is nothing more than an account of the shots taken during the campaign that lasted more than 100 days, but it is a very detailed description of what happened and the trials and tribulations they faced. I wish it was easy to find Oscar-winning documentaries, and this film, which goes back more than 50 years, is still interesting and informative and I'm sure it was when it was first released.
