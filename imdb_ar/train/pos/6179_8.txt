It's good to see that Vintage Film Buff correctly categorized the excellent DVD as "music," so this film is pure and simple. The murder plot is just an excuse to view my detailed daughter with Kitty Carlyle and Michael Gertrude leading a group of ultra-chic girls including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Paul, Beryl Wallace, Guinlian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Bresson is ready to give his strong voice to "cocktails for two". Be sure to be the most popular song in the film, heard at least four times. However, it is Michael Gertrude who steals the show, not only delivered with "Sweet Marijauna" but its strong performance as a rejected hero's friend. As for the rest of the actors, we could do that without Jack Oki and Victor McLaglin. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak vulnerability with the cult symbol, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how much of the rest of the comedy is so engrossed and too intense, the Magglagen super-simple inspector can not simply put his hands on the killer though, do you think, in this case happens to be the person you suspect most. Director Mitch Lizen actually goes to great pains to guide the killer to the dumbest member of the cinema by giving the player concerned close-up approach.
