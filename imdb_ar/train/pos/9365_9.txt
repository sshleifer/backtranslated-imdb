I saw this last night's show too. I was totally blown away in how much better this film was than I expected. There are not many movies that can combine the dark comedy and the current drama of the event and fail to sum it up. <br /> <br /> I will not bother rewriting the plot much because I think the less you know about this film. It makes it much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was refreshing and truly true. It was funny, and funnier than most of his recent comedy movies. Don Cheadle was as reasonable as ever. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as Burat or Billy Madison, but it has a good speed. I would say 90% of the audience laughed for most of the film. The middle of the film slows down to tackle the end of drama for things and does a wonderful job of connecting them together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really wonderful how instead of running a completely black friend / white friend thing they chose to ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
