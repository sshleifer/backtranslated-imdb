It's time to honor Charlton the great Houston after his last departure but this film is not the film. His other films of the last generation were Ben Hur, Top Ten, Omega Man and Canet of Abbey, and his works were better. <br /> <br /> This film, made in 1973, attempts to predict a future land, in 2022, is so dense that the human race has been manipulated by the authorities to eat a world-class food product called Soylent Green, Human flesh. This strange and illogical film was ridiculous at the time it is being released. It is assumed that India's population of about two billion people will be meat-eaters without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston marked this by the secret international conspiracy formulated by world powers to meet the food demands of overcrowded cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of this film, their green message is not the message of the Green Party in today's spirit. Thank God. The cannibals were practiced by indigenous people in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until just 40 years before the production of this film but it was abandoned for a long time by human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another ridiculous prediction in the film is that women have become sex slaves, repeating the trend of extreme femininity that was rising in 1972 when this film was produced. <br /> <br /> The movie was stupid at the time and is now ridiculous but contains a final film that is not mentioned after his late and great performance. Robinson, but there is still no good reason to review the film other than for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a failed film and I do not recommend it until the birth of Charlton or Charlton fans. All the other reviews of this film were read out loud in reference to a future pessimistic society whose central theme appears to be involving the United States of America in an environmental disaster. <br /> <br /> The only merit in the film is that Earth does not face population growth.
