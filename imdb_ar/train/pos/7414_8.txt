This was a very interesting film. A sense of humor, but influential in the family, the obligations that come with it. The story of a man returning home from his life in the city to his parents' bath house in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate, so he takes pride in the things he left at home to get away from. The film is visually beautiful as far as it is emotionally beautiful.
