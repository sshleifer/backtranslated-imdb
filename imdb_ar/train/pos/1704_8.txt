"I moved here to get away from this kind of thing!" Wretched small city Sheriff. <br /> <br /> "This happens a lot in Chicago?" Asks his deputy. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Mars make a mistake in re-broadcasting Halloween from World War I to Orson Wells as an invasion of the real invasion of Mars, and conclude that they need to enter the event! The following are a series of unfortunate incidents involving random attempts by Maritans to conquer Big Bean, IL. Everyone concludes that they are children wearing really good costumes, except the daughter of Sharif and her friend, a child wearing a suit. <br /> <br /> Mars themselves are comedians, and you have the impression that they pose no threat to anyone but themselves very early. It's a fun family movie.
