This beautiful film is a true tale of the bond between father and son. That's by far, Tom Hanks at his best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this film. He usually has nice guy roles. However, in this film, he sets off in this film as a bit angry, but he still smiles as a rosy smell, even until the last scene, the assassination of his character. The cast of this film has been well put together. I also love the part when there is complete silence when the character Tom Hanks shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something chilling and deep about any sound in this scene, just passion. I love the look on John Rooney, Paul Newman's face when he realizes even before his vision, that Tom Hanks's character is getting more vengeful, and knows that his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie, I was getting blown up and I knew I had to go out and get the video, and since then, I've added it to my collection of my favorite movies all the time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this film has my own niche.
