I watch the series again as soon as possible. I try to watch all Star Trek stuff. This is the third month, I am now in the third season of TNG has already gone through the DS9 fully. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever made. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first summary episode in the TNG series. After watching the shows, these new clips were in my mind, but I noticed how two of them were re-photographed because the film looked better. The first season was always dark and ugly for me - and the actors seemed ridiculous, as if they did not fit in with their roofs. <br /> <br /> The show consists mainly of the happiest songs. The harshest moments in Reker's life on the enterprise are up to this point. The Data and Riker scene on the deck of Hulu is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the second officer on board the Klingon challenge the authority of Riker, where the first officer and Riker beat the live CRAP of Klingon. Then the admiral kicked him $ but good. This entire episode serves as a reminder that many wonderful and crazy things have already happened in just two seasons with 5 other seasons to go and a handful of movies! At this stage of the series, they began to develop feelings linking Riker with Deanna Troi on behalf of Imzadi. Until this point they have mentioned the truth, but have not yet exploited it. Let the record show that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and indicates that she has intimate relationships with Riker and also remains very close to a romantic relationship. This episode also proves that there will be a romantic interest tense for each other for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By At this stage of the series, the production value reaches speed and Star Trek TNG is settled in the scientific giant that was supposed to Become. Looking back on this as an adult, I now see what Star Trek Universe is doing. They really need to set up a new ST set after all current offers. The DS9 movie was very nice.
