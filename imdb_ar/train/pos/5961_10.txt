I may be biased, and I am the author of The Hungry Bachelors Club, which was self-published in 1994. The script was written by my dear friend and hungry bachelor, Fred Drisch, who inspired Marlon in the film. I was not happier with the trailer, I hope to see the entire film and I will comment on it. But Gurga Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is a wonderful star. It holds the bulk of the emotional vehicles in good condition. I could not do myself better! This sounds like real people, barely led by the formula and fortunately leading my statement against racial prejudice back home, safely and faithfully.
