One must be very arrogant in fact not to be swept away by this film (and I've seen hundreds of Indian and Bollywood movies too). The actors, the beautiful settings, the sites, the surroundings, the deep feelings that were filmed, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice in Odette Narayan, my favorite) - everything was beautiful. Human element (non-ideal) was also woven, to create some drama and lead the plot, in addition to the opportunity to find a sincere solution. Alok Nath is a wonderful actor, he is open to the feelings of the characters he depicts, and almost steals the show of young stars. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves real romances - those that transcend surface beauty to true love - as one of the best films out there, Indian or otherwise!
