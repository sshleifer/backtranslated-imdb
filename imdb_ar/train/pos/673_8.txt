Through the great gap that we call understanding, there is still much that we do not know about, which was explained by the elders of the early tribes. In each case, there is a lot with regard to the dangers of knowing a lot. On the other hand, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they warn of is the "time of the end." In this film, "The Last Wave," an indigenous citizen is killed for no apparent reason. When officials are arrested, they remain silent and less disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the role of defense lawyer charged with defending the accused. Although haunted by the prophetic images of his childhood and warned of the recent signs given by his indigenous sympathizers named Chris Lee (David Golbilel), Burton continues to defend the violation as a tribal law and thus not subject to standard justice. The film is full of sweet and dark images that foreshadow the horrific disasters that end in the world and warn of the tsunami disaster and a future island. Black drama and deep rites are what give this movie a frightening attraction, and therefore it is not for the faint heart, in fact can continue the most horrific phenomena of years in the nightmares of innocent filmgoers. Silent drama is good. ****
