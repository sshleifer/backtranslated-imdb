After many years of waiting, the famous 1979 movie "The Neighboring House" was finally filmed. The result deviates slightly from the novel, especially in the first story of the trilogy that can be understood if it is unsatisfactory because it is a television movie, all very well absorbed and in fact, not as big as the book, one of Stephen King's favorites and one for me too. <br /> <br /> With more run-time and less restrictions as a theatrical version, it was possible to explore all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous modern home and its exploration and sponsorship, especially the peak revelation near the end. <br /> <br /> However, the whole dice works well in this thoughtful story of irrational hatred. There are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing climate of panic is sophisticated. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes involves the abstract painting of the house by its neighboring amateur and neighboring artists who try to depict its corruption on canvas. <br /> <br /> Be sure to read the great novel.
