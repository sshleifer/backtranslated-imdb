Sudden Impact is the best five Dirty Harry movies. They do not come in any way more fragile than this, as Harry infiltrates through a series of violent clashes, where the bad guys get their fair sweets. This is how I like it. A very big story and aptly directed by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment.
