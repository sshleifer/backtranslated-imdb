This is the feature of Paul F. Ryan is the first and only. He has not done anything since. However, he managed to get an amazing crew to film the characters of his story. I do not know when and why the idea appeared in his head, but Ryan wrote a screenplay that later became his home movie. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps carries the movie on her shoulders Alicia, a troubled girl; the ones we always see in the television series. With dark hair and black clothes. Pack of cigarettes in the pocket, strange look and annoying eyes (with makeup, of course). An event occurred at her school. shooting. Some students died and saw everything. Now investigator Martin van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case, and as expected, Alicia is suspected. But the shooting is just Genesis. The film does not revolve around shooting. <br /> <br /> Lying on the bed in the hospital room is Diana Cartwright (Erika Christensen). She is one of the survivors of the hospital. The script creates an association between them, by the principal (James Pickens Jr). It helps all students recover from this event, but it seems that Alicia does not care. It's isolated. So the manager punishes her; she needs to visit Diana every day until five o'clock. Then the film begins. <br /> <br /> I can not even describe the greatness of writing a film. I can identify the personalities and attitudes in which they live; I really like. These things can happen to anyone. And the things they say are perfectly understandable. They grow up and try to deal with things they have not experienced; they are doing their best. Without knowing this, Alicia (when she visits Diana for the first time) and Diana (when she sees Alicia standing in front of her) begin a journey that will determine her characters and thoughts for the next step in life; after high school. <br /> <br /> Director Kristensen and Phillips lead their roles very well. Look at the contradiction between them. Our religion seems naive and clear-cut. No complexity within her mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees lots of flowers, she asks, "Who brought her?" "Many people," Diana replied; although we learned a few days later that they were her parents, who came every week. All patriarchal figures are well represented, but not as important as the personalities of their children. Diana is lonely. Alicia looks mature and violent; smoking cigarettes and talking almost. But two days after the visit, she finds herself returning to the hospital every day; even sleeping in Diana's room all night. When both fight a battle afterwards, I think Diana says, "Why do you keep coming back?" Alicia is also single. <br /> <br /> The end of the film, without destroying it, comes a little disappointing; it's something I did not wait for. It eliminates some of the film's power. Revelation comes absolutely unnecessary. Destroy the logical peak of the movie. It was an excellent script anyway. And the direction is excellent. A wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Erika Christensen, it was the role he needed to fly higher. Its role in the "traffic" was impressive, but this was the big step; the main role. Many people may not have had a chance to see her in this film, which is unfortunate. You have not made a wrong move since then. I came out with good shows in awful movies. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who proved very promising in this film (a transformation), did not get many opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> (in the output, from the fuck), I expect he is now sitting in his computer finishing the new script; I am waiting for his next film. I wish them all the best.
