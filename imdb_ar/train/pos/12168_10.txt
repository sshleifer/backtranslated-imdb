"A Guy Thing" may not be classy, ​​but it's definitely a good comedy and funny. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after a bachelor's party with no memory and Becky (Julia Stills) lying naked in his bed. Before he can figure out what happened, Becky runs from his apartment because his fiancée Karen (Salma Blair) is coming. Then, as you can imagine, the chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" laughs loudly. The most poignant moments come when Paul imagines what can happen if he tells Karen. Salma Blair is a truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that she suffers from misuse. Although they turned out to be more funny than the Stills character, which is not really interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Guy Thing" is not classy, ​​but it is not too bad, 7/10.
