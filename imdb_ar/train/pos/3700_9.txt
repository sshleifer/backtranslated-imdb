Cameron Grant is one of the best directors who make films for adults. His only rival is Andrew Blake. Celeste is dynamite throughout the film but the DR office sequence with two other ladies is unbelievable. Asia Carrera's performance is good with the construction factor. I highly recommend this film and gave it 9. It is almost as good as the "Elements of Desire for Cameron Grant" which I gave 10.
