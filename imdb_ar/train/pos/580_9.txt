When I first saw this film I was with my father. He encouraged me to watch this film because it was among his favorites. After watching the movie immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A river passes through it, circling two brothers, each taking a different path in life. Norman McLean (Craig Scheffer) is the eldest of the two brothers on the road to education. Paul McLean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious little brother who walks along a road full of obstacles. The film follows these characters, each of which follows its own path. <br /> <br /> There is no negative side to this film. You'll be entertained all the way through. Representation, direction, and scenario is all perfect. Two exceptional things are cinema and the result. They both involve you in the world Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that surrounds you from classic movies. It is certainly in my book. If you do not see this movie, be sure to watch it as soon as possible because it will stay with you forever.
