Soylent Green Classic. I was waiting for someone to do that. He seems to be making science fiction classics these days, and I hope some directors / producers will re-perform Soylent Green. With today's computer animation technology, it will have the ability to be a great image. Anti-utopian films may not be elusive. Human species reproduce like cockroaches with no external effect to reduce it. We, as humans, have the option of placing kebabs on producing less species if they are out of control, but there is nothing to control human reproduction except for ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortion, birth control, etc., the human race continues to multiply like bacteria in a petri dish. Classical Malthusian economies state that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond livelihoods. 6 billion and growing ... This is obscene.
