Vandals are in order to make a note. <br /> <br /> After twenty years of 1984, this film talks about the prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There's a scene that sums up Prince's musical output over the past 10 years. If you get the best of the last 10 albums, you'll get one great album! <br /> <br /> The scene plays this way. Prince runs into his dressing room after playing a single song and the club owner enters the dressing room to give the prince his voice about his fall of grace during the 1990s and put on albums that only the most hardcore fans can tolerate with technical support. <br /> <br /> The owner of the club - "You do not pack them as you used to, the only person who digs your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! What about a musical undercurrent that makes the prince more evil when Appolonia hits the ground in two separate scenes! It gave me chills that this was not the only scene that mistreated him in this film. <br /> <br /> I'm all for the comedy spree between Maurice Day and Jerome Benton, where these two people stole every scene they were in. But what was funny about throwing a woman in a trash can? It was so bad! The other bad thing was the outline of the prince's chalk on the ground provided by the Minneapolis police carefully, making the prince move further! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertainment film in general, with the soundtrack of Prince songs increasing by 110%. But again, the film gives us another theory about the prince and his music, where the film tells us that the biggest song of the prince of the film by Wendy and Lisa and the wife of the princes beat the father of music! <br /> <br /> Is the prince trying filmmakers to tell us that the prince stole all his songs from his father after he found the songs of his father's songs written? Perhaps for this reason the Prince began to run out during the nineties because he ran out of ideas of his fathers ??? ........... Hmmm .....
