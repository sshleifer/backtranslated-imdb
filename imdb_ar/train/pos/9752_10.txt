I remember clearly seeing this when I was three years old, and then my parents signed up by chance for all but a few seconds with some other animation. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I discovered him, and since I was able to understand things better, I thought it was a good movie at the time. It was only a few weeks ago (June 2006) when it was rediscovered with some online articles / videos, not the movie itself. I'm sure they are still good with the kids, but for us 20-30 somethings it is definitely "written cult" written everywhere. It is a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave it enough time, it would probably be more popular today. Maybe if they rephrase it with a different story and the sound of all the stars, it might be, but that's what Fox decides. I'm wandering around here, I know. I still think it's a wonderful movie, but it could be better than wonderful.
