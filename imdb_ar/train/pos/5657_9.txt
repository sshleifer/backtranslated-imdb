I remember watching American Gothic when it first aired, and I went to my mind recently, all I could remember was that the same guy appeared in the Midnight Caller, Gary Cole, and I do not watch much TV, but I watched American Gothic, I bought a whole series on This DVD is this week and still as good as it has always been, this is one of the best TV series ever, and the reason I do not watch too much TV is that it's just garbage running, except Derren Brown, All Reality TV or Soaps, like Grease and Big Brother etc., I was fed up with it, and got a whole string of American Gothic for $ 16.97 pounds From the Asda website, which is the cheapest I can find.
