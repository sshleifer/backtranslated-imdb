Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10:00 pm. One night, I could not sleep until about 3:00 AM <br /> <br /> This short review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I am a long time fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say this is the best episode I have ever seen. I'm not saying that everyone should feel that way, but I feel it. This episode is similar to the weekend I spent with my family, watching my father, and coma in the intensive care unit before his death. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he is a salesman. You have made a mistake in identifying a man named Kevin Vinerty. <br /> <br /> By the time 10 minutes passed, I knew Tony was dreaming, or was watching another program. It was not like the regular soprano and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks up at the sky in "Spotlight for a helicopter" and see it move, a doctor with a flashlight. We see this only for a moment and sequence sequence until we return to real life in a situation similar to the situation I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Tony came out of the coma for just a moment. His children take A.J. The house and Carmilla, overcome by tension, collapse in the gallery: the moment of signing in the ring. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we connect the real world: the family that deals with the potential negative outcome of this coma and Tony's alternative reality, which parallels what is happening in his mind and in the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the star point in the episode: After AJ finishes telling his mother that he is well thought out, she goes to see Mido sitting next to Anthony. <br /> <br /> She approaches Tony, offering the best line of the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In the Tony world, a hotel room enters a dark and the light goes out. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to communicate, but he can not - as if he were trying to say something back to Carmela, but he could not physically attend himself to do so. Not yet. <br /> <br /> Sitting and looking at his window. It now seems that the twinkling light that has reappeared throughout the episode calls to him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When the air is cold I want to die" by Mobi, who is completely married to these last images and helps create an emotional guidance tool for the episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Note: Watch the next episode. Find what is light. It's wonderful.
