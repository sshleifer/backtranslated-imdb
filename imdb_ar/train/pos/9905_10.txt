I've lost the number of reviews I've written on the Slaughter High program. I read a lot of bad and I'll say now it's a great movie. Simon Scudamur was famous for his famous suicide, although this was the only film, but it made the film great. At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Then I discovered that because of the current web page at www.IMDb.com he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic personality that man has ever known, but his real life was certainly his strength and weakness. He did a good job acting, who can disagree? I was always wondering how he felt that he was showing himself naked in a movie. It must be very embarrassing to say the least. I first saw this film when I was 12 years old in sixth grade. I agree with some pointers such that the girl will not bathe after killing someone, and that high schools do not have bathtubs! I think Caroline Monroe, who was then 36 years old, was the only other star who had any talent for acting, and unfortunately for Simon's death, he did not make any future films. The reason (s) of suicide is a mystery, and hope to be discovered in the near future. When you do mathematics on his web page, he tells you that he was 29 years old when he was slaughtered. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs, making the best horror film. Perhaps because of their terrible behavior, others have not made a name for filmmaking. Jacob Young
