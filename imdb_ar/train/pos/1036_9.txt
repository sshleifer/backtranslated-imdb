Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films produced during World War II. Paul Lucas was definitely worth his Oscar. The House of Davis is brilliantly featured as a great actress and beauty. I recommend this film to those interested in that era, and of course the wonderful films of the great expatriate, Mrs. Pete Davis.
