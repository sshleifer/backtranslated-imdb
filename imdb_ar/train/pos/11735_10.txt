This film is pure Elvira and shows it in her chest ... I mean the best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson, the changing ego in Elvira) is an inspiring and captivating story and shows in life the intelligence and charm of Elvira. The viewer gets a chance to see Elvira in a new light as she struggles with the prejudices of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she traveled from Los Angeles to attend her great Aunt Morgana reading) while trying to help teenagers who have suffered long and who have been deprived of fun by Spontaneous security and the rest of the city council. She must also deal with her appeal to Bob Redding, the local film owner, and another woman (Patty) who watches her for Bob too, but is not as well entitled to his love as Elvira. Later in the film, she also confronts the complexities of the decline of "a famous figure in metaphysics" and a witchcraft charge against her which means she will be burned to the test. Elvira was able to be attractive and perilous, wandering the streets and naive in this film, while cracking up rising jokes and making lines beyond the dual meaning. <br /> <br /> This movie is inspiring because it sends a message never to give up on yourself and always try to follow your dreams. Eventually the dreams of Elvira finally come true, and this is the best thing that can happen to this uniquely designed wonderful woman. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie countless times and never tired! There were no unnecessary scenes and I found myself fascinated throughout the film. The review will not correct the real film, so I can just tell you to watch it because it's one of the best movies I've ever made! At the same time, I wish you "unpleasant dreams!"
