I saw the subtitle as it was in Russian, but I really enjoyed it. Sasha's main character was cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger made him do deadly things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love for a young woman called Katya, everyone tried to take her away from him in a deadly battle. There was a lot of weight, but not much for the weak stomach sufferers. <br /> <br /> Not for people who love the usual Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent movies. Kinda I got a sense of Asian fantasy film.
