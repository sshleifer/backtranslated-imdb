I found this movie hilarious. It was a parody of other popular films at the time of the most beautiful I've seen in this genre of film. Try it. If you watch the movies that spoil this movie, and get the humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I felt (and the people who saw the movie with me) part of the film (this is not a spoiler because I will not tell you what is actually happening) was a "startling" scene from the MIB. When they discover the device for the first time and do not know what to do ... then again later in the movie ... you will understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is that I never found it on a DVD so I could buy a copy.
