I admit that I have a shortage of alternative history stories, from ITS A LONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY to 12:01 among those great little jewelers. MR is very difficult to get. DESTINY Without giving a nod to each member of the cast, from James Belushi, the heart of the murderous Courtney Cox, this film lacks weight and size to make it a great film, but it is a great pleasure on a rainy afternoon. It is also a great rental for an inexpensive date.
