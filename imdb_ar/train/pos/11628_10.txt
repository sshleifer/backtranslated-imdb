"I did not want it to be complicated, no, I suppose she would read it." Fear takes a trip at 30,000 feet in this suspense, Thriller movie. The journey to Miami soon becomes a battle for survival when Lisa (Rachel Mac Adams) realizes that her colleague (Celian Murphy) plans to use her as part of a frightening assassination plot. Over time, they compete with time to warn potential victims before its end. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I liked this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also my best representatives. For example, the early scenes at the airport resemble a romantic comedy: two people continue to run in each other .... I also dealt with them, to make a film like this work. In particular, Murphy's personality .. Jackson who seems to be somewhat complicated to act in a charming and innocent manner, but tries to do his work and makes Lisa feel physically and mentally besieged. I mean, in some parts, he seems to be really interested in Lisa. <br /> <br /> A wonderful journey of excitement. Lots of movies that I hate to watch a series or a whole series of movies, but I really would not mind getting a set of these movies, which will be done with Jackson that scans Lisa. Perhaps the favorite scene is the headbutt scene, because it was not expected. There was also a nice accumulation of the famous "pen" scene. When will it be transferred? There was also a nice change in Lisa McAdam, where she changed herself from the victim to fighting again. I also liked the place where you sat in the dining room and pretended to ask some ladies about a questionnaire about the dining room. How great Murphy was with every weekend .....
