It has been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used Wall Street to tell us that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes a GG character and turns into a Secret Service agent, Beth Garrison. guess what? it's working! This strong political excitement kept me guessing. Detailed work on the security precautions taken by the Special Security Forces on behalf of the President and First Lady was interesting. All the prospects were good, but, as I tried, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. While Judy Foster made you attached to the belief and really believes that she is the FBI agent Starling in the movie "Silence of the Lambs", you do not feel the same feeling with Longoria. However, this is a fun movie, fugitive entertainment with Beltway as background.
