Often, the film can make the whole audience laugh, and after five minutes he fills his eyes with tears. Many films try to do this, but few can make the emotional impact of this film. Adam Sandler draws you in practice with his hot and violent explosions often, but it makes you laugh too when the shadow of his past is not pulled away. I will not spoil anything, but there is one scene in particular that should hit your eyes and shake your lip. Even the most muscular men have to be children without heart to feel nothing while watching this movie. Don Cheadle offers another great performance, but Sandler is a genius. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith offer strong performances, but there is nothing in the leadership line. The spirit of humor in Sandler still exists, which actually saved this film from depression on the border. There are many laughs, but do not think you will stay there for a long time, because it becomes dangerous again without warning. <br /> <br /> I can continue to talk about how successful this film is to continue around all the feelings of the human body, but I will shorten these feelings. I feel there is no need to tell you anything else. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it is played on a DVD, the time is 100% worth. The film is very moving and it certainly puts tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless you are of course without spirit.
