This small episode of Smallville may be the best episode to be broadcast since reunion. This is for many reasons. For example, the string returns to some of its roots. Welcomes Lionel's return from the supposed long absence, with Luthorcorp's office in Metropolis. This room has not been in Smallville for too long, and seeing it again brings back many memories of the past in Smallville. Not to mention that Leonels' talks with Lex are always impressive. <br /> <br /> Among other nice returns, ultraviolet radiation has been well guessed, is Bart Allen (also known as Implace), AC (also known as Aquaman) and Victor Stone (also known as Cyborg). Not only did Steven Dennit reunite former racers in justice, but he mixed it up with the formula of Smallville in a unique way, so it looked like a feature film. <br /> <br /> From there you get to the basic story, Green Arrow forms a league, tries to blow up 33.1, gets captured by Bart, saves Clark, and the facility is blown to Com Kingdom. Everything is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, speed and suspense. Oh, Cyborg has some wonderful new promotions that really meet the justice league personality :). <br /> <br /> It is probably music that makes this episode work well. If you remember correctly, the first episode directed by Steven Dennett was directed by Agless from Season 4. This was a modest episode, but there was something that seemed inappropriate. Maybe music, or acting, or the fact that Clark says in the end "We did not find you, our grandmother", kind of people have lost their confidence in the formula. But fortunately, Steve Deknight regained himself in this justice ring. <br /> <br /> I had some concerns about the justice that made them less than 10. First, first, the very mountainous exit of the Justice League from the expulsion of the Ridge facility. I mean it would be much cooler if you said Green Arrow and Cyborg on the Oliver bike (remember from the arrow ring). Clark and Imbles must be clearly running, and Asaman must have swam across another road. But it was unbelievably cowardly, he got two points out of the top ten points. <br /> <br /> Second, there is another cheese moment, not as bad as the first, but when Green Arrow says "Let's go save the world." Which made me humble. All in all, if you look at performance by acting, music, direction and production values, the pros outweigh the negatives, and this is still one of the best episodes in the history of Smallville, probably the second best episode of season 6. <br /> <br /> 7 10 ...
