I saw this movie when I was a kid. Dawn me away. It was days before television, so a film of this size could send a small child into orbit. I was so impressed that I went to watch this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were too far ahead of time. Sabo was a real delight, as was Rex Ingram like a genie. I found myself singing "I Want to Be a Sailor" for several months after the movie left the city. I recommend this movie to anyone I forgot to mention Conrad Fayed, who was a sinister character just as you would like to meet him. Also, June Duprez was not as wonderful as it was in this picture. The color was wonderful. Give this movie AAA!
