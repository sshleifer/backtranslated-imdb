With films such as Wallace, Grommet and Chicken Run under their belts, the good people on the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, are now giving us a bit of twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts." <br /> <br /> "Creature Comforts" is derived from a short period that was accomplished early in their careers, a presentation from the segments of life where snippets of conversation are removed from context and given to an animal of some kind. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animation has traveled across the country to interview people with malicious questions such as "Are you a liar?" Then things speed up a bit about the question about their sexuality. <br /> <br /> Answers, though tedious and mundane, are actually very funny, when you understand that dialogues come first and add animals later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the person who makes his statements? One of the characters who discusses what he is looking for in a woman, "I love them a bit of thinness." It is an insect, walking stick. <br /> <br /> There are dogs discussing smells and smells, while inhaling behind a dog, while talking about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. Since the "wife" tells the breed that she is healthy, her long-suffering husband stands beside her and says nothing. <br /> <br /> While it may take some "comfortable creatures" some time to find it "legs", you should find a place on the TV for those who are tired of the ordinary. While there are more reality programs than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of the qualities that are definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Some humor may seem lively, it's the clay that catches children's attention (like the old Batman series of the 1960s, jokes are so subtle that children do not get it), jokes for adults.
