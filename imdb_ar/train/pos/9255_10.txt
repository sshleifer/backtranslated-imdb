If you want to have fun with a lot of hidden humor, you will enjoy this veto. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why no one will enjoy this. Take it for what it is: A vehicle for Dennis Hopper to hit your head and make you laugh. It is not Shakespeare, but it is well done. Erika Ilniak is very beautiful and carries in this episode - better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows humor talent. Unfortunately, it has not had many opportunities for expansion. <br /> <br /> Tom Bringer fits his role in the "real Navy" completely, and William McNamara does a solid job as an impostor. /> Throw a stroll by Huber in the middle of chasing "Cherry on this Sundae" and got a movie that kept my attention and kept laughing. You purchased this device as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain candy.
