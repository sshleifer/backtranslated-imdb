I was hoping this would be a good lover for James Timothy Dalton fans, and although it was not a "third bond outing" he deserved, it was just a laugh. Balochi brought some good humor to his side, and Dalton installed it well, but perhaps too little. For his part, he loved the camp version of Jack Nicholson in a few good men. The other British was a bit awful, but the laughter was exaggerated.
