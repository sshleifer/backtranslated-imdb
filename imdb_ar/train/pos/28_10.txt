Here is another proof of the claim that we all have to worship Italian giallo and recognize that it is the most unique subtype in horror. The Emily Miraglia's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" is completely charming of original conspiracy values, elegant production values, charming music, brilliant acting talent, and a series of creative murders. He is a wonderful Gilo (released in the Golden Year 1972) and belongs to the top five among all Italian film lovers. The story is not just a sex-loving, sex-loving killer, but a mix of good old revenge with the myth of the deadly Red Queen. At an early age, their grandfather tells brothers who are constantly fighting Kitty and Evelyn about a strange lady, who kills once every 100 years on April 6, seven people whose sister was the inevitable last victim. Fourteen years later, Katie has designed the successful dances of a prominent design agency (to share her bed with the director general) when the murder gap begins. Sister Evelyn was the obvious culprit, but she moved to the United States recently ... or was she? Your stay is complex and complex and involves red herring every few minutes and Red Queen's character is definitely the most spectacular killer in Giallo's history. Her face can never be seen, but she wears a red cloak and produces a very awful laugh when a new victim is committed. It's not too nice, as its victims are brutally stabbed with a dagger, dragged behind cars and even broken into fences! The latter is really one of the greatest acts of violence (= the ugliest) that I have ever seen! What more could you possibly ask? Some nudity is neat and delicious, maybe? The brilliant actress got this more than just covered, including Barbara Bushett and Shabelle Siebel Daning. Emilio Marilia is not the most famous director in Giallo, because he made this only and recommended "Evelyn's Night Out of the Grave" to the same degree, but its impact and significance should not be forgotten.
