All the reviews here about the amount of ZP lack of conspiracy, wooden representation, the senseless ornament scene, etc., all lost the main point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. It was a film produced in the tough times of the late 1960s and early 1970s in Los Angeles. It's a movie to watch while H-I-G-H is out of your mind for some narcotics. <br /> <br /> Look for nice buds and millet, or get a light hit of acid. Seriously, these reviews directly and carefully from the ZP miss this point. You can not get anything out of this movie in a mental frame. <br /> <br /> Until you see this movie on the big screen (which I am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was very rare) you excel, you have no idea what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching it without poisoning, you can at least appreciate the end when the folly goes up to the wonderful soundtrack of Pink Floyd's "Careful With That Ax, Eugene", "Come 51, Your Time Up" .
