Although I did not really feel anything about Lance's personality, I felt that his wife was able to work better with anyone else. It could have been a much stronger film if they spent more time developing their character, perhaps with Lance - I wish it would be better. <br /> <br /> However, I must fully agree with DoyleLuver, when they said "In the words of the character Glen Queen Bin:" I am the star here, that's right I'm talented! "If you watch the movie, just watch it, even when it is in the background ... only facial expressions, all in the eyes, you certainly know what motivates Ben, exactly how he feels towards the comments, even if they are a quick look behind the character's back. Great acting in a fair movie.
