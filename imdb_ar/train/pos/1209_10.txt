In the age of these terrible cartoons, I am shocked when I see a good-sounding film making it into the lower IMDB list of animated films. <br /> <br /> This film contrasts with the first one. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the target age group for this film, I did not notice it, and I did not care if I did. People who made it "the new generation" may have used it to signal that this is another way the Care Bear family can begin. Maybe we should have decided for ourselves how the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> It was my favorite movie at 3-6 years old, and it did not scare me or embarrass me at all. <br /> <br />
