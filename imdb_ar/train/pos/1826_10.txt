I loved this movie when I was small. Today at the age of seventeen is one of my favorite animation movies all the time. Beautiful animation and attractive characters are just two things you like about this movie. Although many people may not enjoy some of the songs, most of them are good performing and consistent with the story. He focuses on Charlie, a handsome German Shepherd who may seem unpopular at first ... but in the end he will win you. <br /> <br /> It's not a children's movie. Often very dark and sometimes scary. A treat for lovers without blues and animation enthusiasts. But do not keep the tissues in hand. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and we will do the same for those who are allergic to the film. It can be said that one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of all time. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A celestial masterpiece.
