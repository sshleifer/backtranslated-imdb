I saw "pitch fever" a kind of coincidence; he was playing on a plane bound for Europe. In fact it was not half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the number one Red Sox fan in the world, but his relationship with Lindsay Mix (Drew Barrymore) may strain it. The film is a fairly interesting look at how global events affect people's relations. It is particularly interesting now that Red Sox has finished its 80-year losing plan. I think these kinds of things happen all the time and we do not tend to notice them. Not so bad. <br /> <br /> Another film that depicts an unusual relationship to baseball is "Frequency" of 2000. Check them both.
