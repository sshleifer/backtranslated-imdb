This is a trio of anecdotes, Shakti, Devi, and Cali, about a pilot community (or something like that) called the Taylor-Ericsson group, which took people on trips within themselves and into an unknown world, Damage here and there, I would say. After many years, some of this damage is still complete and waiting for the right moment to show itself. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died in mysterious circumstances, in fact, torn, and the suspect was a man probably did not exist. It seems that this woman is able to show some inner devil, or even discover the sister of the man who was killed when she tried to talk to this woman while pretending to be a reporter. Davy tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump from his skin." He is head-shaven, obsessed with speed, and sent to see a psychiatrist who happened to be a former member of the municipality, helping the young doctor achieve his wish. This is probably the best of the three parts. Cali tells the story of the wizard, who tries to "heal" this woman who was part of this group and leaves some kind of devil who lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did it or if she lost it because of that she can no longer survive. All these three stories are creepy and wonderful because you are never sure what to expect, and the premise and settings are quite different from the traditional horror movies that add to the strangeness. This contains a kind of low budgets and a sense of it, but it is also able to evoke a largely creepy atmosphere, thanks in large part to it. I've seen this with my mouth hanging a good part of the time, and when the real fears (and gore) have become very strong. I found this movie very exciting and very disturbing and I loved it so much. Find a little good, this one, I would give it 8 out of 10.
