Not sure what to expect from this film. I love watching Brosnan in any film, it's always good, but that was quite different. He is in a mess, and plays being in a state of chaos. In fact, remind me myself several times in uni :) So, yes, there is not much violence, there is not much work, but the dialogue collides, the representation is wonderful and very refreshing, which is also very funny :) I do not think you will come out of the cinema "Wow I was blown away, "but you'll come out smiling after enjoying a good movie. You can not claim more. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, some genius will turn the advertising roller wrong and turn into an inverted upside down heart (with the reverse sound of ads!) Nothing like watching Jack Daniels' advertisement where the drink returns to the bottle Of glass with an American comment "Twin Tops" :)
