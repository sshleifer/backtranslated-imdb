The film conjures up as unbearably gloomy and unbearably frustrating as the mythical misery and emptiness of the controversial Huilibek novel of the same name. Like many French films, her style is deep but painfully slow - or should it be slowly painful? Although this film is excellent and challenging, it is not a fun film and it is difficult to think of it at any time when a person may be in a "suitable" state to see it.
