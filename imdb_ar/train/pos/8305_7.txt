I really enjoyed the film, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had a lot of things happening in his life. First of all, I did not know Lucille. There is very little reference (hardly any male) to females that are closely involved with Little Richard. Even in his life today, there is no mention of any female involvement in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life is not mentioned. Overall the movie was fantastic. I also did not like Leon playing the role of Little Richard, he is a good actor but I feel he should have gone to a different actor. He visually did not mention Little Richard. I did not quite realize the mixing that Little Richard had part of. Of the film was filmed as a sexual addiction. At present, he will be referred to the counseling for adding citizenship. He was a voyeur. I do not want to damage the film to someone who has not seen the movie, but there were several things about the film I feel was not supposed to be part of the final film.
