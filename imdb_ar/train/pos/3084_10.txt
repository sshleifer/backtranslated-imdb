Hey man, why? "Six Degrees" is a presentation about this alleged theory that is all related to someone. If they focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard this show, I did not get noticed at all. Sounds very ordinary, in fact. Then, I saw some episodes ... and I loved her! First of all, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is an alcohol addict, a woman cheating on her fianc√©, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on ... Unlike what we used to, most people interact with each other in losses, as in our daily routine. Great! My favorite friends are Mai and Carlos Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then, the cast. They're all fantastic. Jay Hernandez, of "Hostel," shows his three-dimensional character more than his previous work in Paxton. Others also make great performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I came to IMDb, after seeing some episodes, I could not believe it was canceled. Seriously, I can not understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It's very bad because he has not had more than one season. It will really be a good show to follow!
