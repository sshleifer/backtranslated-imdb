Johnny To makes here one of the best elegance exercises, making a strong film with the good Yakuza story. The election of Yakuza's new president is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, violence is used wisely in context, making a very powerful film. I particularly like the way he tells history, moves around all the roles within the Yakuza family, and makes us see violence, like the only way they have to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Talking about, the technical aspects, the film is a good example of the way Temporarily paused and rhythmic and plotted to film a film. One of Hong Kong's films this year. Is like infernal affairs, but without violence scenes easy action, confused story. Highly recommended for all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my english, better in spanish lol)
