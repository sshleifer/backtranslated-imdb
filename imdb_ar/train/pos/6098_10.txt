This is a single TV show based on a horror movie that gets it correctly. Friday the 13th series has no connection to movies. The evil spirit of inheritance: I'm not sure. It may have been loosely connected to movies. It looks like they're giving a famous title in a show so viewers can see it. <br /> <br /> It shows Freddy burned by parents on Elm Street (in the first episode I think) and how parents were disappointing. With all the children targeted in the first 3 films, you expect a larger number of parents. But okay. <br /> <br /> Freddy is basically the narrator. Watching the actions of people in the real world sometimes get involved in some way. Just like other anthology shows such as tales of a crypt, there is a supernatural or sudden evolution involved. <br /> <br /> Representation is lacking or true or not: Violence sometimes transcends movie violence. This show continued for a few seasons and was soon introduced to the fourth film. I heard that it was canceled because of parents' protest. I've seen a lot of things classified as "R" as a child, so it was a shame that the parents ruined it for everyone. 4 other films came after the series, so it was not a complete loss.
