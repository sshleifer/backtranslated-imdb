Without a doubt, Beat Street is the best film about the fracture scene. All about it is spot, clothes (Puma), music, and most importantly dancing! A basic story, but hey what's there to tell a story? The full aim of the film is to show what children were doing at that moment in time, and what interests them. It shows that teenagers are generally good. All that matters to them every day is music, dance and friendship. After watching the DVD recently, I was pleasantly surprised at how long it was to withstand the test of time! The clothes did not look old (probably because Puma has a huge return now), the music still looks fresh, and the dance is still asbre to watch. Anyone between the ages of 10 and 25 should be seen as part of their youth culture.
