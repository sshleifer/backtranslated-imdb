Given the size of these films, you should be happy to make them. The film focuses on a house that strangely accommodates everyone who lives there. Philip Rhyson (Peter Cushing), who is a little closer to the wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), who is obviously his daughter's facade. Actor Paul Henderson (John Pertoy), is about to get too personal. <br /> <br /> "The House That Dripped Blood" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it's starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Apart from being just a ranking, there may be some tones: the question of real horror versus supposed terror may be questioned. As in The Shining, we may ask whether the house / hotel itself holds some of the memory of past events. And if there is nothing else at all, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul's co-star) is too hot! Soon after that appearance, she starred in "Dracula Countess" and "Vampire Lovers" (with Peter Cushing too). You may still be - like Barbara Steele - known only as the Queen of Scream, but mark my words: She's a hot cry queen! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele taking part in a tournament. <br /> <br /> I think the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott wears a pink shirt and a thin jacket. You read this right. What kind of name is "Denholm" anyway? Oh, okay. Very cool movie
