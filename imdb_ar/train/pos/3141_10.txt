Let's face it: the last season (No. 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I ever enjoyed (mostly, I did not find dry spells that last a whole season). But if you judge this offer last season, it will of course be less. This is a totally unfair assessment - because the '70s Show' was, in its day, a wonderful and fun comic play about a past era and how the people who lived there were not quite different from what we are here in modern times. <br /> <br /> Well ... Ignore Season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace plays Erik Foreman, a horny obsession with a teenager who has a constant love for Donna (Laura Prepon), the next-door girl. While playing their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mella Cones (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fes) and Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) offer great performances in almost every episode. The best is Fez, a mentally ill foreign exchange student. from which country is he? Try to figure it out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith have the role of parent Eric. Rupp, like Kitty, is gorgeous and sweet, like Mrs. Brady meets Mary Barone, while Smith's Red is mainly found to intimidate the dowry of everyone. He plays without Stark and Tanya Roberts very well in the face of each other as Donna's parents, namely Bob Choufini but the beloved and Mido. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances like Leo, a stoning that mimics Hyde's character. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the outdated errors that appear frequently and the overall lessons that sometimes come (and in this unfortunate last season), "The Seventies" is a wonderful show with amazing writing, an immediate direction and a good sense of pulse In each episode. They're all fine.
