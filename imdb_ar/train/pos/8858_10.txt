I have to admit that this is the kind of film I usually avoided, but I hired it mainly because of the stars. Definitely not sorry. In fact, as you can see, I have a five star value. This film is a perfect combination of sharp output and superior acting. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the illegal crime of stealing their parents' jewelry shop. The commission of the crime is a fatal mistake - thus starting the examination of the three men in the Hanson family. Through a series of memories of the past, we met Charles Hanson and reached an understanding of the tense relationship between father and children. <br /> <br /> Little brother, Hank is basically. He always had trouble filling a job as he walked in the direction of the wind. Hank is insecure, cowardly, and under the influence of his big brother. Ethan Hawk enjoys the character of Hank "nailed to T" and gives his best performance so far. It shows us a man who has good faith in the first place but is so deeply influenced by external forces that he is unable to pursue any important task. <br /> <br /> On the surface, Andy appears to be a successful businessman, but we soon discovered that he was addicted to drugs and was stealing from his company to pay for his habit. It is Indy who sets a plot to steal his parents' shop, and gets a weak-willed Hank to commit the act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - certainly one of the best actors of our time - plays the role of Andy. Hoffman is a actor who has the ability to portray a man, on the surface, is a charming businessman who is loved by his acquaintances but the real mud ball underneath. It is perfectly ideal for a part of Andy or it may be said that through his superior acting skills, he made Andy the perfect part. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays the role of father in his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or bad man, but he has a bad relationship with his children because he did not really understand what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself. He has always been very quick in criticism and preaching. He has always made it clear that he prefers his younger son to the bigger one, causing a wide emotional split between him and Andy. When we get to know Charles and Andy, Andy's idea of ​​a plan to steal from his father becomes less believable. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not believe how Charles Hanson reminded me of my own memory. Father, how much Andy reminded me of my brother and my personality. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why I enjoyed the film, like the story of the remote father, critic, bigger older brother, and younger, less successful younger brother who was very close to home. Luckily, my brother and I have never reached a state of crime against my father - I think we have made more stricter and more ethical things. <br /> <br /> This complex of characters and actions was brought together by the director, Sydney Lumet. In the eighty-third, he still has pieces that allow the public to engage the characters and actions of the edge of the hypnotic seat. 12 Angry Men His first film was made 50 years ago in "Before the Devil Discovers You're Dead," but he did not lose anything of his magical touch with characters we have long remembered. <br /> <br /> The events and characters in The Before the Devil Knows You Dead are harsh and unattractive, and this is certainly not a great film. However, it is two hours of final entertainment which I highly recommend.
