The life and time of Little Richard, as Little Richard, as Little Richard produced and directed, was one-sided as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a documentary drama, but it has a good writing and great energy and a prominent actor plays Richard. All the music is composed by Little Richard, so she shakes her narrow brow on each song. <br /> <br /> The film covers his early childhood, and during the formative years of music, the wild success and the throwing of Richard all this for the Lord's joy. Everything well connected and a clear return in 1962 managed to get away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles, who opened it in front of him. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that his blatant cultural behavior and antagonism have diminished your business and do not feel how his audience's experience at the time. Some of his energy, which he still has, does not encounter full force. He looked tired, compared to what I remember at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are that Rachel is brainwashed by Lucille and writes a song about it and the bar to Bikini shorts during his presentation, to make point to the lack of a decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they entered the "Bronze Liberace" as Richard used to refer to himself in interviews, there is a story. Tired me I've just seen him lead two months ago and still joking with the beautiful white boys, gives the dancer a particularly good audience, his headband. Almost 68 and I still strongly recommend this film and any concert or television appearance you can find. Little Richard is always on
