This is a really wonderful movie! I remember seeing her for the first time when I was young and I was used to seeing her all the time as if I were once a week ... The shadow was my favorite character in the film. Homeward Bound is really funny, and it's a great way to train animals to do all these things. Some parts of the movie are sad (for example, when Sassy falls, the cat, down the waterfall, and when Shadow falls in the hole in the end.) I saw Homeward Bound II but I must say it is not the first good. Shadow is smart, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy or talking animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
