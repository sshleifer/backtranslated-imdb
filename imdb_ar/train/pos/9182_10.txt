Those who love Jane Eyre's book as I love (this is my favorite all the time, I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a very good boy looking for Mr. Rochester, but otherwise, he does a wonderful job portraying the brood master at Thornfield. Zila Clarke may have been too big to play the role of 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this film, I do not think of the characters' ages. The dialogue of the film is taken almost literally from the book, which was very smart. Sure, this movie may sound a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I hope the people who made this film took part in the latest film Zeverelli, because it would help in the mess of the film. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I saw this video in which Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reid"! It is so versatile that I did not recognize it. She plays the role of Daisy in maintaining the appearance, and played the role of Ms. Musgrove in persuasion in 1995 (another wonderful modification). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I got a DVD this week, and it's great to see the unpublished original. (I always wondered why St. John had a slip of paper when he revealed that he knew Jane was - because the part he had edited from the drawing board was Edit it from the US version of VHS!). Rosamund Oliver in that ... was completely cut off from the VHS. As far as I can tell, they did not dare to free any parts of Timothy Dalton, so there's nothing new there, but it's great to see the whole minarets after all these years of enjoying the VHS. Thanks, BBC (PS ... I'd pay more for a special DVD version ... maybe with some interviews with the stars ... or make an offer)
