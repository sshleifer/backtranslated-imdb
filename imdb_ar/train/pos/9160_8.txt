In all the comments that praised Dalton's performance or cast it, I thought it was excellent. He does not play Rochester as a rich spoiled boy, but as a strong man. I liked this version, although the shot on the side of the video was sometimes distracted, and scenes with Jane and St. John never ended. I give this 8.
