I watch this movie all the time. I saw it with a family between the ages of 3 and 87, and everyone in between; they all loved it. It actually shows the real scenes of the dog, the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's great for parents who like comedy movies, shaky movies, or even pets. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, the animals amazing, the sights I really thought, and the characters perfect. It is a wise, wisely and mentally minded dog, the Chans (Puppy American Bulldog) are basically a puppy with a witty side, a comic character; and Sassy (Cat Hymilayan) Is the real cat that shows what the real cat will do to her owner, the real ugly cat.
