Chances is a charming romantic love story about a woman (Cybil Shepard) who killed her husband (Christopher McDonald) soon after learning she was pregnant. Then we see the husband in heaven leaving the powers that he knows were seized soon and that his wife needs him. He was told he could go back to Earth but not himself. Flashforward 19 years old, where we see the daughter of Shepherd (Mary Stewart Masterson) preparing to graduate from college and face a young man (Robert Downey Jr.) who turns out to be the embodiment of her father. The film is small on the predictable side ... The story goes everywhere you expect, but it is magically played by active actors (especially Shepherd and Downey) so you can not just finish the fun. Shepherd is rarely seen on screen for a better advantage, and she and Dwayne are supported by a talented group of representatives of the characters in supporting roles. A beautiful and enchanting imagination that will immerse you and immerse you.
