It is a nice! In Story Mode, go from the villain to the pros. You must complete the goals that include skiing, driving and walking. You can create your own skier and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he cheats you and jumps out of the ski team (you can choose a team to work on) and then start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of the story mode) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can open secret skiers such as Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skier. You can create your own goals such as SKATE messages, COMBO messages, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create a target for pedestrians and write what they are talking about. If you feel bored doing this, you can do the primary goals in the parks. The only thing I did not like about this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive cars. 10/09.
