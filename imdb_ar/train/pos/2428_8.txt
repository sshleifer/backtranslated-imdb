As an old white housewife, I can still appreciate that Lawrence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who can appreciate Deep Deep can enjoy watching this great acting set. Since I think this is his first appearance in directing, it may be more interesting. All acting is very good. If you can not take the lower Manhattan worlds or the reality of the life of the crime (and not the glorious shooting) this is not a movie you enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburn's usual contribution to incredibly delicate relationships. I love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go to each other in a movie.
