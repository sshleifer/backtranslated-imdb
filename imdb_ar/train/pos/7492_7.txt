If not a horror film in the traditional sense, this scary little movie delivers the goods. A vampire appears in a small German city draining its victims of their blood. Police inspector Karl Breitchneider, Milvin Douglas, suspects in one of his early roles that he believes a mad killer, not a vampire, is running. The only person who has believed it is Ruth Bertin (Faye Ray), the friend of the inspector and lab assistant to Dr. Otto von Neiman (Lionel Atwell) who appears to be a prominent scientist who agrees with the theory of suckers. City residents doubt that eccentric Hermann Gleb, who played with his usual madness by Dwight Frey, who seems to enjoy his turn too much. The film contains a great deal of humor that helps alleviate some of the severity of all the murders committed. One funny part is Jesse Schnabman (Maud Iborn), Aunt Ruth Bertin, believing that Hermann Gharib did not turn into a bat but to a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye are creating a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This movie brings the budget elements of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" with Dr. Niemann using the power of suggestion in making the game Sumpolymst. Orders, from "Frankenstein" using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" because murder is believed by everyone except the inspector and his daughter to be a vampire. The Thses elements are well combined by director Frank R. Strayer with little comedies that have been well cast. Cooking works. The restored version I saw used a dye to increase the nervous atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
