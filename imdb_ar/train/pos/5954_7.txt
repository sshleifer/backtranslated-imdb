I feel a mixture of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are stereotype vampire. Yes, there are stereotypes covered here. Even stereotypes martial arts. Everything is good and good, and certainly, it is not all that perfectly. However, I feel that there is one important point about this film being ignored ... the cultural significance of its site. The film was set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying it. This is a bold step in today's film world, a rare treatment for indie film lovers. Indeed, it may not be the latter. Pensacola is universally known as a maritime city, a city of aviation, a city of timber, and sometimes as a hot spot for political controversy. Rarely seen as a growing movie city. But that's all changing now. More movie companies come to shoot. More Pensacolians discovered the original power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of an increasing trend of indy-based films in Pensacola, and there's more in the way. Pensacola is making a big fuss in the global film community, and by the world, the world has begun to pay more attention. Watch and listen, World. Pensacoli are coming. Such as the virus.
