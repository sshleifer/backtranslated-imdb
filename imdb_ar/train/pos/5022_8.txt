Frailty - 8/10 - It's an insensitive title and the title "Bill Paxton Directs" aside, it's a very good old-fashioned rip-off and it snorts from the horror of the Bible. In the end, he may end up being the only authentic Southern Gothic cousin in the film "The Shining" in Kubrick, but hey, this is a pretty damn amusing idea. I've also got a misrepresentation of conspiracies ... and a very vague moral message. This is the kind of film that people encounter late at night on the basic cable and fear the beejesus of themselves watching it. The very bad director Bill Pexton had to go to hire himself for the star ... well ... he is still a good devil.
