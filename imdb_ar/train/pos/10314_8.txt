This one and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of the Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there is something that does not exist in this new series. They may stress too much on the lesson to be learned. She is smarter and more intelligent than the Sirling version. However, this episode can be considered very emotional too. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, fans can never unite. I remember that I was not surprised by the Korean film "Il Mare" (later reproduced in "The Lake House." I think the reason is that I saw this episode first, so it spoiled the impact of the subsequent film.
