Let me first say that this offer was of the highest standard when John Ritter was there. At the time of his death, the show declined slightly, but the producers did not give in, James Garner and David Speed ​​joined the regular cast from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The show centers around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, may rest in peace ), His wife Kate (Katy Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Cali Coco), Kiri (Amy Davidson), and their son, Rory (Martin Spangers). When Ritter was in the show, I screamed in laughter (and I'm proud to admit it, now), but now he's gone, I'll laugh a little with harsh laughter from time to time. I am very happy because I fell due to the ecstasy of this show after the sudden death of Ritter, because it made EPS with Ritter much better. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character is well-improved and well-written, so you can help but love him. He always leads girls around dating, but he really wants them to be happy. He is the father who hates entertaining her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also wonderful, and she is also a likable character. After Ritter's death, her character offers such good influence and strength not only to her children, but I think it was Sagal who formed the life of Coco, Davidson and Spangers, because she and Ritter were friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The most extreme characters in the show must be Bridget Hennessy, played by Cali Coco. She is the absolute blonde: brilliant, slow, faint, but intelligent. It is outside the wall, a joy in the innocent "blonde" humor and imagination. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson can get an annoying child like Kiri, but that's the purpose of her character. The only mistake in the offer is that this offer never gives Kerry anything he is happy about. She is always after Bridget, and her personality seems to have been thrown there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spangers as the only son of Hennessy, hysterical, and when Ritter is in the show, it is often a comedy. At the death of Ritter, the show offers some story stories to Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are just a laugh, with the occasional side-by-side story of CG, Spide's character. Garner plays the role of Kate's father, as a little basic information. <br /> <br /> In general, this show was given a great rating because it was a wonderful show of a tragic event that led to its collapse. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - Spy
