I have to agree with the Cal-37 It's a wonderful movie, especially for the family, Kelly Lynch is beautiful, the young girl is really talented and nice, of course Jim Bilushi got his ribbons! But if you really want it, it was a piano song, if you're a musician or you do not see this movie for it, you'll know who it is. <br /> <br /> "Written by Ross Morgan, Larry Stock, and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> So enjoy watching <br /> <br /> See ya, <br /> <br /> Nelson
