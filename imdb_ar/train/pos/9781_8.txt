I first heard about TEARS OF KALI for a while, and it seemed like something I saw, but with all the movies I came on regularly, I fell on radar. While roaming around the local WonderBook ... I checked the box for this one and grabbed it. I must say I am very happy because I did. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, permanent and sometimes creepy movie that is somewhat constrained by its obvious budget shortfall - but it is still amusing and interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> TEARS OF KALI's workshops on imaginary India are centered around the Taylor-Erikkson cult group, which practices meditation and other rites in the pursuit of and negation of the "inner demons" of the individual - but these techniques seem to work very well or not enough In your opinion ...) not only are the troops expelled, they are also fired at the desperate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is told "in a chosen style", with a brief but memorable rendition and "Open the Eye", then moving on to three stories that make up the bulk of the film. <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) revolves around a journalist visiting a member of the community held in a mental hospital. The journalist covers her desire to search for the cult of Taylor Ericsson, but we find that her real motives may come a little closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist discovers that she may have entered her head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) relates to a violent young man sentenced to psychological rehabilitation instead of a prison sentence for beating a young man in a coma. We find that the therapist in question is in fact Taylor Taylor's Graduates and that his rehabilitation methods are far from standard. <br /> <br /> The final story (KALI) revolves around the faith of the "wizard" and his assistant When a wizard accidentally helps one of his clients and actually expels the power she possessed, the devil is free to roam and find a new host ... <br /> <br /> I said that I really enjoyed Cali from Cali. The flaws in the film that prevent him from being truly excellent - but he is an original and ambitious film for what it is ... The biggest face of me in this production is the weak dialogue that is not called surprise. I think the dubbing is so glossy that it makes the performance appear to be stopped, which is not really happening. In fact, some presentations are chilling and chilling (the "doctor" in the second part, and the "client" in part three comes to mind easily ...) The FX gore game was designed very well for a low film Budget, with some graphical scenes of claw removal scissors through scissors, and suicide pen stroke R, and some self-decent (but "shaky") flight, and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure. Not nearly like some of the "most extreme" juries there are, but they are certainly stronger than the usual horror fare. I also found that the story about the worship group is interesting and welcome in the nonsense of the horror story model. There are a lot of scenes of real tension and tension, which you have not encountered in a while. Although there is a flaw in some key respects, I still think that TEARS OF KALI will attract most of the "secret" horror viewers - some scenes may be too much for the more common scenes. Definitely recommended - 8.5 / 10
