This movie I was dying to see. Well, it's been up to now to hire him. It was worth it. This film made me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is funny no matter which film he is in. However, this must come close to being the greatest. If you're looking for a family movie, that's pre-teens and above, this is something you can not get through.
