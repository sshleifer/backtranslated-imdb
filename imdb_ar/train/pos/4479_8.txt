Since I first saw Aweigh's anchors in 1945, his introduction to a video carries a lot of nostalgia for me. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to be attracted to the first great musical MGM Technicolor. Now I may be more interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Although Sinatra made two unimportant films shortly after his appearance after Dorsey's days, as a soloist, this was his first major film appearance. As one of the other viewers observed, this looks like a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have been working hard on it, but his dance with Kelly is credible and would have done better in the coming conflicts. However, by observing his fitness, it is easy to see why he was portrayed as a bean bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an Academy Award for acting, and he would continue to play many roles as a difficult reporter or commander in combat. Although the character and dance of Jeanne Kelly dominated this film, his stunning performance did not suggest that he would become a great creative force, almost the most distinctive, of MGM's musical music, developing a dance style that complemented the unique Astaire style. Finally, it was strange to see the new Dean Stockwell face and remember that he will later play the killer "thriller" in the movie "Ekrahion," based on the death of Leopold Loeb in the twenties of the twentieth century. Additional note: One critic praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. I later played his interview in On the Town, but Pamela Breton appeared in this film.
