Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the best books of Poirot, because it is very creepy and has a brilliant end. There is no doubt that television adaptation is visually stunning, with some great photography and a very haunting musical result. As always, David Suchet is flawless like Hercule Poirot, and the highlight of this episode is Poirot's fight with mosquitoes in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is as good as Captain Hastings naive. The rest of the actors turn out to be decent performers, but they are careful not to overburden the two options, which is a risk in some Christie modifications. Some of these episodes were quite creepy, an illustration of a tragic episode such as Five Little Pigs, an episode I enjoyed more than this episode. What made him particularly creepy, he put the music aside when Louise Lidner saw the ghostly face through the window. About the amendment, it was fairly true to the book, but I will say that there are three things I did not like. The main problem was speed, it was fairly slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens. I did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In this book, I see that he is a somewhat nervous character, but the idea of ​​making him deadly, and the weakness of it, made him a less attractive character, although I am glad they did not miss his addiction to drugs. (I also noticed that the writers left the fact that Ms. Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she thinks she is the next victim of the killer.) The other thing that was not impressive is that I felt that perhaps it was more effective if the adjustment in the view of Amy Lathran, The book, Amy somehow seemed less sensitive to adaptation. On the whole, despite some erroneous judgments on behalf of the book, I loved murder in Mesopotamia. Bethany Cox.
