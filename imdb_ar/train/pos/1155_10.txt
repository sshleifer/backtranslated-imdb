he is very funny. They have a fantastic staff, each offering great shows. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Klein. It's a script well written by Andrew Bergman (honeymoon in Vegas). I do not like drama series, even though I never saw them. But I love this movie because it is so crazy and came out of the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap they have on television during the day. In my opinion, it is the best film of 1991.
