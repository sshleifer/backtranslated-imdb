Silly movie is really, really funny. Yes, its deadly moments have passed, it can be a little clear, slightly go down the second half, the story is an incoherent mess, but they laugh out loud all the time. It is worth seeing Ed McMahon as a right-wing party. This film is in the same category as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny film, not much appreciated.
