When I messed up the TV guide and watched "Twisted Desire" in the movies section, I read it as a description. Three words grabbed the eyes of Melissa Joan Hart ... I find her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Charm" very tacky, I hate this kind of program, so I was just thinking of it as an old boring, love story will starve ... I did not I know her a bit. <br /> <br /> I finally started on TV, and I had a ready-made bucket. If you look at it with cheese or peels, you know what I mean. At first, you think she is just a normal girl and mistress loves her, but she has a religion. Then when she discovers that she has manipulated her boyfriend to kill her parents, so she can be with her true love, you are like a "stand". You just do not expect this kind of role for this kind of actress. She played her role well in my opinion, I never expected her to be able to act like a bitch, and voila, I've done it perfectly! Congratulations to her, the film was very good, I was definitely watching it again and recommend it to others.
