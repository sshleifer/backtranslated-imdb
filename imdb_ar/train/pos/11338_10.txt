I saw this in "Dances with Films" and it was wonderful. I really felt for Jake. Talk about making mud worse! Not only are your parents divorced, but there is a monster yet. <br /> <br /> It was both heart attack and scary - there were several moments when the audience cried out in real fear. I was reminded of a kind of Japanese horror film, but the story was really good. <br /> <br /> This is what separated Jake's Closet from the usual Indie film - an excellent script with compelling characters. Also, by blending the elements of a horror film with a family drama, the film gets the best of both types, and avoids the cliches both. <br /> <br /> If you do not go out in the theaters, definitely get a DVD.
