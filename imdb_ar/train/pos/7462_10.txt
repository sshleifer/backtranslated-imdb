Note: These comments are for people who have watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a wonderful, complex and exciting film that explores what the tag line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps we can focus on the film's plot for the confused filmmakers if we look at it from a different angle. <br /> <br /> Given the following: <br /> <br /> Now, I have not yet gone strenuous through the scene by scene, so I will have to further confirm my assertions, (and welcome your thoughts), but Try this and see if the movie is not in place: where exactly is the "paste" going on? <br /> <br /> Now, I am not talking about the paste as described by LE "Technician", since this sequence itself can actually be interpreted as rational within the state of mind / dream / coma of David Adams, but the real difference between Reality and Dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality of the car crash, the way it is filmed (without an explosion, for example) is a possible "paste" point, and any sequence containing an existential / dream / zombie / non-existence Realistic - whether it was on screen before or after the incident - is actually part of Aames' personal journey towards self-realization within his own mind. <br /> <br /> In this regard, we leave two questions at the same time the end (if you know more than that, let me know): Does Amy's really distort, and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If you do not end completely in the exact sequence of details in a plot, or at any point where his dreams are spread, this film becomes a wonderful exploration of the person in a journey to find himself in the pop culture society today. <br /> <br />
