Despite the sometimes amazing story and "watching for all", it is a rather appealing film. <br /> <br /> It is very pessimistic, and the scenes with the devil are very creepy in fact, some of them visual effects are wonderful and best of all, no humor spirit put in a ridiculous place to diminish the film, Wannabe) Now <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the greatest film ever produced, but it actually attracts you and at least takes part in character development <br /> <br /> I was happy to watch it
