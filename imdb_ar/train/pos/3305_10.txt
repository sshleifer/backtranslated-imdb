Without a doubt, this movie must be one of the greatest ........ in the history of cinema. I have seen several times to remember them, and every time it seems I watch the film for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? <br /> <br /> Central Mina Kumari There is no doubt that performance is one of her finest career, followed closely by the owner of Baby Or Gholam and Paul Or Bather. Each move has a simple performance, making any other Bollywood heroine of importance. Her thorough interpretation of Cathak, coupled with her grace, tragic weakness and Urdu poetry, is nothing like Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most simplistic interpretation of the human condition is the background; photography, cinematography and celebrity in the scene are highly charged with symbolism and meaning, leaving the viewer speechless. <br /> <br /> Naushads music, unsurpassed, and its knowledge of legal gram music is unbelievable, and the way it permeates the narrative with dark atmosphere motifs and overwhelming romantic tunes is truly wonderful. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys watching the whole cinema, you should see this epic mediation of life and art.
