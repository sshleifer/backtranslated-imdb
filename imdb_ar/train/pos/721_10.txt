ROCK N ROLL HIGH has a special place in my heart because it brought me to Remons. I was very young in the mid-1970s until I was not familiar with them, although I had an older cousin who was a great admirer at the time. Finally I saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-1980s when I was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way. (It is not the dream of every high school kid to destroy his school and blow it up, all prepared for rock?) I later recorded the film a year or two later, and I watched the sequence of the symbolic ceremony over and over again, thinking "man, these guys kick ass! Check out some of their albums! " The rest is history. Twenty years later, an endless number of Ramones LPs / ribbons / CDs, and three Ramones are being shown later, still representing one of my favorite bands at all and RNRHS continues to poke me every time I watch them. Now that we have left Joey and Dee Dee and Johnny (R.I.P.) at least we have this movie and tons of wonderful music to remember them.
