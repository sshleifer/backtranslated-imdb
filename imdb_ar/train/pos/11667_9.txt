The Secret of Kells is a movie I've been waiting for years after I saw early shots at the animation salon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you now that it's worth the wait. The fees are hugely inflated but not as annoying as I was afraid. The whole movie is a thing of beauty and great imagination, and I particularly like the animated book Illuminating where small characters come to life on the page. The characterization is wonderful, I like the voice of Brendan Gleason as a stylist and I particularly like the sound of the Essling Sprite. Forest victory, such a beautiful place. I understood the story well, a mixture of truth and fiction. The viewer is really attracted to Brendan's appeal in his search for the ideal materials for the book. I'm a fan of Arabic calligraphy and lighting anyway. The subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who have seen this and are not lovers of this craft agree that it is a nice little movie. I will definitely buy a DVD when it's released, I would say, a good salon cartoon and all the people involved in this gigantic project. There may be many more. :) Come back here to say I bought as many copies of the DVD as possible and gave it on Christmas, everyone loves it! I wish them all the best in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this candidate.
