This documentary explores a story that was covered in the latest book, "Liberty Next Time," which was published in 2006. It reveals the horrific expulsion of Diego Garcia, a Chagos island in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> Islanders are technically British citizens, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, such as Mauritius, the nearby island where indigenous people were once exiled. But the British government ignored their pleas to return home, where the island has now become a military base for the US military, who used it as a basis for bombing Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pellegr's coverage is appalling, especially as it documents the treatment and current poor living conditions of the islanders who survive. Interviews conducted throughout the tour are excellent, and having a representative of the parliament using government information to locate him is one of his best. <br /> <br /> Bellger is also using an exciting reconstruction of a series autopsy. Of the recently published documents that illuminate the entire British plot to expel the indigenous people. The weaving of these footage through interviews and the music of islanders increases the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but "stealing a nation" is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.
