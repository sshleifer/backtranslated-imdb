Bravo! Morgan Freeman is a representative, looking for a character chosen to play, before committing. Freeman is "fit" for the film (as in "Driving Miss Daisy"), which is not only incredible, but he gets a chance to change his image in personal play with dignity and privacy reserved. Although there are no guarantees in life, this gives the actor a wonderful opportunity to play different or unique characters stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotypes. It must be said that stereotypes have impeded or completely destroyed a large number of representative professions. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget film that was surprisingly produced in just two weeks. It is a film directed and directed by Brad Silberling. The manager has chosen Carson, CA to set up the movie, and the site helps adjust the tone and timing of the movie. The amendment is fair to good, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was a "Subcontractor", urging Freeman to do the film while he was actor among the film projects. <br /> <br /> There is good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens up an effective dialogue between each of the diverse team members from different cultures. The film also promotes understanding between people who do not speak only two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but belong to different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, norms, beliefs, folklore, principles and values. The film seeks to get some honesty and reach some truth to preserve the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays the role of an actor who has been out of work for four years. In fact, Freeman is badly needed as an actor who works constantly. <br /> <br /> The film offers an adventure of interconnectedness, caring, participation, and exchange. The results of the film give the viewer a preview of some of the things that the actor must follow in preparation for a role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are taking a "mental health day". The film went on. If you are able, take someone or your family with you. I put the film at 10 out of 10. It's fun, fun, useful, touching and interesting.
