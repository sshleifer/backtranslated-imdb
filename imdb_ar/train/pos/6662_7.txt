Gandhi and my dad is a well-made film. It depicts the life of Grandfather Gandhi Harilal. His personality, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand alone, his failure, selfishness .. Akshay Khanna justifies the role of Harillal. Not only that, everyone has done well in the roles they played. Darshan Gariwala is Gandhi's best screen show I've ever seen. But I will cut three points where there are few shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First, the film was 20 minutes longer than it should have been. Second, the film needs more research on Harrell's character. Somewhere, the character seems incomplete. Also, he did not show his relationship with his brothers. No other Gandhi child is mentioned in the entire film. I think a character like Harilal must have at least some differences between his brothers as well, taking into account the selfish nature of the Harel. <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite some shortcomings, I loved the movie.
