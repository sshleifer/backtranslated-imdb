What a great gem this is. It's an unusual story to watch. Yes, she sings, but she is very well placed in the story and she is very melodic to hear. It was very nice to watch. I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during World War II. It is about a trained witch looking for a missing part of a mascot you need. She uses her coarse "charm" to transport her and 3 children under her care to different destinations to find her. They are joined by a correspondence teacher who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school are already working! <br /> <br /> Although special effects may seem a bit dated at first, once you become familiar with them become part of the magic of this movie. In fact, the film won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is innocent and fun - it's hard not to like great songs. Interesting interesting characters to watch. I think anyone at any age can find something they like about this film.
