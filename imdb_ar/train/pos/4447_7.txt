Barbara Stanwyck gives this soap produced by Douglas Circus's early production, produced by Universal, just the kick you need. Not as memorable as the subsequent Sirk melodramas, it is easy to see by watching "All I Desire" where Sirk is moving artistically in the next few years. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in a small town in the United States, after she abandoned a decade ago. Her family and community have mixed feelings in dealing with her shocking return. Some of the film works are amazing, Stanwick strict nails and this film really gives energy. Overall, a fairly good view.
