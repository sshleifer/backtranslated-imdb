In the first three seasons, Sabrina was a jewel hidden away on the TGIF channel (and later, back-to-back operations early in the school day). Each episode had a frenzied, zany energy and shooting speed that overcame a critical joke at times. Melissa Joan Hart raised a strong talent for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. Her uncles, who played "Straight Men", or as straight as they could be charming, have a wonderful comic timing and a general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a talking cat, was free to participate in any crazy scheme he was interested in, and one could laugh and take everything in his step because, after all, a talking cat. Sabrina's friends experimented with the school's social experiment, which also included the "evil cheerleader" and "totalitarian director." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the exhibition is the ability to incorporate pop culture (eg, age bands, Jerry Springer), the typical human case / ethics (eg, the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas), and The literal representation of these metaphors in the magical field. Unfortunately, like many other programs throughout the television age, the program peaked during the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina's high school. From the fourth season, he decided to move to college which could become a sharp decline in the overall quality of the show, especially when the book chose to present Josh as a rival to Harvey, fabricating high excuses for Ants Hilda and Zelda on screen. As key players. The last season, where Sabrina worked in the pop culture magazine, was unambiguously disappointing. However, in the end, Sabrina (especially high school years) is still a unique intervention as a situational hybrid comedian with magical elements that lifts it above the cumbersome wages produced in this genre each year.
