Maybe this is one of the worst movies ever produced. It's terrible. But it is very good! It may be better if you do not see it expecting an intriguing plot and something smart and very enjoyable, because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and a wonderful / bad English guru, you are in a wonderful place. The harder it is to think about a movie, the worse it is, unless you face competition to discover the most holes in your head and nails, in which case you have hours of entertainment. I would only recommend this movie to Smap fans bored or rude. Until then, the latter should be a bit cautious, because the Japanese Guru fans were angry about it, they thought he was selling himself. (Not really so, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) could do it for him).
