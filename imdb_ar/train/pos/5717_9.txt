Omigosh, this is the most horrifying film ever made. To say that I love horror movies will be less than reality, and I saw Akwama (given its limited availability in New Zealand, that's too much), but I never had to sleep with lighting ... until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some may say that they are part of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both of which are similar story lines (yet different), but Grudge stuck to herself as a terrifying film - when I saw in the cinema, Even at a certain stage of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful, especially the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she's like an excited person. Jason Bear is a real Hotie, and William Mapother seems to be enjoying himself. However, while I am usually a fan of Clea DuVall, they do not really appear in this film. Of the supporting characters, probably have got the most profound story and back, but they do not seem to be there. Sarah Michelle Gillard, well, she stays the same through all her films and roles is not it? The ghosts were really scary, the music and the sound effects were scary (especially the noise when KaDee Strickland's phone answered her in the apartment), the finish was so wonderful. <br /> <br /> Super highly recommended. 9/10
