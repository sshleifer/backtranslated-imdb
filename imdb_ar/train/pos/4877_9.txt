In fact one person / character is not "there", but the summary line indicates the strength of the film. All this is achieved without any massive camera moves and / or large production groups, but with a great story and a good actress and a good story moving actress (Sagittarius). <br /> <br /> You can call it an accompanying piece of great Japan movies / movies (like the story of Tokyo and others), not much wisdom of course, but more of a wise mood! Representation is great, and nuances in presentations are really gems. If you are eager to experience a moving story and want to watch a movie that is emotionally gripping, this is the story that will be launched. As I noticed (as with many of my reviews), I'm not going into the story. There are places here in IMDb where you can search for them, I'm not spoiling the story at all!
