** Potential spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually a typecast in comedy, but in "Reign", he performs very impressively. While there are people who have shown courage in the face of the post-September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widower, single and "lost in his own world". Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, faces his old college buddy (Sandler) and wants to catch up with "old times". See, as in Renn Mann (Dustin Hoffman), Veneman also takes emotional and pulls in difficult situations. Old music seems to be a comfort and a "psychological" word to rely on. <br /> <br /> Johnson, at Fineman, is looking for some fun and ease in his family. He is also unhappy and dissatisfied with his job. In the same case, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not fall into the social "cracks". I came out of this film with a different and more sympathetic view of the sad family.
