"The Groove Tube" was one of two films by Ken Shapiro, and the other is "Modern Problems". This one is just a large-scale parody of the TV. Apart from Shapiro - who has yet to do "modern problems" - the film also starred Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Palzer. The three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in different plays. One of the most extreme of these features is Chase in one of the deceptive Gritol ads, in which the drug is described as his wife's ribbons, and ends up in his beloved. There is also a pornographic news program, a disturbing cooking show, and an epic story for some drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the whole thing is just a real hustle. In my opinion, the best three television forgery films are this movie, in addition to "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I may also include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what Ken Shapiro has become.
