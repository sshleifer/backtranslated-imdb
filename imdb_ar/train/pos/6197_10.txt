Fay Grim is a real example of what I call a complete puzzle. It contains all elements of representation, direction, story, and entertainment value. Everyone fits with each other, and when they do, they create a masterpiece, Faye Grimm. <br /> <br /> This film follows a single Fay Grimm trying to raise her son so as not to grow up to be her father who fled the law and lost. CIA quickly contacted Fei in a desperate quest to find 8 magazines of her husband Henry. These magazines are filled with confessions from his long past in the CIA and his involvement with states and what their government does. Fei is sent to find these magazines, in exchange for her brother's release from prison, and is sent in a cat and mouse hunt across Europe to retrieve these magazines and learn about the hidden secrets of her husband in the past that she never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was an actress I really liked after seeing her at The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought vitality to her two comedic roles, but Faye Grimm had a much different role from the other two films. Bossi made me believe what was happening on the screen, and I felt it, and I got her and wanted to learn more. They hold you while you are on the screen and when you are not idle, you can not stop thinking about what is happening to them. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other work by the writer / director Hal Hartley but I think I will look at watching some of his previous films if half of them are as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to choose a smart movie next time, you will decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD. I would strongly urge you to choose Faye Grimm. If you have any good sense of how the film should be, you'll enjoy it a lot.
