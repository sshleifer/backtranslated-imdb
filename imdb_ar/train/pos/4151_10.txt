It is time to serve the convict to give the Cold Case unit information about the killing of a policeman, committed years ago. Shawn Cooper, a good cop, was never released. Of course, investigators believe that the new evidence will help them assemble all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues. <br /> <br /> In the memories of the past, we took to baptism the child of James Bruno. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is tension when Shawn, a godfather, arrives at Devishl and lingers over the rites. Elaine Bruno does not seem happy to be there. Revealing its true ambiguity. Shawn, who was drinking with Jamie in the back yard, was captured by her husband, and more shocking yet, and Jimmy responded willingly. <br /> <br /> Somehow the station has become a hub for gossip. Sean did not like his boss because he discovered the involvement of a criminal in his area who controlled the drug trade. Sean realizes that this man deals with a strong drug man because he always justifies unleashing the bags of bags Sean and Jimmy at the station all the time. Great pressure on Jimmy. Sean is comfortable with homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. Cooper's father does not want to do anything with a stranger. Even his boss McCreary wants him out of his jurisdiction, but the issue is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police force. Sean was killed because of his homosexuality, and to know a lot about the involvement of peers in taking dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this honest picture of the life of a police officer in the treasury and his secret. Love with another fellow policeman. We thought it was an open account of a serious issue that nobody spoke about in those days. Sometimes, people who participate in the show, for fear of retaliation by sponsors or networks, dare not present these real positions. Janot Schwark, shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue, which is dealt with without dramatic provocation of the case may be presented with a different team. <br /> <br /> There is a rare appearance of Chad Everett in his capacity as the greatest Jimmy Bruno. His goal is the right one with a touch of emotion that is beyond control. Sean John makes an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper. The cast is superb and includes a good performance of all persons under the direction of Mr. Sezurk. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Nick Vera approaches his neighbor, the mother of a basketball player taking his detective to the ball away. Nick is heading for romance with women!
