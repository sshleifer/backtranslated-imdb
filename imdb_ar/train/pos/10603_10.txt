I was tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughter who was constantly exposed to watching Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. All of this seems to be the same old tired cartoons that have been redrafted over and over again. When my daughters could not go to the show this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to relax and rest for a while. I turned on the TV, and in search of something different, I turned the channels. Stop my finger channel surfing moment I heard Harvey's voice. I adore every single thing this guy did, and when I saw he was doing my voice for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters were immediately impressed by the animation and the more we saw the program together, the more it grew with the message that was filmed. He is not necessarily a proponent of "gay rights" but of anyone who has been previously described as a child for anything. I had friends who were chosen for something or else .... very fat, very skinny, very feminine, cosmic, I do not be smart enough, just have a parent .... I named him! Children, as a rule, can be very tough to each other, so you are happy to see an entertaining cartoon convey a life message to his audience. My girls really accept others as they are and do not choose others because they are different. My eldest daughter defends her friends if they are chosen (it happens to have a single mother and pick up that little girl very much - she warms my heart when Cassie defends her!). <br /> <br /> So, those who condemn this offer because you feel that they are advocates of "gay rights" or are forced to "accept certain views", have clearly and completely missed the view of this influential little cartoon. <br /> <br /> If you need to explain it to you .... Well, you need more help than any TV program you can offer.
