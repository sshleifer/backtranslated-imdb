I was very surprised by the fact that "The Man in the Moon" was really wonderful. I mean, at first, I was expecting a beautiful and predictable film, but I decided to put it aside when I saw it. Well, when it was over, I just left (mainly tears) surprised by how The Man In The Moon turned out to be wonderful. This film is very enjoyable and fully aware of his tone and wonderful film. The acting was especially great from Reece Witherspoon (who was very nice and loved), and anyone else. There was nothing really bothering me, I felt that the end was predictable, but I did well in it. I also felt some things that were obvious or as if they had been done before, but still a great movie. Overall, I must say I do not want to say much about this film, not that it was bad, it's just a movie you like or do not like. However, I recommend this to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like this kind of movies, the movie is still fun. 8.7 out of 10 stars
