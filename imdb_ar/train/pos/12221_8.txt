This is a nice piece of work. Very sexy and attractive enough plot to keep my attention all the time. Its main drawback is that it seems to be made specifically for television: full screen, and although there are many sexual scenes, there was no nudity (but the boy approached it!). Strange, too, as Netflix appears to have been classified as R. <br /> <br /> However, it is very surprising, and I hope that Alicia Silverstone will make more movies like this. It was part of a series, but I could not figure out which chain it was. However, I would like to know this because this film was good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 2005/08/23
