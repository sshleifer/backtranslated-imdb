This is a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel that the end has closed this film of high praise. <br /> <br /> He was filmed in a rather naive way. This was done clearly to create a more lifelike sense of film - the sense of isolation becomes apparent very soon because of this imaging technique. <br /> <br /> The ugly characters are represented very well and are given a special "Nutcase" called Joe. However, the useful (natural) characters are very pathetic to me - they have been granted, they are supposed to appear pathetic but a little bit of OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly (and the naive camera works on the movie "B" to start with) and very naturally, but you will soon feel the imminent brutality that is about to happen. This is one of the most "twisted" films about cold-blooded violence. <br /> <br /> After an unbelievably sudden and unbelievable ending, I was disappointed. I would give the film 9 if the finish is in line with the rest of the movie, but it only gets 7 on the "strangeness" power and biting scenes earlier in the film. <br /> <br /> Give her an hour and excuse the end!
