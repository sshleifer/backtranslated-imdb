At first, this is one of England, so, of course, I had 98% of the chances of being a smart and very good cinema. I have never heard of this film before. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here is the female version of My Left Foot. You're right, but I was also wrong. Wrong because the two films are very different. My Left Foot has been a film for John Ford both, and this movie is both Chaplin (not because this is funny, but Chaplin has that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) Lewis turns a little ugly by playing someone Paralyzed and did so with a great sense of reality. Here, very beautiful Bonham Carter did the exact same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very smart. For me, Miss Bonham Carter is one of the greatest women of the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Jie! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes of the cinema since Guinna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michelle Morgan and Ava Gardner! It is also a real talent, as it appears in many other films. See this one, you will not regret it! A very good post by Pranag too!
