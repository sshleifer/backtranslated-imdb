I only know one other film that can compete with the "Night Opening", "Bergman." Both films are simply amazing, with a wide range of ideas that are hard to understand at first sight. We have a deep hope in the relationship between art and life, where one actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gina Rowlands) finds herself more in contact with the character she plays on the stage than she wants. The sudden death of one of her admirers, a little girl announces her love for Myrtle, then collides with a car, leaving a deep impression on the actress. She begins to ask a question about her age and begins to influence her until the only solution is alcohol. But this does not help much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. The scene where you kill the dead soul of a dead girl (or not) is one of the most exciting scenes I've found in Cassavets. The film ends with a genius show on behalf of the director, portraying a theatrical scene where he and Jenna Rowlands play a spectacle, because Myrtle is very drunk until the opening night to perform her role accurately. This scene was filmed automatically, with a direct audience, real laughter, and the chemistry between the Casavates and the Rowlands is very spectacular. If you love Persona or you're interested in a film that offers great ideas along with great entertainment, this movie is all right for you.
