There is no doubt that Private Lessons II is the greatest film I have ever seen. Japanese translation (bad), translated into English, it's fun to watch. Not many of them make sense, but that does not matter. It's the greatest comedy without ever being funny. <br /> <br /> The film is rare and unavailable on video, but I grabbed it late some time, late at night on the pay cable. I have seen my recorded version dozens of times and dozens of times while I slowly, personally, introduce the jewel of the film to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Bakula plays the role of teacher / lover of Ken, our hero. (She seems to have been working just for her examination.) Ken played the role of Guru Inajaki, of the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gave it all to him and had great hair by directing the film. Stacy Edwards, of fame "In the Company of Men", also appears in the film, and may be happy because she found other works in the film afterwards. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three times to sort out what the plot is. When you watch again, you can enjoy elements such as the unusual amount of vases that Kane owns at home (at least 50) or that Ken is wearing a shirt with corn-coated peels at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable, but it is highly coveted. My friends and I were re-represented as full scenes. Yes, we seem to be lame losers and we ... but Lame losers saw Second Privacy Lessons. Be one of ten people in the world to watch this movie. You will thank me for that.
