It took a long time until I managed to find the title in a special video in Berlin, and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch pledges. I think it was one of the best horror at all. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie a black comedy. I have to admit, I could not laugh, when I first saw him (and it was the same with the second time!) On the one hand, Tilkowski looks very nice and pleasant in his timid behavior. On the other hand, this boy is playing on the pitch and there is no explanation. But the strangest thing is of course his transformation into Simon Chol and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His hallucinations are the most terrifying in this film. Of course it's all in his mind, but is it the apartment that highlights this feminine aspect of it or was it before it moved - I think this is an interesting question. It is difficult to understand his schizophrenic behavior, and it is horrific to see the two sides or identities fighting against each other. The result is that he first cuts his hand and jumps out of his window. But this terrible crying - does that mean, that everything will be repeated over and over again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? Is this Egyptian hieroglyphics and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she resembles a mummy in the hospital - this is not just an accident; it is a guide in my point of view.
