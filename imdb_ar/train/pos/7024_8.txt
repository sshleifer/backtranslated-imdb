I watched this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on him, so I thought I would review them. I thought it was a really great movie and I can not wait to take a look at it again. The actors were really good and I loved all the music! There was not much talk in the film, which at first felt a bit strange - but once I entered it, I thought the story and the acting were really emotional and meaningful and I think it left a lot of imagination. I want to see the film again because there were so many things that I forgot a lot of little things, but I know I left the theater and I was thinking about the film. It was beautifully photographed and everything was really unique.
