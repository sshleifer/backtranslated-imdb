I love Paul McCartney. It is, I believe, the greatest of all time. However, I could not afford a ticket for his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the return on the US tour. I was annoyed to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as your being there. Paul is still a man and I will enjoy this for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I would like to hear from Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Paul did not die either. <br /> <br /> The greatest single DVD ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** Away from the place *****.
