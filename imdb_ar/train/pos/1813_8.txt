In my case I loved this film because when I saw it I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated films that prompted me to think about its subjects even after a long time. Talks about death, revenge and hell in a way that makes you love you face, until you reach suffering with the sequence of dreams in the middle of the movie. This is what makes this film good: the ability, unique in Don Bluth, to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate the character at any time. This, and the fact that she has many good personalities like Charlie and Anne Marie, is that in the end sad and happy you have to say "I have something in my eyes" to hide others who are crying. All I said is just some good points for this film. As for the rest, you should see them yourself in a very honest film. Don Bloth, thank you.
