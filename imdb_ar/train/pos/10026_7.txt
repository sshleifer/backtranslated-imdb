Without Kirsten Miller, this project was not necessary. But with talented beauty and awe-inspiring awe that Miss Miller would definitely recommend. It seemed as if other actors were only playing for their strong performance. Wagner's gloomy attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes did not detract from being amusing. Mostly my criticisms with the line of writing and the plot, a group of talent assembled was heroic to save what should have been a disaster. Miller's attractive reception and timing were impeccable and credible. It plays this line between the firm and the main but has never been offensive, and is in fact the structural engineer who claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but unfortunately I was lucky to hire it before it was lost.
