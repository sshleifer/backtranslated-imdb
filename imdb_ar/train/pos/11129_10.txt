I never thought of it this way, but my friend said that the first thing he thought of when he heard the title "Midnight Cowboy" was a lesbian porn. At that point, all I knew was the reference to the episode "Seinfeld" in which Jerry tried to move Kramer to Florida aboard that bus and Kramer all the patients with nosebleeds. <br /> <br /> The film was wonderful, and was surprisingly optimistic, not all pessimistic pessimists like some movies I can not even remember because they are all nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot consists mainly of the naive young cowboys Joe Pack. To New York trying to be an impostor (essentially a male prostitute), believing it would be easy to pick them up, just to hit the brick wall when a woman ends up in the hush, accusing him of having sex. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, who is called "Ratsu" by all gay men who make fun of him all the time. You think of him as a stranger, but you are loved (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian). It is surprising that he and Joe become friends, and the film is very sweet and comfortable, and they are seen to be more friendly as well. Rizzo reveals himself to be a very sad, very depressed and self-conscious man who hates to call him "Ratsu" and wants to go to Florida, where he believes life will be much better and all his problems will be solved. He will learn how to cook and be famous there. <br /> <br /> It is sad to watch Joe do everything he does to move them to Florida, along with many fun moments (like Ratsu trying to steal.) Eat at this hippie, and the woman who says "G Well, you know, it's free, you do not have to steal, "he says," Well if it's free, I do not steal it. "And that classic moment is completely unwritten and unpcheduled as Hoffman gets hit by that cab and yells" Hey, I'm walking 'here!' I'm walking 'here! "), Acting is very reasonable, you never believe that Joe Buck will grow up to be a distinguished and respected actor c This is not the first time they have worked together in leadership roles, but the chemistry is very thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sad part, which I think is too much to describe. "Ratsu Rizzo collapses all over the film, can barely walk, barely eats, coughs a lot, sick, and gets to the starting point on the bus on his way to Florida." It hurts a lot, and only miles from Miami, Bus board. The bus driver reassures everyone that there is nothing wrong, and continues. Sad, but not the way you go home and cry and conspire poorly as if you had lost your dog for 13 years. <br /> <br /> All in all, a wonderful movie. The soundtrack is made up largely of "everyone talking" that was played throughout the film at the right times. Strange step, but it is fantastic, since the song is good and fits the movie tone perfectly. Go see it, it's great, go buy it
