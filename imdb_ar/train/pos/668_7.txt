I have just watched the "last wave" in my school's fine arts library. It's interesting, like all the things Peter Ware did, but it's not always as interesting as I liked. I found myself fascinated by the ideas thrown into my face (because they are handled well by film director Ware) but at the same time I did not have enough enthusiasm. AKA I was a bit bored at the sites. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds an Australian lawyer who becomes obsessed with some of the dreams he has with an indigenous group he defends. <br /> <br /> It starts with a strong sequence of weather and has some amazing mood effects all the time (notably "strange" sound design and "burping") and the strong trend; but it did not think of entertainment like the subsequent Weir movies. Maybe I just need to see it again. <br /> <br /> A good movie about obsession and obsession. Because in the end, the mystery between the whites and the indigenous people presents some dire consequences. <br /> <br /> God bless you Peter Ware. For him alone this film deserves to be seen ... a very organic director. Such as the Australian response Malik! I will give it 7 because it contains enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments.
