May 2004, Wonderland is somewhat new in the UK. Fantastic movie for a brutal real story. If you've known Los Angeles since the early 1980s, you'll appreciate how good it is. Using the elements that make up its innovative film style is original, amplifying the experience and making the viewer very close to being physically there. Using the detailed timeline of the "Pulp Fiction" line allows you to explore the uncertainty regarding what actually happened, while the direction and performance of the studied team's attention, especially the Val Kilmer as John Holmes Oscar certainly is if you deliver it.
