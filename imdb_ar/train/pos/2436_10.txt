In general, I like something light and enjoyable, so this film should not appeal to me. But he grabbed me from the start. The story of the family's choices and challenges seems clear, but it raises the question again and again: "What if my family is my choice?" I cried and laughed when they did that because I really felt what the people concerned were feeling. It was in places that are hard to see, but hard to keep away from. The story is real, life is sometimes difficult to watch! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and greatest stories that are unpredictable are all real stories. Like real life, you do not really know what will happen next, or why people do the things they do!
