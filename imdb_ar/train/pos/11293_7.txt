William Wheeler had to direct this amendment to Mozart's Broadway play with music / recruiting posters, but his military commitments intervened and headed to an unlikely team leader: George Cukur. The "Women's Director" has a certain touch on many documentary-like series of air force training films, which she invests in a more humane kind of suffering, especially in times of war. Sure, a handful of novices (and the whole white, except for a non-American American conscript) are a bunch of nicer and healthier beginners than real life, and talk about home, mom, wife and child becomes very thick, but it's effective propaganda and undeniable excitement. Also notable for the military actors who have not reappeared for many years: Lone McAllister, Edmund O'Brien, Martin Reit, Red Patons (in the clouds, as Sister Andrews), Peter Lind Hays, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee Gee Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who does not show up an hour and a half in the picture but has some good little sequences as a Brooklyn nurse nurse for O'Brien's concern. It is clear that, after Twentieth Century Fox (with great success), the rights have returned to the army, and if there is a good 35 mm print, it is likely to be somewhere In the bowels of the Pentagon. It is deceitful and flashy at the sites, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the horrors of war, and deserves to be seen on a larger scale.
