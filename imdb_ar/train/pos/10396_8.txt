This was usually the advice of the producer Alexander Korda on the appointment of several of his followers; the film is credited with three directors, but in fact, Alex and Zoltan helped Korda and William Cameron Menzies, and pushed him to six. <br /> <br /> For John Kopal's 1987 "Best 100 Film," a survey of 81 critics of the film The Thief of Bagdad at 55th place, a careful examination reveals that Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Cobal Himself had actually voted for the picture, but their high story was enough to move it to nearly the halfway mark. <br /> <br /> The outbreak of World War II turned the production of the film throughout England and America, and eventually completed in 1940 and won three Oscars technical award. Like Citizen Kane, is in some ways a movie you might like more than your love. <br /> <br /> The special effects, outstanding for this time, are still reasonable and actually stop if you stare. But it is not as effective as bold inventions. Among them is a fun horse, built from a set model, which starts when he goes up, in his rear end. There is also a deadly game of the six-armed Cali (perhaps it is quite clear that there is a single woman sitting behind two women) and a giant spider-looking. It is also impressive with its magnificent flying carpet. But Rex Ingram, in a wonderful moment of film-load, must have appeared at the height of a thousand feet! Ingram depicts the genie as a threatened creature, and adds a risk element to the actions. I look for the moment when I was fooled again in a vial! <br /> <br /> John Justin works well with the Arab king, who has an English accent and has a high lip for a strange reason. Sabo, an amazingly 15-year-old, is the father of his semi-gentle and impressive name. After crossing paths with evil Jaffer (Conrad Vedt), Justin finds himself blind and turned Abu into a dog. When it seems that the rest of the film will be told in the memories of the past through the perspective of blind (Justin) blind, we find that halfway through the film we pursue the present and continue the adventure. In fact, the second half is somewhat better, as it is full of the biggest and most fantastic accidents. <br /> <br /> Three small songs highlight the piece, but as the film continues for 100 minutes, it sounds like a mild seasoning instead of a real item. I will not classify this as a musician. It's all very enjoyable. Justin and Juno Dobriz are the love interest of mothers and fathers, and Vedette is the villain of Boyce, and Abu is a young thief who can not be suppressed. It may take some time to get to a somewhat dated mentality and exaggerated melodrama of English movies from the 40s, but once you've sat in the first half of an hour or so this movie really attracts you. It is commendable.
