Remarkably reminiscent of the 1940s, such as "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story about conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicholas Cage) is a young man from abroad, but honest, from Texas, goes west in search of work and money. He finds both, but not the way he expected. <br /> <br /> The screenplay contains a lot of surprises and transformations. Excellent movie editing, adroit movies, and western mood music add tension and suspense. The expansiveness of the country's large skies provides a wonderful environment. The representation ranges from good to excellent, with fantastic performances by Dennis Hopper and JT. Walsh. The specially recorded rural and western song by Dwight Yokam provides the film with a powerful ending. <br /> <br /> Red Rock West has been properly classified as "New Noir". The plot is full of amazing coincidence and unpredictable timing, so that others may consider the scenario flawed. Usually, I agree. However, in this case, when coupled with moods, and the fact that the small Red Rock town seems almost free of ordinary everyday life, the unlikely coincidences and timing suggest a story, along with "noirish", surrealism. It seems as if fate is deliberately interfering in unforeseeable events to force Michael to control himself. From this point of view, the coincidences are not flaws in the script at all. These are necessary plot points in a nightmare story for a young man who must face his demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Sirling, in a footnote, explaining, in his always-stated voice, that ... a young man, looking for himself, stops in a small deserted town a thousand miles from anywhere . It is his last stop on a trip to ... Twilight Zone.
