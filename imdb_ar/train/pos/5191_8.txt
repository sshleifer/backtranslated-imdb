Scott is right. The best duel sword 2 person put on the film in the middle of this movie. Sword battles with multiple fighters are not the best though they are very good. However, the battle in the middle is even better compared to Japanese samurai films. Scenes of Chinese swordsmen in my opinion did not exceed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in the scenes where someone must fight a group of enemies, surpassing Japanese films, for example the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Although the Japanese film fiddles last for only a second or a minute at most, the intensity of those moments made them better. However, this is one example where the Chinese swordplay game has surpassed the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five-minute battle with the most amazing choreography ever. The other battles in this film are very good, but even if they suck this movie you will get 7 for this scene. If you do not see it, you should do so. John Wu is the man.
