This was a completely amazing series and I was sorry because I was able to just watch some shows on the way back to the United States late at night. His style was quite different from others of his kind, and the whole thing had a disturbing atmosphere of awe. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not the negative one I can see) to understand what this truly innovative series is and how it caught the imagination. I now understand from reading the comments that have been canceled and this is unbelievable. What should be there (or maybe still) running to do it.
