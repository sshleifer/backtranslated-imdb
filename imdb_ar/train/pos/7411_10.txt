The key to joy, beauty, pain and sorrow of life is our ability to accept that life is basically what it is so we do not constantly struggle against this compelling truth. In doing so, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity but extremely difficult for most of us to understand. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this fact but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful but simple story, and more than a tale, which played very well. Watching actors is more like being in a room with real people than watching actors. <br /> <br /> I struggled with how to write a review of this great movie so others are encouraged to see it. I am confused. The story revolves around men in the bathroom. Sounds like a real stop, right? But nothing could be further from the truth. The American title for this film is The Shower, but it is almost the opposite of a major theme in this film, The Bathroom. I'm still puzzled. Talking about the story or characters will not do justice to them. <br /> <br /> So, I'll just tell you how much you enjoyed watching this movie and how much you touched and moved the experience. I was also completely entertained. I was very interested in the personalities and I was interested in what happened to them. For any story, this is the highest praise. <br /> <br /> If you are taken by movies such as The King Of Masks or Not One Less, be sure to see The Shower. Netflix has that quality DVD video quality and excellent sound quality. I saw it in the original language with well-prepared English submarines. <br /> <br />
