What do I say about this very beautiful film? I saw this in Atlanta, Georgia, Dragonson considering that this is my main city. I'm a science fiction fan and I enjoy motion-picture movies. I was awake all night and was about to call it the day when I noticed that this movie was playing in the morning. This is not a science fiction film nor action of any kind. Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade nor Eric Etebari, after seeing some episodes (his performance seemed so old and inhumane). But he managed to really win me in this performance. Really mean winning me more. After I saw cellular, I did not think there was much in the way of representation for this guy. But his performance as a classic was simply amazing. He was very convincing as a wicked devil. But there was a lot of detail in this character that surprised me completely. I later searched for it online and found that Eric won the Best Actor Award because he was the best in his career and gained my respect. Now I keep reading about forex from this production project and let me say that I was not interested in them (sorry Brian). It was done very well but I was more impressed by the story - which I think was more his goal (seeing films like Godzilla with huge effects really stopped me). I could not sleep after this film believing again and again in my head. The abusive family situation is not easy at all. I showed the trailer to my friend on the Internet and almost cried because she affected her even after she lived with abuse. This is one film I'm thinking about constantly and I will highly recommend it.
