Hello everyone, I am a chess fan since the age of 6 years. I'm supposed to be obsessed with chess, but I hope not to be like the central character in this film. <br /> <br /> In this film, the center reflects a real chess player named Kurt von Bardelpin who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for playing against Steinitz, where Steinitz played a beautiful mix. Instead of resigning, he simply withdrew from the tournament hall and never returned. <br /> <br /> The social incompetence of the central character is, unfortunately, a cure for some of the top stars of Grandmasters who sometimes get them in chess tournaments. Chess I suppose it is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up balancing in other areas of life. A key example is chess legend Bobby Fisher. Although he was a genius, he was very upset in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the film, a world championship match is played, as is the case with the Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. Coordination is a knockout, and the FIDE World Board has in fact used it sometimes as the same format - moving from 128 players to only two players in the final. But this was a collective knockout - which also depicts a realistic form, where winners from each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The situation before the postponement makes the chess puzzle wonderful in itself. In fact, you've done a YouTube video about it, to explore the winning mix in detail - Enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon
