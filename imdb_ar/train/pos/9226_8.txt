I read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I did not see it until early last year, when I entered a crazy game to buy movies, and for whatever reason it occurred to me recently, although it was a few months since I saw it. <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful film, filmed in Italy somewhere around the 15th century. Certainly in the Middle Ages (although I do not think any specific year is ever offered). At this time when the time of Christian ascension, the age is the time of complete madness, and the film captures this well. <br /> <br /> Flavia, our protagonist, is a young lady who encounters a Muslim fallen on a battlefield. He appeared to be a warm and curious colleague, and I was taken with him immediately. Her father, a soldier from a prominent family, comes almost immediately, killing the wounded man in front of her eyes. But she will continue to see him in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Her father ships her to a monastery that looks like a crazy outdoor asylum - the population, severely oppressed by the cruelty of medieval Christianity, slowly mad. Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. But in a crazy world, only the mind of reason is really insane, and this social social sister is clearly aware of the madness around her. Take her in the times when they live on a chord with Flavia, which was small and apparently protected, she started asking all about this world where she finds herself trapped. <br /> <br /> The film is unmistakable in his portrayal of this world, and displays much hatred. We see a golden horse that is raping a sedan, raping a woman of his land in the form of a pig, a dirty torture of a nun. Through all of this, Flavia observes questions and rejects, ultimately, a Christian creed that creates such a spectacle of horror in terms of which the film would gain some criticism over the years because it seems obsolete. I do not agree with this criticism. Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely reflect, for example, the contemporary feminist commentary of the time (the film was made in 1974), revolve around what are really obvious questions. It may be hard to believe that it may run out of water at its own time, but that's the kind of simple point you do not manipulate. Flavia is written in a way that allows those in our time, or in any age, to sympathize with her ordeal. Involvement in such a matter will be missing the forest for the trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia is relieved when Muslims arrive, reap the countryside, and find, in their leader, a new version of the medal. Is still visiting her dreams. Almost immediately enthused, he allows her to lead his army almost, becoming a figure of Jean-d'Arc in a full-fledged fighting game, directing the invaders to destroy the Christian community, avenging all who see it committing evil. <br /> <br /> Is she the Herald of a new and better world? You might think about it, but Muslims in that era were not the biggest in the women's movement, and they soon learned the hard way. As they say, get to know the new coach ... <br /> <br /> This is just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The film is very bleak, and with a very pessimistic ending, somewhat depressing. The film is not an audience at all, certainly. It is very good, and it does not belong to the "improper discharge" pile that is dumped on it carelessly. I think there is great value in the final film, and I'm glad to see it.
