I think most people do not seem to have gotten the right idea about the film, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a movie about drug abuse; it's a film about how these genius brothers think, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it's not a commercial film you see every day, and if the author wants it, it certainly fails, as most people think it's one of the many drug-related movies. However, I think there is something else that is the case. As with many films that depict different cultures, the audience usually understands films that depict their culture, something they grew up with and are quite used to. This film aims to show what these "genius" people are thinking and the problems they face. The reason why they behave like this is because they are bored with their minds :) They have to meet people who do modest things and accept these things as if they were launching space shuttle flights every day. They start with a rather hard work and excel at no time. They feel - I went to work, I did not do anything, and I'm still twice as good as the men around me when they were all in their projects, what should I do now with my spare time. What is more boring? When you start to predict behavior, it is not because you are a psychologist, but rather because you have seen this pattern in the past. For them, unilaterally, it is a function that does not challenge, and is also somewhat boring at times, and on the other, begins to discover people's behavior. It's a recipe for great big boredom. Usually the dumbest things are out of this situation. They mentioned earlier that the biggest problem they face is that they try to know life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really logical, it is really quite right.
