It may not be for Academy Awards and it is recognized, it is very cheesy, but very enjoyable! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovable, optimistic, and fun, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love the excellent adventure, only a fake flight is more entertaining for me. Death is a hilarious flippin and Bill and Ted are more endearing. People are sad to love this film, but only really pampered filmgoers will say it's not entertaining. If you like this, you may also be a fan of Wayne World, David Ayna Mae Car, and Womb & Dombre. Admittedly, though foolish, they only make you smile and turn your tickle box. So watch them just for kicks and laughs !!
