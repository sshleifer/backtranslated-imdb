This is one of those who feel comfortable, movies on Saturday afternoon. It's right there with other retro clicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a nice movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up. It is interesting to see how 20-year-old stars such as Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson have changed. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> I personally like movies like this from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. I did not know Mr. Phoenix if I had not read the credits recently. I was just a kid when I made this movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was an emerging actress at the time. She and Lia did a great job in this film. I agree that it is not an Oscar movie. But much worth watching. Especially if you have children in a group of 8 to 11 years old, let's say. Or those interested in the space program.
