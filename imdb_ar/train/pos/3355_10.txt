May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for a historic date with Mussolini.Emotions, tensions and forms of self-affirmation. An empty town, housewife and journalist. Meet different worlds. A refuge for the mother with a sad life. Short fill for a classic victim. A story about isolation and silence. Around the shape of the corners of life and desire like the shape of the battle. Great Personal - A talented book in the spring afternoon. This film is a poem, a fascinating art to describe the shades of common loneliness. Seek for an insurmountable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. Pictures of Il Duce, the folly of Antonita, Gabrielle's impatience and tension, and the director's art to give a sense of grace to the script, make this film a wonderful actor, predicting subtle accuracy, and a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary judgment on the essence of life and defiance of any tyranny. Lorraine and Mastrani are the masters of intelligent representation. A clear masterpiece.
