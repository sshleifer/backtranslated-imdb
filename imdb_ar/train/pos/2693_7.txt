Although the story is essentially routine, and the "sudden" ending is just a bad joke to the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it provides them with the kind of roles that good actors can shine on, the brilliance they do. The film is meticulously made - in its time. It was remodeled in 2000 as "under suspicion", and if you just want to see one version of the story (that's all it really deserves), I recommend the other, with Hopkins' most recent and obvious direction pointing to the plot points that the original text can hint at To them only. The end, however, still strikes. (** 1/2)
