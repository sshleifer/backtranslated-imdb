I really thought this was not so bad. It was not a great work but Dermot M was the best performer. Patricia Arquette was over-estimating a lot of time. He was actually playing the cello which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he is an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy. Add to that talent, and most of the things that were more tolerant. He always does his best, even if he does not achieve some of the projects in which he participated the highest degree .. Not the fault of the representative in most cases. Unfortunately, it was in some exotic films that did not resonate at the box office. Always with a list of actors but not just a "blow". But it is "worth every penny" of any rented DVD or purchased. Watch the wedding with Debra Messing - one of his best films. Worth every penny! . ) (If you have not seen it yet, do it, then you will understand this quote!)
