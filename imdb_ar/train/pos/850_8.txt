Matador (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kenner, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged killer facing a midlife crisis while in Mexico, where a beloved square American businessman (Kenner in his most papery work) endorses and discovers that there is more to life than death. Richard Sheppard, a new film director, first appeared on a big big screen with a clearly sinister black comedy with a sharp look for visual detail, refined dialogue and personal development, making him a talent to watch in this refreshing film of Comedian Friends. From his strands and let Brosnan take out the Ya-yas game with diabolical joy. Hit the sleepy indie jewel.
