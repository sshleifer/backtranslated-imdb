A recent watch of this entertainment gave me an incentive to see many of MGM's classic musical works from the 1940s and 1950s. The AWEIGH anchor is definitely a film less than ON THE TOWN. The songs are not good, nor are the chemistry among the characters. But the film blends beautifully with classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. The scene in Hollywood Powell, with Sinatra and Kelly appearing above them at the top, then running down the stairs, while dozens of pianists play the piano, is the best scene in the film, although the scene where Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Lovers of classical music will certainly decide on the music they play on the piano. Sinatra then squeaked, "I fall in love very easily," before he had a epiphany about who he loved. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful with its mountains and pollution-free air (can you imagine Hollywood in the 1920s, not to mention the mid-forties ?!), piano music is very glorious. MGM certainly had a tendency to create such lyrical moments.
