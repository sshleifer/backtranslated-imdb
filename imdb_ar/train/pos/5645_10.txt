I purchased the DVD set on the recommendation of Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail on his head with this. I remember watching the show when he was on TV but I always wondered what happened to him. Ten years later, it was like seeing him again for the first time. Lucas Black like Caleb Temple and Gary Cole, like Sheriff Lucas Buck, are both wonderful, although somewhat competitive. Almost represents the good (Caleb) and Evil (Sheriff Lukas Pak). I did not really understand what Lucas was supposed to be, but let him suffice to say, he has some special powers that I do not think they were given by anything sacred. It can ring phones, show typing, or even change a person's feelings. However, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes a good man though. All in all, this is an excellent series like many other groups I can think of (such as Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV to name a few) were canceled before their time. The Steven King's The Dead Zone seems to be the only thing in the genre he seems to be making. There is nothing suitable to watch on TV anymore. This is because anything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and should be withdrawn immediately from television. So, in the meantime, I'll continue to buy DVD collections and watch programs that should remain on TV but turned off by religious fanatics so we can see "good" programs like Family Guy, American Dad and The Simpsons (a handful of This crap is).
