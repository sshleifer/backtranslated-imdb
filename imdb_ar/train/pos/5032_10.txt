The film "Frailty" is actually more exciting than a horror film is. He has all the horror film decorations but that is not so. "Frailty" is a film about the perceptions of religion and the realization of the differences between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In the film "Frailty," the middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to have worked God. It turns out that they are three serial killers known as "Yad Allah". We see the father killing the "devils" in somewhat brutal ways while convincing his sons and their selves that they are doing God's work and that what they are doing is right. He claims to have received a letter from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate demons living here on Earth. God has given him a list of names and for his "services"; he and his children will be protected, meaning that the police will never be able to arrest them. We see all this unfolding in a very disturbing way. What is really worrying about all this is the effect it has on the children, especially the older son, Adam. Adam doubted himself strongly in the presence of a higher being, that is, until his father changed and a week in the cellar all that. He knows that his father has lost his mind clearly and is sure that the same thing happens to his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything as if it were his religion. He seems trapped in his father's world of God and demons. I suppose the reason is that it is young and can be easily felt. But all that happens to these three fairly persuasive, in fact, convincing TOO. <br /> <br /> The events in the film can be seen as living hallucinations witnessed by the three main characters. I say this because they interact with the situation in different ways and at one point in the film all of them claim to see God. My father first sees murder as his mission. His "mission" eventually consumes him and quickly turns into a mania by eliminating devils. In fact, hallucination is fundamental. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are all part of this hallucination. Watch the scene where my father finds the ax in a barn to see where I came from. Fenton, the youngest son, was easily impressed with all this talk of demons and destruction. Since it is too small, it is easy for him to fall into his father's trap. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical of his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a way, hallucinations end when my father is killed at the end of the film. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I will say it is not nice. After his death, he progresses rapidly to the present day. (The story is recounted through the memories of the past, as seen through the eyes of the eldest son Adam). In fact, it is Fenton who tells the story, not Adam as originally thought. The story is recounted in the way it was conceived, through his actions and his brother's actions. Fenton has disappeared and continues with what his father started by attracting the FBI agent to his trap. <br /> <br /> Since religion is a major theme in this film, the film also plays on how easy religion is to be misinterpreted by those who do not have a full understanding of it. Before my father discovered his newly discovered mission, he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion and did not fully believe in the Supreme Being. His sons, Vinton and Adam, often sang the hymns of the Innocents to young children, but they probably did not have a clear understanding of what the words meant. After revealing his father's newly discovered mission, the two set off in two separate directions - Adam remained in doubt of a higher being while Fenton was gradually subjugated to his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good movie would sneak into you, you do not see it alone.
