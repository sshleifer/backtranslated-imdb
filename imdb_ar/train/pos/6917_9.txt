This is the story of Winchester Real 1873 "The Gun That Won The West" to cowboys or outlaws or peace officer or soldier, Winchester 73 game was excellent. Indian will sell his soul to own one ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo who will continue to create a group of Westerners who have added a new psychological depth to the genre. The story shows that Stuart is Lynn Mac Adam who is pursuing the man who killed his father. Lynn runs in Dodge City with his trusted friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), to Henry Brown (Steven McNally), the man he wants. But after Will Geer takes all the weapons from those entering the city, both men are unable to get the exchange of fire that they are ready for. Instead, men participated in a contest to win the Winchester 73 pistol, a contest won by Lynn in the end. But before he could leave the city with the grand prize, the Dutch ambushed him, stole the gun and quickly skipped the city. When Lin starts off in a hateful quest for both the man and the gun, the gun will change hands several times, adding each time another dimension as the day of reckoning for all the suggestions. <br /> <br /> A standard for what has become known as the "psychological west," Winchester 73 is essentially the story of a respectable man who leads to border madness because of an event in his past. Despite being shot in black and white (the only one from the Western duo that he was), the landscape is still a spectacular feast for the eyes. The tone on the opening scene, such as Lin and Johnny, is set on horseback, and in a silhouette, you can stretch out over a hill on their way to Dodge City. It is just a starting point that Mann will use his views as a way to coincide with the states of his emotional personalities. <br /> <br /> Stewart offers one of his best and most intense shows like McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of the most luxurious and diverse Americas. Support team is not too bad too. Shelley Winters is the only female in this field, while Mitchell, McNally, Jair and Dan Darya always add another category to the proceedings. There are a few parts of Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson here, as the latter plays a brave Indian and extends beyond that. <br /> <br /> Originally, the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who until the text was ready to run away. But Lang has moved away from it, which has proved to be a blessing for the Western public. Because he was a great director, Lang, with Man's release (and a new text by Borden Chase and Robert Richards), put the wheels in motion to change the course of this genre. Not only with the extra efforts of Mann & Stewart, but also in those who were influenced by them. The likes of Baud Poitcher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all watching, and gladly for Western extremists, they followed suit and carried the psychological torch further. <br /> <br /> A great success at the box office when it is released, Winchester 73 is a wonderful film still packed in modern times. 9.5 / 10
