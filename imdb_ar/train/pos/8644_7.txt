This actually is more of a drama, too grim in that ... I remember some emotionally intense Duchovny voices. <br /> <br /> Pitt presents his role in his film, which is perhaps more attractive with amazing talent. Who began as a hopeless but harmless "white garbage", became aware that he was addicted to alcohol, annoying and mentally ill. During some of the final stages of the film, I found it difficult to keep watching it - it was unpredictable and scary. This proves writing and acting very well. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is full of exciting alien scenes that have made me breathe less than once, and I do not mean motion scenes. I mean the scenes of the dialogue, which was brilliantly designed and I was really hit by what I saw. It was like watching a rhinoceros and putting a lion in a cage and watching as they gulped each other to death. Again, I'm very impressed by the scriptwriter. Whatever the impossible: oil and mixed water. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed Juliette Lewis very much. It is very rare for this talented young actress to appear these days to the extent that when she does it is a joy. Some of her moments in this film made me cry. I mean this. The feelings that this girl can raise in your head are unbelievable, and I remember vividly that I have become foggy on several occasions. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm cheating on the craftiness shown by filmmakers just giving "KALIFORNIA" rating ***. But the dark feelings it provokes are so powerful and depressing that they do not excite her. I think everyone should see this movie though. I really do.
