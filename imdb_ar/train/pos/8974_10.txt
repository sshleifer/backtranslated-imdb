Joey Trnaka made his latest animated film in a statewide indictment, which caused him trouble in his native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, symbolisms simple, and his trademark is almost absent here, allowing the viewer to focus on the myth. A man in his room devotes pottery and care for the only plant. But suddenly the huge hand enters the room and asks him to make a statue for himself. The man refuses and has been persecuted by gloomy gloves. These days, where the impression of the fact factor is erased from most of the animations that try to replace the real world, it is refreshing to watch a movie that makes the technical curriculum part of the fun.
