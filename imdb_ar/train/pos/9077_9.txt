I really enjoyed the pilot, it was fantastic as I wish it would be better, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first I thought I would not be able to identify his character. He and Megan Price had little chemistry at all, but hopefully over time they would become more comfortable around each other. It should be strange for Meen to move from being the star in her last show ["Foundations of Life"] to being a star of participation. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlish and Oliver Hudson seem to be really new in the whole comedic scene, but I think they will improve in time. For my surprise, David Speed ​​was not the focus of this pilot. The way his lines are different from anyone else I've seen on TV is different, but I think it's just his style. He works for it. <br /> <br /> I think couples, or even singles, will be able to link to all doubts, battles and uncertainty about your decisions, that this is about it. All the positions in which the characters are placed appear to be a real fact, not as wrapped in sugar as most presentations. <br /> <br /> I hope CBS makes it a chance for them. This show has the ability to be one of the best serials, if given the opportunity and time just.
