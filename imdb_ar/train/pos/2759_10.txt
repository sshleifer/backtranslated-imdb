How many times did you cry when watching a little movie? There was only once when I really cried and that was when I saw this movie. This movie contains some echoes but I do not really care. I cry even as I write this and it has been a long time since I saw him. It behaves perfectly and all the production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and brilliant message. We all know that in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all its forms. Only when we love we are really alive. I know how passionate my voice is and I'm not usually like that. I am very cynical. This film has raised more feelings of sadness and happiness in me than any other, and it may always be the first film I recommend to others.
