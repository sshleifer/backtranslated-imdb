I watched this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It is amazing how homosexual relationships between the author and the protagonists in the film are sublimated. Correspondent straight, the protagonists are more than gay. <br /> <br /> The movie begins slowly, but when you review it for the second time, we get all kinds of interesting information from the analogies created by the writer / director Brooks. <br /> <br /> Notice the striking pieces at first where killers and killers are associated. The cutter on the phone is identical to the Piri on the phone. Cutter and face wash is cut matched to the face wash face. Perry looks only at the mirror and sees his exciting male body imagining the guitar in Las Vegas playing on empty chairs. This failure / fantasy corresponds to failure - the fiction that Perry tells of him about his father who built a beautiful mottilla in Alaska just to find it always empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting the riders and the fact that the riders do not see I know they will die. We break the blocks. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream about a yellow bird, "Longer than Jesus," who attacks the nuns who persecuted them. He tells us, "The nuns asked for mercy, but the bird slaughtered them anyway." Raise the berry birds to paradise. Curiously, Perry says he hates nuns, God and religion. This is later repeated in his last words when he wants to apologize but he does not know who. <br /> <br /> The director puts in all sorts of whether and what if only. <br /> <br /> Nancy Kater gets a show to sleep at the friends house. It holds the horse. Perry will hang on her picture and house later. Nancy can not sleep in her friends' house because her boyfriend will come to dinner. The decision ends its fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "Treasure of Sierra Madre". But this is another image of Bogart, "Beat the Devil," which Truman Cabot co-wrote, where the search for the fictional treasure was McGuffin. But Dick knows that the heroes of this film ended up. Dick wants to get hard cash, which is $ 10,000 that he thinks is safe in Clutter, (which is ironically as much of a fantasy as in Mexico's Treasure's Perry. <br /> <br /> Cut to Herb Clutter signs a lock It is ironic that his death is about to end within a few hours, and the insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, and it is also ironic when we know what will happen within a few hours. > <br /> <br /> Dick said he did not want any witnesses, so no one would remember them. "There was a witness," the detective continues to tell Dick later, but was this witness the friend of the prison, Dick, Perry, Truman Cabot, or God? Becomes the witness witness after watching the film. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie.
