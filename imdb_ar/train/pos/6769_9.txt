I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. Although I do not remember much about it, I must say it was a very good offer. Also, do not think I saw every episode. However, if you ask me, it was a good offer. I remember a vague theme song. Everyone was a perfect cast and the fashion design was wonderful. The presentations were also of high quality. I just hope that some networks will bring this series back one day so I can see each episode. Before I finish this, I would say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I do not think I saw every episode. Now, in conclusion, when this show is re-presented on air, I hope you enjoy it one day before it blows into the air forever.
