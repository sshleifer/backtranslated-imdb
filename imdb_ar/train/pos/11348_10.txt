I loved this movie perfectly when I was a kid. I cried every time I saw her. It was not strange to me. I identified perfectly with the characters. I would love to see her again (and I hope I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks! I really attracted to the world of fantasy. The film was for me loooong. I wonder if you've seen this string and tidy it up? The representation I thought was strong. I love Jack Wilde. It was as soon as I was 10 years old (when I first saw the film, not in 1970. I can still remember the characters clearly.) The flute was quite acceptable and I still can "feel" the evil forests.
