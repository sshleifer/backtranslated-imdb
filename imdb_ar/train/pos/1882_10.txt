<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the best films ever produced. It is a reaction to the charming romantic comedy of the 1940s ... but with a modern twist. The script explodes with wit, charm, humor, tenderness, breathtaking cinematic photography (NYC was not so beautiful) and of course there is cast! Dudley Moore turns into his career as a loved one, and is drunken Arthur Bach. It is also sad and real. One of the best lines of the film is influential. "Not everyone drinks a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." Sir John Gilgod the Great won Oscar prizes for his outstanding performance, such as Hobson, Arthur's servant and business man. Although it is considered "a role in getting money and operating", it brings to the personality all the talent, experience, courage tragidian experts and comedian comedian. The cast is also out of this world, from grandma Gerald Fitzgerald's bold Bach to the amazing mafia of Stephen Elliott. <br /> <br /> The result is also very memorable and completes the movie perfectly. The only real problem with the movie is the sequel sequel it's generated.
