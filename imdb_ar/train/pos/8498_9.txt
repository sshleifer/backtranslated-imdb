This is a great film with a fun and interesting story, the dynamics of cultural differences and the theme of what's important in life, makes this movie a highly appreciated film. Do not let the cynics in the world deter you from seeing this. Keaton enjoys great moments and I wonder about the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton are turning from humor to serious parts that look very easy. Fantastic movie everywhere!
