I have not seen this movie for 35 years, so when I recently noticed that it would be shown on TV (cable) again for the first time in a very long time (not available), I was sure I did not miss it. Unlike many other films that seem to lose their luster when I see them again in the end, I found that the visual images of Marines' Pride were vivid and effective as I remembered at first. What makes this movie so special, anyway? <br /> <br /> Everything. Based on the true story of the young man and his teammates in the ordeal of the machine-gun crew at the battle of the Tinaro River in Guadalcanal in November 1942, the scenario remains true to 95% of the book based on "The Shame, Marin" by Roger Butterfield, This is not a typical "war movie," where the action is central, but the scene of the war is 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film, but it is 10 minutes memorable, filmed in the least light possible to shoot a night battle, Or the falsehood that usually affects this kind of time - perhaps before that time, it was the drama The film is not about "glorifying" the war; I can not imagine anyone who sees this scene of the battle and wants to be recruited into service. Not immediately, anyway. <br /> <br /> What really matters is the fallout of the battle, and how affected people can learn how to recover their lives.There is an excellent scene in the hospital discussed by dozens of men, Well - I've been writing very well. There is a "dream" sequence in the reverse (negative film) seems almost experimental, the representation is also strong, led by John Garfield. Garfield was ideal for this role because his natural temperament and hematides were almost identical. Garfield met with Schmid but lived with him for a while to learn as much as possible about the man and his role. The actors no longer do so much, but they added to the equation, just another reason for the film's success in recounting this difficult and unattractive story.
