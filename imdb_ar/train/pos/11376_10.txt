This must be one of the best films about slaying killers I've ever seen, and this comes from a person I love silent Lambs. HBO hit the jackpot here. This film is convincing from the first to the last moment. <br /> <br /> This movie contains many basic topics that are difficult to pinpoint. The 10-year research tells about the Russian murderer Andrea Cicatello. Stephen Rhea performs a wonderful performance reserved as an inexperienced forensic expert charged with investigating, and Donald Sutherland performs more engagingly as his cynical boss and the only person in the Russian government who wants to help him. Both of their performances are subtle masterpieces --- Rea begins na√Øve and unwilling to compromise, while Sutherland begins to separate and almost entertain from the position. In the end, Rea became more tired and overwhelmed by the system, while Sutherland found himself more enthusiastic and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other film, I would say that Sutherland's performance stands out above the rest, but here Jeffrey Doman competes with him, as the serial killer himself. Doman creates a personal talent here that inspires compassion rather than hatred that we think we will find - he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we get the idea that he is disgusted by what he does as we are. He was tortured, ashamed and brutal. <br /> <br /> If you can handle the incredibly dark subject (which is very disturbing), you should see this movie.
