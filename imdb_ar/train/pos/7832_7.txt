I finally got my desire to see this one in the cinema. I saw Fritz Lang on video a few years ago. I hoped that the perfect examination conditions would work on her charm. <br /> <br /> The conditions were perfect in Cinematheque Ontario. Virgin full-length printing. Translations in gothic script in German with simultaneous English subtitles, accurate without being very literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the film faltered for a short time but finally failed to catch up with me, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This movie is not related to any real relationship to the Wagner's Ring cycle where I already knew but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13th c. Niebelungenlied for his own purposes. The first part of the epic Fritz Lang - "Siegfried" - has a lot that will be familiar to Wagner audience. <br /> <br /> "Revenge of Creamhead" is the story of Siegfried's wife, Creamhead, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) Hun, her desire to avenge Hagen and Gunter, and Nibelungs Rechristened, to kill Siegfried. A stunning fire in this film is supposed to have expanded Wagner's legends in his Guterremronung, his Twilight of the Gods, and the end of Valhalla. This film is still going to Earth. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is stunning. Massive groups compete with "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffiths to "fanaticism" (1916). Their decorations set a new standard in barbaric splendor. There is a large group of raving Indians, mangees and art deco burgundians. And battles. Battles that do not seem to end in reality. <br /> <br /> Krimeld succeeded in the success of the revenge plan. I managed to destroy all of them around. It seems that her loyalty to her martyr Siegfried does not stem much from love or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted, "Get rid of me here." She knew she was not emotionally prepared for what she needed to do. But Creamhead does not offer any natural human feelings, and certainly there is nothing equal to the feminine principle. It is already "in the highest degree of cruel cruelty," to borrow the term Shakespeare, from the very beginning. Margaret Shawn and her manager happily convey this. I do not want to exaggerate this, but this glare is the only expression ever to "move" the face of Creamhead. It's the end of the show. However, it is clearly not just a case of misconduct. <br /> <br /> What we presented then is a one-dimensional drawing of revenge anger. Some may see Creamhead as an authorized heroine. I just see that the film is hateful to women.
