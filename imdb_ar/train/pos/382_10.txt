One of the coolest movies I've ever made! Why I just got a 7.6 rating mystery. This film is a window on the world of black experience in America. Mandatory observation of all white persons and all children must be over the age of ten. I recommend watching it with "The Long Walk Home" as a companion. If you think that the work of Whoopi Goldberg revolves around "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares", think again. Do not miss this movie, which should have won an Oscar. (And read the book too!)
