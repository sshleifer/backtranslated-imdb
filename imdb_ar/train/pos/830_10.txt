I did not have much expectations in the film, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is wonderful in a very different role. He threw the stunning Armani suits to look ridiculous, and pays off to show he is an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play each other wonderfully and make them one of the best couples in friends for a long time. The humor is dark, and the performances by Brosnan, Kenner and Amal Davis are wonderful, and mix it up with an influential element in the friendship story, and you have a wonderful movie. Maybe this is one of the best comedy friends in a long time. This film certainly shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era in the professional life of Brosnan.
