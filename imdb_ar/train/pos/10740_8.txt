Designed by the French brothers Jules and GÃ©donne Nodit, it was co-authored by Robert De Niro and fireman James Hanlon, an intriguing story about how New York shone in the darkest day. I saw it for the first time when I was a naive young man of 12 years old, and at the time, he still had me. Knowing the seriousness of the events of 9/11 was an extension of the full impact of the events of September 11. We knew who the heroes were, how everyday life was shaped, how they put their lives at stake in a situation where most people were just running and saving themselves. These courageous men put their lives to the test, and watching this increases my admiration for them. See if you can, this is the best documentary I ever saw.
