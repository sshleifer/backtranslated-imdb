The thief of Baghdad is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although the main exposure of my four children to this story, and the most famous of the Arabian Nights stories, comes from Disney Corporation, the "Thief Baghdad" has kept their interest until the end. The story moves at a good pace and includes a sequence or two that reduces predictability. Sabo, who plays the role of the young robber, Abu, is measuring up to any of the teenage actors on appeal today, from the number of times I heard my eldest daughter say, "He's watching!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won the Academy Award for Cinema and Special Effects. Today, of course, these effects look very dated ("see, she's Barbie flying in the air", my daughter announced the sight of the jumper). Yet they fit the story well. The film, after all, is more than 60 years old. Effects fit the script. Moreover, what the people of The Thief of Bagdad see has remained the latest in the next 25 years. One only needs to compare the opening montage of the Star Trek episode 1967 to see this. In that, it was a great achievement. <br /> <br /> This is a family movie, although there are some stitches near the end. The representation is very clear and the wounds are non-bloody for those almost artificial scenes such as animation. <br /> <br /> In general, a fun movie is worth watching either for an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. I highly recommend it.
