Carter Wong plays a noble hero in his quest for a book of healing that leads him to absolute revenge! Good Speed ​​In this movie, there are plenty of fighting scenes to keep the movie going. The guillotine looks like an evil plane and the main villain has no problems using it. Although the story is not strong, the procedure is fun and pulls you to the end (which I felt I could have completed). <br /> <br /> Campy and Dark, this is great !!
