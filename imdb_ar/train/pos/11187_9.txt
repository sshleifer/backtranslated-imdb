Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of Father, Louis, Mother, Rachel, Brother Gage, and Ellen's daughter. They are greeted graciously by Judge Crandall. He is 89 years old and can tell you essentially about Ludlow's entire history. <br /> <br /> Behind the house of the new faith, there is a path leading to a cemetery for pets (half written for pets). When Elaine wants to climb to see her, Good's family deliberately takes a trip. This is the beginning of hell for the family of faith. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the children leave, the Elaine Cat Church dies. Good feels that Ellen is not ready to die for her cat, so he suggests that Lewis follows him on the road, Pet Cemetery. <br /> <br /> Jude Lewis tells this buried land, once used by the Memac Indians. Louis is buried in the church, without the help of Jude. Two days later, the church returned, alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the horror films that could have actually scared me, apart from the "evil spirits." The greatest performance will ever be Zelda, the sister of Rachel with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help faiths make a mistake in bringing things back from the dead. <br /> <br /> The music in this film plays a heavy role. It is at the same time sad and mysterious. In line with the film beautifully. <br /> <br /> 9/10
