As a major winner of Radio RKO, Bombardier is the heroine of O'Brien and Randolph Scott as instructors at a school for suicide pilots. O'Brien and Scott argue about teaching methods, while their students compete for Ann Shirley's emotions. O'Brien's audio methods proved during a raid on Tokyo. Scott and his crew were arrested and tortured by the Japanese, but Scott, who was fatally wounded, set fire to a gas truck, providing an ideal target for his fellow bombers. In one way, Bombardier is one of the most divisive war films, and moments of subtle brilliance (the death of the trainee Eddie Albert) alternate with scenes from the funny melodramatic "Yellow Braille" (the Japanese literally whisper through their teeth while torturing helpless Americans). Although he can only seem to be a historian today, Bombardier is still an entertainment effort (the film is sometimes misrepresented as the first appearance of Robert Ryan, who has already appeared in front of the cameras since 1940. <br /> < Anyone interested in getting a copy of this movie, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
