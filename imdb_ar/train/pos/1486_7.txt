I was very pleased to see "Milanese" in Milan. Alessandro Alatri, a Romanian director, is well understood and fortunately, in his film The Philosophy of Milan. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a Milan couple in a standard career, from "birth" to death. A very typical wedding of any scheme becomes an original and includes all guests of the wedding in a story of manliness about how the couple treat each other and their feelings of love. Life is tough in the "urbe" for Milan and after the beloved days became tougher and tougher, then finally the product: a child, instead of strengthening the marital relationship weaken it because the typical "selfish influence" in our "capital" personality. An advertising environment characterized by "creativity" in an atmosphere of stress helps to engage well in the plot. We lose the values ​​of life and this is reflected well and deeply in this gentle and sharp film by Sinza Bell's director. <br /> <br /> The actors are well selected, and Stefania Rocca is a nice, good character and a positive surprise. Fabio Volo is an unexpected good, well known for her TV series "Trash": Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
