GOJOE takes a little getting used to at first, but the end result is very satisfactory. The story, which revolves around the murderous samurai who seeks to recover himself through the opposition of the transgender Samurai, but dangerous, deserves more than an hour. There is much at stake here, from physical survival to emotional salvation. The film may look a bit like the animated Samurai movie at first, but it eventually turns into a more mature / adult area soon after. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the best samurai films that revolve around the post-Kurosawa phase. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for more details about film and other foreign movie reviews)
