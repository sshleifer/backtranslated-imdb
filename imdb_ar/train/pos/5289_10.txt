John Waters made a small, open, nostalgic, dark and personal film that I think I've ever seen (Fast Fasts and Yum's may come second). The directors' vision is not polluted ... The eccentric narration and characters are personal and strange reflections of the family and its inner life ... Tone has never been forced or not deviated from design. <br /> <br /> There is no design shot, design, magazine or magazine. Plimpton is amazing like a sister .. Eddie Furlong is inspired by casting. Jeddah with Mary talking, packaged in tea, recycled clothes, yesterday's trash is the art of the day - the lesson learned from the film is that the most important thing we can appreciate is the family ... and a modest life.
