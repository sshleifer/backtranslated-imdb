The power of Kangwon County is the second director of Hong Sang-soo. It is clear that most of what he began in his previous film dates back to this film, including several related narratives (in this case, two), stories of disturbances or anxiety relationships, Ironically. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that has been clearly reduced from his previous work, Fancy Trips, which included elements of Surrealism. However, this film also contains one surrealistic moment that contrasts with the realist picture that exists there. The two stories follow a young woman making a trip to Kangwon County with her friends, to find herself planted for a stranger, and the second for a man who also goes on a trip to Kangwon County with his friend and is struggling for his relationship. Woes. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hong shows a strong understanding of the absurdities and flaws of human nature, yet I do not think he is entirely unfriendly when it comes to his characters, attracting enough compassion to compensate for his irony. I think the idea that I came to love in Hong's films is that she feels realistic, especially complex and conflicting characters. Not to say that every person is hypocritical or suffers from confused feelings, rather that these characters he and the actors represent, feel they are sophisticated and fully reliable. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast-moving movie. There are a lot of things stuck, and as in the previous film, things do not always connect immediately, so patience pays off in surprising ways. There does not appear to be any element of the film that is not deliberately placed in the film, which makes me well aware of some additional characters that seem to be dragged into the mix as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Power is an excellent film capable of pumping a level of personal emotion, remorse and longing into a story that highlights the paradox and the impossibility of making human decisions. It's a fairly difficult balance and it's surprising how Hong managed to pull him out twice in a row. The values ​​of artistic production have become much better since the first film became clear and clear. This film does not pack the same emotional connection as the first, but it is gaining much in its sure exploration, and refinement really helps to narrow the overall vision. Great show for art cinema lovers. 10/08.
