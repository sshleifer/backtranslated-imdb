One can not enjoy these gems, hidden rays 1936, often. But can not forget it. The story is elegant. Karlov, who is shocked and bitter at his mountain retreat in the Carpathian Mountains, is Janus Roch, a genius who reads ancient light beams to confirm events in the great geological past - especially the crash of a powerful radio telescope in Africa. Joining him is Lugosi always elegant (as a rare hero), who studies "astro chemistry". Francis Drake is a beautiful and untapped young wife. Frank Luton romantic seduction; Violet Campbell Campbell is Rokh's mother, in the performance worthy of Maria Ospenska. <br /> <br /> The story moves quickly in bold episodes, with special effects still beautiful. It also has some wonderful fonts. One Rukh returns to see his mother, asking, "Mother, can you see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever before, and what I see frightens me." Even better when the mother says Rukh, "I have violated the first law of science." I am not alone in my acquaintances puzzled for many years exactly what this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a desert island material.
