When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. Her greatness caught my attention so much that I focused all my attention on her throughout her life. I recommend seeing it not only for anime fans, but for anyone who likes a fantastic film period (or really likes weird things). The art style is beautiful, the sound perfect, and the symbolism inside it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange inclusion of the English text in the film, but I think the way it was complemented by the strange style of the film. Self-described description of "Hello Kitty on acid" This film is not entirely of epic proportions. I would like to find more work by who has done this and seen it.
