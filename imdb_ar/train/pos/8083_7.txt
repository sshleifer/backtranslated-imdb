If you have read books, forget the letters on which Tolkien built your head. I've been representing hobbies, dwarfs and so on a Disney treat. The dark racers are excellent, and as I always imagine books. <br /> <br /> In terms of cinematography, this is an excellent film that blends live motion and animation to produce spectacular effects this year. I just wish to have (Bakshi) had earned the money to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> It's worth getting the video because it will be worth a bit after 2001 Lord of the Rings !!
