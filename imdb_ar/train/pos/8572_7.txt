The first film was beautiful, but not as good as the wonderful classic animation I found more exciting and moving. This sequel is the lowest, but not bad at all. Make sure that the paper is a lot of paper jams, as the program contains its weaknesses, and the plot is not in the morning. But the dogs are very nice here, and Eric Idel is as hilarious as the parrot. It is good to watch the film through elegant films and special fashion for the eye (especially Cruella's), and the music is enjoyable. The acting is mostly very good, and Ian Grover is attractive and Gerard Depardieu was the best performer and he is the Cruela partner. But the best profit, as in the first film, is the glamorous Glenn Claus in his playful performance like Cruela, more evil than before. Overall, nice. Bethany Cox
