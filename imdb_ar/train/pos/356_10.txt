Turned out to be a neat production with what should be a low budget. A variety of amazing characters, from the dwarfs that carry the ax to the 7ft Ghoul! I enjoyed the relationship between the prospects, not too emotional but romantic enough to keep the attention. I also enjoyed the humor mix (which can be very easy to be wrong, too many / not enough) which means that it has not become too dark, nor too stupid. It was a big step from the efforts of the other Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of story and production. They have a great location which is worth checking out. Bane can not wait, if the level of improvement continues, it should be great.
