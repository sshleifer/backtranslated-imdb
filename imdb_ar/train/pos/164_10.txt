Do not say I did not warn you, but you'll laugh. Maybe it's enough to hurt your stomach. It sure got some blood splattered, all in good fun. So, it has no budget, who needs a budget when you get such a script. <br /> <br /> Take your time and check it out. Worth watching for two hours. If everyone laughs as much as they laugh during this film, the world will be a happier place to live. <br /> <br />
