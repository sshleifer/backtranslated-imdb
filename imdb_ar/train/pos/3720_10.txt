Joel Schumacher made a choice among the options when he decided in this film and this script. The story is well written and well illustrated, and this entirely new set of 10 or 12 central characters was extremely impressive. There seem to be 6 "threads" and about half of the supporters, this is the best thing about the film, the new youth faces of tomorrow. It has been a long time since Hollywood touched the controversial Vietnam War movies, which say something about "the story to be told" (as Schumacher put it) and Tiggerland landing in a handful of the best war films. However, it can not be classified as a war movie because it seems more based on the human spirit of Bouz and others. I think anyone wants to just see a good movie with all their own foreign currency, but good and bold drama should go to see Tigerland, and Shumachers Best is obviously working in the last eight years.
