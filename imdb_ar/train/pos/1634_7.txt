At first, the film caught his first show on HBO in 1981, and I was probably 15 years old, and I think the film was a joy. I do not remember seeing pictures of Alfred E. Newman set out in theatrical trailers. When Mad Magazine scoffed at the film and suddenly stopped halfway with an apology from the "usual gang" to slap it down with such foolishness, I assumed she was manipulating herself, which I'm sure he was, but to find them seriously (and Ron Lipman) embarrassed to remove their names From any credits, I was very surprised. Certainly there are many of the worst films associated with them. Watch the movie on the video now (at the age of 32) With the restoration of the MAD references, I still get out of it. As a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, where is Poppa?) I think it is the jewel of its crown of offers (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
