Overall I was fairly impressed with the pilot. The first 15 minutes were worrisome, as I felt that the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The OC, but this fear is corrected in the event of a terrorist incident and hence the presentation turns into topics and positions I rarely see. BSG has addressed topics such as Tawheed, , But it was primarily a subtext, the viewer has to think or ignore it if he chooses to do so. Here, on the other hand, these themes are the focus of the presentation and I personally find myself conjuring up works like Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points during the viewing and being surprised at the quality of the discussion. I think if you're a fan of the two programs you've just mentioned or other movies / TV shows that address the topics I've mentioned, I think you'll find something at least here. <br /> <br /> In terms of starting point to explain how the situation we know at BSG I think they dealt with it in a very interesting way, I was especially impressed how they explained where the faith of Celon came from one God and created Caprica only sufficiently advanced and contemporary Technology has been thrown to make it appear in the future but not entirely alien to us as viewers. <br /> <br /> The only real weaknesses I noticed were the relationship between Greystone's parents and actress Lacy Rand. While Eric Stoltz and Paola Malcolmson individually liked their scenes, they seemed to lack chemistry. At this point, the reason could be to develop their personalities, but that's something I think needs work. I also found Magda Abanovic not convinced in turn. This may be due to the experience and time needed to develop it, but throughout the episode it seemed to be forced and not entirely confident. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot, I am very much looking forward to seeing where to go "Caprica" ​​the future and hope to touch the greatness that BSG once.
