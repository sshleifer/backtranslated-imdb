"Watching before Satan" is one of my best experiences in the cinema. I was intrigued by my mixed response to the film - and for me, the extreme view is that the film touches something the public has adopted or rejected. It's one of those films that stayed with me and I'm still thinking about them. <br /> <br /> Surely the DVD will light up some of the topics and elements of filmmaking? Which include: Sidney Lumet's return film, the time-shifting technique that has been published in storytelling, the wonderful blend of Lumet and Masterson and why it works well, the main direction, and the relatively rare focus of Hollywood films that give it to male characters and tragedies are largely struggling to Becoming a checkbook open to her women, the imperfect performance, yet echoing the performance of Marisa Tome and, of course, the wonderful Hoffman with the central monologue around the sum of its parts - to me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Phew! Definitely a witty movie. So imagine my disappointment in watching the expected DVD eagerly - just to find any comments, no behind the scenes, no interviews, no extras. <br /> <br /> Hey - distributors - categorize them!
