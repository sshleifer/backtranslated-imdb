I have a lot of time for all Colombo films, but this film in particular was very well written, and the solution in the end is very effective. However, my main memory of this one is the opening scene in the middle of the film, between Colombo and the murderer (I apologize if I do not remember all the details of this exactly). It is the most striking picture in Colombo that I have seen: the scene from the darkness of the coffin where the victim was killed, and in the room beyond, illuminated by daylight. Colombo sits on a high-backed chair facing the entrance (we), pondering the closet, and almost in a silhouette because of the contrast in the light. there is no sound. The camera moves slowly out of the room and goes up towards it. It is deep meditation, gently blowing on the cigars, the smoke swirls of the cigars spin slowly upward as believed. Then the dialogue begins. Wonderful.
