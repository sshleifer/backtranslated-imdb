In 1978 this phenomenon began. John Carpenter's "Halloween" release led people to line up in a column around the mass to witness evil, Michael Myers. Critics loved her, loved her world, and was imitated, and became one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Plot: 15 years after the murder, four (all) female friends are babysitting (and eating with their friends) on the night of Halloween. After escaping from the hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to hunt down these people. Three of them were killed silently and accurately. He does not speak. He walks slowly. It hides .... <br /> <br /> Only one of the friends runs away, after being rescued by Doctor Lomis (Michael's stalker and his doctor) <br /> <br /> There is one reason why Halloween makes good work. simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he is killing, and he frightens us. These are the only reasons that make us afraid. <br /> <br /> John Najar wrote and directed the film. Builds an unbearable tension throughout the story, frightening to an extent that can not be seen at times. The peak is truly spectacular. <br /> <br /> As horror, this is necessary. It's terrifying and behaved well. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human being. Undeniable strength. <br /> <br /> The disciples focused a lot on Michael and his "history". This film focuses on fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this thing is a masterpiece.
