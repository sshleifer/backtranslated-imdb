If you are not in a mood for more than a long hour, this movie may give you some variations. What I like is the constant surprises. Not only once you want to continue one or more short film movies in "New York Love You". Yes, some short films make you curious, some are very short, some are longer, others have definite ends, some do not end. <br /> <br /> Most of the story shows the sad side of the capital. This shows many different backgrounds of nationality. Many of them, I make it look the same way I once went to a capital in other countries for a year where many people come from different countries. This film explores many kinds of things you may have known, but for all characters, they are new things. Some of you may have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; feel the dream and sadness, but the kind of sadness you are looking for because you are bored in your home. You may want to recreate life again, by watching this.
