I'm not sure why it is not running in Peoria, but this is a very funny and clever British comedy. It was set at the end of the "swinging 1960s". Peter Silars is as wonderful as the forty serial serial spoiler. The absolutely delicious Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American girl in London, is, in the beginning, a "sell of the day". But the food critic can not prevent the same urbane from falling for the dizzy American dick. <br /> <br /> Humor, compassion, brilliant writings and powerful presentations from potential clients and supportive class. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, and the best part is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll like it.
