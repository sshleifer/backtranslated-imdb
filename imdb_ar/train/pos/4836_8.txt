I saw the film a few days ago on a video, and although it was hard to swallow it in one shot (due to its length and story), I was very impressed with it. I was first impressed by the script and then achieved this script. The film takes you on a journey, but this is not an easy and joyous journey; it passes through different political systems and shows its impact on the lives of ordinary people. What I liked was the inner logic of the film; logic, like logic in life, was illogical and confusing at times, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and developments were logical. It is illogical to try to re-narrate the story as it spreads in more than 50 years. I also liked Alexey's personality for the character of Nikita Mikhalkov and the way he played, as some critics saw, while giving up anxiety. What I do not like about it is that I think he later played characters who reminded me of Alexey in films like "Hard Romance" (Zostokij Roman, which I really love) and, to some extent, "Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye". I think that "Siberia" shows what the great filmmaker Andrzej Konshalowski was before he went to Hollywood and made forgotten films such as "Tango and Kash" and less forgetful like "Runaway Train". Best Ria Kuroshka for them ...
