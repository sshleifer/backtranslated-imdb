Despite being told from a British perspective, this film is the best documentary produced by World War II. Appear in digestible rings (can be digested as much as they can be a war) where the dangerous voice of Laurence Olivier links many eyewitnesses forced to live in the events of that dreadful time. We are anxiously awaiting its appearance on the DVD in the United States. The Europeans had the opportunity to release a DVD earlier this year.
