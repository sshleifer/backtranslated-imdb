It's a really good movie and I enjoyed watching it several times. Michael Kane is as wonderful as always. Michael Kane earned a good reputation for any role in any film regardless of quality or lack of himself, but he played a good role in playing Sydney. From the beginning written well. Who would have thought that Era Levin, who wrote things like the boys from Brazil and Rosemary Baby, could have written something so cleverly. Let's face it - Michael Keane, Chris Reeve, Diane Cannon, and Henry Jones ... How would you be wrong with this good film directed by Sydney Lumette. <br /> <br /> I am very conservative to go on because if anyone gave up anything about this movie it would be a crime. Just watch it and adore it.
