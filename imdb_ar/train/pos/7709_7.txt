I know that I love this film, and I do it often, but as others have said, it is a bit old. I also found raging hormones of all male crew members to be a bit annoying. It is no wonder that they did not start gurgling and whining in moons as well. I must also say that the film leaves me cool in general. It's a very sterile atmosphere permeating the film. On the plus side, the effects are great (besides the cartoon beast), as well as effects, props, costumes, and of course ruby. If you are not a robot in this movie, I do not think it would have been as popular as it was. The second half of the movie gets stronger as soon as we start exploring the forgotten tools of "Krell". As many times as I saw this movie, Krell still lets me scratch my head exactly who they are or what they were. Based on what was produced at the time, along with "This Island Earth," Forbidden Planet is a million miles higher than the average science fiction movies of the time. Being photographed in color also adds to the enjoyment. Definitely a classic in itself, the faults are all, and worth it.
