This show is well worth watching. She has the best crew of talent I've seen in a long time. The supply hypothesis is unique and modern (I think ABC executives do not use it either, because it was not another realistic offer). However, this offer was reasonable with beloved characters and wonderful storylines. I'm not 40 years old, but many of my friends also love him (late 30s - mid 40s) and die in order to get quality offers with talented crew members. I do not think this show will give enough time to gain an audience. I think that in the light of more time, this offer will be good. Again, ABC does not make a real offer that has a real chance. With lots of offers granted time after time and not worth it! They need to give quality offers a real opportunity and time to really click and win an audience. I really liked the characters and I look forward to watching every episode. I've been watching episodes on ABC videos and the show continues to improve. Although I think they owe us another one (No. 13?). We want to see what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and messages and see if it is possible to save this exhibition from extinction. Definitely worked for Greco. Some things are worth saving and this offer is definitely one of them. Sign the petition online at ABC AT: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
