Teresa Pavlainck was a famous member of the Toronto Second City team. I have done many guest sites and commercials here in Canada. Finally someone has a feeling to create her show. Support case looks very good too. I have seen the pilot now several times and I still find him refreshing. However, I am not sure why the program was presented as a 2004 Jane Show. (I may be wrong) But to my knowledge, this show was conceived in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. New Idea Hope to do well. Too bad, can not be associated with Corner Gas. Now I know that the corner gas is on the CTV channel, but the exhibits will be two adorable pieces.
