Although this movie is cheerful at its best, it is completely withdrawn. This film, no doubt, must be considered a classic of modernity. There are two basic types of movies that I like - deep films (chick flicks, if you have to - I blame my wife for that) and reckless comedy where I can sit and relax. This film is a perfect example of this latest film. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine turned me into this film shortly after it was released. He told me due to the fairly shallow, "You have to see this movie. In front of the insult, I began to watch. I know they have mentioned Ramon a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it's Ramon." My friend replied: "I do not know they were a real band." I had my own moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This movie, although somewhat dated now, has to be seen by Ramones fans - or anyone else.
