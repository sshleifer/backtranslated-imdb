Night Of The Living Homeless is a spoof of 1978 (and a new version of the 2004 film) for "Dawn Of The Dead". Just this time ... with the homeless. The episode includes homeless people coming to South Park and people can not figure out why. They are treated like homeless zombies who want to change and end up with a few parents on the roof of a supermarket as in the film. So it is now up to the boys to know where they came from and how they can get rid of them. This is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys who sing their own version of the song 2pac / Dr.Dre "California Love". Overall a good loop. <br /> <br /> 8/10
