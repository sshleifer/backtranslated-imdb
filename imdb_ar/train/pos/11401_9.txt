The American in Paris, in many ways, was the ultimate blend of Hollywood music and music. The film was made at the height of MGM as a musical force, and the film presents an unforgettable music by Gershwin, who rightly called the equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart in the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Jane Kelly was also at the height of his power in this film, although it can be said that this film was just ready for his best work in Singin in the Rain (1952). In fact two films are closely related. Apart from Arthur Fred's connection, Broadway's Melody in "Rain" is due to his amazing American presence in the Paris Ballet series in this film. This may be the only time that the dance number has been mentioned in the opening credits of the film. He deserves to be so, because he shows Jeanne Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to the fullest. <br /> <br /> The film crew is uniformly excellent. Leslie Karon, who makes her film for the first time in an incredible way, is a mature stage that makes you think she has been making films for years. Her primer sequence of dance, and her later work on ballet, offers some of the most astonishingly exciting moments that MGM Musicals competes with only through the work of Send Chares in Singin in the Rhine and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is as hilarious as Bill Kelly in his novel, which gets the best moments of the film: during the last concert sequence (which I will not give to anyone who has not seen the movie), and one of the most memorable musical numbers in the film that combines his wonderful piano and influences Special Modern (for time). <br /> <br /> George Gucci is not forgotten as a romantic rival to Kelly, although he has some notable musical features, Nina Fuchs as Leslie Karon's romantic rival. The relationship between May and December between the character of Kelly and Nina reminded me of the "reserved man" relationship seen between George Bebard and Patricia Neal at breakfast in Tiffany. <br /> <br /> There are a few elements of film that make it less satisfying to me than Singin 'in the rain. Ballet, despite its luxury and good production, does not really fit with the rest of the film. Without giving up the plot, ballet only happens, without any rhyme or real reason. Unlike Broadway Melody, it really has nothing to do with the plot - and in the best of musicals, songs always have a kind of reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the end of the film takes place immediately after the ballet. Although the end should not be a surprise (this is a MGM musician, after all), I was hoping for more ... The film after the ballet. It seems as if director Vincent Menelli felt he could not follow the ballet with anything else. The film literally left me at stake. <br /> <br /> This downside aside, an American is rated in Paris as well as the best musical works in Hollywood. It does not reach the highest levels of Singin 'in the Rain, but it is approaching and will remain a testimony to Jane Kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
