A brilliant chess player comes to the tournament and falls in love with a woman who meets her there. This will in itself be a very bad angle in the story. So, there is more. There is a fact that the chess player has been completely isolated from the world because of his brilliance in the game and the fact that there is some history chasing the player. <br /> <br /> This film retracts back and forth about romantic trivialities to tighten the tournament on the historical events that formed the chess player and works very well. It is easy to become associated with the two main characters and it is easy to believe that they might collide with each other as they do in this film. The extra effect of the tournament is very good and creates a great situation for tension. <br /> <br /> I have no idea about the strength of chess players because I do not play the game myself but it looks nice and believable. All in all, most of the film falls very easily. And forget again too easily though. So it's good to see but not more. <br /> <br /> 7 out of every 10 players in the chess game are caught between the crow and the hard place
