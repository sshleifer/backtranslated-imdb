I've been so excited to watch this movie because I've always heard it was very scary. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that a Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they have already photographed Japan with the original crew! I think this made the film ... more Japanese (this is probably why it's somewhat successful unlike most horror movies from Japan to America) but it also made it not possible for American audiences. The difference in what frightens the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture I felt throughout the film. It worked well in moments when they planned to catch the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a large, busy and unfamiliar pool in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The story of the story was also very confusing. In typical Japanese fashion is very complex and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story and from there we move continuously forward and backward until we see at the end of the film the end of the whole story and the beginning of the story. This constant flipping over time was very confusing to me. Also, I did not think that some things were well explained and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (they had already seen them, as well as the sequel to reveal more of the story apparently). <br /> <br /> In general, there is much to be loved by the American public, tons of horrific images and horrific details that represent a wonderful array of jumping scenes.
