This movie was great! It was an excellent rendition of an ancient legend. The animation was a little weird, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It has been a different level of work for Disney people. Some characters were small box-like, but they were more than just compensated with the beauty and charm of the scene. The music was pretty helpful but this was perfect for the film. This was certainly not a film that needed characters to statue to song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
