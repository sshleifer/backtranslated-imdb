JUST CAUSE is a flawless but decent film with strong performances and some creative writing (albeit very predictable). Sean Connery is a crusader against the death penalty brought to save a young black man who appears to be innocent (Blair Underwood) of the final punishment. To set things right, Connery starts at the crime scene, where he must deal not only with time, but the intervention police chief (Lawrence Fishburne). The shifts and twists and turns of the roles are many - some amazing, and others are not - where the old crusaders try to uncover the mystery. The climatic end is a bit ridiculous, but the only reason worth looking at is a slow night.
