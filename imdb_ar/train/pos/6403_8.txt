Honorary men show Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance yet. He plays Carl Bracher, a man of courage and high-profile heroism. He is a poor farmer from the south, who wants to become a naval submarine, but has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert De Niro, is an underdeveloped, yet grows to respect Prachir. The film revolves around how Prachir should agree with almost insurmountable difficulties, not once but twice. The shows are the ones that make this movie special. Gooding is wonderful, and DeNiro, the best actor in the history of cinema, offers a wonderful performance - his best drama in years. Charlize Theron offers strong performance as a much smaller wife to Dinuero. The film puts the patriot very little (although not near the level at which Patriot was), and there are a few characters that are just one bad-dimensional (Mr. Holbrooke's film Mr. Bape is very wicked), but the film is a rarity among the movies today. It is upscale and naive. Wonderful movie
