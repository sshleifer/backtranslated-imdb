This is by far the shortest part of making two comic geniuses. From the time they walk in, until the time Hardy gets off the roof, this makes me hysterical. I strongly suggest that all lovers of Laurel and Hardy should see this briefly. I also recommend every Ghost series. If you are looking for laughter, watch this movie and you will be happy.
