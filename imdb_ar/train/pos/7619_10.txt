it's interesting. Thrilling. dramatic. explosive material. composite. The Melhem. Words that touch only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the great story that has been told. <br /> <br /> From representation to rare visual effects, LOST is the primary display on TV for science lovers. - Imagination, imagination, movement, adventure and a lot of mystery. <br /> <br /> Each member is chosen well and very well in his roles, so that he likes or dislikes them, or wishes them dead. <br /> <br /> Visible effects, when used (which is rare), are already well executed taking into account the usual production of presentations. Whether it's a "smoke monster", for polar bears, LOST is believable in terms of eye candy. <br /> <br /> As far as the stories are concerned, nothing compares to the enormous complexity that this show has made viewers like. I bear. From start to finish, continuity is almost perfect, characters are developed, and the story that develops always gives answers to its questions very slowly. <br /> <br /> In general, there is no disadvantage in LOST. The dramatic / scientific television is what Arrested Development has done for comedy: the obstacle has been put in place. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend LOST to those who have patience, thought and love at every moment of the trip, no matter how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> See this offer.
