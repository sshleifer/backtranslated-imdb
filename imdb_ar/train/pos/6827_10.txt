I spent 5 hours immersed in this film. I have never seen anything close to the tasty funk that this film left me. Do not mind that the female advances in aging dilemmas, human fear outside the screen to watch you. Personally participates in the ninth class, and invests one film with an undeniable common feeling for our lives. I have enjoyed this dalliance with the bitterness of the raw wound deep inside. It is possible to have a mutual set in the history of human encounters that reach beyond pain, isolation and deviant views of oneself and others. The result of our lukewarm configuration is forgiven of a bridge far from the sludge of the dead we must face. Birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit. Realistic effort overlaps with the dark earth of our bankrupt culture.
