This is one of the nicest and best films I have ever made! Although I have only seen forty minutes of it and I have to say that this is a good film. The plot is funny and because there is sex around every corner of this film. It's really funny and I do not see how anyone can love this movie. I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has a somewhat sickly scene in it (trust me, it's not very fun), but apart from this wonderful movie. I appreciate this movie on 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the scheme. Please, if you are a fan of American Pie and would like to see a movie where all the sex is in it, buy this movie. Will satisfy you. <br /> <br /> 10/10
