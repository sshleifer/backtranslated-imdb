Everyone has already commented on cinema (from good to great), characters (larger than life), and structure (chronology, with many references to surfing culture over time). What we miss is the biggest question of social importance: stifling mainstream American culture for something more satisfying and rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was a photographer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm films at local high schools in SoCal. I remember a great feeling of surfing the entire day until my skin was warm, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and trousers and watching the latest night-time movie. Often, the narrator is the same director, reading the script from the paper. Sometimes, a surfing band or a proto-punk band adds music. I was never happier. With the exception of shooting and screaming, I watched the Giants Ride back in time. <br /> <br /> It also reinforced the feeling that life is on the edge of the abyss, do not worry about money and climb the social climb and companies may not answer the question "what is the purpose of life? ladder, not keeping up with Jones, push yourself physically and mentally from For a quick moment of joy and joy, at least for those like Greg Noll and Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something few of us bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to follow: to live life according to our own terms. If we all do exactly what we want in life, it is wonderful to see people who already live their dreams <br /> It was the message that really impressed me.
