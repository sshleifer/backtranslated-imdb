I loved this TV program because it was special to discover a girl on her 16th birthday that she was a witch and that she lived with her aunt at home and they were both witches. Well, take it a few weeks after getting used to. When she used her strength for the first time, it was very enjoyable because she turned her enemy into pineapple. She had to go back and repeat the day. This series is really wonderful, a typical series of teenage girls, but she bounced back from her house and into an apartment with her classmates and then became bored and stopped watching. The other was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and hated the evil Sabrina Lippi's enemy.
