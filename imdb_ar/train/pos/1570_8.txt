Well, here's the personal list of the best Nicktoons shows as it is today: <br /> <br /> 1. All the adults / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teenager </ div> .Gazim Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Note a word with only uppercase letters? This means that this is the Nick program I will talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple but wonderful comedy about three rich cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - who get them in really strange and surrealistic situations, from trying to join the Kimberly Human Sleeping Party For the root beer to save the planet from the mollusks of the evil spaceship. This is one of Nick Nick that you will have a funny tickle sooner or later! The theme song is attractive and memorable. The vocal actors - including Wayne Knight of the Seinfeld franchise - bring characters to a new life with very strange characters. The stories are fun (fans will be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). All the humor is done in some of the C earth worm pattern. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which are very popular all over the world in 3 seasons or less.
