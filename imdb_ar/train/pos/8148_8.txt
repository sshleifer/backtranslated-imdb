I have no interest in rap music and in the culture of the ghetto. I'm white and like classic rock music, but that did not stop me from appreciating this wonderful comedy. It's an integral part of The Is Spinal Tap, meaning it's the same movie as rap instead of rock. Yet it's hilarious. There are many funny jokes but not without some jokes that just fall down. The characters are all very funny and credible. I just watched because it made me laugh at 3 am, and any film that could do that would require at least a test. One of the reasons why these films are so funny is that he makes fun of rap music from a different person. Rap today is worried about the wrong things and get a noise in the studio and a little talent. This movie comes from a time when the rapper deserves more credit. Overall, it's a funny film with many jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the most obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for any fan of this. It's basically the same movie, about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes are working in both films.
