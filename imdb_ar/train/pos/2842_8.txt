New York I love you just like its predecessor (Paris Je T'Aime) is a collection of different stories that reflect the different types of love and its different aspects. On the contrary, the rhythm is much faster and the stories are much shorter. The film offers a unique view of New York City with its different landscapes. New York, I Love You presents top-class actors, including outstanding actors such as Shea Labov, Natalie Portman, Ian McKellen, Hayden Christensen, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawk, James Cann and Robin Wright Bein among others, and some excellent writers and directors such as Brett Ratner and Anthony Mingella.
