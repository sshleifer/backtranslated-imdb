Diego Armando Maradona was 16 years old in 1978 when Argentina won the World Cup at home. He was already the biggest star, and the greatest player in a football obsessed country. Cesar Luis Menotti begged to play the role of genius, but the manager thought it was not yet ready. <br /> <br /> History records have recorded that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup convincingly - they really did not need Maradona. . The same thing was not true in 1982. Spain was a disaster in Argentina. Minotti - still smoking a series of smoking - Diego played this time, but the occasion was too much for such a mood boy. Maradona signed for Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for about $ 7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the Nou Camp and Belgium beat Argentina by zero. It was not the first time that he was lucky, and although he scored two goals against Hungary in the next game, Maradona will remember the World Cup as the site of his lament - a very blatant mistake on Brazilian Batista in the second round, which suddenly ended Argentina's rule as world champions. <br /> <br /> But now it was all behind him. Maradona was confused at times crazy in Barcelona, ​​and left in 1984 to join Naples. It was as if he was finally home. The Neapolitan Tefuci did all he could to tempt Maradona to the poor, without realizing Naples. Gifts from elderly women and pocket money from young children are conveniently located with millions in the Camorra as part of the transportation fee, and the city is designed to make it feel at home. So at least for now, Maradona was El Rey - he brought his Argentine team to Mexico as a candidate, and with new coach Carlos Bellardo replacing Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this story, a one-man machine winning the World Cup. In 1982, hundreds of young people died in a futile battle for the Falkland Islands; now the British press yearns for a return match (with the same result) in Mexico City. Maradona was still seen with distinction in England, and remembered him more than his wonderful performance in Britain during the 1980 tour compared to Spain. But he was still allergic: the enemy. <br /> <br /> England has already started well, and can register for Winnker only 12 minutes later. A major event occurred in 8 minutes. Fenwick, the big and limited English defender, has been booked - he is now terrified of facing any challenges in the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After 45 minutes of nervousness, the second half began a powerful blow. Maradona danced forward after 50 minutes, but did not find a way. Similarly, Valdano's attempt struck only white shirts. Then the moment of shame that serves as Diego. Hodge angrily suspended the ball in his own penalty area, Shilton rushed to claim - but there was Maradona, who rose somewhat above the English goalkeeper to push the ball into the net. How did he do that? Simple: Handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous mistakes in the history of football have been slow. Every spectator waited for Mr. Sharif from Syria to blow because of him (he did not). Shelton looked and appealed to the adjutant - ran to the central circle. Unless the Pope is assassinated, or becomes the first man to step forward on the surface of Mars, when the great man dies, this moment will appear first - with a long slow motion, followed by a look of joy on his face. The next picture will be his next gift to the world - the best goal for the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Borochaga hit the ball for Maradona, who was playing on the right side of the half. He stretches, and accelerates away from Beardsley and Reed. This was the real Diego - Butcher broke into and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick had a chance to stop the attack. Usually, he was aiming to boot somewhere near Maradona's thigh - he was sure he would get a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick had the brilliant idea - he hesitated, decided to run in Maradona waving his arms - maybe he was trying to keep him away? Diego shot inside the box when Fenwick fell. Butcher was running alongside the genius as though he were offering encouragement. Charton was charged in a panic, Maradona twisted around him and ready to register. Now Butcher recalls his role and tried to paralyze the Argentine - instead gave extra momentum to the ball that crashed into the goal. England was back home. <br /> <br /> During this magical Mexican summer, the world found a successor to Pele. In fact, the greatest football player has ever been surpassed - Pele was brilliant in 1958 and 1970, but he had great players around him. Maradona did not. 1986 was his World Cup.
