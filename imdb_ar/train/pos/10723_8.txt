I have read some other user comments and decided to add one. Some users are stuck in a "realistic" type of mentality. This film was supposed to be "fiction" .... an enjoyable film. It was not supposed to be "real" or serious. It was a lot of fun for everyone I knew when I came out - even though she retreated from the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 years old and enjoyed it completely - my little son loved it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she also loved her. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that you should enjoy just for fun. All "realists" in the world must relax or commit to watching documentaries or documentaries and avoiding any other kind of film. I was very sorry for those young people who first saw this movie and then managed to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone on expecting to find the same kind of environment that was filmed in the movie and then felt " Hope "... I think their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh, okay. If you like fantasy fun movies and you do not see this, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
