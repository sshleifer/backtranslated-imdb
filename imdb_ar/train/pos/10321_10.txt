Most people miss the Hollywood concept. If the hero is able to stimulate heroic acts on the child's mind, I agree with the lessons taught by Doc Savage. Public and government search for heroes to decorate. Moviemaking brings heroes to the screen for people to recognize - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as "the best of the best" by James Bond or Superman or any of the others. All others who follow Doc Savage are only part of the character, not the "bronze man".
