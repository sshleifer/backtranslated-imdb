Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door, and enjoy a fun time with this amazing, utterly ridiculous, and extremely miraculous "animation". MYSTERY MEN is a backup of every supernatural click I've ever seen, but the incredible rebels are unlikely to be so interesting, varied, and perfect that they represent memorable characters in themselves. Dark humor, complete absurdity, bona fide movement, and even an influential moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about beloved losers is the real winner. The comedy talent of the actors who play Mystery Men - including Mystery Woman - is an ideal frustration for Wes Studi, which can only be described as the bargain basement Yoda and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most unusual characters of the Wall (and the weirdest villains) ever To walk from the pages of the comic book Dark Horse and on the big screen. Get ready to laugh and cheer and say "huh?" More than once .... Enjoy!
