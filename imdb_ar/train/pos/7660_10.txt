This film is nothing short of a dark masterpiece and courage. I may be biased, because apartheid is an area I've always felt. But I say that it is in the forefront with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Unfortunately, even a few days ago I never heard of this film. Inside, one of the most acclaimed films of all time, perhaps because it was a small film company, I had never heard of before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is reasonable and sexy, Nigel Hawthorne plays his very treacherous role. Not looking for humor in this film, there is nothing. It is real, brutal and brave to the end, and for the sensitive I say bring a box of tissues. But the films that raise this make you wonder, why do not you hear the greatest movies often?
