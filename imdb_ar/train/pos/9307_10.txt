Not a movie for everyone, but this film is among the top 10 films. I am a fan of black comedy. With representatives including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben Brass Bulls in London) in the foreground, the lines can not be dried. Cast support is almost dead center. The slight blemishes in the film: The makeup of Ellen Barkin gave her a washed-out look. There were two great crimes by Joe Bishop and Richard Pryor that did not serve any purpose, and Michael J. Pollard's appearance was very short. And above all, the cast was just stunning without the ego to destroy a good scenario. If you've seen Larry Bishop (Writer, Director), Underworld (Dark Crime Click), you'll enjoy this movie. His next trip (writer, director and actor) is Hill Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
