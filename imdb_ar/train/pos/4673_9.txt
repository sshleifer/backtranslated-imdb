One of the things that got me more interested in this film is how the characters and the associated histories are developed. I suppose the writers wanted to gain attention by not forcing them to feed their characters. The premise of using art and craftmanship to design furniture and construction was unique and / or similar to what families / siblings are going through. The complexity of having a twin acts as an alternative father and so the husband added a great deal of tension towards making this movie emotionally interesting. Also, although the story is not a story that may be directly related to the masses (ie Jewish / Twin / Family business), the themes are rather universal as each family has black sheep. This made them very attractive.
