Anton Neukomb makes the film as the main theme. His watch soon showed him knocking a song unless it was an entire album, showing that the man was a real talent that he thought he was a god but he was fun and fun. DW is not really interesting in comparison musically or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton says to the photographer: "Well let's go this guitar pawn!" Great use of archive / home video materials. Great to see rocky documents still being made. Cool document about the creative process. If you love this go see Nirvana Live! tonight! sold out! On DVD. Good experience Anton is this movie. 8 of 10
