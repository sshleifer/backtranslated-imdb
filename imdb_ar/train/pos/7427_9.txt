I saw the video of this film in the seventies when I was barely 16 years old while watching another movie. Oh!!!! How excited me and my favorite friend. We could not wait for a month or so until the day came. I saw this movie 17 times that year in the theater. I love, love, love. Chris is very perfect for the film. He screams and shakes, but he is timid and uncertain with Babs and it is very lovable to watch him again. When they are always singing in the studio, they are in tune with his coarse voice quite differently from the perfect tunes that come from it, but I always thought it was one of the best scenes in the film. The way he looks at it is very proud. I can watch this movie every day. We tried to wear clothes like est-her I even had a jacket and a long jacket like the one she was wearing. It came on TV on time and my daughters got to see them as teenagers and loved it. Maybe just because I hung out in an age when everything was so intense I do not know. The end was always crying to this day.
