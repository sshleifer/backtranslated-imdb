Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the best in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> I think we could all feel "gypo" because we all struggled with what was right and what was wrong and what was wrong. This was one of the first artistic photos released by a major American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> The image of Joseph August Film is at its best here. However, the stunning August part was mostly ignored. He did not receive Oscar nomination, which he really deserves. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy and sadness, all conveyed in as few words as possible.
