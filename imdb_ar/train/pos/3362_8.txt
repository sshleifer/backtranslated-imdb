"Una Giornata Particolare" is a movie with a title that sounds very familiar and I think I've seen it more than once. Now that I have finally seen her, I am very happy. This is one of the best Italian films I know, with one of the most impressive performances by Marcelo Mastroiani, who starring other masterpieces such as La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2, both from the great Federico Fellini. Directed by Ituri Scola, this film takes some time to introduce characters and slowly develop a story on a special day, the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome. <br /> <br /> Marcelo Mastroiani plays Gabrielle, Gar Antonita (Sophia Loren). She is a member of the Mussolini party, very fanatical in her ideas, a member no longer. The reason I will not reveal. Every day everyone comes out of the building, including her husband and children, to see Hitler, still in the building. An Antonita flies and flies to Gabriel's apartment, and so the two meet. Before Antonita goes to Gabriel he thought of killing himself, again for reasons I will not disclose. I will not reveal how the story unfolds here, but what happens between the two is what makes this day a special day, not the fact that Hitler is in Rome. <br /> <br /> As I said, Mastroiani performed wonderfully. You see it is a man who wants hard around him, although we initially do not know why. Maybe Antonita loves, maybe in her love, there may be other reasons. Antonita feels what we feel. What does this guy want from her? She likes attention anyway. See how she does her hair to look attractive to the man. Lauren plays very good scenes too. We understand her questions, although we can not be sure of her intentions. The moments when we discover their secrets, if that's what you can call it, are a wonderful moment. How the story evolves from there is more interesting, but I do not want to spoil it for you. This is a movie you should see. The great performances, beautiful cinematography and the message you give us are still in place today.
