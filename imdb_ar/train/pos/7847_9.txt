Believe it or not, in 12 minutes, this film (for 1912) is a full length movie. Very few films were longer than that time at the time, but this certainly is not what distinguishes this little film from the other odd movies! No, the difference is that all actors (except for one frog) are mistakes ... yes, mistakes! This simple local comedy could have looked like starring productions such as Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked like bugs). Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy were not discovered after I assume that Linder was busy, so maybe they used the errors! Using stop motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought surprisingly - and Hick was far more realistic than King Kong after 21 years! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Mr. Beetle's infiltration for a good time. Goes to a saucy club while his wife is supposed to wait at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he was caught in the camera by a local film buff. In addition, he does not know this, but Ms. Beetle also continues to work as a painter of the Bohemian grasshopper. Of course, there is so much more to this local comedy, but the plot is old and very enjoyable for adults and children alike. <br /> <br /> Strange but also very amazing and fun.
