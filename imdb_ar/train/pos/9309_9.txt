Dear God where to start. This bar is nothing the best movie I have ever seen. The camera angles are fantastic but in my opinion the acting was the best. Why not write a screenplay script for this film big budget movies I will never understand. Another is cast. It is a nice. This is the best film by Ted Rimi there is definitely. I know that some of you may be thinking "there is not much better" but there is no error you have. Raptor Island is a work of art. I hope he has got the best film of the year instead of Krabi Crash with a group of names without Raptors. I think this film is really the most wonderful thing ever.
