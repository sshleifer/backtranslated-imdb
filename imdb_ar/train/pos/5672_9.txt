In this installment of the series, Edmund Blackcaster is stuck in the Regency period in Britain (during the latter part of George III's reign). This time, the prospects of Blackadder became poorer - instead of kings, he was a servant of George IV the very thick (ruler of prices). Contrary to George IV's historical accounts, this novel is as bright as tomatoes and as a result, Blackadder is able to benefit from it and plan for the content of his heart. The only major difference in style between this one and the older is that the series ends with a very different note - you just have to see it believe it. Otherwise, all elements of the usual story are present and the show is hilarious. My only reservation (as always) is that this offer is not suitable for children due to its difficult language and adult situations.
