Arnold's latest film is excellent. This futuristic film has a great work, one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is framed as a bad man in this film and plays the game of death. This film is excellent and fantastic film / action. I have always loved this film and it must be one of the greatest adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! Perfect
