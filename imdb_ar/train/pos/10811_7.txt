This movie takes you to another time when there was a different pace in everyday life. We have an idea of ​​how families deal with war and how quickly we send our young people to fight. A very impressive look at the past and a reminder that war casualties do not just occur on the front. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, not many of us had to search for our ancestors, grandparents, or fathers during the war. I think this film is small. Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like Peter O'Toole and Roussel Crowe as impressive as Australia. It is certainly worth listening to as he reads "High Flight" and makes me wonder what he might do with Shakespeare.
