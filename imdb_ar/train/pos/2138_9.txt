This film revolves around Japanese culture as much as it is about the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is a disgrace for those over the age of 7 (especially in public places) and then all bowing instead of embracing even when they are close friends / relatives. Dancing in the dance hall involves putting your arms around someone else and so in public places too! Never less than a dance floor is (absolutely) massively popular. People dancing in the dance floor in Japan are seen to resemble nudes in the West ... and many want it more than they do but culture prevents them. A delightful family movie, enjoyed by any amateur dancer for the dance series alone. I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan. I think the Japanese are just like us - they like to hug them too.
