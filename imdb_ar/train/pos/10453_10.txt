While traveling by train across Europe, Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Frances Celine (Julie Delby) meet together and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States, and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of your favorite romances, and it is already one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low-budget film with a very simple and true story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawk and Julie Delby is perfect, and the dialog boxes are amazing. The trend is staggering, conveying the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just completed my 1000 rating on IMDb and chose "Before Sunrise" for this important number because it is a very special movie for me. I can not understand why this film was not nominated for the Academy Award, with script, directing and great performances. Yesterday I may have seen this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
