Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily poor Polish church in the 20th century in Paris and finds itself followed by the most popular figures in France and a charming promise - in addition to being engaged in a shoe pole. This is a failed premise that includes one of the most rave plots in the history of the film. There are behind-the-scenes political machinations by the generals' handlers, a thin balloon and a crowd of Bastille days, but the heart of this beautifully filmed film is the intriguing upstairs frenzy of the Rendezan maids and more aristocratic aristocrats. Yes, they are the rules of the game. Before it all ends, even Gaston Modot, the jealous game keeper in the "Rules", appears in appearance - only a Capo Gypsy! Things happen very little and fast in the end, resulting in some confusion for this language other than French, but what distinguishes it - Elena and Her Men is another Renoir artist deeply human.
