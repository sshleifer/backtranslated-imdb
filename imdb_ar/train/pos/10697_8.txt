A modern romantic story. <br /> <br /> A very good representation of Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman is doing a great job imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also as good as a shy shy writer. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and very sympathetic. I forgot what a wonderful woman she is. It is not hard to imagine that John falls in love with her. Some unexpected turns in the story are good for suspense. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the film was a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
