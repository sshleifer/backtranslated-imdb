Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is interesting to see how a global leader (such as Ch√°vez) who supports the poor in his country can be underestimated in the United States. The worst "sin", in my opinion, concerns those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What could be so bad about it? I was always fascinated by the media reaction from the US government to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good man (around 1959) when he replaced Batista. However, Castro soon began to turn Cuban businesses into the needs of the poor rather than the fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and our government face a problem of engaging with the poor? If these men are "dictators," then we can use more "dictatorships," especially where the world's poorest people live.
