Sentinel is characterized by a type of grinder and suspense / ambiguity, but it is raised with some good speed in representation and confusion. Most of these stories have already gone through as many permutations as we can afford, so what remains is how well represented, how clever and bad the players are, how far the main plot is, etc. ..... so the guard does a strong job since it is content. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland maintain some good attitudes and positions. Eva Longoria (for the first time I saw her on the screen) brings some satisfactory support. The full side of the story is completely implausible, it takes away a little, but it deserves a recession. Worth seeing if you like this kind.
