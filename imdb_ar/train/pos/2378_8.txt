This film is much better than the version of Aesilums mainly war on the worlds. The two racks look very cool but may be walking and dying better. The sights of the movement were really wonderful. Walking ... Walking ... Walking ... Walking !!! Oh God stop walking please or I will kill myself. The baby's thunder scene was a favorite sequentially because a ship shocked a group of trio carriers. A good film I recommend to people who read the book. The music is great and the manager section looks great. <br /> <br /> Positives. 99% good soundtrack on the book "Cool Violence" is a wonderful handling rack and handling machines to look at the downsides <br /> <br />. Some cheese effect acts in London
