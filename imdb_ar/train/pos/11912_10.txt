I enjoyed Albert's "enemy" for his cowardly work and his almost complex text. Many people complain of the "confusing" plot of the first film, which is probably the reason that "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a stupid rock-like plot that has the same super-movement to execute. <br /> <br /> This one gives the name of the first movie hero, Alex, to a large female sent to the past to save the future. I grew up in Africa. A large part of the film contains an African-language dialogue without translation, which I liked because it made it seem fairly authentic (how many times did the films try to do that?). It does not take long until the evil cyborgs get back to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Do not miss me This is a piece of nonsense (not this first one was anything great). There are sub-plans involving political unrest in Africa, hunting treasures, and tribal fighting. The image is too short on the brain, so none of these things get very good treatment. The picture is basically a long battle with some chase that is summed up in the muscle babe vs cyborg game. Her entertainment value, do not expect quality, or anything from the first film.
