Rock and Roll High School was one of the best films ever produced! I think the only reason behind it was great because of Remones! You can not make the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it will not be the same. Dye Young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary and Ronoff, Paul Bartel, and Mont Hall, as well as the film. The whole movie revolves around Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed up at the Rock and Roll High School if you were a real PUNK fan. Not a new crap cisse ... but loud, fast. The only kind Ramones can do. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramon 1951-2001. De-Ramon 1952-2002!
