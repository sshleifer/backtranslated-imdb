Originally, I rented this movie for my daughter because she is keen on football - and I was not disappointed in this way (except for the plot that interferes with football scenes). As a father, I think I was a bit surprised by the introduction of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent, these problems are quite available to children these days (uncomfortable as I feel). In a way, these feelings were an integral part of the film's main premise - that at some ages you should trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma was presented by a British-born teenage girl, Yasminder (Jess), who has an Indian-oriental heritage and dreams of professional football. The marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage offers many of her rich opportunities to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was an interesting way to explore Jess's frustration of her parents' expectations of her - once again essentially different from parent-child relationships. <br /> <br /> In the summary, football scenes are fantastic (much to learn in a slow time) and although I did not need a story - something was needed to continue the film.
