The film was very impressive despite the classification of NC-17 and disturbing scenes. Things actually happen like this and that's why this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in a superb performance) and he started his recent studies at the university and everything is going well for her. Jared (Chad Faust in a terrific performance) meets in a senseless ceremony that turns out to be a real and sweet man. Invite her to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and end up at his apartment. They talk and take it to the basement if they become flirtatious with each other. She is trying to put an end to her, but he is raping her. This incident frightens her. She goes to a club that meets a DJ / Adrian (played by Marcus Patrick) who thinks she is drunk and helps before she goes further. They beat the friendship. As the drug does, Maya starts using as well. In other words he knows it in a different world. She began to return to school and work as a teaching assistant (TA) and Jared as a student. As the students take the intermediate test, Jared realized the fraud. Jared tries to smooth the conversation with Maya, but she still has the upper hand deciding to invite him to her place. Does the history repeat it self? Or will you surprise Maya Jared? You see the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson depicts role with focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like to be raped, but he does a wonderful job like Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very wonderful man who saves Maya and trains her to a new world. This film deserves an award.
