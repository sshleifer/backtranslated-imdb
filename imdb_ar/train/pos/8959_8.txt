Although I agree that it is a good but not a good film, for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned, I still enjoy it. One reason is the music: I would draw attention to the very wonderful appearance by the Candoli brothers - Conti and Betty - in a well organized scene in a nightclub. These men were among the best jazz musicians of their day, and they managed to perplex Jimmy Stewart's mind convincingly by playing a hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of Stuart's ears. Candolis was really playing this well too, although I think the actual music of that scene was later released. I do not know much about George Daning, who got a balance of music (other than that he seemed to have worked with the three geeks on more than one occasion), but choosing the Canadoli brothers as jugglers playing jazz was a real nice touch.
