Ben Thomas (Will Smith), who is haunted by a mystery, seeks salvation by changing the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is drawn, there will be nothing that can stop it. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben did not plan to fall in love with one of these people, which will eventually turn him in. Will Smith once again returned with director Gabriel Muchino, after the inspiring movie Life Pursuit of Happiness. "Seven Pounds" is another film experience that has changed your life, not only reminding you of its former collaboration, full of tears, but ultimately inspiring you. Will Smith, is also a producer again with some others. These films are extremely realistic, depicting a man's common life and struggle through life. Maybe seven pounds took some time to gain their actual momentum, but only half an hour after the film, the whole movie was tuned to your heart. This movie also contains some twists and turns, which allow viewers to follow the guesswork. Director Gabriel Mokino is once again the winner all the way, with his emotional and inspiring message. It makes all characters very real, so that people find themselves somewhere in the film. Along with the director, Will Smith is another winner, with his superb acting skills. Again, the duo works for director and actor as a magician. Also, other talented actors in the film did their part well. Rosario Dawson, beauty with brains, this is what can be called. Looks beautiful and performs its role very well. Barry Piper, offers great support for the film, and Woody Harrelson does the same, although Woody did not have much screen timing (it would have been good if he had had more). You will not forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Cinema top class!
