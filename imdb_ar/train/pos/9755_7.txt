The last time I saw the film I was about seven years old, so my views may dwindle over time. At that time I enjoyed the photography that turned between animation and live movement. At that time I felt sad for the blue camel and its sad life. I was also delighted when Captain Contagos, the heroine of the game, was kidnapped. Unfortunately, the producers did not decide to transfer the film to the VHS, so all I have are 20-year-old memories. I am sure that if I see the film again, I will consider it angry and happy, but I really enjoyed it at the time.
