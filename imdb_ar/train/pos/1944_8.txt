This is an excellent film about the characters in swimming class for adults, their problems, their relationships and their interaction with each other. It should have been distributed more widely because it is much better than similar films from major studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> The swim trainer is almost Olympic, confined to adult education and basic lessons, and is often the target of horndogging by his students. Trying, more or less, to repel them, with varying results. <br /> <br /> Student characters are the mainstream of the United States; teachers, police, university students and retirees, all of whom have not learned to swim for some reason. The film covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as the class passes. Several sub-schemes provide amusing fodder, including a divorce teacher, some high school students produce a documentary film, and a girl only in class to meet men. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie or just one to watch when you are in the mood for a romantic drama with reality ringtones.
