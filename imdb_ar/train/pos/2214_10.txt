My family came back to New Orleans in the late 17th century, and when I saw the film I knew it was a history that my ancestors never spoke about, but we knew it was there. I have cousins ​​who are obviously blacks nicknamed African Americans and others who can "pass" as white and choose not to. It is a difficult history to watch when you realize that your family is talking about it and that a river was part of that history. Makes me want to cry, and makes me want to kick the "ass" of my great ancestors who owned these farms and wonder how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under this repressive and aristocratic existence ... I will not be the successful businesswoman I live today in a fairly integrated world. The acting was excellent and fair depending on the actor, but the film needs to be made. Ann Rice does not believe it and ask myself, why is it "symbolic" you write about my family and not as well. I recommend this movie to everyone. Lisa
