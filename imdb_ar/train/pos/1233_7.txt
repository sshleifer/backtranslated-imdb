A strange role for Eddie Murphy in taking her at the height of his career. While there is plenty of Eddie Murphy's character, he plays the role of a truly respectable person. The rest of the cast is good, especially the beautiful Charlotte Lewis. The beauty of her character and her silence kept the film's tone from becoming too much Murphy.
