Bogmeister and others have heard this pretty much. Shore Leave is the first attempt at the TOS in lightweight science fiction (which would later be achieved with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). Both the Foundation staff and television viewers have given them the required respite from the consequences of the universe that threatens, for example, The Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Looking for a place to relax for a while, the organization happens across the seemingly romantic M Class Planet, and sends an exploration team to take a closer look. Soon, all sorts of absurdities begin to appear - some of them seem risky - but all seem to have become a mood for the human emotional parties that have been engaged in a strange mix of wonderful mystery (McCoy passed by the glass of sight), psychological thriller (Kirk Chase) By bully that can not be compensated by his past), and comedy romance (no comment). <br /> <br /> The TOS was the least serial in all the Trek franchise series, so it's easy to forget the number of episodes in the first season focused on the potentially disastrous drama. Unlike the subsequent franchise series, the TOS production team was not afraid to go literally to any place never seen before. The Good Shore, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (especially Shatner - paradoxically given the sense of legendary humor) - does not seem to know how to deal with this new wrinkle around ST themes. Perhaps the last scene is one of the worst scenes I can remember from running the entire TOS - both formically and in terms of representation. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. My recommendation - watch it while watching the entire first season as it was supposed to be seen - arranged.
