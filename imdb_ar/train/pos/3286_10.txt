Simply put, this film is terrifying. <br /> <br /> The show begins simply as a study of a rebellious little girl and goes on to become a beautifully made horror film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect Gore, or zombie. This is something myself, and just as he does in Candyman, Bernard Rose is capable of conveying an unbelievable horror. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you get to know more about what's going on, and how to connect the two worlds in this movie. <br /> <br /> The graphics were no more frightening than before.
