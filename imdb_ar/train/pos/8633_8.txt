Nicholas Mallet is a failure. A cashier in a bank, everyone walks over him. Then he has a friend, a writer who does not like his books, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss that he is resigning. He plans to spend the rest of his life making a lot of money and sleeping with a large number of women. He was able to do so. <br /> <br /> If it is not the amount of death (homicide / suicide / natural causes) in the film, it would be a farce. There are many stabs in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trentigant is a sexually immoral rogue. Rumi Sneijder is in her attraction. Definitely worth a look.
