When the mutant becomes a pulmonary plague, a US public health official, Dr. Clinton Reid (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantines anyone known to have been near the body. Unfortunately, this road is solidified by killing, and there is a good chance that the killer will start spreading the plague, leading to an epidemic. Police Chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who was recruited to track down the killer as soon as possible and avoid a possible national disaster, entered. <br /> <br /> While street panic is a good movie, it suffers from being a bit unfocused and slightly sprawling (my reason for being down to eight). She roams the gangs of gangs to the medical and procedural disaster of police, excitement and even romance. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of director Elia Kazan, but to say that this is a bit deceptive. Kazan is responsible for masterpieces such as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all. This film precedes them, but Kazan said he was "not already" bound by the studio. Taking this freedom too far may partially account for the extension. The film was shown in New Orleans, the city where Kazan used to wander around. He wanted to take advantage of the environment. "I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses and jazz joints - all areas of New Orleans." <br /> <br /> Kazan deals with every kind of street panic well, but it can be better connected. The film benefited by staying with only one or two temperaments. The extension in terms of setup was still working. Part of the dilemma may be due to the fact that street panic was an attempt to combine two stories by Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like Im Cool." <br /> <br /> The gangster, which ends up firmly in the excitement zone with a long, protracted scene near the end of the film, may be the salient point. It is not surprising that Kazan says he thinks the bad guys are "hotter - I did not have much affection for loved ones anyway. The second is the only article that approaches the "panic" of the title - the discovery of plague and attempts to track the open, vaccinate and contain the disease. While there is a lot of suspense during these "moods", much of the film is also fairly clear drama, with a more traditional speed of the genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is excellent. The stylistic difference in many modern films can not be clearer. It is intelligent, connected quickly and well by each character. Conflict is not created by "stupid" decisions but smart moves; events and actions of characters are more like a game of chess. When unusual positions are taken, such as Reid's blocking of plague in newspapers, he presents relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions, which are disputed by other personalities. <br /> <br /> In light of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "convenience, religion, morality and the middle class all kill us." This idea makes its way into the film through amendments to the standard, or rather, by the heroes. For example, Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) is offered a "Prison Break Free" card if he cooperates in the fight against plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are fine, if there is nothing exceptional, but the real reasons for watching are the shows, the sedition scenario and the well-written dialogue.
