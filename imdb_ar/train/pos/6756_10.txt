Otto Breminger, who completed the Noir course at the Twentieth Century Fox Theater, combined his roles with Laura in this stark, provocative drama. Dana Andrews once again portrayed a policeman, but this time he became pessimistic and sarcastic. His boss accused the police brutally - "You do not hate the skullcaps, I loved beating them!" Mark Dickson (Andrews) despises criminals, because his father was an impostor. He does not want to be Sandy Dixon's child until he becomes a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hateful. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating a murder, one of the suspects, Ken Pine (Craig Stevens), is hard to kill. Dixon shakes his best to cover them up, and plans to frame the hated thugs, Scalese (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the father of Payne's husband, Giggs Taylor (Tom Tally), whose daughter, a big shop muse, Morgan Taylor (Terni), was distanced from her husband but continued to be attracted to his gambling schemes. Payne slapped his wife, which angered her father, who appeared in his son-in-law's apartment, but not until Dixon left with the body. With no better suspects, Giggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Mark flips with Morgan and gives money to the lawyer. He decides to take Scalise anyway, but leaves a letter sent to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything. In the end, he can not live with knowledge of what he has done, and allows the message to be read by his boss and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan realizes her love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD, after many years of televised mystery. Eddie Mueller, the Noer film historian, makes a comment and does a good job, but I find that the masses would not have discovered the importance of choosing two potential customers because Laura was produced six years ago. In this regard, he is wrong because he appeared in "The Iron Curtain" two years before WTSE and the movie was successful at the box office. <br /> <br /> Both Andrews and Terney were amazing together, and Ruth Donnelly feels tremendous comic relief as the restaurant owner Martha, fueling fire between the detective and the girl. <br /> <br /> The city's night views give the film a dangerous atmosphere. Gary Merrill is as wonderful as the old-fashioned Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("I loved your father to me, he ridiculed Mark"), Karl Malden and young Neville Brand are also wonderful Tom Tally is as influential and funny as pop Who unfairly accused her. <br /> <br /> A famous Nawar movie with great actors.
