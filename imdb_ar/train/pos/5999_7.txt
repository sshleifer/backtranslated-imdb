This is a strange film for me, and after reviewing a beautiful film by FAR OUT by Phil Mucci, another writer / director, Ryan Jeffrey, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film, The CURE. I usually do not review films this way, but what I like - I like short films and I could not wait to see another. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, while it turned out that I liked the treatment, I was not overjoyed and let Jeffrey know. To his good judgment, he encouraged me to review him anyway - giving him my sincere assessment. <br /> <br /> The film is phenomenal and as far as Jeffrey goes, it's exceptional - especially for an inexperienced filmmaker (it's his first film). Created a range of exceptional color, speed and music choices that suit the film's sense of atmosphere. You have been really drawn to the film and this is credited to the film industry. However, the thing I did not like was some writing. While the basic idea was brilliant, the end was very easy to predict. I really liked the finish if it was a surprise or there was an unexpected twist. However, given that this film is from someone who should not be able to produce such a professional film because of his experience, it bodes well for his future. good job.
