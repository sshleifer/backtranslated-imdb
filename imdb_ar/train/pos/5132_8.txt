Jazz fans will enjoy this classic short story featuring some of the best jazz musicians who do their work. It's like watching a music video without a decoration today. <br /> <br /> Jazz men give you extra fun in the person of Mary Bryant, who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I have never heard her sing before, Bryant looks like Billy Holiday. This compliment people. <br /> <br /> Their effective work is also tops. With black cinema in its time fed on many white stereotypes, will see this film and cherish it. There are no fantastic production values, just a lot of good music.
