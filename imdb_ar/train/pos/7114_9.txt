Certainly in the top five films John Garfield must be the pride of the Marines. This is the true story of the special Marine soldier who was at the expense of his own look, while the injured wounded a crowd of Japanese who stormed Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds well in three parts: the life of the Shmeid house, where he is hard at work, simple and seriously treats a woman and likes nothing better than a bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and is on its way to war as millions of others have. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal and we see part of the work where it was in the nest of an isolated machine gun, stopping the Japanese troops. His actions prevented him from crossing the Marines, but a grenade in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Of course, the third part is his painful adjustment of civic life and to reassure himself that people are not only interested in pity, and most importantly, the girl Eleanor Parker saw. <br /> <br /> This movie was broadcast on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary about Garfield hosted by his daughter. One of the interviewees said Garfield was the most authoritative actor in the working class's roles in getting a trade union card. <br /> <br /> In this regard, he was lucky because he landed with the Warner Bros. in Hollywood. Although he continued to get the manuscripts of gang roles in the tradition of that studio, Garfield was wonderful in these parts because of his background, because it came from the kind of life that Schmidt lived, except for the Jewish background of Garfield. <br /> <br /> In this regard, it was ideal to play the role of working class hero such as Shamid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. There are no major championships here, just a person who came back to Philadelphia, but he did something to do. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful part of Garfield. It is a film that should not be missed. I do not wonder despite everything that happened to the real SMMED.
