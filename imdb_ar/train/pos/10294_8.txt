Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston combine to present one of the most entertaining movies to date in the 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement in Carrie's past insane and forgotten roles in former comic characters. With a few curly comics to some extent, and with his own old self-sufficiency and difficulty, Curry carries the power of this film to the height of laughter and also some hideous dramatic moments. C's real acting abilities continue to appear in this film. This delightful summer entertainment hits most buttons, including dramatic elements along with the delicious moments that fit perfectly with this script. While still lacking a wonderful collection of comedy / drama, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great history film along with a powerful message, soft spiritual cynicism and parody that keeps its natural taste. Eight out of ten stars.
