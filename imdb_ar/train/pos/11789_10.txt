Hi, This little movie is especially interesting for an artist, filmmaker, music artist or visual artist, for: One can feel and study David's touch / style directly from a short piece of simplicity relatives. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing between clips, pans, and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even with a simple film, this creation has multiple layers. For example, there are some sounds that fly unmanned, while others (although hidden) appear in some points to support some of the shots. <br /> <br /> One can also see several types of pans: some climb up and down in a gentle retreat. There is a diagonal pan. Swings move forward and backward sometimes. <br /> <br /> Lightning and composition / disposal of objects in space, as usual and clear, is an act of a painter / artist. You can feel this even in this crazy room. This means: one can make a truly wonderful art by the simple art of putting the form / presentation and composing the scene. Then come the basic fonts for images: such as digonales, parallels, etc. Light decomposes colors, although there is not much search for textures as in large productions, it is also good. This is an artist drawing of some kind ... <br /> <br /> All of this is not calculated, but is done with the inner feeling and this feeling gives David a touch / feel, as with any real artist.
