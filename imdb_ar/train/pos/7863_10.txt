This film is eye catching for those who can only glamorous lifestyles of stars. It tells you how people who want to do good can not. In addition, the scene of the bomb explosion is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and study does not just happen !!! <br /> All actors played their role very well. <br /> <br /> Some scenes may be avoided to include teenagers. /> <br /> Not a movie that can be seen with the family. <br /> <br /> Casting is great !!!
