The only thing I've always liked in Robert Ludlow's thriller is that you think you know him, it's going in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this film that I suffer from neck pain. <br /> <br /> There's one thing I like about John Dole (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Do not Forget) which is that it can be based on a good story. In this case, write (with his brother Rick) a good story. <br /> <br /> Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and JT Walsh to the actors and you have a story that will keep you interested even if they're playing characters I've mastered. It seems that Dahl highlights the best of people and will keep you interested and guessing until the end.
