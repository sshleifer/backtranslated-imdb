Chase created a real phenomenon with the soprano. Irresistible performances, rock writing and some great music are what might be the best show ever. <br /> <br /> All actors are strong, but Falco and Gandolfini have earned every inch of these Emmy movies. Anyone who doubts this needs only a sample of a few episodes; especially from the first few chapters. James Gandolfini is quite violent and frightening, and you still find yourself loving him - fascinated by him. <br /> <br /> Many of the people I spoke to about The Sopranos (who have not seen them yet) will say, "I'm not a fan of movies / Mafia programs." whatever. Run - Do not Walk - Get It. These people usually love ER, but I bet they do not care much about hospitals ... it's not about the context.
