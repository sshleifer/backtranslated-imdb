Because Nabokov did not read, and did not know anything about chess, I could only show "The Luzhin Defense" as a movie. <br /> <br /> It works well as one of my favorite "sports romance" types. The live chess game comes as a more intense competition than the competition, for example, "Finding Bobby Fisher," to show how much hard mental work the game can play, which requires thinking, preparation, stamina and planning. I liked the special effects on the chessboard where it is expected to play alternative plays. <br /> <br /> Through the feminist director Maureen Goris (from "Antonia"), Emily Watson is gradually growing up with her big blue eyes through her transformational relationship with John Tortorro's mysterious, bold-minded chess genius. <br /> <br /> The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/27/2001)
