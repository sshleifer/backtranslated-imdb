There is much to be said about this film. It's not your nunsploitation model. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but this is almost incidental to the story. <br /> <br /> She was appointed in Italy in the fifteenth century, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians takes a good part of the film. It was interesting when everyone ran from the Muslim treasures to ask the superior mother, "Why are you afraid of Muslims; will not they do anything the Christians did to you?" Sure, there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a convent to challenge her father. In this process, she witnesses and is exposed to many things: the vaccination of a local woman's rape and rape by a new Duke and the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tertiary community and whipped herself when she ran with a Jew. The torture was especially outrageous as hot wax was poured on the nun, and her nipples were cut off. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia must continue to be in trouble and wonder about the male-dominated society. . She even asks Jesus, why the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are all men. <br /> <br /> In the end, she joins the Muslim leader as a lover and the monastery. Here you can see more meat than you can enjoy at one time. But the tragedy is to come. She managed a beautiful revenge on everyone, including the Duke and her father, but she found that the Muslim lover treated her perfectly. She's a woman and that's all. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the Holy Fathers did in this end, but before the torture of the saw or the lodges. For decades. <br /> <br /> Fans of exploitation will be unhappy with the treatments, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.
