Why is a good actress like Elizabeth Berkeley stars in this popular movie ??? !!! The cast represents some good performance (Elizabeth Berkeley as a Barbie girl, El Kates as a girl without a mother and Justin Whelen, a young man imitates by disturbing him forever), but the direction is very boring and the story is not very interesting and innovative. I can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Kurman (producer): Are you crazy ??? !!!
