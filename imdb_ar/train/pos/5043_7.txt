The debut is very promising for director Bill Paxton. Extremely dark film / really done, recommended by Stephen King. This is a powerful and well-designed horror story about a religious man, but he is unemployed in Thurman, Texas, spending a period of killing after getting orders from God to eliminate demons who are trying to control humanity. Two transitions of the plot and a strange ending makes for your money worth. Most of the acts of violence that you do not really see, but still sufficient to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> The director Paxton plays the twisted man known as "The Dead Hand of God." Matthew McConaughey is equally influential as the eldest son of a man with dementia and ends up passing this story to a FBI agent in Dallas (Powers Booth). Butte, as always, solid and flawless. White joints suspicious! Highly recommended.
