I am a Jehovah's Witness and I also work in a medical facility for acute care. Over the years, I have seen people die of hypersensitivity reactions to blood transfusions. They have attended several conferences on blood-borne pathogens, and have seen many patients develop serious pathogens from blood transfusions. I have also heard that many Jehovah's Witnesses have been told that they will die if they refuse blood. After 26 years in this field I have not actually seen it. The question arises, "Is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusion or is the community in big advantage of the battle on this issue? "Jehovah's Witnesses are an ethical issue. "Must refrain from blood" is not a vague statement. Thank you for this movie and allow comments on it.
