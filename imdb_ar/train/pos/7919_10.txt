No doubt the intended joke is quite decent, "Full Moon High" depicts teenager Tony Walker (1950 ADAM) accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Tony certainly bites and grows fur and fangs as the moon completes. One of the most interesting aspects of this film is that he can not get old as long as he has a vile curse, and that he must achieve his destiny - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the movie is just funny once it gets. Ed McMahon's personality is an overly right-wing Yahoo character (believed everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), the manager / manager Kenneth Mars is a tense dweeb, then there's more. One of the most influential members of the cast is Demond Wilson - better remembered as Lamont on "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But perhaps the funniest entertainment is the bosses change; then the gulf with Gerald Ford really summed him up! Anyway, it's a real treat. Since Alan Arkin, who plays as an adult psychiatrist, has just won the Oscar on Sunday evening and thanked his children, I wonder if he remembers participating in a tournament with two of them in this film or not (except Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role). very funny. Starring Elizabeth Hartman as well. <br /> <br /> Note: Larry Cohen is likely to be known for the deadly dust "It's alive."
