Lily Bowers works openly until her father dies. Then you go to New York to work in the office building. Here she notes that if she wants to go up, she has to give men what they want.

Other actors include George Brent (Kurtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Nad Stevens), Alphonse Etier (Adolf Craig), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Anne Carter) and Teresa Harris (Chico). Young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Junior. This film deals with a brave subject and does it well.
