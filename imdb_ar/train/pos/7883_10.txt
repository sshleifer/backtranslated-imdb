I saw this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! I mean there was nothing scary about this movie! It was funny all the lines said Freddy was hilarious! I think they did not make a new nightmare and just went to Freddy Vs. Jason. Although some parts were gross (such as head blowing). And any movie Elm Street from 1 to 5 sucked. This was the best besides the number 1. I would not recommend this movie if you want a good scare. But if you have nothing else to rent this will laugh a lot. I want to see the Texas sawdust massacre I think it would be scary. Freddie Dead Final Nightmare Grade:
