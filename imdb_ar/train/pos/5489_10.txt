Very good point there: "Only a few elite (upper classes) can access the Internet and be able to communicate on an English-only site like IMDb." Some may think that the Internet is not a fact but this view puts the media and democracy community at risk: Maybe you are right .. Even if there is an Internet cafe in Venezuela, most Chavez supporters will not even be able to rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Screw you a fascist upper class rich right-wing liberal intellectual capitalists .. maybe this is the first time you use the Internet;) ..
