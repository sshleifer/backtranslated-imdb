There were a lot of things that conflicted with this film for me before I watched it. <br /> <br /> First, I was a great high school model, in a class of Shakespeare I did not really like him, less half understood! Shakespeare will not be more than incomprehensible without putting all my focus in his almost encoded plays ... encoded in his language is very difficult to understand the language .... then I still will not get most of them. <br /> Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought that was a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you something. This film was very brilliant, very beautiful, and literally understood all languages. Now, the script has been followed on the message in this film, the same text that was not understood for me in the Shakespeare chapter. Here I open my mind and understand it. I was doubting myself while watching the movie almost! But lo and behold ... when they do, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is actually a master, who wrote wonderful stories. When I saw her on the big screen, especially in the high-budget animated picture style (with cinematography and beautiful photography), she acted amazingly by Branach and cast, somehow .... I understood what was going on. What was said. The language is wonderful and emotional. It allows for more raw feelings ... When words can not describe something, perhaps the words of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I still hold on to this day that North Star's fist is the greatest movie ever. No movie provides more entertainment. But for the film, which is close to getting rid of the grip of this position (which Hamlet did - he approached) it is really wonderful .... amazing. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing is that he made me appreciate Shakespeare. Wonderful. strong. Strong is the word. One of the rare truly powerful movies out there. <br /> <br /> This gets two hundred trillion stars of infinity stars. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all you need is your kids in a class from Shakespeare ... Forget it. You are wasting your time. You have to see the plays performed. Only then will justice be done to them.
