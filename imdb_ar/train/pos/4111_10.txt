I saw this film for the first time before adolescence, about the age when children begin to think through their identity. I was very impressed by the scene of the man and the children he was raising as a special scene. The older boy ridiculed that his mother was a prostitute and that none of his brothers had the same biological father (as Kurosawa illustrates by having children who do not resemble each other). The man still convinces the boy that he is his father with the only important definition. The man is known to be the father by all children, but he is one, who still prefers her brother. <br /> <br /> Each short article is also compelling to their stories and conclusions. > It's a wonderful movie, even if it was not the greatest Kurosawa film.
