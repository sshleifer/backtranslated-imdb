I originally recorded a pleasant show with a nice fat 8, but I struggled a little with her late and fine humor 7 is what has been settled. I will explain to you. <br /> <br /> You will either love Sarah's humor, or you will not. If you do not, I doubt that anyone can convince you. People know who you are and it's quite good, but you know it too. As we progressed, the first season gave us wonderful bits about Sarah, her friends and family, and her endeavors in life. In one memorable episode, she was "pulled" by Officer Jay, whom she met for the first time. - "Do you know why I stand here?" Ask. "Because you got all that high school?" She answers sarcastically. It seems to be a real question. - These are funny things in my book. Sara can come to you from strange angles. In another episode, her relationship with God was remarkably funny. God is being trivial and jealous and added to the wonderful humor. It's smart, it's a twisted view, but it will show us the truth in humor and laugh. <br /> <br /> Then, the second season came. Although we are still free of some new and creative comics, we seem to have slipped to a normal tube and fart jokes, simply. I get some good laughs here and there, but many of them look like stuffing while they and the writers are struggling to stir up some original stuff. Sophomoric and cumbersome are the feelings I have about the rings lately, but I was getting rid of the jewels I found (the tortoise) and waiting for her heart. You are a fan of the routine "Jesus is magic" I would like to think I understand what is capable of it. Let's go back to that.
