This pleasant and attractive sequel to the highly successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a follow-up by name only. The stories are spread in a self-contained sleep-fishing community of the Bigfoot, supposedly evil creature called Big Bay Tai, which lies deep in the non-expendable Buggy Creek marshes. Two brother brothers and their older and more rational sisters (a courageous performance by Dana Plato, the beautiful tail-end comedian, "Drela Plato") are engaged in treacherous adventures to see if the creature of the local legend may actually be a living being. The trio is desperately lost in a fierce storm and comes as a furry Sasquatch, looks like a bear, kind, but very cute and good to save children. <br /> <br /> Tom Tom Moore is a casual, non-frivolous story that goes slowly, brilliantly captures the details of the rural city with fine and attractive details, paints diverse country personalities with great warmth and passion, and happily develops feelings in an organic and non-coercive manner. Never turns into a sticky-sappy sticky. The magnificent Dawn Wells (Mary Ann in Gilligan Island) offers an appealing portrayal of a single working-class mother, while Jim Wilson and John Hovevos provide wonderfully impressive support as a pair of ol 'hayseed curmudgeonly. Robert Beethard presents the sunny cinema with the ability to put wood in all its luxurious, pure, pure and weak splendor, untouched by the splendor of civilization. Daryl Dick's combination brilliantly mixes the glazed beef chills and bluesy blue bananas with a delightful voice tone. In addition, this picture deserves a special tribute to the way it predicts inappropriately the advantage of the childhood of the Bigfoot nineteen years ago.
