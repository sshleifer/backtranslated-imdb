This film contains a wonderful message, influential actors, Elaine Burstein, Samantha Mathis, Judyell Fairland (she was four years old when she made this film). Ellen Burstein and Judith Fairland were nominated for Best Actress in a television drama at the upcoming Emmy Awards in New York. Peter Maasterson, director-director of the best television drama director of the Emmy Awards, was also nominated. April 1, 2001, Judel Verne "Won", Best Actress in TV Drama, at the Young Artist Awards, in Studio City, California. I can see why they have 3 nominations. Mermaid is a real story, during the lending period they have a real family on the set, something you do not see very much. You can find mermaid in all popular video stores. Do you watch it, you'll be glad I did.
