This is one of my favorite movies at all, period. I can not think of another film that combines so many nice film features like this one. All this flick: action, adventure, science fiction, good vs. bad, even some romantic (without even the innocent "peck" on the cheek between Paso and Chita). Perhaps best of all, you do not have to be in Mansa to "get it" and enjoy the movie as you do with some other Miyazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I watch the movies for a rest thought). It's just a fun movie that everyone will love, so buy it yourself. The only sour note is the American dubbing. I found the Vander-Geek just annoying. But we did not lose everything, the original Japanese version is on a two-disc set and it's shaking! Who cares if you can not understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at the second grade level, check the original Japanese registration with English translation. You will not regret.
