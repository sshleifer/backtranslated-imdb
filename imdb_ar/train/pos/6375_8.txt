Although I have great respect for animated Disney movies, they recently have not really been what I call "watch them". Atlantis looked interesting from the first poster and movie trailer, and fortunately lived up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is one of Disney's "mature" movies in the sense that he lacks songs (a very unusual feature for a Disney movie already) and focuses more on motion and discovery than any recent Disney show. The world of Atlantis, hidden under the earth's surface, is magnificent, is displayed in the form of abandoned caves with ruins, and slowly develops into actual ecosystems, which, although usually containing some harsh reminders, become more and more interesting until the tropical paradise itself is reached to her. The presentation of the scene and the simple style of Atlantis, without some of the joyful songs consumed, gave the Kingdom a more beautiful and curious look. The addition of Atlantean language, as well as attempts to link it to the legends of ancient civilizations in real life adds to this, and works fairly well. <br /> <br /> Also, except for some scenes that include Mole's practical jokes, there does not seem to be a lot of "childish" elements that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to reach Atlantis, and the constant discovery of Atlantis, where Milo from abroad learned all he needed to know about the place by helping the Atlantis discover parts of their own history they did not know about. Part of this involves the Atlantic "weapons", which are used at the height filled with excitement and which, because of the lack of a better word, is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Granted, not all of the story is complete in the sense of the word, the film does not show any amazing new visual effects created by the computer, but besides Toy Story movies, this is the most interesting Disney movies I have seen in years.
