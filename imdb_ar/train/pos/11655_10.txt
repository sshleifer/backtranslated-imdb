There are many topics that are avoided in the cinema, eating disorders are considered one of them. This movie appears as it is. Viewers do not enjoy it, but it is presented with a real reality that makes it more powerful. I only saw it once and it was a few years ago but I still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. It is a very powerful film and is a good support for anyone with an eating disorder to give him the willpower to stop. This is what films should be - should be there to help people and not to polish the wrong things.
