I have long wanted to see this film, being a fan of Peter Cushing and David MacAlum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this wonderful role. We thank Sky for the Turner Classic that aired the show last week. I can imagine that there are a lot of problems with children after the war, especially with what it was like throughout the 1950s. Some boys are a bit scared. I certainly do not want to meet them on a well lit street, far less than to be dark. There were some good ideas about the feelings of fires, or as they call it, firefly.
