The Man In The White Suit is often described as a comedy, more than a chuckle here and there. <br /> <br /> Sydney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who does not get the chances of booming his inventions on the world because no one pays him a notice, he is just a weird guy and a strange job for the place as he was. After deceiving his way to the Burnley textile factory, he used his lab to achieve his goal of inventing not only a fabric but also cleaning! He initially declared a genius, and those who initially ignored him suddenly wanted a large piece of it. But then, the heads of death in an industry foreshadow a blow to her head, and then the praise quickly turns into something more frightening. <br /> <Yes, the film is very funny, in fact some scenes very bad, but the sarcastic edge of the film is flying from the normal level for me. Contradictions about the advent of technology are a crucial issue here. Do we want inventions that save us wealth while closing industries? , You just have to see what happened to the coal industry in Britain to see what I'm about. The decade in which the film was produced is an important point to point out. The making of nuclear weapons has become more than mere rumor; science has advanced into frightening new dimensions. You see this movie and see the rapid transformation of the events of the main protagonist Stanley, from hero to enemy in one fell swoop, in pursuit of his own pursuit of mankind better! Black Suit. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I can not find anything wrong with this film. The scenario from Roger McDougall and John Dayton and director Alex Mackendrick can be filmed today and will not be misplaced by the sharpness and thought of the mind. The sound and setting are phenomenal, smooth, with color shift brilliantly by MacDrick. Some of the scenes are just fantastic, one especially on the hearty tendons and bring one to think of a particular scene in David Lynch's film "The Elephant Man" after about 29 years, and after this deflation of events the film is still able to take a hint because the genius Alec Guinness gets close The film to keep viewers thinking not only about the future of Stanley, but also for the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world. <br /> <br /> A timeless masterpiece, objectively and as a piece of art, 10/10.
