This film was excellent. I did not expect to live up to all the hype but she did. Like all Bourne movies, action is fast-paced, realistic and intense. If you like the other two films in the trilogy you will love this one as well. The film plot is clear and direct and there are no very unrealistic plot moves. Well, Julia Steeles, who appears in the Italian safe house, was a bit of an escape, especially after the excellence. But it makes sense that she is the only person in the movie "Teddyston" whom Bourne knows. He does not want him dead and the only person to lead him in the right direction. The work is driven by personalities and their reactions to what is happening everywhere around them. The thing I've always liked in Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick but when they match people who are just as good, the fights are a fight and cause a lot of damage. They do not treat the public at all like idiots. <br /> <br /> All actors were strong in their performance. I think Damon can play the role of Bourne in his sleep and receive excellent support from Joan Allen and he is re-playing in Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie as a trilogy. I do not miss Franca Bottente.
