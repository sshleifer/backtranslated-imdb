One of the most attractive elements of Gilliam is that well-prepared images, disturbing backgrounds and depressing characters are evidence of the originator's involvement. Instead of most movies (where the director is a pay-per-star or two-way outlet), you can feel Terry Gilliam's experience. "The 12 Monkeys" are proof of Gilliam's own vision and style, rather than producing anomalous films for her. "Monkeys 12" is a variation on similar themes from Gilliam's repertoire: repressive / recessive societies, the heroism of the protagonist, the frustration associated with infidelity, and the parallel worlds. In this film, Gilliam does a good job in blurring lines between the two worlds, using ambiguity to force the public to believe rather than to know. This tendency to neglect Gilliam to fill some of the gaps leads to criticism of the art connotations. The difference between Gilliam and the arts sites is that the Gilliam options have a clear purpose and each image has a meaning. Both shower appearances are almost identical to Cole's initially to make comparisons that make the audience unstable. His bald head is the sign of unification in the future world of disease, yet he makes him known in the world of 1996. The title itself is a sign of Gilliam's creation, because it requires the majority of the story to materialize to be fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's dedication to producing interesting creative films to see them so far also requires reflection and interpretation from the audience. The film has a tremendous value for re-viewing, as there are precise details and hints that can be missed at the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.
