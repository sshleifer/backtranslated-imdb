I liked this film to recognize the intelligence of the viewer, allowing the layers to peel the characters through their interactions with each other about the undeclared loss that affected each one of them. <br /> <br /> The cinema is beautiful, and it is an inspiring reflection to see someone who I think is a very talented new film director with maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that the others with the greatest experience have failed to accomplish. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who has the ability to focus on the goal and achieve it honestly. <br /> <br /> Glory to achieve this achievement.
