A wonderful Broadway movie. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games. Adelaide Loving Blonde (Vivienne Blaine) wants to marry him if he abandons the crap. He decides in a final match when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who is betting big, is in town. Betting on a sky that he could not carry Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go to Havana. This may sound like a strange plot summary, but the movie as well! <br /> <br /> This is a real mixed bag - there are some wonderful things here. The songs are all good and the dancing is incredible. The real display stopper is in the nonsense game in the end. Brando is also very good here - it may seem strange to think about singing and dancing but pulling it. I have to admit a huge big brando pulling some hard dance moves was so much fun! Also Sinatra is very good and Blaine is as wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend. The numbers of her song and dance are the most prominent features here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but she is stuck with a dirty colorless role and can not do much with her. The film is too long in 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons are really withdrawn and were supposed to be shortened. Most characters also speak very fine English - contractions are never used. You may be trying to be amusing out of the mouths of gangs, but I found it funny and kept getting out of the movie. <br /> <br /> We should enjoy the songs and dances, but the length does not get you after a while. Give it 7.
