I think this was a great movie. Touches all human fibers. Love in the film is very intense. I thought it was the best performance for Lowell so far. Great steering. I love editing. The music was fantastic. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie that everyone should go to. I hope people get something great out of this. Overall, the film is excellent. I think Hollywood should make more films in essence. Even motion movies can have a caring story. I love the fact that the will was so subtle in his representation. He had a goal and dedication that was rare to see. I would suggest watching this alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I found that the world stopped and that my only focus was on the film. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a wonderful feeling with all the chaos that is taking place in this world. With this generation, it was great to see something (someone) who cared more about others than himself.
