Pete that blood is dotted is the third in a series of seven anthrax anthrax selections. If the MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series, it will produce eight movies. Although this film is quite different from other films. <br /> <br /> I look at the selections of Amicus with wonderful memories as I loved them when I was a teenager. My feelings for them today are equally strong. <br /> <br /> I've spent many years trying to track this movie. The storytelling was so appealing that I went so far as to pay a large sum when I found a copy at the end. As wonderful as the movie, I was disappointed when I finally saw it. It was not quite as good as led to believe. Although it is better than its predecessors, it is not as good a place as its four successors as I will show. <br /> <br /> The story of the link sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious house. He begins his journey at the local police station where he learns the stories of former passengers. The story of the link later finds him visiting a real estate agent who sold the house. While this linkage story looks tempting on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest in any selection of Amicus. I could only feel that John Bennett is a copy of a poor man from Donald Blaiseans or Ian Hendry. It is much better to see one of the above-mentioned actors in his role. Maybe we had here - one a police inspector and the other a real estate agent. They've managed, I think, to make this weak element in the film much better. <br /> <br /> The film contains four stories, each focusing on a resident of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story is that Dinholm Elliott is the author of crime stories. He is absorbed in an exciting story about a stranger, so goes beyond drawing a scheme to help with his writings. Soon after, he began to see visions of his own creation. Some excellent directions for Peter Deauville, especially with the choice of camera angles, help to reduce the restricted text. Eliot's wonderful performance as a tortured writer also helps in raising the story. The story ends at the end of half a minute, but I was unable to help understand the text that was not allowed to rise to its potential. <br /> <br /> The second story sees Peter Cushing moving to a house. He is a lonely man who still yearns for a beautiful young woman who was once upset and maintained. Cushing's performance really brings this emotionally moving story. He was assisted by the director who chose to include the constant emphasis on Cushing's unit. This is taken further with the great hallucination scene that helps us see within Cushing's mind. In any case, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum quite like his daughter. It's normal to grow obsessed but this romantic story seems to be a worrisome development in the end. Joss Ackland plays the role of his opponent Kushing, but his great performance Peter Cushing dominates his performance. <br /> <br /> The third story is easily seen by Christopher Lee - my favorite horror actor all the time - moving home with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives one of his ideal cold ice shows here. He shows no love or attention to his daughter at all. He even brings in a nanny's school to teach her. The nanny, whose role is played by Neri Don Porter in her other brilliant performances, tries to discover the mistake. Without giving much, I can find that magic plays a role. Christopher Lee's presence is truly exciting in every scene he brings. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her very little performance as a young girl who easily became the most wonderful character in the entire film. The film is worth watching so as to see only one story. <br /> <br /> The final story is almost full of laughter, but it's certainly amusing and that's what matters. John Pertoy plays the role of a horror film actor who moves home. He is not very satisfied with the approach of his filmmakers, and sees everything as cheap and fake, especially fashion. So he decides to buy an original mantle for his last role in the vampires. Jeffrey Bildon has an excellent veil as a merchant selling Bertoy an old mantle. When Pertoy puts on the abaya, he starts developing the fangs and becomes essentially a vampire. Perdue's performance must be seen. It's really hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but her talent is lost in a role that should have been much larger. <br /> <br /> The link story ends with a loose connection to the final story. This is particularly convenient because the inspector was looking for Pertwee and decides to naturally visit the house. The rest will be able to exercise on your own. Despite the weak story of the link, they enjoy a decent ending if the end of the comic is somehow unintentionally. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the blame for the shortcomings of what should have been a really wonderful film does not lie with Peter Deauville, the director, who really does his best. I think the script was too restrictive and lacked the ambition to be found in the next four movies. <br /> <br /> In general, a house that explodes blood, although its imperfections is a must for fans of Amicus selections, lovers of other Amicus movies or horror filmmakers portmanteau. If my summary provides the film with enough appeal in your eyes, check it out. You will enjoy it!
