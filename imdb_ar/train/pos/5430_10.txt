Of all British imperial films such as Four Feathers and Charge of the Light Brigade, for example, this film is a tribute to the crop. It reflects a time when "the sun does not set the sun on the British Empire." throw it away. I will not go into this because many others have expressed the many reasons why this film is great. I visited the hills of Alabama and photographed the passage through which the British walked and still remains the same, and the time has not changed and crawled by men and saboteurs. Although I know that it is coming, the vision of a religion lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Religion! Religion! Religion! <br /> <br /> You are Lazarusian of the skin Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Although I have multiplied you and provoked your anger, <br /> <br /> Judd, who made you, <br /> <br /> A man better than me, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> At 54, I still feel foggy and eyes and anyone who says they do not do it is a liar. The set of emotions inside is a sign of a wonderful movie. Like the end of another wonderful film, from mice and men.
