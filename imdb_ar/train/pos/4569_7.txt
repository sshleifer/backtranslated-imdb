DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is doing a great job of playing Christie Brown, the artist who grew up with Cerebral Palsy but managed to have a productive life, successfully dealing with his disability and becoming a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is difficult to review - or even watch. Luckily, I had the advantage of commenting on capturing every spoken word which was impossible to see the movie in the theater. While I respect it as a brave act dealing with a difficult subject, I can not say that it is a kind of film I want to see more than once. <br /> <br /> However, my attention has been drawn through the storyteller, a framed frame-frame of the present, where Christie is honored for his achievements before we see the flashback of his youth and his struggle to connect with those around him, who came His definitely caring love. <br /> <br /> DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly wonderful because the troubled man who falls in love with the treatment specialist (FIONA SHAW), is very much afraid of his mother that when the love is not exchanged, his heart will be broken. There is a long and painful scene in a restaurant, where he admits his love to her before others, and goes into a rage after eating too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER is doing a great job with the mother, his father and a group of siblings struggling to keep a roof over their heads until Lewis's day begins to succeed. She completes the performance of Dai Lewis as the warm mother and takes part in many exciting moments. <br /> <br /> A rich and detailed story for a family that stays together in the most unusual circumstances with attention to the details of the period in each frame of the film. Fricker and Day-Lewis won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. Christine O'Conor as a boy and McAnally is the father who spends a lot of time in the local pub but loves the boy. <br /> <br /> Summary: Music by Elmer Bernstein is an additional factor. Good, but definitely not a movie for everyone.
