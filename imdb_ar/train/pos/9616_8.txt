Worth seeing twice because of the rapid causal transformations between several compelling stories, "Bug" appears as a perfectly satisfactory art that always plays an ever-growing love against countless examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> The characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), who cares most about the film - from cockroaches to airline passengers with partial responsibility for them; Oliver (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time preparing surreal meals but Delicious for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); Mitchell, a cable TV technician and boundless confidence in the fortune cookie letters: "You will meet the girl of your dreams." <br /> <br /> Against this optimism, there are strange forces of reality, all of which result from the actions of characters: parking tickets, drained drain in Chinese food / cake shop, disable TV, broken car park, End to holiday cancellation in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny: Oliver drowns in the performance of Chipendale, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative in an attempt to deal with an angry client, a bacterial mania (Brian Cox) who faces a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jimmy Kennedy) His girlfriend refused to have children by writing the riches of a hostile Chinese cookie: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the man who sleeps while running a rock hole machine because he spent the night looking for a lost girlfriend cat. <br /> <br /> A simple story with a public cabl The Darryl Theyse and a local teacher, The Boy in the Bubble, point to the main theme: Love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" enjoys the same level of "trains, planes and cars" but with a low budget and a fresher eye.
