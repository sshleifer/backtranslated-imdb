Richard Dix decided to retire, and Michael Dwan took his place as Ted Nichols, who met a young French girl named Alice Dobris Barclay (Lenore Obert). The couple met each other for only two days and decided to marry a judge (magistrate) who rained profusely when they were taken to the judge's house and discovered that he was not a house and would not return until the next day. When the couple is inside the house, you see some lift the hood and take part of the engine from the engine. Once you see this event, you realize that this couple is a big surprise and the story's creatures reveal a very mysterious event surrounding Alice Barclay, so poor Ted Nichols starts with a lot of trouble and without marriage. A good secret, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
