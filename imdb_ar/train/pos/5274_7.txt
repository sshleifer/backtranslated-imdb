Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I grew up, I watched this movie so many times that my father had to buy another version of VHS because the old version had faded. <br /> <br /> My family received a VHS version of this movie when we purchased a new VHS system. At first, my mother was not sure that the film was suitable for 10 years old, but since we just bought a new VHS, she let me watch it. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is the dream of all young boys? The film contains a wonderful atmosphere, large crowds of barbarians, beautiful naked women, bad monsters, and jokes that you will get only when you grow up. So, two days ago I introduced the video and watched the film again after a long time. At first, I felt bored, and then I started to think about how much I loved this movie when I was a kid and continued to watch. Yes, the experience was not as great as I remembered? The acting is very bad, the story is very bad, jokes are no longer funny, but the women are still beautiful. Yes, I grew up. Although the experience of the film has changed for me, I still think it is worth 7 stars. For the good old times you know ??
