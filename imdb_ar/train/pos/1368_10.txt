Okay. This has been my favorite since I was 14 years old. Granted, I do not watch it many times a year anymore, but ... this film is not for an older elephant and wants a deeper meaning or some wonderful messages. This movie is fun. It's very old, almost parked, but Parker Posey is so fantastic. If you want to be enchanted by the 1990's Tiffany's Breakfast, or I'm in the 90s, or like Parker, this movie suits you. Otherwise, do not bother.
