The first love is a very difficult subject to withdraw convincingly in cinema: the overall emotion involved generally ends with a pale tradition or, worse, a little silly. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz has managed to avoid all pitfalls and presents an exciting, exciting and utterly enjoyable love story about love, disaster, and potential salvation, while being tangibly exposed to some of the deeper issues of human existence. <br /> <br /> The main story is Matthew, 18, a solitary story, an introverted boy who meets Cedric, Brachid, more outgoing, but wild with his family. With summer temperatures rising, they fall in love, and when the holidays are over, they decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends with a disaster: Cedric betrays Matthew, who is trying to amazement to take his life. He is alive, and to return to his life again, back to the coastal city where they met for the first time, this time relax in the winter cold. <br /> <br /> If the story is told so it will have no effect at all: a large part of it implicitly, all this happens in a non sequential way. <br /> <br /> The complex narratives are necessary to get a deeper sense of emotions, through the use of counterpoint and time perspective. Fortunately, the three timelines used (Summer of Love, Psychiatric Hospital after Suicide and Winter Reconstruction) are color-coded: yolk and warm orange for the summer, an almost frightening blue color to see hospital scenes, warm brown and blues at the winter beach. <br /> <br /> Both actors have performed exceptionally well, although we are pleased to see Stephan Ridou (Cedric) used to his full potential (I am used to seeing him under - Elkaim (Mathieu) in Gael Morel's dramatic, To a certain extent, to be mentioned in particular: You can feel loneliness, then his almost stunning passion, and then his personality collapses behind the wall of the abyss.The beautifully designed gestures overlap much more than dialogue can. <br /> <br /> The subjects that have been touched Its almost classic in French cinema: the difficulty we face in understanding the reality of others feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the sand In an attempt to understand why Mathieu tried to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks CÃ©dric if he has ever been deceived by him ("No, well, yes?" Once, but it was not.) Cedric still loves Matthew? He brought him to the hospital while trying. Suicide (we have not seen any of them) and trying to continue to contact him again once he left ?? But he can not understand that he has lost it forever, because something that did not seem to him (meaningless) is everything to Matthew. <br /> <br /> While the film is darker than the unfortunate Pierre Et Gil label, this is not without hope: we have seen Cedric's slow and painful attempts to connect with life, first through a cat adopted, then by working in a local bar and finally Contact Pierre, who may be his next love. But here the story ends: Teenage passion, during the year, perhaps another beginning. So what was it? next to nothing? Certainly not when you live in it ??
