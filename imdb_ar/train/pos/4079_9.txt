I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on television in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I loved her perfectly and was sad when she later repeated her death. The story and the characters fascinated me, but more importantly, the music is beautiful and full of vitality. This was the original English dubbed version I saw - sometimes referred to as "Streamline Dub" (dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which unfortunately is unfortunately unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I felt the version was partially corrupted by Disney. The voice representation is fine but the dialogue does not have the same initial energy as the original "flow" or Japanese, and I think James van der Beck looks too old to play. They made some useless adjustments, such as changing the name of the main character from "Pazu" to "Patzu" and adding some dialogue. But the worst of all is that I felt they had destroyed many scenes with intrusive music - for example, the opening scene of the airboats was basically silent but was ruined by Disney's obsessed demand that there be music playing when nobody speaks, which I find disturbing in many From Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This movie still blows up the latest animated movies, and I can not recommend it enough. The plot is simple but captivating and the mela movie appears sadly absent from most modern homogeneous animations.
