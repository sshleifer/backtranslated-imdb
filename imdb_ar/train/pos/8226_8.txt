We are talking about a low-budget film, and there are some weaknesses (there are no spoilers: a sudden explosive expert and a senseless one of alcohol); but in general, the story keeps you interested, most characters are liked and there are some original positions. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that surprise you with some people who do not want you to believe them, then twist and move the plot ... I salute this movie. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try also to watch "Nueve Reinas" (Argentina).
