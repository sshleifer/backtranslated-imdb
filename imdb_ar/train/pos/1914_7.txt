Eight simple rules began as a very entertaining series. He loved John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessy and his relationship with his children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I've always preferred Kerry to Bridget, I've been Bridget before, Kerry is unique and I can communicate with her in several ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction her character went in a subsequent series. <br /> <br /> The early episodes were fun, and simple teen plots were good about disciplining Paul and Kate the kids, yet I think the show lost its luster when John Ritter died. The crew and staff were impressed with his desire to continue the series, but when he died I felt that the program had done. For me, the basic idea of ​​the show was based on the "Simple Eight Rules for the History of My Teenage Daughter" written by a real man with teenage girls and the significance and the viewing angle changed without Abby Hennessy. <br /> <br /> Bridgett seemed more upset, Rory stayed the same and Kate always gave her lessons in an atomic life that seemed to be more entertaining when it was up to Paul. I think Granddad is funny (especially when watching "Great Escape") but feels that C.J is not necessary for viewing. It's funny in parts but I felt that the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. For all that's new, it's not good just to lose excitement and does anyone else find it outrageous that Kate is working at school and CJ and Guldad are always there too? I always recommend this offer to friends because it was very strong at first and worth watching for Paul and Kiri, but later the average time was at best.
