Hamlet is by far my favorite in all the works of Shakespeare. Branaugh is the one heck of the actor. His portrayal of this was amazing. His soliloquies were breathtaking. It has always been rare for the film to keep my interest, but I have been involved in this particular piece. I recommend this to anyone who likes Shakespeare and those not much. This contains everything the modern world seeks in its films: murder, betrayal and deception. Not to hit the Mel Gibson version, but Branox touches the whole work. This leaves no stone inverted. When you finish the movie, you will feel as if you were reading the play yourself. Or how to say "two thumbs".
