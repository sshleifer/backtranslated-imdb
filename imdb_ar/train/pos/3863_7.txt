This interesting series involves real people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and presents a part of their real story with a serial character involved in that story. Matt Clarke, a railroad investigator, plays a role in tracking out those famous outlaws from the Old West in stories that at least partly rely on real accounts. In this sense, it is almost a series of selections, and as another person has pointed out, this strange structure offers some chronology of real events, but it is a fun series with a lot of action to satisfy the thirsty 1950's Western audience that still holds well after 55 years. Clark has cut a strong figure in his Western leanings while facing some of the worst bad guys in history. And his girlfriend Frankie was a great dish. If you're a Western fan, make sure you have a chance.
