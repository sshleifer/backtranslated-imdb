In 1967, I visited the sailboat Elsinore Harbor and flew a yellow glider from Pratt Reed. Back in Germany, the above-mentioned danger ran on television and the first part was about California's high-flying jetliners in the early 1950s. (The real life pilot was Bill Evans, and I do not know who played him in the series). It turns out that the glider in the film was the same (same N number) as the ones I had flown in Lake Elsinore. Since I saw this part, I was looking for it and I wonder if it is available somewhere. (Other segments of that danger were around Baker's tossing bench; a tool to find the victims of avalanche and so on.
