It is very easy to qualify this film: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This view was formulated for the following reasons: the performance of representatives, apparently citizens of that era, 1100 BC. They customize the characters perfectly. The second reason is that Homer's poetry in his poem is well given by production. Among other things, the novels made by the choir give a certain atmosphere that makes us a party to the artistic rendition. The third reason: the reconstruction of the decoration is very ideal, in the Mediterranean areas, where the work of the poem occurred. Most of all, emotion is on a date. I repeat my appreciation: "MASTERPIECE PURE".
