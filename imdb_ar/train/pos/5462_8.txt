First, if you plan on seeing this, be sure to see the UNCUT version (although it's very interesting to go back and watch the scenes that have been tampered with by censorship), that makes a big difference. This film revolves around a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who forced her father from the age of 14 to practice prostitution. When her father suddenly dies, she is able to go out into the world on her own. Having read about Nietzsche's philosophies of life, she uses her sex life to manipulate men to give her what she wants and leave them in ruins and desperate for her love. During the film it has become increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the public begins to wonder whether it has any sense of morality at all. In general, Baby Face is a very shocking film with sexually explicit scenes that most people do not expect to see in a black and white film. Although no sexual acts are clearly displayed on the screen, it is very clear what happens outside the camera. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this movie a lot and I think that most modern audiences will get some fun at least if it is, especially with the shocking value of movies. I thought while watching it that the speed seemed a bit slow in parts, but I think that in most movies the first time I see them. In fact, I think that almost all the films I have seen since the early 1930s have had some minor problems or parts that have not "flowed" correctly. Maybe this was just a filmmaking craft that was not yet perfect? It will take a few more years. Compare a film from 1939 and compare it to a movie from the early 1930s and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm very happy because I was able to watch the original section; it really makes a big difference. Also, any of John Wayne's fans will be surprised to see him in this film before being famous for an unusual role.
