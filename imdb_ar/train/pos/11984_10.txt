I have not seen a good show like Full House. Full House puts all the latest offers to shame, great time! Anyone who has never seen, and who does not see how it is possible, must see it. It's a great show for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will amaze you. It is true that some people feel that there are some "cunning" aspects of the series, but the positive aspects go beyond all the "cheesy" aspects. Full House ran the first episode on September 22, 1987, entitled "Our First Show" and directed the last episode on May 23, 1995, entitled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The exhibition plot is very reasonable. Danny Tanner (Bob Sage) loses his wife, Bam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his brother, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), the younger brother of Pam, and Danny brings his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Collier) to help raise his three daughters. The daughters of Danny DJ (Candice Cameron Burr), Stephanie (Judy Sweeten), Michel (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) were named. Joey and Jesse plan to move with Danny and his three daughters for just a few months to help. And ends up living with them for eight years; the number of years that the offer continued. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief description of some of the characters and actor / actress she played: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting for a great break. At Full House, John Stamos does a great job of portraying his character. I've looked and played music like Idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Sajit (Danny): Bob Saagt is also a wonderful actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunken driver. He has to raise three girls without having a girl's mother. Bob Saget does a great job of portraying a full-time parent who still has time to raise his three daughters. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): One word can describe Dave Coulier, funny. It is great. Joey's character play was perfect for him. He does a great job playing comedy back in anticipation of his big vacation. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bury (DJ): She's an enormous actress. She plays Big Sister, DJ and short for Donna Joe. She is one of the best actresses I've ever seen. Her ability to represent at Full House was very reasonable. <br /> <br /> Judy Sweeten (Stephanie): Two simple words can be described as Judy Sweetin, Incredibly Amazing! I wish I could say everything I would like to say about Judy, but I'll use up to 1000 words to it. She started her work at a children's show entitled "Mother's Goose Stories" and when she came to Full House, she blew up the public and creative opinion. Her stunning appearance and amazing acting ability helped make the show a success. According to Dave Collier, Judy was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where you would get a great break. Judy, who is five years old when the show premiered for the first time, can reach each line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young children can not do this. As you probably guess, Judy Sweeten (Stephanie) is my favorite character at Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Fantastic actress. Full House is where they started. They received Michelle's part because they were the only children who did not cry while they were in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> There are many members of the acting team to be identified. These are the original characters that have emerged since the show was first introduced in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is how Full House eventually became Michelle Show. I think she had to focus on her in the end. Especially when I think Judy and Candice were much better at acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things he can teach you is that everyone can live a wonderful life even if a tragedy occurs, such as losing a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all that being said, there are only a few things left to say. Full House will never die, and thank you, the Full House crew, for giving everyone an offer they can enjoy.
