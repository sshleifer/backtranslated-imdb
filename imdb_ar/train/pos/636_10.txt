Why are the previews so blah for a very cool movie! Everyone should know what this excellent film is. It's attractive and funny from a single moment, original, and good disposition. I hope the film works as a good press as it deserves! <br /> <br /> For anyone who likes The Bride Bride and Labyrinth and other funny and creative fantasy adventures, this is one of the great ones. Robert Denero Hesteri. Newcomer relative Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danis is wonderful as always. Michelle Viveur gives a great shine thanks to her recent return to the screen. There are also many wonderful moments of small characters ... even in facial expressions.
