Three teenage girls in a trilateral relationship incomplete. The base of the triangle is barely there. At the top there is Mary, the serious, short and meager squirrel with the face-like face of the Belmendo. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: colic, obese - dare to say fat - wanting to kiss her first with a boy but not fully ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her naivety, the boys do not seem to be interested or hurt. <br /> <br /> The other stop from the top is a beautiful blonde patch "fille fatale". They are deeply involved in synchronized swimming that leads to a competitive level. Mary saw her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Mary resorts to the life of the patch using the desire to become a synchronous swimmer. The patch has the reputation of being a whore, making any young man around her. Mary was not eliminated. Put pressure on reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half was prepared. We learn a lot of synchronized swimming when we get to know the three girls. In the end, the narrative is left in sync and is focused on the relations between the three parties. When unexpected things begin. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French films to cast nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. This is no exception. Here revolves around ceilings and death. Watch the movie to learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says that synchronized swimming is useful. This sport for women only is a metaphor for the girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface while working hard and competitive down. There are a number of scenes that raise this point: elegant movements and smiles for the audience, and the legs are rummaging underwater mercilessly. The title in French also suggests: "prieuve", or octopus, indicates that an individual has to reconcile several pressures simultaneously.
