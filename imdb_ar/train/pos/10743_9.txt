I have read most of the comments here. I have come to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that September 11 is a shocking date. There are a few who think the narration is weak and <br /> <br /> I agree that the narration is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers find each other after the disaster and hang the shelf around Tony. But I do not think narration is unnecessary. Like me a lot of theorists think that our lives are narrative. We live and make our autobiography. So if he tells us about our lives, it is always in the form of a novel. We do not summarize facts such as: birth, childhood, high school, etc. We are creating a story about our lives. <br /> <br /> Because we are familiar with stories, we want to put history in a story as well. Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand the things that happened in history when they are listed in the form of a story. This is the purpose of adding a story in a documentary film. The story is weak, so be it, but we understand what is going on. If I was there I would be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> The second point, making a wonderful film about it. True, it is time to come out with a big film about 9/11. However, there were few on the subject, but none of them liked this documentary. But what if there was a movie in about 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to earn a lot of money from the events of September 11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best way to learn history. How many films have we seen about World War II? If I have not seen these films, my opinion in World War I will be quite different. I remember seeing Schindler's list, and I cried for an hour during the class. Movies give you a good picture of things that have happened in history and although they are fictional, they contribute to the memory of disasters and losses. <br /> <br /> So my point: telling stories is not always bad, it makes us empathize with the story, and never forgets what happened.
