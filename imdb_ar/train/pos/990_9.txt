I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea exists to a large extent ... The federal government that arranges for a tracking device implanted in a small thief decode time to attract a hacker / computer hacker is more dangerous than hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man who "volunteered" to give him the device, is a very likable person, and it turns out he had a lot of fun in the head with him for a short time. In the end, Alvin proves that he is more than just a good humor but negative or one-dimensional when it appears that he is not easily manipulated. Definitely worth seeing.
