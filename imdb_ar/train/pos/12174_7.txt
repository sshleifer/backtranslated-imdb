I think the deal with this film is that it contains two minutes of really funny moments, it offers a very good section and many people came with expectations from the trailer, this time the movie does not upgrade to the trailer. It's a bit slow and it takes a little bit for such an exciting hypothesis, and I think I see comments that link people to a love / hate relationship with this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you look at this film for what it is and not what you could think of in the talent of the staff, I think it is still good. Julia Steeles is obviously the star, she is very angry and neglected, and she agrees with everybody's consensus, she is only glowing, and the whole audience loves me. The rest of the crew, of course, are my testosterone-filled colleagues, his elegant mother-in-law, his sister-in-law Jim, and his friend, who are all doing an excellent job of reconciling the stereotypes of conformity and boredom that make Stills stand out in the first place. <br /> <br /> Lee does not go up to his usual clothes, I do not think so, but you can see that it's hard for you to upgrade him. This may be one source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> Still the movie itself, despite the slowness and some jokes that do not appear as funny as the author intended, is very funny and I found somehow a clever film. Matching topics and "walking the safe way" seem to be cleverly aligned with several layers. For example, there was the whole idea of ​​how he imagined the scenarios, but he would never act on them until the last scene, or how he was listening to a radio show on the highway talking about how everyone agreed, or how everything clearly explained the figures Julia Stills said and echoed By those subjects one person is a safe choice and one is the risky option. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about the film is that it was a kind of comedic comedy where Jason Lee had to continue to walk in the film and through dumb luck (for example: a pharmacist turned into a good chef) and some Intelligence on his part often shuns him. <br /> <br /> Although it was not as funny as I expected and there was a little talent wasted, but overall it is still a good film.
