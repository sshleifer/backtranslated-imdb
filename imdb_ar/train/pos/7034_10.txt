When you add all aspects of the movie --- dancing, singing and acting --- the only person who stands out as the best actor in the team is Vanessa Williams ... Her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie her perfect role. I have never seen a person portraying Rose with such vitality! Vanessa's musical talent beautifully shows up with all her songs like Rose and her acting skills do not stop me from being stunned! Her dance is incredible, even if some people say that the choreography was bad - her dance skills have been shown better than ever! I would recommend this version in 63 just because I find that although Vanessa's long acting is wonderful - not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the actors are also very influential (except Chynna Philips ... what in hell were they thinking about when they cast it?) <br /> <br /> In general, I say this is a fantastic version and I recommend that everyone see this version!
