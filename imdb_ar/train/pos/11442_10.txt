<br /> <br /> So, not being a poet, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. The relentless Goldsworthy movement, which paints beauty in its own, attractive works. He saw his cat sticking to each other in a hanging net from a tree nearby for a few minutes while talking about his work, and then received the reward when the camera took the wide picture. Surprised by the ease with which he works, he then realized the futility of having a light breeze falling over the entire Internet. <br /> <br /> Goldsworthy's genius seems to know no boundaries because his inspiration is nature itself. In the fundamental change of nature, its work is complete, although completed in its field.
