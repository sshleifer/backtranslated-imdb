Perhaps World at War was the greatest documentary series of all time. Historical research is flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about World War II. An invaluable historical work involves interviews with some of the most important and brilliant personalities of the war. I recommend it as an educational experiment.
