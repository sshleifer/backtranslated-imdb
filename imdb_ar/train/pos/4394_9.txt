So, neighbor was killing neighbor. Reminds me of Iraq. While I was watching the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) Being dragged behind the horse, I realized that burning that piece of red, blue and blue did not bother me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Bill of Rights. I am a southerner, and I must have some historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watch the character of Toby McGuire learn to respect the dignity of the former slave, looking at the black fur and Germans (his ethnic background) betting in poker ..... was interesting. Many twists in this film. The wife, forced to marry, shows both lust and strong will, qualities we are not used to seeing in the "respectable South Victorian bells." <br /> <br /> The disgruntled Southern South has given me some ideas about why my cousin, the head of the Copeland band of horse horsemen in Mississippi, was suspended at the time. Gangs of displaced men roamed the countryside armed. I remind you of Iraq? How similar are we under the facade of religion and ethnic background? Why are southerners still fighting that civil war today? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can not use the same knowledge in our dealings with the country we just invaded and occupy, and ignite civil war everywhere. This is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, and it is unfortunate to sit on oil. The savage killers in Missouri, the Lawrence raid in Kansas, could be the insurgents we now fight without success. <br /> <br /> Among other anomalies the father is honored by the Yankees who move to Lawrence and set him up. "Even before the church was built, that's why they will win." Huh ????? I studied history in Birmingham, Al and taught us that the North was more industrialized and richer ..... That's why they won. Of course, they also had God beside them. As you can see here, when the freed man points out that he is trying to free his mother, he is sold in slavery in Texas. Oh my God, he gave us an awful old bondage. <br /> <br /> They are doing well, lots of blood and bullying while the warriors are riding happily in the battle (but they have not heard any cries of insurgents, so remember us in Alabama football). You also feel a real sense of the stupidity of the war, where cheating men and street vendors gather their troops in another raid. They have lost cause for their fight, as well as we. More reckless slaughter. <br /> <br /> You are also constantly on the lookout for the unborn children who return home from Iraq, where the jungle arm (ah, any signs) is closed first, his arm burned, trying to save her, then amputated, then dead. Much suffering for such a stupid issue. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Now I have to go back to the DVD and get production notes, one of my favorite parts of any film. I think this film is written by Gore Vidal, because the spoken language is the kind that you will associate with that era, if you know history. Dialogue is thought-provoking. Do your normal blood and courage war movie, by any means. You see the wounded but they are still in active duty, they are still fighting because they have nothing else to do. You see the South Raiders who live on the ground and steal indiscriminately. However, at first, I saw the battle stop, so women can be evacuated from danger. As I read the increasing number of women and children dying in Iraq, I think, "Where have we lost our sense of honor as a people?" I forgot the reason for my research about this film and bought it 20 years later, but some books hailed it somewhere. For good reason. Toby at his best, before Spideman. Buy a DVD or rent it. Tell me why others are praising this, not just liberals.
