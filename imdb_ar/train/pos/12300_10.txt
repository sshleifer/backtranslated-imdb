This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo plays Anna Christie again, but all the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were shot from back to back because Garbo had such a similarity in Germany. Garbo is supposed to prefer Anna Christie in this version of the English version. It's a good story and you should see it for Garbo fans.
