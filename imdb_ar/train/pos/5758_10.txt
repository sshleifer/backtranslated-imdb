This in my opinion is one of the best motion films of the 1970s. Not only is it a great game but it is also loaded with wild shootings and explosions that are still impressive today. The story revolves around a veterinarian in Vietnam (Chris Christoferson) being recruited by his brother (Jean-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Chris begins to take advantage of his office and becomes a bad criminals he has contracted to get rid of. It is wonderful to see Chris playing against writing. Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal both offer great support as ladies for both male stars. Jean Michael presents the character of the real movie star in this film. I do not think Vigilante Force works on the video but it sometimes appears on TV. It's a great flick for men who love movies.
