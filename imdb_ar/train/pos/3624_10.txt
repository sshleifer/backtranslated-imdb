The rookie kept me smiling from start to finish. Dennis Quidd played the role of perfection. The little boy playing his son was wonderful. He made this film a father to remember. Messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failure to chase is ok as long as you try. The excitement is clear. I think this film will be classic.
