I give ten out of ten films one of the best movies ever. The stunning image of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and all the crew, a stunning plot ... just look at yourself and take your courage to confess, touched your soul, is completely shattered, because it is strange, but there are all the answers that you were looking for. Best, Mr. Richie! Very good at all. Those who were looking for small statues and skirmishes were screaming disappointed. But there are so many shallow movies in Hollywood these days, you can not remember what it was the next day I saw it. On the contrary, the Revolver is unique, and it was hard to imagine that it was possible to portray this clear picture and genius about myself, for everyone who would be watching. Unmatched at all, stunning, dazzling ... One can get an insight into this, I have no doubt about it. In fact, no words can express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to film such a film after years of mysterious garbage in the Hollywood we were watching. Thank you with all my heart, it's simply the best.
