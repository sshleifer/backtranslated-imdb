I'm not a complement to John Cleese (although I thought "The Volta Towers were fantastic), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this sitting, neglected, on a shelf in the local Blockbuster, I decided to try it. A 50-minute entertainment of the experiences I've ever had, and writing is a typical "goon show." In fact, as an audio comic, this will not be misplaced in the "Firesign Theater" album, but the execution and timing were set in Bringing a "strange state" to a kind of jaw-line performance that could create fanatics of British comedy across the neighborhood . <br /> <br /> Britons have a gift to combine comics with a wide-angle, closely watched character and timing, and the creators are both well here, and it seems that the cinematography of Holmes "owes much to Inspector Clouseau "But he has a great talent in physical comedy to the extent that he carries more than his own personality, but the unexpected treatment of Arthur Loy, who plays Watson as a pleasant but inconceivable person with such timing Wonderful delivery, so that it becomes the best side in the film. I never heard of Louie before (his background seemed to be a musical theater and a musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance as much as I am concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people may not be able to take care of "a strange situation ...", especially if the British freak is not a "cup tea." But I am very happy that I saw this before it disappeared from view.
