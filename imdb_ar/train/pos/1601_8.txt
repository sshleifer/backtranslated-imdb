It is a very simple and very inactive film but very charming. There were moments when I could see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, but at other times I wondered why Glenn Claus did not win the Fatal Attraction award. In any case, he won the Oscar and Golden Globe, and BAFTA, Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low-paying job has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Camarre (Danny Ailu) to marry him. He promises that he will be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she needs to get as many members of his family as possible to attend the wedding. The only problem is that when they find Johnny's brother who has no hand, Rooney (Golden Globe candidate Nicholas Cage), they start to have a relationship, and there is love that moves to this moon scene (where the title comes from). He was also nominated for the Oscars for Vincent Gardinia to become Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, Paufta and Olympia Dukakis, the Golden Globe winner in the role of Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ended up without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronnie were happy together. He was nominated for Best Director for Norman Geoson (at night heat) and Best Film, and was nominated for the best-rated Baxtas Award for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Movie - Comedy / Music and best screenplay. The number was 96 in 100 years, 100 quotation ("Snap out of it!"), The number was 17 in 100 years, 100 of passion, the number was 41 in 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!
