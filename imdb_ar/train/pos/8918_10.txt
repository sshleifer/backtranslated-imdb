There is no hidden agenda. pure scifi. All the fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and I was very scared. I was a kid :) <br /> <br /> The original can be appreciated more compared to the new child I have seen and forgotten. The original, starring Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the best and only version anyone should see. <br /> <br /> The movie was produced dated, but the Forex used in making Blob stands up to the test of time. I was convinced that this thing was moving on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
