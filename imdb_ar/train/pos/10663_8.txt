Here's an excellent bill for Barbara Stanwyck on a single disc. The first film - and believe me less - is MGM in the film "Satisfy Lady" (1950) which was associated with Clark Jable. It's basically an astral car with Gable as usual dominating the film by being on screen. Here a muscular race driver gets some bad press from a Stanwyck female reporter and begins a gender battle. Of course after much ado they end up in each other's arms, and all this comes to an end and gratification. A little bit of fluff in motion but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - make it fun! <br /> <br /> But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature - a fantastic and completely unknown story called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, it is a wonderful little gem for a movie that never came from a single date! Here Stanwyck plays the role of Barry Sullivan's wife and mother with their little son Lee Ecker on vacation on an abandoned Mexican beach when a tragedy suddenly strikes. A dilapidated wooden platform collapses Sullivan's siege under a heavy platform and guess what? Yes, the tide comes. With no spirit in sight and unable to release it on its own, Stanwyk will go by car to get help. After driving a long distance, the only help she can get from convicting an unscrupulous evader (Ralph Maquier) - in return for helping him - wants more money or change her clothes ("I'll do anything to save my husband"). <br /> <br /> Meeker escapes with the picture! It turns in very impressive performance! Once you come to the movie you can not simply close your eyes! Actor in Burno's burning style It was not surprising that he did not accomplish much of his career in movies Although he made great performances as the doomed Cavalry Officer in the western film "Mann / Stewart" (1953) and as one of the French soldiers of the sacrifice In 1957, the only real claim to fame was the role of Mike Hummer in Mickey Spielan's "Deadly Kiss" in 1955. His performance in " Jeopardy "was a wonder for him but he had only a career in movies, he died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Because of this release," Jeopardy "can take its rightful place with pride as a classic, Tight and sexy thanks to the great performances, the narrow direction of John Sturgis, the huge monochromatic cinematography of Victor Milner and the aerial result by D Timothy is passing. However, add-ons are no longer significant except for a radio version of "Jeopardy" and clips for both movies. <br /> <br /> This disc is also part of the Barbara Stanwyck box celebrating its 100th anniversary. It is hard to believe that a lady is greater than 100 years old if she still exists! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - MGM Winner!
