Poor Basil Rathbone, an arrogant composer whose victim was killed. He has been falsified for some time, buying his words and music from various sources. The problem is that two sources (Bing Crosby music) and (lyrics of Mary Martin) come across and fall in love. Then they discover what they are doing. Complications ensue, but everything is corrected in the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing horribly. Mary had signed a contract with Paramount, and at the same time doubled as a regular member of Radio Kraft at Crosby Hall. For reasons I do not understand, the film audience did not take her to her, so she returned to Broadway and made a one-touch call from Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times played comedy does it very well. His ego is constantly reduced by Oscar Levant's companion and again I am amazed that they did not do more movies together. <br /> <br /> As with most Crosby's Paramount cars, there are no big production numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the melody of the title being an impromptu jam session at the pawn shop. Good work for everyone. <br /> <br /> An amazing original plot and wonderful entertainment.
