I had some reservations on this film, so I figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a contemporary film about Christmas. Due to our mid-wave heat in late June, we decided to give it a chance anyway, maybe we'll see some snow. <br /> <br /> It turned out that this movie was laughing one by one. Ben Affleck was trustworthy in his character, but the real star of this is James Gandovini. He gave his lines with real intelligence about him and made a wonderful "father". <br /> <br /> If you want to get a few enjoyable hours, you should check it out.
