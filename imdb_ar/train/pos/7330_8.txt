This film is based on the art of Frank Frazita, the legendary fantasy photographer. Some characters directly from his paintings (Death Agent is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation has managed to keep the original art feeling. Bakshi is known for his extensive use of a rotoscope (a live motion sequence tracking technique) and this film is no exception. However, since the theme of the film is quite realistic (all human characters), this works well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the scheme: because once we have a story with exciting characters and nice action sequences, the really hideous villain is a gorgeous babe. This film has a sense of the best comedies of Conan, and it is not surprising that Roy Thomas is the Marvel series writer of our favorite Cimmerian! This is a far cry from Conan's lively and lively Conan, not talking about every B movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
