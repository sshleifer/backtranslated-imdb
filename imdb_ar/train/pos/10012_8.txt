The night listener may not be one of William's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but completely different film. I can assure you that you have not seen this kind of movies before. Maybe some people will not like the slow speed of this film, but I think it's a wonderful addition to the film. She is certainly one of the best films released in 2006. Her performance is intriguing in a film with great content and a dramatic feel. This is not an American film. No film is predictable. You just feel that it's a movie that contains secrets and you find it hard to determine what the outcome is. This is not an excellent film that contains everything, but hell, it's a very good and innovative film.
