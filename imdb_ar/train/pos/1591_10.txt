My mother and I have become addicted to this show recently, laughing with our heels! I've only seen about 10 episodes and I'm disappointed because I did not notice this gay series before it was canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters already have fantastic characters (or not great, but they are still funny!). I tivo every episode of what I love about you. Amanda Pines and Jenny Garth, as well as all the actors, did not leave me bored during watching! There are some languages ​​that are not suitable for children and some sexual content, but with a directory of parents near you, you should not encounter too many problems. There is a kind of "friends" relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoyed it.
