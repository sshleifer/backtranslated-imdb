This is the best film I've seen in a long time. This is not the best film of its kind (filming the school). The way Ben Kucio (the director) decided to shoot him was fantastic. He filmed using teen actors who were still going to high school. He filmed in private actors' rooms and used the real actors as their parents in the film. The actors were also filmed using video cameras making them look like video diaries. It's almost a work of art (if that's a word for sure). There are a few turns, for example, when calling Cal brads (?) Land rover Range Rover (or vice versa, it's been a moment since I've seen it)
