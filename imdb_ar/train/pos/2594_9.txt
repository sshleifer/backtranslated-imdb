This film took Jerry Springer's approach to superhuman strength. "Wilder Napalm" is a kind of feature-based film that I love, and addresses the idea that a miracle in America is defined either by their talents or by attempts to conceal them. At the same time, the film indicates that every miracle is only human, and there is no reason to fear or worship more than any other human being. This was a wonderful, fun and humane comedy with that slight sarcastic edge.
