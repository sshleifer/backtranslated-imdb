First, this is an excellent series, although we have some sort of James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Royal Casino is being held in 2006, it is the first adventure of 007, and the second is 1962, while in Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judy Dench is referred to as the new male alternative "M", how could it have existed at first before becoming a double-zero bond, regardless of the fact that she was 14 years old? This is more or less a "lattice" license for excitement. We need to turn our heads aside a little if we want to enjoy. No, the new Star Trek does not contain any of the original electronics of the original series about half a century ago. In the 1960s, communication was imaginary. (Now we call it cell phones) and there were sliding cranes instead of buttons. OMG, do you think that 400 years from now, Rogen would have mastered Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, let us give producers time out. <br /> <br /> But to try to make things a bit consistent, let's just contemplate the creation of Cylons just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If this is the case, where did all the icons that inhabited the original land come from? We know that technology exists for automatic jumps through space. Well, what happened if one of the Cyclon ships that were at war with the Caprica fleet or there were sunspots or whatever, and one ship, loaded with human-looking Cylons, was not just jumping through space, but over time And return a thousand or ten thousand years with a ship paralyzed near Earth One. They colonized it and discovered that they could eventually regroup and destroy themselves, but not before they sent a fleet to find the legendary Caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, colonized it into human beings, which ultimately invented the Cylons. Time Paradox? Of course, of course. What came first, chicken or road? who cares? It's an amusing concern!
