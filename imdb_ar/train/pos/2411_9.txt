This film is one of the most successful attempts ever to find reasonable answers to some of the troubling questions that emerged in a recent scholarship concerning the accounts of the "Passion" (suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. Why did not Pilate succeed?) Why is not Pilate successful?) It is a film for a serious and thoughtful Christian: The lovers of "The Passion of Christ" will undoubtedly be disappointed by the lack of a gory scene And arc characterization. To me, I find the picture here - the willingness of ordinary people to sacrifice very gently the common ethic when their own interest is at stake - more realistic and not too worrying. (Indifferent look, "just doing my job" on the face of the man who leads the first nail in the wrist of Christ is chilling like any moment in the film.) The film does not claim "originality", but the settings and fashion always feel more "right" than many Of the efforts that have been highly acclaimed. It is a slow film, but if it accepts its own limits (it is, in the end, "death" - not life - "Christ"), it is ultimately a highly rewarding film.
