Frankly, this is the best realistic show anyone has ever reached. In order to make money, you have to be really smart. Not only do you have to be brave, athletic or funny, and so on. Not like some lame offers these days. And yet, they only have two seasons of it! Bull..that they need to re-offer this! <br /> <br /> However, they will have difficulty pulling Anderson Cooper out of CNN. It was wonderful. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was a great show. You never know who will be at. It was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself! I've had an offer you can play yourself if you want it! <br /> <br /> Bring the mole !!!! Bring the mole !!
