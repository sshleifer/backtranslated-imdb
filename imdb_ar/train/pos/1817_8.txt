All dogs go to heaven playing criminal criminal dogs. The movie is fun for children with a comic story, dark but satisfying and happy ending with lots of songs and dancing. Charlie has a pariah, a fellow criminal who kills dogs but is brought back from the dead. He meets a homeless girl who looks to him, and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute cartoon I like very much through my eyes as a child. I highly recommend this film to children. I'm not sure how adults interact with her. (I've tried watching it a few years ago on VHS, but these recordings do not last long, do they?)
