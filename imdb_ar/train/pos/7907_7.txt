I did not agree to a lesser extent with the rating given to this film, I think this is a sample of myopia over most of the spectators around the world. Really ... do you forget that cinema used to be a kind of art before some emperors tried to make it just an amusement? This movie is not entertaining, at least not the easy entertainment you get in movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It is elegant, it is different, it is shocking ... For this reason most of you hate it: because it does not try to please you. It's just a story, a very strange story I admit, but after all, it's a strange story. It's not a great story, not even a great film work, but I think it's worth just 7 stars for the author's and director's courage to film a story that is not made to please the public, selling billions of copies and making big studios richer. This film, to me, is a film similar to European art made in the United States, and everyone involved in making it deserves respect. Whether it be for courage, or to have a sense of unique humor.
