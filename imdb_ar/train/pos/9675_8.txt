Most people may say that if one spends a Saturday night watching a movie, you should really feel bored. In fact, I just came home from the TV and there was "Pauli". <br /> <br /> I missed the opening credits, so I did not know her name but I saw that she was carrying Chechens in her, so I thought of course that I had turned into "Born in East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to dismiss it as a kind of late night movies. <br /> <br /> It's good to say, it's better than that. As you know, if you have not already lost Paulie and try to return to his original owner. It seems like it took years to find it. What should be an advantage Pauli is actually dis-disefility in ways. People come across an educated parrot and all they see is a way to earn money or take advantage of themselves. <br /> <br /> While Chek Marin's character "earns" money from him, he does not care. The dance series with parrots is something children will find pleasant, and find them amusing. <br /> <br /> Paulie, the naive, quickly learns that humans are not all good people. In particular the owner of the animal research laboratory. The man lied to him saying he would help him find his owner as long as he helped with his animal-related research. Pauli is now stuck but decides to take advantage of the man in a presentation to others about Pauli's vocal ability. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paoli tells his story to the concierge of the facility that ends up releasing him, several other animals and finding the location of owner Pauli. It's an impressive reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, it was supposed to be assumed that there is no scene clipping wing. This part may bother young children. Otherwise, it's a great movie for older children and adults who are a child at heart. (End)
