In general, I'm not a fan of movies that stop moving, and at first RUKA did not draw my attention. However, knowing that this film was produced in the oppressive Czechoslovakia during the era of Soviet hegemony, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how devastating this innocent little-looking film was. This subtitle really made the film a starting point and gave it a real survival force as a work of art and a political statement. <br /> <br /> The sad little movie is made without any dialogue, but it is quite clear what is happening. A cute little wooden man makes a bowl of clay and spends a nice time when a moving hand suddenly appears and destroys the container - making it hand-sculpted instead. Well, the wooden man repeatedly tries to chase the hand and do something special. However, over time the hand becomes more insistent and man cages end up. In the end, the man died by hand and hand, in a sign of true hypocrisy, gives the man the funeral of the hero! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is a clear attempt by the courageous Jerry Trenka to criticize his autocratic government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs loved the film and gave it a critical compliment, the state (ie the hand) banned this small parable. Sadly, Ternaca did not live to see that his people were liberated after more than two decades during a "velvet revolution".
