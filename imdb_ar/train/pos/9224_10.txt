This film is visually stunning. Who cares if he can act or not? Each scene is a work of art written by John Derek and his family. Web sites, designs and fashion perfectly work to convey what is in a love story of beauty, youth and wealth. In some ways I would like to see this film as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment will not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as father, teacher, lover and picture of a man lost by man in a past era when men were men. Some of us find value in strength and direction wrapped in confidence that contributes to a sense of trust, containment and safety. Yes, men no longer like this! But, how many times do you find women making like Bo Derek.
