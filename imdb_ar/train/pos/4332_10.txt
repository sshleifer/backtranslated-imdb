Paul Reiser did a great job writing this film. Peter Falk gives his life performance. She deserves the Oscars. This was one of the most exciting and funny year films. Novelty Reiser is as wonderful as he was in the long TV comedy "Mad about You". Peter Falk did a brilliant job as his father, and the 78-year-old Peter made us laugh and cry at the same time. The support team was equal to the mission, especially the brilliant Elizabeth Perkins. It's a movie to watch for 2005. We bet that everyone of all ages and religions will love this movie and relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers, fathers and brothers like in the film. We all went through bad and bad times together, and wished the same things but different.
