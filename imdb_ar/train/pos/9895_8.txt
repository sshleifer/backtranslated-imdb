A handful of famous high school students play a harsh joke on Nardi Marty (a sympathetic performance with Simon Scudamore), making him grotesque. Five years later, the gang returned to the collapsed and deserted high school now reunited. Of course, Marty, angry and frenzied, wears a clown's costume to do the terrible retribution of his tormentors. The writers / directors Marc Ezra, Peter Letten, and George Doogal come out with all the lively clich√©s that make the 80's 80's body a lot of fun with cheese: fear of fake jumps, dazzling Steadican shots, a violent storm, madly rocky solid rock music, Female gratuitous, absolutely silly "What the hell?" The supernatural climax, f / x fussy makeup, and one of those beloved lame "was all just a terrible dream" is an unrivaled fake. In addition, the distinctive pieces of murder offer the hideous goods: Gory's most prominent features include an explosion of the man's stomach after he drinks the poisoned beer, the woman who takes a sour bath, the man being crushed under a huge tractor, and two people electrocuted while in the middle of emotional sex Wild. The thirty-year-old British siren Caroline Monroe is cumbersomely misleading the American teen in the first third of the flick. All the actors present strong performances, with the remarkable work of Carmine Iankoni as a clever leader from Skib Pollack, Billy Hartman as Frank Machu's smiling Frank, and Donna Jaeger as a stingy Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has an amusing veil as a Momo Monroe worker. The disturbing music of Harry Manfredini plays, rudely, the cues of his "Friday 13". The film features Alan Pudney's cinematic tricks. Good, fun garbage.
