This film is a very comfortable and enjoyable romantic comedy. Meg Ryan works very well as a sister of Albert Einstein, although she believes in her own skills. Tim Robbins works just as well as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes to her shop with her fianc√© after stuffing her car. I loved Walter Matau as one and Albert Einstein only. This film has a very comfortable feeling, while maintaining some kind of seriousness in it (if it is actually possible, it will happen here). <br /> <br /> I found this movie very amusing, especially the old scientists - I thought they were fab and hilarious! This film seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a comic sense, this is the right movie for you!
