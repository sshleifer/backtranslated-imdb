Brendan Fillon is the absolute best character in the soprano. Matt shot through the eye. This was the best well-planned scene ever in the soprano. Brendan Fillon is very good. Brendan Filone must chase Uncle Junior in his dreams so Uncle Junior can not take them anymore. Brendan Fillon is the best character. Brendan Fillon was killed in Episode 3, denial, anger, acceptance. But his legacy will live forever. Brendan Fillon is the best character on Soprano! Brendan Philoni is the best character ever. I recommend this show to anyone who loves the drama and wants to see good death scenes and output and great production, because it does not improve from this series. Brendan Fillon is the best.
