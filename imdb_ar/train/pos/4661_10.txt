I can only echo the praise on other reviews here. It is a delightful movie and has a good factor to achieve without crossing the line to emotional feeling. Natural sweet - no sugar added. <br /> <br /> There is a small point: it seems to me that the light objections raised about Osteinov's character, Pendleton, who is capable of going against regime security, ignore the fact that Pendleton is obviously a genius / savior in this kind of thing. Yes, the film was too illiterate on the computer, but he showed Pendleton "studying computers" in his apartment, and I think the inclusion was supposed to have been simply allowed to gather the entire subject, overnight. <br /> There were some strange moments when it appeared in some scenes that Janatpole was trying to test Pendleton's knowledge and calling for his deception. I'm not sure whether we should have believed that Pendleton was ignorant of his way out of these cases, or whether he was sufficiently familiar with passing the tests - was not quite clear. <br /> <br /> Definitely had to learn enough to set up fake accounts. Walsh and Ostinov were supposed to rely on their vague understanding of how computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they were getting, it was necessary to know their concept perfectly. They knew that there was something about the "actions" that were important; they thought that "smart light" could actually control security, rather than just referring to its state; they thought that the features of the user station would affect what could Done on the same central computer - despite things like graphics feature, I do not see it on its own. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as much as possible, and they did it well. Allow them a little bit of technical license, do not think their efforts have had any drawbacks worth noting. <br /> <br /> CD
