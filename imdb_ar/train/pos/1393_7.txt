"Shore Leave" is probably the most unusual part of the first season; some parts go on for a very long time while other parts are unambiguously cut, but no one can deny that they threw in everything except the typical kitchen sink to make this The episode is amusing. It seems that Kirk and his crew have found the perfect planet for the coastal holiday after leaving the long work round everyone in need of rest and relaxation and so on. It seems for all intents and purposes that the land is uninhabited, with landscapes and a perfect climate. The first indication that things may be a little skewed is when McCoy, who leads an advanced team, watches Alice (from Wonderland) after a large white rabbit wearing a jacket. Kirk is reflected and finds others reporting strange events and encounters. The only thing they shared was that every member of the crew was thinking about the person / place / thing they discovered before he was discovered. This does not sink immediately with Kirk or anyone else. Kirk met with Ruth, a wonderful old friend (of course) and a young boy from his academic days, Finnegan. Scene chase / fight with Finnegan continues long but at the same time, McCoy is run with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. Finally, an old man appears and explains what happened. The planet is a future "park" where visitors only have to imagine something to show. Nothing permanent; McCoy did not really die. Once that was clarified, Kirk decided to ask for the coastal leave for all after all. Although "it was a dream" it all ended, but "Shore Leave" stands as the first episode of Star Trek's first season.
