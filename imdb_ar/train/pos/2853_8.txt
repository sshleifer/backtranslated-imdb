I finally watched this movie tonight after renting it at Blockbuster (VHS). I must agree that I pray violently. Yes, the characters may not have been fully realized but they are not one of those films. Instead, we treat the manager's eye, his vision of what the story is about. This does not stop. To be honest, I did not want it. I think Sabu should have had an impact on managers of "Lock, Stock & Two Sm Drums of Smoking" and "Run, Lola, Run". But I completely liked how the three would see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them for a moment. I really need to see other director's works because this film really interested me. If you want insight, culture, induction and situation, go somewhere else. If you want to laugh, camera traffic and criminal laughter, see here.
