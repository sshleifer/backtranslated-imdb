This mysterious de Sica delivers cargo. "Farewell inherits the earth" is said. This tale of layers on the surface but in fact symbolic of all the homeless people who settled in Europe after the Great War. They are homeless but thrilled, in poor and selfish communities that they do not care about or recognize, settling for Italian carpet owners. De Sica chose to tell her that it was a fairy tale, the story of Cinderella. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I can not predict whether deus ex machina is the builder of the writer or Vittorio. Begins with words, "once ..." to illustrate the story of her story, because the story can be set anywhere, everywhere. The cartoons of the aristocratic paintings that are limited to greatness, and the alien nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to grant their wishes and end the right to exit the image of Spielberg, make this joy a joy for all. De Sica's most intuitive image is also one of the best image. With the abandonment of new realism, he has always demonstrated between this and the old good-old filmmaking industry, making a film that breaks the heart and fills it with the hope that one needs to keep leaving this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
