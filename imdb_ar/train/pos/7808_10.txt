This is a movie everyone should watch. Apart from raising very important points (while South Africa is still recovering, many countries are still in similar positions now), they are superbly directed while Denzel, in my view, is the best performer in his career so far. Klein also performs well, though it may not be as stunning as the performance of Washington. John Tho also played a good role as police chief. <br /> <br /> There are many areas where a movie about apartheid can fall, but all of these things have been avoided. It would be easy to simply portray white people as bad guys and black people as good people, but Attenborough did not. Sure, there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil, like the captain in the Soweto uprising, but to add additional dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the movie as it is, but I think it takes two and a half full hours to tell the whole story, because it really is incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the film is the funeral of Steve Pico. When the entire crowd begins to sing South African national anthem, it is likely to be the scene, if not the most exciting scene I have seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not already watched this movie: Review it. The offer may not be comfortable, but it is definitely worth it.
