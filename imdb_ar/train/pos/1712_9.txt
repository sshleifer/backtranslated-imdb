This movie was a disaster in Box Office, and the reason behind it is the innocence of the film, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of this story is very good, the director tried to do his best. Abhaye is excellent and impressive and lights up his role again, he has done his best in comedy or in the emotional scene. Suha looks pretty in the film. The rest star was simply thrown okay. The music and all the songs are good, Himeesh is impressive as a singer here. Do not miss this movie, it's a wonderful film and a good feeling for us. Abhai's best work so far. I will give 9/10 to Ahasta Ahasta.
