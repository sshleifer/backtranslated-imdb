I really enjoyed watching this movie! At first, when you see your poster, I thought it was just an easy romantic comedy ... but it's simply more than this! I personally think this idea (I'm sure it was a good part of the viewers before watching the movie directly) is another important part of the great concept of this film itself (or even its marketing strategy)! What I mean is: these days we are slaves to pictures! To impressions! I went to the cinema to watch this film which has the wrong impression, wrong expectations, and in the end I felt superficial! For example, the near-term sequence in which Sydney buys the plane ticket to return to New York comes to mind as he is asked to "give his signature", which means signing the ticket. He thinks he just got on TV thanks to the scandal in the awards and now Type of celebrity. I think this is just the climax of the main subject around which the films revolve. "Even the saints were people at first," says Sophie once. In the film. The saints of the moment are the stars. We attribute them to the perfect "halo", eternal happiness, but actually much less than that. Even the saints of any religion are perfect images and models of how to behave and how to live your life. So they were not real ... They became "real" after their death and we looked at them. This is the problem: we need our saints! We need our stars! We strive for them as if it was not for them. TV and all other media are a way to create and capture our efforts. We need standards for measuring ourselves. This is how we came to the cinema to see this film in the first place: to see if we can determine the scale, or whether the standard is small for us. This time it was bigger than we expected.
