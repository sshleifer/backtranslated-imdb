I never saw it on TV, but I hired it through Netflix once I found it. I had great expectations and was not disappointed. It's funny, excellent animation. This level of quality I was expecting was only from feature films, so I was surprised by some bad comments on it. Maybe DVD version has improved animation? One bonus for the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the beta. I am an adult and I really appreciate it for adults. Not only children who love cute animated characters. It's not anywhere near "evil" as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents do not want to see their young children. I am very disappointed that it has been canceled. I hope they produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
