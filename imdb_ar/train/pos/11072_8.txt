Everything is very simple. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with the masters of deception and chess. They sympathize with his history of loss and failure, and the misery he lives in because he believes in mastering small tricks and controlling the rules of little crooks. They decided to give Jake absolute freedom: from his deeper fears, which he thinks himself. Therefore, they took him on a journey where all fear, all pride, all hope - was born again as the true master of his will. <br /> <br /> It's an intelligent movie about the journey of lighting, about gambling and endless games that we do with and within ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
