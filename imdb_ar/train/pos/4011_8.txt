After SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the airwaves on Saturday morning in the fall of 1986, I stopped largely from watching the cartoons on Saturday morning at that stage, as these were the only ones who kept us tuned. She looked very promising to me, "retired" and began to sleep on Saturday morning. I did not return to Saturday morning television except in 1988 for one year only to display only one animation. <br /> <br /> Superman's new animation was something I did not miss. I was 17 years old and high school at the time, but what about it! I love this show. From what I can remember, this series was a gift to the masses that I suppose are celebrating the 50th birthday of Superman that very year. He has a distinctive music and music style that reminds you of John Williams's film Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman. I honestly felt that the cartoon style of Robbie Spears was reminiscent of the superpower team: the Galactic Guardians series of Hannah Barbera a few years ago. Unfortunately, Danny Dark did not return to Superman's role, but I felt that Bo Weaver did a very impressive job because the voice of Superman and Clark Kent were as confusing as Chris Reeve's. After hearing him as Red Richards / Mr. Fantastic Four In the Fantastic 90's, I can still see this version of Superman in my mind. Jenny Maxwin is the role of Louis Lane. Haha! What a rhyme. She was the voice director for Hannah Barbera and Robbie Spears and I think she took it upon herself to do Louis. SuperFriends' memories remained in this series when it came to sound. Jamie Olsen is Mark Taylor, who was previously on a strong storm. Perry White is only former television writer Batman Stanley Raleigh Ross, who was in SuperFriends Gorilla Grode and ProNiac's Super Powers program. And Lix Luthor, the brilliant billionaire businessman now astounding is nothing but the eloquent alum in the voice of SuperFriends, Michael Bell, whom I know best from Zan and Rider as well as many other characters in many other serials. <br /> <br /> I felt that the series was a combination of Superman and post-crisis crisis John Byrne re envision for Superman, with Lex Luthor as the billionaire, Jonathan and Martha Kent alive to see Clark as Superman. Bruce Tim series and Lewis and Clark also do this. Unfortunately, we have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. Unlike Luthor, we just saw Prankster and saw General Zod. I particularly enjoyed this episode with Wonder Man, which was expressed by BJ Ward, which she played in the Great Powers team as well. <br /> <br /> The episodes were broken and I also enjoyed Clark's growing stories and development from childhood to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to Metropolis in the short, small family album Superman. <br /> <br /> The only things I did not like. It lasted only one season. After the Wonder Woman guest site, I was hoping Batman would get the voice of Adam West (I'm still thinking about the great power team's I think). As I hoped so because in the Prankster episode, the Metropolis baseball team was urging Gotham Goliath. <br /> <br /> Each Super Hero has a very rare caricature. For SpiderMan, I feel like it's a 1981 single series that aired at the same time as Amazing Friends. For The Incredible Hulk, it's a 1982 sketch. For Fantastic Four, it's the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. For Batman, it's New Batman 1977's filmmaking adventures with BatMite. But for Superman, the rarest series is the series. <br /> <br /> Superman books and documentaries are not covered or remembered. This is another string WB should consider when releasing a DVD. All in all, this 1988 version of Superman is fine .... Super !!
