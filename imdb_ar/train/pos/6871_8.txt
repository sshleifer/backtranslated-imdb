We showed this film at the local film association, and the audience was spending their time in film. It is a taste, wonderful and very funny in a kind of sixties. Drawing a kraft kitchen recipe makes them laugh like crazy. The rest is a mixed bag, but the highs certainly beat the lowest levels. By the way, whatever happened to Ken Shapiro?
