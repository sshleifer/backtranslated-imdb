This was given 10 out of 10 points. I love it so much. I was a child in the eighties of the last century and became totally in heavy metal for many years. These are the reasons I like this film so much. It is wonderful to see these posters in the bedroom of this boy (Judas Brest, Lisie Borden, Rivin, the twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (reveal the bad guys by the thriller, the rise of the mutants by the master of shock metals Impaler and Killing is practical By Megadeth). Also the soundtrack of FASTWAY is absolutely incredible and fits very well with the plot. If you are in the metal, the TRICK or TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for seconds, watch it because the soundtrack and story will bring you back to the glory of the eighties. You will not be the same person yet.
