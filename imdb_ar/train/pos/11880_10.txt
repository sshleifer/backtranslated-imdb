"Scarface" has a master cult relay so far, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> They have also been widely criticized for being too vulgar, redundant, too many, all swollen! These are the people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the artistic front, (cinema, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is the way behind "Godfather". <br /> <br /> But it is also true that Scarface and some other bands have lacked films, are roughness, the raw rough approach of the bands. The Latin gangs in this film seem more threatening and real than any of the Italian or Irish bands polished from other classics such as "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas." This is one of the key win points in Scarface, and I firmly believe that this fact has been written off as "bankrupt" by most critics! I've seen the original version of Scarface 1932, and I have to say that these two films are very different from each other, and they should be seen as different rather than praise the origin of the new version! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was criticized for being too loud and loud in this film. But what about thinking that this is exactly the way filmmakers wanted to be the character of Tony Montana! It is this angry young man who makes hasty decisions and gives fits of temper every minute! Michael Corleone is not quiet here. It's Tony Montana, an eccentric and uneducated person who does not think much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> There is definitely a 1980's for this film. Sound is all 80s! I like some songs, including "Theme Gina and Elvira", "Push it to the limit", and a useful title tracking tool. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful sequences that are memorable, including the famous saw scene, Rebenga hit, the first encounter with Sosa and Tony to visit his mother. <br /> <br /> About the shows: The brilliant Al Pacino is an angry Cuban refugee. He said he enjoyed playing Tony Montana more than ever throughout his career. It really looks like it completely enjoys all the sights! One wonders how Scarface will be without Pacino. I could not imagine anyone else filming Tony Montana, and in all likelihood, the film would not be effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines as Tony Manny's friend lights up. <br /> <br /> Robert Logia is wonderful as the leader of Chromatic Lopez. As well as q. Murray Ibrahim (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there are some sweets in the form of Elvira by Michelle Pfeiffer. Looks beautiful and adequate in its role. <br /> <br /> The director moves slightly through a certain part of her climax. Without revealing anything, I would just say that this is the only small part that suffers due to poor handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and entertaining bands movies ever released. Enjoy them for what they are: an initial depiction of drug lords and gangs!
