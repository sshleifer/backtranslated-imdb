I just finished showing the first disc in a set of 4 CDs (26 episodes) created in collaboration with the University of California Film and Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from the first episode), the picture quality is very good. The DVD box on the title page is displayed here on the IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is just as enchanting as I first saw him (he was 5 years old at the time) and Wally Cox is really endearing in this role. If you're in the mood for a quiet comedy that sneaks in, instead of hitting you on the head, you'll have the opportunity to experience all the wonderful characters you may remember from your childhood. Although some of the gags are a little wet, but most of them are innovative and well executed ... even those vulgar are fun. This is one television series that goes back to the memories of my early childhood.
