Best animated film ever. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with very puzzling effects, but the branches of the human mind, spirit and philosophy. The story shows a family of cats, where the younger sister dies in the death of her older sister and saves her body, but when she wakes up she leaves without spirit. Therefore, the two brotherly cats embark on a journey to find it. This journey has been linked to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I see it, I discover more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not on the physiological side of it, you still like it. Fantastic animation, creative scenes will make you attached to the screen. For example, the ocean freezes in time, God eats a soup from the ground, a strange and slightly small novel about Hansel and Gretel. In conclusion, Cat Soup is an absolute solution for anyone. <br /> <br /> PS - Not for children, including unjustified violence.
