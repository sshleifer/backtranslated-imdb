I really liked this movie! Although it was not like any of the books, it is still similar to the classic Nancy Drew. I've been watching a lot of ads for this film and since I was really in Nancy Drew's books I had really great expectations for this film and have certainly achieved these expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly how their image of reading books. I'm really happy because I saw this movie. All actors and actresses behaved as if they were acting as in a series of books. Since I saw this movie, I wanted to read every book Nancy Drew wrote there. All actors and actresses have already arrived to their characters and certainly appeared when this film was broadcast on the big screen. Certainly all actors and actresses were already in positions where the characters were, and I certainly give this film 10 out of 10.
