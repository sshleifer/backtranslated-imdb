Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British TV show ever, and the performances, directing, casting, suspense, drama ..... are all wonderful about it. <br /> <br /> Although the show fell a little later in its final season, this well-finished film snapped the strings and woven a great story for both show and beginner fans. I can not recommend this movie any more, look for it and see it. But I recommend watching the series first, as the first and second seasons are better than this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Clear (10/10)
