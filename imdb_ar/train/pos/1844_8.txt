I was not sure if this would just be another show of exotic night soap operas that seemed to flutter at peak times, but, as it turned out, this was a very good show (not due to much to talented acting). Four friends from different backgrounds meet and share the weekly events of their emotional lives. The one-hour program follows each of them individually through tasks that are usually tight to find love and do so without being boring or trivial. "Trudy" by Sharon Small is a housewife (allegedly widows after 9/11), who preaches a bit and is upset with her friends (who tend to be more relaxed and more creative in their endeavors). It is wonderful to see a small return on TV, so it was fascinating in the Secrets of Inspector Lynley. The chick can work. Orla Brady (Siopphan, a lawyer) may be the most affected but still very sympathetic to women, struggling with her gentle husband Harry Harry (Jaffry, formerly a Spooks) in his desire to have a child with her Consider their needs. The last two members of the team are Jess Fowara (Chili Conne), the event planner, a wild boy sleeping with anyone and everyone, sex not specific, and Katie (Sarah Parish) a sad doctor dealing with a patient and his son sent her career and loved the life that comes out of Scope of control. However, I am hooked now and I hope that the BBC will continue to publish this series because it is good, it's different and has a great team.
