If you've just seen the pilot of this show for 10 years. I was hooked immediately in this wonderful new world. The subsequent episodes did not meet the full promise, but I will keep watching and I hope the situation improves. Incredible production values ​​and first class representation. I do not mind that it does not seem to be fully compatible with BSG because I am very intrigued by the hypothesis and let's face it, two different programs. I am thrilled that both Esai Morales and one of my lovers, Eric Stoltz, have come back to my life (if only weekly) because I missed them. This offer requires little thought from his audience and this is always good. You must put your head around certain aspects of the show; things are not always as they look, and certainly there are shades of gray, literally and figuratively, in the lines of the plot and characters, and of course in different virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey looks to be an enjoyable trip.
