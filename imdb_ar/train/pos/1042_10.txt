An American woman, her husband and her European children return to her mother's home in the film "Watch on the Rhine", a 1943 film based on Lilian Hillman and Paul Lucas (I think he repeats his role here), House of Davis, Lucille Watson, George Collores and Geraldine Fitzgerald And Donald Woods. Kurt Mueller (anti-fascist) Kurtzer, a clandestine worker, has been injured several times, and the Nazis want him, and he needs a long vacation at his rich wife's home. But he discovers that there is really no escape because one of the homeowners (Coulouris) doubts his real identity and is more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> Many wonderful performances in this film are largely written to present the viewpoint of liberal Lilian Hellman. Was certainly a powerful propaganda tool at the time of its publication, where the evils of war and what happens to people in other countries reach safe American homes. The big controversy in the film today is that Paul Lucas won an Oscar for Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart had a great presence on the screen and a great Rick, but Lucas was tolerant of Kurt. The monologue that he has about the need to kill is a severe pain, just to mention one scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what one thinks of as Bette Davis, she performs brilliantly here the sincere and loving wife of Kurt, Sarah. The locomotives represent her in the heart, and love scenes between Kurt and Sarah are beautiful and wonderful. <br /> <br /> In the last half hour of the film, I honestly cried my emotions. Lillian Hillman is not a cup of tea for everyone, but unlike the Little Foxes, some really sympathetic and wonderful characters have written and a wonderful story given by Wariner Brothers to the values ​​of casting and production. Highly recommended.
