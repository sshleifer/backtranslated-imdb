This Jackie Chan flick is above average, due to the exquisite finale and humor, but others that it is nothing special. All characters are wonderful, and the movie is fun, plus Jackie Chan is amazing in this! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had wonderful chemistry together, both very funny! , I thought that the main opponent seemed already threatened! , But the dubbing was simply awful! Personal evolution is above average for this kind of thing !, The main battle is simply fantastic! , In addition to some of the pitfalls that Jackie takes in this tough game! There is a lot of silly humor and really intimate in this matter, but it was a conscientious, hilarious result !, plus all the characters are very loved. It's pretty nice but very good overall, and although it does not have the amount of fighting you expect from a Jackie Chan click, it's enough to keep you watching, plus one of my favorite moments in this movie when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai -Man Chan (Tiger) playing with a gun and going off! This Jackie Chan flick is above average, given the wonderful end and brilliant humor, but this is not something wonderful, but it is still worth watching! The direction is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here by working the solid camera and great angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part. Very good acting! Jackie Chan was amazing as always, and amazing here, he is very lovable, hilarious, as was the case with some crazy stunts, he had a wonderful chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked this ass, and played this wonderful personality full of vitality, he was amazing ! , I wish if they stopped dubbing! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, as he is a very good military artist. The rest of the cast do OK I think. Overall worth watching! *** of 5
