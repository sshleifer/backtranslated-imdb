I watched this movie for the first time in about ten years and I thought it was very funny already. It was not as bad as some critics did. The fact that it was written by John Hughes is usually reliable showing that you can at least expect some funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is very good and that Hughes also saw lightning speed). <br /> <br /> The movie has a very cool look with all the basic colors - red and yellow. Etc - making it look completely unique. Cast is also very good. The luxurious Bunny Packard and the Devil's Delores Salk are a prominent place. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly a little dated but I personally prefer it to all the other "Lampoon" series.
