I am a big fan of the Dukes Hazard TV show. I really enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed it a lot more than I enjoyed with other summer films. <br /> <br /> It's funny that people who oppose this film hear excuses like "lame conspiracy" and "it's more disturbing than the show." Does anyone remember the horror of humor in the experimental episode? Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke probably has half the children in the orphanage. The only reason to clean it is to change it to the time limit. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot goes. The Dukes plot was perfect. In fact, as a new image, it is likely to remain more authentic than any TV program that has been migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not exactly like the small screen versions, they do a great job and work well together. I was not too keen on Burt Bose Hogg though. I would like to get a little more inefficient than Sheriff Rusko. In Rusco's little film ... Scary. <br /> <br /> Who did not have a smile on their faces because General Lee was racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard? <br /> <br /> Allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for past nostalgia, chasing bikinis and chasing cars, you will not be sorry. It's just a great stupid movie!
