I watched this movie when I was almost a child, and of course, I was touched by the story of the Fox family. Hokkaido's wonderful scenery, excellent storytelling and last but not least wonderful soundtrack, provide a rare intimate with the fans. I'm still looking for a copy of the wonderful soundtrack. For German viewers, it may be useful to know that DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to. I clicked on both (DEFA and BR) but I continue to show only the first one.
