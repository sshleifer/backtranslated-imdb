It was my favorite film as a kid and I have been in production several times, so it will always be my favorite music and I doubt that anyone can reintroduce Oliver Twist's story on screen, any better than this movie did. <br /> <br /> My favorite "villains" all the time must be Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. Not only was he intimidated by my life when I saw him at the age of 6 years, but now as a woman I can more sympathize with Nancy's character, the bar / maid who helps Oliver get the life he deserves. <br /> <br /> Jack Wilde, as a skilled dodger, was wonderful, and I do not think anyone can outperform him at any time, such as the Jeep Street picker, and the best friend of Vaughan. The music is fantastic, especially the figures of Wagon, and I am very grateful that they did not give Bill Six a musical number, and it was not useful to have a sinister character with him. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did an excellent job of finishing Nancy's adhesive, keeping her a G-class movie by hiding the beating, but giving enough to show Bill's violence towards her. <br /> <br /> This film is both enchanting and attractive as a musical instrument, as well as a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life.
