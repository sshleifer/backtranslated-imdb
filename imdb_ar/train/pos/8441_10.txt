For anyone who loves the series, this movie will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you wanting more. I loved the way in which each character (the detective) appeared. The least with the end of the fourth is because they leave the reason for another film. My guess is Bayless of course. Such a serial was a series of scenes placed very well. This is a series I wish I lived on. Thanks to the cast for some wonderful TV.
