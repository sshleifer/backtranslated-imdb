Walking through the weekly Sci Fi section of the local Video Rentals store, I was losing hope of finding any good movies I had not seen yet. The hire of Siver was like a punt on a very lame horse. My son is confused by current science fiction "B" so much that he has not bothered to see him yet. <br /> <br /> Please note that I have not seen anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. Must be very calm or missed. <br /> <br /> Well, this was a really pleasant surprise! This is also no B movie. It is not a "big group" of the epic group and does not try to be - a quieter movie to be seen several times until the plot is fully over. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerful when they are used - my only complaint is super helo, which is obviously a CGI, but they get it right when they appear in second place. Something else is better. However, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything away from the plot. The ground structure on the side of the Russian doll is very similar to the basic instinct (although there is very different content). <br /> <br /> I will only say that Jeremy Northam's choice of leadership was a major blow. The actor was born in Cambridge England, and his tone for this film strikes the ear as a kind of harsh New England accent. Get to know the finishing touches to the plot and you'll see why this is a great choice! Lucy Liu is right with her "Do you accept me - will you shoot me?" <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies several times in days - this is one of them.
