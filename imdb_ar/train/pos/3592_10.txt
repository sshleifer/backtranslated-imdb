Flick another strong chick. This time around, Diana Gusman is engaged in fights that are always at school. Instead of expulsion, take her anger elsewhere, to the boxing ring. She trained to be an angel and she met Adrian's featherweight and began to love him. This film contains a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone does not believe in you (in this case, her father does not believe in them). This alone makes the movie worth the price. Enjoy
