A combination of brilliant black and white photography and the plot of "Eugene Ongine with Evolution" made this a real hit for me. The atmosphere created by the very dark shots contrasted with the excessively white color, which was very dark. There was a wonderful moment where the transparent paper was displayed - apparently a seemingly traditional holiday but the actors' faces revealed the character and the situation skillfully but instantly - accompanied by a hearty Lansky song from the opera Tschaikowsky Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me a good movie sign is that it should take advantage of the opportunities offered by this medium, which means that the story is often less important than the images and atmosphere - last year in Marienbad is a good example of such a the movie . Crisana in the same mold.
