I know, I know: he is childish. But I like this kind of movies. A bird has suffered many "accidents" and has not lost its faith in humanity and humor. What distinguishes this film is the fact that the main character is "Poly" - parrot - and that it was not used as a motive for some human actors. Besides, I like the story: Polly tells his lifestyle to cleaner when he gets to the bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice sounds like Joe Bisky!). Shish Marin Of course, man is a humor for me. Since I saw "Up in Smoke", I appreciate the naive way in his performance, making the simple attitude a joyful attitude .. I can not help myself.
