A fun game, which offers fun play, easy play and fair replay ability. Staying right with the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something invisible in most traffic cartridges today. Also, the narrative and animated scenes used (although the long animations are replaced by slide shows on the Nintendo 64 version) use the full feature of the platform capabilities.
