I think Hollow Point is a funny movie with some good moments that I have never seen before in motion movies. Well, both Tia Carrier and Thomas Ian Griffiths are not good at acting, but Tia Carrier is a nice and good-looking girl, right? But Donald Sutherland is fantastic in his crazy gangster role.
