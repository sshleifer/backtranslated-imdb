In fact, I never bought the metal demonic, but this kind of film played on this idea. Although it is certainly not a film that takes seriously or is a real rate, it serves its purpose in that it enjoys playing. The story contains a burning metal bar to death at the hotel, one of his dreams has a dream in that sense, and said that the band begins to carry out a killing from behind the grave. So yes, there is a little conspiracy "Nightmare on Elm Street" that takes place here. Freddy has never been molested by a girl in a car before. There was another film showing a heavy metal tape, but it was quite different in how it was shown because it had a band of this kind that captured a city of children and made them crazy. This one simply has one fan of band type to help the killer spirit at first and then try to stop it. Nothing shocking in that I do not remember so many people being killed. Quite frankly, the scene I remember most is the girl wearing headphones and being harassed by some of the band's incarnations. Nothing great, but a nice time stuffing.
