I was browsing the list of Oscars and I was surprised to see this film beat Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for the best picture in 1969. After seeing him already, I'm no longer surprised. He was very advanced in his time with style and film and using the flashback to help develop the character of Joe Pack. <br /> <br /> What's amazing to me is the depth of Joe Pack's character in such a short film. I think Voight possessed naive and sparkling when provoked. It was the scenes that really caught my attention after he got the tongue in the theater and when the older man asked him. I think when he looks at the mirror he tries to figure out if he's actually done - or is about to do - something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a wonderful decision by Hoffmann to take over this role. Otherwise it may have been written after graduates. Anyway, this is great at all times for some reason.
