In the wake of Watergate, a number of conspiracy films appeared, such as the one written by the late Adam Kennedy (based on his novel). <br /> <br /> Jane Hackman plays former Vietnam veteran Roy Tucker, the loser who ended up in jail. He receives visits from Marvin Crown (Richard Widmark), who claims to represent an organization designed to help the wrongdoers. They offer him freedom, and although not proven Tag accepts. But he brings with him a cellmate named Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). Exactly what is hard to see, because Spiventa is a annoying little man who drives Tucker to madness with the continued talk about sex, not what you want to hear when you are behind bars. <br /> <br /> Tagge users kill Spiventa before Tucker is surprised. His collection with wife Ellie (Candice Bergen), giving a new identity (strangely, he does not try to change his looks.This shark's shaving was beginning), settles, but finds that there is a draw - Tagge wants Tucker to do at least the assassination of the president United State. He refuses, so Tagge Ellie is kidnapped ... <br /> <br /> I'll leave the summary here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest yourself. The script contains enough plot holes to make you want to read the book (fantastic trick!). Tagge represents people not being detected. The insinuations of the killing of J. F. It is okay. Despite the findings of The Warren Commission, the question of whether Lee Harvey Oswald acts alone continues to this day. <br /> <br /> This was Stanley Kramer's first film in years, and although he is not Turkey, he lacks the grip of John Frankenheimer, the "Manshuriya candidate" or "the theorist" of Allan J. Bakola. Being a leftist plot film, he tends to skirt around his subject rather than stick to it. I am better than the right wing myself - they are more entertaining! Domino has the look and feel of a T-V. The film boasts of what should be the easiest escape from jail in the film's history, not to mention the end of the classic Michael Caen film "Get Carter". <br /> <br /> What makes him famous is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, who died sadly earlier this year, is as wonderful as the mysterious Tagge, who initially appears to be behind the operation until he is mercilessly eliminated, and begins a series of deaths designed to remove all the evidence traces one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot - completely Such as dominoes. As Tucker, the innocent pawn, Hackman is awesome. You have to wonder why he chose to hide in this obvious place. In his shoes, I fled to the other side of the world, anywhere to get away from these fanatics. Hackman's scenes of love with Bergen slow down the plot, which is almost comfortable when she is kidnapped. It is assumed that the producers also thought about it, which explains why it was opened with a strange introduction that explains the entire premise of the film - expressed by British actor Patrick Allen - warning the public that they are "out there" and that they are "out" to us. Comedian Les Dawson later defied this opening in his book B.B.C. show "The Dawson Watch". <br /> <br /> Miki Rooney worked earlier with Kramer on "Its A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World". His "death" scene is like a clip of that image, where the actor seems to have been tickled by a wasp instead of killed. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy films were made only by the left, but now the right to get the act too. Last year, "Taking Freedoms," a ridiculous collection of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair's government, turned Britain's response to the "cooler of madness." At least, the Domino Candice Bergen had a nice. Chris Atkins's best film was Ann Widecom! <br /> <br /> It is surprising that the "Domino Principle" was produced by Sir Louis Rteij, the legendary British television magnate behind the film Saint, and Jesus of Nazareth. And "puppet show". He worked with Adam Kennedy again in 1980 in "Raise The Titanic!" , Whose failure failed so great that he drowned in the aspirations of Grade to be Louis B.Meyer's new. Being somewhat open-minded, I do not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.
