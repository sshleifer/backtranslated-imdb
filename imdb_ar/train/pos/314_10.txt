This exhibition is a great history story. It contains everything from slavery, the way they were treated, the religion, the ways in which Jews were sent to hide, the Inquisition, the belief in the African gods, and the way women were treated, including the girls. Even down to homosexuality. The way in which characters are intertwined with that Violante, that character saddens me. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her. I am very happy because they decided to re-launch it for TV. one more time. Although I love to see the unedited version. My check became my hero. I look forward to the way they use their power to help everyone who is looking for them. I love all the characters and found that they can relate to many people now in this century. I look forward to my check every night. It would be great to describe it in English so Americans can also love it.
