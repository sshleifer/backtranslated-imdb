Tiempo de valientes is a very enjoyable comedy. After his wonderful film El Fondo del Mar and the amazing program of Los Simuladores, Damian Szifron made another great work. Tiempo de valientes seems, for a moment, a Hollywood film made by Diego Preetti and Luis Loki, two great actors, and here, they have great performances. The film is very fun and funny and has wonderful moments. Tempo de Valentines is a very enjoyable motion comedy I would highly recommend if you want to get a fantastic time show. I have to congratulate Zephron for all the talent he has. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
