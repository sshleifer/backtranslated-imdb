Frankly, this film has gone through the heads of most of its critics. <br /> <br /> The reverse of the lost (lost) is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of very few to deal with these two concepts. The film also explores the love and disappointment of the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these issues are currently. <br /> <br /> The premise is that the parents in this move, officer Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his criminal boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), loved their sons and would do anything to protect them. But Connor's son Rooney is more evil than the rest. One of Rooney's loyal soldiers is being killed to cover up his father's robbery. When Connor learned that Michael Sullivan's son saw it, he accidentally killed Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an effort to silence the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides he wants revenge at all costs, even if it is terribly high. Rooney, who censors one of the scenes on the day Connor was born, refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan and employs a murderer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Ronnie joins his son Conor on the road to destruction. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, accompanied by his young son Michael, Sullivan Connor follows Ronnie on the road to destruction, chasing Maguire Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in the basement of the church, and demands to give up Conor because Connor killed his family, says Ronnie - "Michael, there are only killers in this room, .. and there is only one guarantee, none of us will see the sky." As the film ends, as expected to some extent, one character and one personal repentance are saved. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he gives up his character to play captain Sullivan convincingly, giving subtle and wonderful performance. Newman does a good job like Ronnie the old Irish gangs, showing a solid edge in his face and style, his eyes chased by the acts of Connor. Good Lou plays Maguire in a creepy way. Tyler Hueklin plays the role of Michael Young naturally and without any effect. <br /> <br /> Still, cinematography constantly shines from darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and destruction. The camera was pulled out of a plate of greens and gray. Ash belongs to parents and the urban landscape of the Illinois Depression. The Greens belong to young children and rural lands in that state. Thomas Newman's lush, resonant, and harrowing Irish music was faint and displayed in Copeland-like arrangements. The collections were real in mid-west cities - factories and churches. The houses shine with glittering woodwork. <br /> <br /> The feature of the film is to create a unique feeling through its deep themes, distinguished representation, music, and film. The only negative result was the appearance of a light anti-firearms message in the y scenario, which is the only film reference to political precision. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 out of 10; in time it will be recognized as a wonderful movie.
