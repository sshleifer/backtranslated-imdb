I watched it several times on Sundance TV several years ago and I received a beautiful cinematic shake on the system. A semi-surreal but difficult look at the modern media culture (or lack of it), with a focus on some seriously distraught Hollywood village residents. She had an early and entertaining performance by Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable films from DPs that made films of the Polish brothers. There was the savage sense of humor and the strange original feeling that certainly distinguishes it. This film was classically written throughout the film, and I am surprised that it has not yet come out on the DVD. <br /> <br /> We hope soon.
