I love this game to death. Since I was nine years old (now 15 years old). It contains fantastic graphics, characters, charm, weapons and extras, and do not forget the wonderful dragons in the end! I'm still waiting for a new version, pre-set or sequel to this awesome video game. <br /> <br /> You play the role of Dart, a young swordsman who has the ability to be a hero. In this adventure you encounter fantastic creatures and fight the boss. Also face some friends in the way who have their own element. Such as fire, dark, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light, and wind. There are also elements known as the souls of dragons, which allow you to turn into magical beings of myth. Dragons, processors and creatures called wings and evil beings will have to face them in this exciting adventure. One of my favorite games at all, The Legend of Dragoon!
