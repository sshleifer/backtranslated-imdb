First, this is my favorite movie at all. You do not need to give anyone a description because every hole ** does it. I am literally obsessed with these non-bloody, girlish and lame effects, which include the poorly released "Arm Arm Display", the metal horror masterpiece of the 1980s. The director (heard) hoped to achieve a great success at the box office so he could serialize and get a deal of the type FREDDY / JASON for himself. Damn, I wish I had fallen so! Noise in the soundtrack. Good representation .... Check out this MOFO. And any fan enthusiasts out there, do not hesitate to e-mail and chat at some point. Midgetorgy .... I can find it at Yahoo.
