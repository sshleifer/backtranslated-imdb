Love Trap is not short, obviously a 105 minute feature film. <br /> <br /> As I write this, I may talk a little more about Love Trap. I was often asked what makes Love Trap different ... So answer this question: 1) Present characters - one in particular - never seen before in the film, this period. <br /> <br /> 2) Reveals more truth about love, and delves deeper into the concept of love, than any other American film ever, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as in the way the story is listed, it does not resemble any love story I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It offers very timely insights on various cultural issues, both within and outside the Black community. <br /> <br /> Over time, people will come to see Love Trap as original as possible in this era, pleasantly refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare moral play full of food to think about. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about this movie.
