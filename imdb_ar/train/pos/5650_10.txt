"Someone at the door." Oh, how I miss this very bad offer .. But we are now lucky to have the "invasion". Thank you, Sean Cassidy. American Gothic, it was all. If I have to choose one thing I like in the presentation, it should be "unexpected plot lines." My favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I adore that Southern Accent. I purchased the DVD as soon as possible, and my children are also impressed. There are some steamy hot scenes. Some of those demonic also. So, if you're watching kiddos, you may want to edit (fastforward / skip). Her spirit of humor, on the level of Joss Wheedon, lacks many offerings. Adult wit and adult mode, which is dealing with finese. The DVD has some plugins, but I hope it contains more. If you want to get excitement and enjoy a wonderful show, come and see "American Gothic"!
