It takes time to get used to the sites Nebraskan in Nick took some time before we can easily accept him as an intercontinental playwright. Once you skip the bar, it turns into a wonderful story about a man losing everything while trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Nolte, an American, travels to Germany and marries a famous actress, a satisfied success in all respects until the war ends. He was visited by John Goodman, who convinced him of the United States, and persuaded him to accept a job as an anti-Semitic radio announcer for the Nazis. Nolte has no policy but believes it is difficult to write an almost impossible role and then play it himself. Another US secret agent will modify Nolte's radio scripts - coughing here and sneezing - that will serve as a symbol for intelligence transfer to allies. There is hunting, though. No one will know about Nolte's real role as an American client except for Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt himself. If it is ever discovered, it will be rejected by the Americans. <br /> <br /> Nolte moves forward and his programs are very popular in Germany. His admiring wife, Cheryl Lee, knows nothing about what is going on, and does not care. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as the "two nation". The war ends and the problem begins. He was captured by Americans who are bitter because of his betrayal. They beat him and left him in the mud. Goodman, his "fictional mother", sent him to an unknown presence in Greenwich Village and sent him little money from time to time. <br /> <br /> By 1960, he was able to develop friendly relations with his neighbor, painter Alan Arkin, who lost his family and claims that the two now belong to a secret fraternal group. But his position and identity leaked in one way or another and were embraced by a group of ancient Aryan racists - led by a dentist and a priest. His front and trunk were painted with swastikas and accusations. I was senselessly beaten by the previous GI. But - miraculously - his beloved wife returned to him by the ancient Aryans. Another file: It turned out that she was not his wife, but her younger sister, whom she loved since adolescence. <br /> <br /> The end made him write his memoirs in an Israeli prison in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity. It's not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can talk, but not see, the cell's occupant over his prison. It's Adolf Eichmann. Eichman seems nice enough. Nolty advises that this bad habit is writing for fifteen consecutive hours. "It's important to relax, you have to learn to relax." He laughs loudly and yells, "So you got here." The film is full of such paradoxes. At some point in their comfortable conversations, Arkin told him that "despite everything, I still think people are in good health." I do not know if the film was a commercial success, but if it is not, it is probably something that has been blown up by a smaller audience of theatergoers who may never have heard of Anne Frank, let alone be supposed to have a final mention in her memoirs. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it is an adult film, and an adult patient in it. The story moves slowly, there is very little violence, no car chase, no shooting, and people do not seem to be under the pressure of manic talk. Many of them may escape from viewers who do not open themselves to their deliberate approach. Nolty points to the wartime relationship between him and his wife as "a nation of two". This is a very compressed statement. There is no doubt that anyone can come up with a bright definition, but it takes some focus to understand his emotional significance. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a man who loses everything - his ability to write, his identity and his identity as a wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-respect. At some point, he stops walking on a busy New York street and simply stands there after dark, when a curious policeman moves with him. The reason for his stop is that he simply does not have a place to go. What vonigut describes is much more depressing. I do not mean to look down, but it's a kind of hard-to-understand feeling in your youth. Teenagers may want to think that they know what Nolte is booking at that spot, but it really requires maturity and the quick sense of smoothness that maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Remember Robert Frost's line about being home is the place when you go there should take you in? Well, Nolte will not take place.
