Here is Italy (I write from Venice). Why was it canceled? ABC should have given it an opportunity to build an audience. The cast (w / Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen in recent times. We need more offers like this that make viewers feel smart, not drones. I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or be picked up by another station.
