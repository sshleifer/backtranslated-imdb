The burglar of Baghdad is one of my favorite ten films. It is exciting without the presence of a gorge, beautifully photographed and the artistic direction is flawless. Casting can not be better. Rex Ingram has made me believe in genes. The example of evil was certainly portrayed by Conrad Vitt as Jaafar. I put the tape very high. <br /> <br /> .. I watch this movie at least twice a year ... I never get tired of it. This movie is an adventure for all ages ... no one is too old to enjoy it. A thief steals my memories to a more innocent time ... I was 10 years old the first time I saw her and the United States was about to enter World War II. Conrad Viet was so wonderful that he was able to continue this basic "evil" after a few years in Casablanca. Korda, I believe, collaborated with Justin and Dupry again in the film "Four Feathers" .... Fantastic film industry!
