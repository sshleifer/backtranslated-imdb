Hot Millions is a wonderful movie in every way. An eccentric fun story with fantastic performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in business. Peter Ostinov is gorgeous, as usual, and Maggie Smith --- certainly one of the greatest actresses of all time --- is a complete delight. Carl Malden and Bob Newhart are the cast of the cast and they are also ideal. If you want a movie that has perfect reps, that's it. The impressive thing is how they work together in a natural and effortless way, creating lots of laughs and fun moments all the time. Peter Ostinov was a genius with a great sense of humor, and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and editing are also first class, a wonderful capsule from London in the 1960s. It is definitely on my favorite menu.
