The only complaint I have about this amendment is that it is sexually sporadic. Things that have not been hinted only in the novel appear on the screen for some strange reason. Did they think that the public would be too stupid to understand if everything was not shown correctly? Other than that, this is very good quality. All actors perform wonderful functions to recreate their characters to life. For the shallow women there, it is worth seeing at least because Toby Stevens Gilbert is the most attractive thing ever. If you were Helen, I would forget to be married the moment you put eyes on them. <br /> <br /> A kind of spoiler - the end scene is a funny reflection of what happened in the book.
