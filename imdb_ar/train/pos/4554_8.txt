There are not many stories to overcome difficulties like the stories of Christie Brown. His parents with cerebral palsy were born in Dublin in the 1930s, and I think his disability is mental and physical. Although Brown was properly diagnosed in the end, in a working-class family of about 20 children, he had to pay himself just for his family's appreciation. Through the use of the only fully functioning limb, his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint, both of which he skillfully developed. <br /> <br /> But what makes Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" such a big drop is humility. Director / writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day Lewis have been able to tell this story in a way that does not call attention to melodrama. Cheerful struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of precise victory are the easy pitfalls of a very miraculous story; however, "My Left Foot" remains a real and fundamentally inspirational one. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing anyone with such serious physical disabilities must be a daunting task. Day-Lewis gives us a complete picture of Christy, but it is also capable of dating, improving, and changing his character at different stages of his life. Christie plays at the age of 17 when he had limited language ability and was as emotionally volatile as Christie, who is intellectually learning and struggling to overcome the reason for his inability to find non-Platonic love. The last subject is the most powerful film and it would be wonderful for Sheridan and co-adapter Sean Connaughton to embody it. Regardless, Day-Lewis makes us understand all these elements and empathize with them, giving such a reasonable performance that you do not have time to think, "Wow, he's a great actor." These are the most commendable offers. <br /> <br /> Equally important but through more accurate means is Sheridan's work in the film. This story revolves around everyday life and conflicts. Although Christie has such a unique set of circumstances that hinder his life, his struggle is no different from our own, while Sheridan realizes this concept. Christie struggles with love, parental care, self-esteem and ability. His struggles are manifested physically (literally and figuratively) more than our struggle. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that reflect the spirit of the great Brown family and the unique Christie place. Drama develops naturally when tensions are higher and humor is the same. Dinner scene When Christie teaches that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - will marry his brother Peter is the best example of the film on the efforts of Day-Lewis and Sheridan. They are well built by Sheridan so that they appear when we are ready and Louis takes us today from there with his amazing work. <br /> <br /> The other strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as the lady. brouwn. I did not know she won the Oscars, but there was something about her performance as a loving and wise mother who just screamed at the Oscars. Her love for Christie and the constant fighting for her seem very persuasive and hearty, and she gains much empathy because of her attitude. <br /> <br /> The emotional enthusiasm of the film because of the story is very small. This may have been part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organic. The two must be conciliatory, but I imagine it's hard to tell a story that feels realistic and provides dramatic moments to take our feelings on the roller coaster. The choice of underestimating the latter was a wise choice for my "left foot". Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they do not need pressure to make a big, heavier impact. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my moviemusereviews.com website for more
