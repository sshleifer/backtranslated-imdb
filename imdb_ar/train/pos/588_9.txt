I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford, and I appreciate his love for the American people and the earth. In A River Runs Through It, Redford presents the lyrical romance and visual splendor of the rocky mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th-century naturalist such as Thomas Moran or Albert Berstadt. This film makes love visible and word with the text of author Norman McLean, an amazing camera work by Philip Rossellott (Kiss of the Serpent, Regin Margot). <br /> <br /> The Redford team is perfect. Tom Skrit is Rev. Maclean, the man who includes his methods of teaching fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythin, the mother, and his children, Craig Shafer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems as growing teenage boys and complex youth. Both Shafir and Beth Mahbuban are quite like brothers with their love for fly fishing and some will connect them forever. The relationships between men, father, sons, brothers and women to the outside world are based on a "river running through it" into the context of the storytelling of many of the Hollywood films that have been produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> However, what makes these relationships special is the attention Redford gives to language as he speaks in dialogue. This is a script, nice to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning rivers and mountains of Montana. Words and preparation are equal to the performance of reps dressed in their material. While the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem a strange tool to centralize a story, it is not impossible in the hands of Redford managers. Given the material, the Redford poem to a simpler time and life worth going back again and again.
