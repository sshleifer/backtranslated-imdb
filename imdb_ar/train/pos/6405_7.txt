I thought that racism and prejudices against Karl Prascher was greatly exaggerated by Hollywood's influence. I do not think the US Navy was racist at all. I can not imagine that a full captain, the commanding officer, tells his boss never to deliberately flounder. Certainly not at risk of his life. Never before was there a trivial head, where he was shamelessly prejudiced against everyone, but WASPs as a DeNiro character. The Chief would not have been on his head drunk and rude as he had ever played to become Master Chief in the first place. Cuba Gooding saved a bad film.
