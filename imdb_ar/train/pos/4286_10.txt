I watched this movie (its title in English is "Who sings there?") At the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. The rave then won ... and disappeared. Awesome shame. It is brilliant. Sublime, silly, sad, and very funny. The script is a work of art. I've been 19 years and I've seen a bunch of comedy (or any other kind, for that matter) can match authenticity.
