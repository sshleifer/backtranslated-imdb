When I hired this movie to watch it, I knew it would not be a great movie. Instead, I thought of it as a ransom of reality where someone would be severely beaten. You know what I did. Kurt Russell played a prominent role in showing the emotional soldier he was. I recommend this movie if I went out with the boys and wanted to watch a good movie.
