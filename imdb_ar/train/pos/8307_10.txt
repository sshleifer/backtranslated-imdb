The performance of Tricia Lyric was fantastic !! Tressa played the female singer role, while Richard was at the club. When I first came out on stage and began to tear and strangle her purposes, my soul became vibrating. Her voice is Platini. It needs to work as a CD. Have more fans then realize. She liked the performance of the show stop in five heart beats, which starred with Lyon when she was younger. How a little girl has a very big voice. It's really amazing. Good voice good good good good voice voice voice voice voice wonderful voice wonderful, back back, tears tear, lift, take you back in the days of sound. If you read this commitment, please take my advice and start recording a CD. If not just for the love of singing, but for your fans. I think you can really make it. Look at those singers who have achieved success in one studio, lol.
