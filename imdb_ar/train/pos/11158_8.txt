A well-made, awesome radiator is an undervalued story of brutal killing and the forces of evil. <br /> <br /> A small town doctor is trying to discover who or is committing a series of violent sexual murders. <br /> <br /> Incubus is a tight puzzle, with some horrible killing sequences, that build on a strange climatic evolution. The scenes of murder are intense and shocking, so this is not an allergy film! The direction of John Hough, along with a strange musical score, meets to create a dark atmosphere of horror that runs through the film. It also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well. Also highlight beautiful shooting locations and some stylish camera work. <br /> <br /> The cast is not too bad. The great John Cassavet performs a strong performance as a new doctor in the city. It is also good to perform Kerrie Keane as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a historian in the city, and Duncan Mackintosh as a psychologically tortured teenager. <br /> <br /> All Incubants Incubus is a forgotten horror movie that needs to be rediscovered and re-evaluated. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
