I would like to comment on April Love. It's one of my favorite songs because Nelson Malone plays the role of horse trainer. I remember vividly when Hollywood came to Lexington, Kentucky, where we lived at the time to make April love. My father was in many plays and he was a talented man. I spoke with him trying to try one of the bit bits displayed, and if he returned home with the script. How exciting it is! Also, a number of my colleagues were in crowd sights - especially those appearing in the park. It's a very nostalgic feeling every April when I see the movie being shown again, and April Love by Pat Boone is still on the radio. Remember the eternity of the time you spent a long time ago watching the films they make today with all the hateful sex, language and violence. It will be refreshing to see more films like April Love back to focus ...
