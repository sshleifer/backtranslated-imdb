Technically, this is a beautiful movie - cinema, music and fashion are fantastic. In fact, this film is nicer than the one directed by Akira Kurosawa himself. In this case, he wrote the film only because it was produced several years after his death. <br /> <br /> Thus, with regard to writing, the dialogue was well written and the story was sometimes impressive. The story, however, was somewhat depressing but in some respects not involved - after all, it is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, although prostitution is considered acceptable in Japan, women still aspire to a better life. This reminds me of a lot of Streets Of Shame, although Streets Of Shame characters are less loved and more monolithic. <br /> <br /> So, overall, you get 7 - mostly because of everything but writing. It is very bad that the weakest episode in this film is the great story of Curacao.
