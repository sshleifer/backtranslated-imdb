The person who wrote the review "Enough with sweating and spitting already" does not understand what culture, literary or psychological criticism. He rejects Zizek's explanations because they do not seem "compatible" with what the director originally intended. So what? The importance of director's intention (or author) is not important in critical theory. This is known as the "deliberate fallacy" of the author and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy The text or film can be analyzed through a number of theories, many of which differ with each other, as well as completely ignoring the author's intention. This is the basic idea in critical theory. <br /> <br /> For this reason, everyone who writes this wall has wasted a lot of time and effort to insult Zizk. In fact, anyone studying the theory would immediately distort the opinion of these guys (I suggest you too) because it is completely out of the question. <br /> <br /> This is said ... If you are ever interested in Freudian, Laconia, or Christophian, this film is necessary. It connects these theories to popular films, making them more clear and fun to read or think about.
