Chang Chih "Shaolin Temple" may be a hallmark of the Shaw Brothers Art Film Course. This exciting kung fu epic boasts its amazing songs - a real person from the Shaw Stables. Although the plot is fairly standard and the martial dances design is as cool as usual, Cheh's dealing with the subject makes this film great and enjoyable. The sense of reverence for history and tradition in the Shaolin Temple is evident in every frame. Unlike William Kelly for "Fighting 69" in the same movie, or John Ford's tribute to West Point at Long Gray Line, Shaolin Temple in Xie is a lovingly designed poem in the same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural relationship that I tend to make is comparing the Shaolin temple to Alamu. Watching this film will see the same impressive feelings and nostalgia that I have experienced for many years in the history of primary school when I learned the courage and sacrifice of the convicted Alamo heroes. At the end of the movie, you may also be tempted to go out, remember the Shaolin Temple!
