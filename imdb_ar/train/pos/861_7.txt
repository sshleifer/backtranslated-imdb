What can you say when you see a good French film trying to paint a suspicious story in line with the social background of the characters? The main point is that we believe in those characters and once they meet with each other we want them to stay together. It's simple and really effective. The background story is less important. Why does the script go along with a half-developer film? It does not help in taking part in these social demonstrations that most French filmmakers like. Not much ambition, true: Sur mes l√®vres is just a fun French film with good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the impressive points in the scenario, the end is very easy. It looks as easy as in the rear window (a clear reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less convincing context. When I was stunned, I see that the surveillance officer's personality was not cleared. Brings very little to the story. When he appears alone, we wonder if we have missed part of before. Jack Odeiard is not new yet. Strange and strange.
