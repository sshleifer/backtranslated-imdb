I remember seeing this on TV in the late seventies - and I stayed with me! It's a charming, colorful and colorful film - a wonderful movie for kids. I put it on some friends at a recent concert - of course they thought I was crazy and expected a sick thing to happen to the dolls in a way that "knows the flaws" but no - it's clean and healthy fun. Jack Wilde is in good shape, as is the case with Mama Casa, a fairly attractive charming feces. <br /> <br /> If you like banana splits and you're in their thirties, this surreal childhood will return Saturday morning vibe! <br /> <br /> Even if you now realize that Puf himself is just nonsense - all he does is catch him and escape! A high-quality TV movie - if, like me, you're in a state of death - you'll like it!
