I chose to watch this film in Tribeca based on Jude Hersh and Scott Cohen and found him one of the best films in the festival. Both leading actors perform well-rounded performance that seems to fit personalities on a personal level. The director did a great job of bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is not usually seen in the production for the first time. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this film is the Love of Woodwork and New York City (Brooklyn specifically). The film revolves around the family business of the furniture industry and creates a precise cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary life in Brooklyn. Back to the manager at this good choice. <br /> <br /> This gem I would highly recommend it (I'm sure it will reach the screen).
