Kirk and his crew land on a single planet where the sun explodes. They intend to evacuate the population but find a deserted place except Mr. Atoz who runs a kind of high-tech library. Despite trying to get a direct answer from him about where anyone is, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insists that they have to "check quickly while there is still time". They have no idea what he's talking about but they're walking around looking at mirror-like discs on viewers and seeing pictures of the planet's past. Then, while there is a disc in the viewer, Kirk passes through the entrance and is magically transported in time to what appears to be on Earth as the time of Louis XIV (the 1860s). When McCoy and Spock follow, there is another disc in the viewer and sent to hell in the Ice Age. They realized very late that the library was a time travel machine and a warehouse. <br /> <br /> While Kirk's visit is very short and not very exciting, Spock and McCoy's were more eventful, with Spock in the wake of Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this horrible place as punishment. Spock sights are unusually interesting and unusual for a man who makes sense naturally. <br /> <br /> Spock's exit from the base, highly innovative text and very diverse languages ​​makes this episode an exceptional episode - one worth seeing. <br /> <br /> For your information - Ian Wolf, the representative of the excellent character, played Mr. Attoz. I am a big fan of old films and I saw him as a supportive and well-rehearsed actor in countless films in the 1930s and 1940s, and he looked exactly like he did in this episode of 1969. Interestingly, although he seems old, he lived in 23 years Others - die at the age of 95 years !!
