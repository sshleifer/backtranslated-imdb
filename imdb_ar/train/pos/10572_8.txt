I have a feeling that Warner Bros. musicals of depression will become more important in the next two years. Yes, we are in a recession (or do you live under a rock) and the times seem bleak. But we always have films as a way to escape from our problems. In the 1930s, the film was popular even at the height of economic gloom. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was a popular film. While this musical film directed by Lloyd Bacon does not reflect the social issues of the time as did the 1933 "Gold diggers" (1933), it is still a wonderful display of talent. We have to wait until the end of the film to get the three basic numbers for Berkeley, but the boy, they deserve to wait for me. Yes, Robbie Keller is a singer and an awful actress, and moves to her a lot, but the magical "Bus By Magic" by By A Waterfall beats her, and what looks like a hundred other chorus girls, in this amazing wonderland. Of course, Busby figures can never be performed on stage (they challenge the limits of gravity, for one thing), and are in stark contrast to the reality of the tough, non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also includes James Cagney in one of his very few musical songs (in fact, what could this guy not do?). He even takes the job from the leading man, not dressed as a sailor and pretending to be the gospel of Shanghai Lail (who is really small than Ruby in a wig from China!) And took part in the tournament with Joan Blondell, The other (even the final reel, that is). Blondell seems to be the only other woman Kani has ever loved apart from his wife. You can see mutual love in every scene.
