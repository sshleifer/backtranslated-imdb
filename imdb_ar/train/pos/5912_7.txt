By Dan Yousef <br /> <br /> It is said that the film "Coonskin," by Ralph Bakshi, the only and only, is a satirical condemnation of mental exploitation films and negative negative stereotypes, as well as a look at the lives of blacks in modern America (modern day, I mean 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that caught fire. <br /> <br /> But this Bakshi film, controversial, sexy, and must be seen by definition almost. It is not just a random "jock shock" of the film that tries to shock for shock. It's Ralph Beckshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if he makes a film, he has something big to say ... <br /> <br /> Although its roots depend on the poisoning of cheap discoveries, "Coonskin" is not just another game called Exit the Movie Mainstream white or any kind of flick throwing. "Coonskin" wants to be more. It aims at higher scenes and reddishes a much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie does not make fun of just that kind of fun. It not only charges blacks, but seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells a story of some of the convicts awaiting prison. The fact that it is even possible to get out of prison in the world of "Coonskin" alone makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> A guest tells a story about the three black brothers in Harlem named Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox who want respect and a piece of work and are ready to get it by any means necessary. The Italian mob manages all the real actions. <br /> <br /> The star of leading black musicians: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordon, the first black playwright to bring Pulitzer back home. Obviously there is something big happening here. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the role of descent in this world, this aspect of racial division. From an angry black man, full of vigor, deeply affectionate with hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi does not know the meaning of "sublety". This sounds like not even heard of the word. But such a subject may need to be radicalized. A heavy hammer is a real joke. Some topics can not be handled gently. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is mercilessly of God. Here, no member or minority in the Harlem scene seems unscathed. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real" all based on mood and attitude. All animated characters and human figures share the same reality and are meant to be taken in the same literal form. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never shows an ugly fee just for the value of the shock. He always has something to say. The black face is also unjustified. Here, unlike Spike Lee's Bamboozled, he seems to be using it to try to really say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi films, this movie includes animation and live animation. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not only being stunt here. All this technique is intertwined, tangled with saying something. <br /> <br /> In a way, this technique seems inevitable. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi) are highly objective, and highly motivating at the moment. It reflects the particular direction of the day, but looking back years later, there is an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth). The city looks as clearly as the images of a time capsule, and the attitude, spirit and heart remain unchanged From the king's ear. Everyone who actually watched the movies, the state of things, was with people who knew what I was talking about. <br /> <br /> So that some black characters are a rabbit (junglebunny), a big OL bear and a fox. One of the most rude and indecent racist characters is the dirty Harlem cop who is famous for their "dirty" path after the death of a policeman. But for him, it's not just work. Nor are they for the rest of the brothers who wear armor. It's just pure sadistic racism to hurt black. <br /> <br /> The sequence of Godfather and Lady is one of the most exciting works in the entire film, of which there is so much. It is displayed as opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Promo line: Warning: "This movie offends everyone!" This is not just hype. Follow with great caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> By Dane Youssef
