What can be said about Mr. Moore? He is the Godfather of Rap, the King of Blaxploitation clicks on Z level, and here, back to his most famous character, Dolemite! can you dig it? This film is one round of politically incorrect comic columns, Kung Fu trio, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things you have never found in most modern movies (or any movies, really, haha!). Do not miss the routine of his position early! Anyway, D2 is definitely a fun way to waste an hour or so. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and does not have any class! I'm going to gun up his whistle * a **!"
