"Panic" is an obscure and confusing film about reconciling the deceased and the middle-aged dissonant between strife with a younger hairdresser, his love for the wife and son, and his duty towards the employer / father with his own identity. Although the film has a mysterious purpose and mysterious end, it is a wonderful production in almost all aspects. The clarity and sincerity of the characters in such an unpopular story may appeal to the public.
