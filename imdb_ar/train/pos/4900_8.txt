This is a strange film where the British do a good job. Low budget, embossing type roles, executed well. The story is a little weak, and Judy Dench recently decided to pick up the "Blonde Bomber Girl," a girl band almost all (almost all) made a show during the war in London. Such as the way the film allows young people to see that they do not monopolize feelings, love and even lust, and that "old wrinkles" can also laugh well. I was supposed to see more of the other "blonde bombs", so I quickly thought. I kept thinking while I was watching that David Jason would have made Patrick better than Ian Holm, although he was quite fit as a "transsexual" drummer. All in all A cheerful movie worth a night with the girls :)
