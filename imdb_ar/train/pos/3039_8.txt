Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning autobiography, Patton, follows with a strong tribute to American combat generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Beck gives a strong description of man, his genius as well as selfishness. With MacArthur, you did not know exactly where one started and the other stopped working and many times mixed in. <br /> <br /> The entire story of Douglas MacArthur will be a six-hour film or a small television series. He will cover him from his days at border posts with his family to his time at West Point where he still has the highest school rate ever achieved by trainees. He was talking about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, a legend of his building courage in the battlefields of World War I in France. He will also have to tell him when he shoots World War I veterans in 1932, and Caposh is likely to put any chances of President Herbert Hoover in reelection. During the last years of MacArthur, he and Hoover owned penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. This should be a subject they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the years from 1941 to 1952, and was quickly told. The film starts with addressing MacArthur in front of the students in 1962. As the words of the famous letter of honor speak, MacArthur's mind returns to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on Corridor Island and the Bataan fields on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to restore the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months that culminated in his reassurance of leadership by President Truman. <br /> <br /> MacArthur will not work as a film at all if it is not for the portrayal of Dan O'Hareley and Ed Flanders as Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It is part of the film I enjoyed best, where I saw MacArthur and his relationships with these two men. <br /> <br /> FDR picks up by O'Herlihy the aristocratic jam and the exceptionally twisted man who was our thirty-second president. Roosevelt was a man who got his points with extraordinary skill and skill. Sometimes he liked him a lot for his own good, but he was the main politician of the last century. Note how MacArthur deals with the battlefield commander and potential competitor at the same time. <br /> <br /> As people remember, a man speaks frankly of people who do not like MacArthur hate of gitgo. Of course, in history books, how was Truman MacArthur exempted in 1951 from disobedience. MacArthur was a rebel, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> However, I can write a complete thesis on Truman MacArthur relations. Along the way it never needs to crunch. I've always felt that Roosevelt would have handled the whole thing much better if he were still president at the time. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also very eloquent, while Gregory Beck picked up some of that rhetoric in some of the speeches that made him as legendary as the victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck when the Japanese surrender, MacArthur farewell to the nation before the joint congressional session, and of course his speech to the students in 1962. See the news and see if you disagree.
