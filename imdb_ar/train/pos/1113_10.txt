Sandra Bernhard is a wonderful figure, certainly one of the most endearing women on Earth. She started as a comedian in the 1970s, but her big break came in 1983 when she starred against Jerry Lewis and Robert de Niro in the dazzling Scorsese masterpiece "The King of Comedy." Her film career never started. I made two exotic and entertaining images, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the amazing parts were those I made for themselves. <br /> <br /> "Without You I'm Nothing" is without a doubt its best effort. He adapted to show off the overwhelming Broadway that made her a star? Madonna's best friend for four years. In ten well-designed and welcoming scenes, Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross and talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs famous songs by Bert Bacharach, Prince or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich got Sandra to perform a 90-minute tour that is uniquely sexy and funny. If you are a fan of Bernard, you will not miss this film; it is a tribute to her (odd) beauty as well as her unconventional talent as a comedian. Have influenced the directors in their work ?? "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", for example, will look much different if "Without You I'm Nothing" does not exist.
