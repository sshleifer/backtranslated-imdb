I must start by telling you how I came across this film. It was winter time in Alaska around 1990. My friend from Australia was staying with me and my friend in a shoe box in an apartment. Winter in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch anything come on TV. I found this film outside a savings shop on a snow bank and was immediately a new treasure. Best movie ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish. We've seen it many times in fact so we sometimes turn the TV on its side or upside down to get a full fill effect. It is a real gem effect. The laughter will come unceasingly and memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it, and you will not regret it!
