One was a great movie. You've just finished watching it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought that this was a good picture of what looks like life as a professional wrestler. Now this movie was made 4 years before I was born, but I do not think the rigors of professional wrestling have changed much. Sad, funny, and everywhere great! **** 10+
