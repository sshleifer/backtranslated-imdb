I read that this was not good, that the story was not solid, and that Volckman felt that he had failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with that. First, they are executed well. Volckman works well not only to try out a new style, but to focus on what is worth thinking about: Will eternity diminish the value of life? A big question ... <br /> <br /> I can see that he is trying hard to build a feeling, and he does not bargain. This is a praise. I'm sure it's an interesting exercise to build characters in such a model. I've seen artists shrink a form to the minimum to build the intensity of the moment. I know this film by this. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is more interesting than Richard Lynchliter's definition of the robot, and Volckman's story is more meaningful than the subsequent Lincliter stories of a drug-wasted life. Old news. Everyone knows that, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance has a lot to offer, something new to think about. There are many other stories that contain a lot of holes that perform much better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really wonderful work
