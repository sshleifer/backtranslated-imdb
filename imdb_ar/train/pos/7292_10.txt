I got this only last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival in Limes on Beverly. This film got the most applause of all the movies that evening. Given that the two music videos opened for the first time, I did not know what to expect because they were very fast and attracted attention, I was not sure I was ready for a short while immediately. But to my surprise I really enjoyed this. I thought the main actor demon man was really good. I was so impressed by his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see this man who was a stalkbad. I've gotten really good especially since then! Either this or he has been given poor roles or has been pushed by the director really badly for this short. The girl did a good job. I think it's hard since it was its first performance and being small. Father Hassan also. There was a lot of really good work for a short time, both for this and for the next short game "Mexican Hat" which was also nice, but I enjoyed this most because it had the greatest depth and passion and I was really interested in characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was very illustrative and dark! I've dealt with real themes using a more imaginative approach to keeping people like me interested. We will not even talk about the last film in the block that I left. My only complaint is that I wish I had seen more of a demon character and little less than the start, which is why I gave it 9 out of 10. I also thought that the final credits went slowly. Otherwise, they have been told, directed and edited beautifully. The timing was very nice with a complete change from the quick MTV editing that has been on everything for the time being. There will be more coming from this future director in addition to the actor. Now I will think of him as the representative of the lost grief and not the Witchblade man.
