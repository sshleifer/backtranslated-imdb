The fourth in the series "Dirty Harry", this film features one of the dirtiest, ugliest, undesirable, and disgusting films I've seen in the film: "Ray Perkins," performed by Audrey Nyan. It is the modern, low-life version of "Detour" of 1945, "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> I have relieved her bad mouth and her annoying position so much that I have not seen this movie again until it has been acquired by the candidate of the noble words that closed it ... and some less of it! Then I enjoyed the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Everywhere, "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood), the violence follows immediately ..... in minutes! It is often laughable, but he makes a fast-moving armed film with a satisfying ending, where all the bad guys get rid of each other. <br /> <br /> It is a very sophomore movie that appeals to our instincts ..... and connects, sad to say. Most of us want to see this dirt get in the end, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
