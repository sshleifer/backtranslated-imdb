With all these things at the moment with the MJ, I started listening to his music, watching the odd documentary here and there, watched the Wiz and watched the Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get an insight into this man who I thought was really great in the 1980s just to decide whether he was guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part of a biography, part of a feature film I remember that I would see in the cinema when it was originally released. Some contain hidden messages about the feeling of MJ towards the press as well as the clear drug message is m'kay bad. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Michael so what you do not like about MJ anyway you'll hate this and find it boring. Some may describe MJ as cocky in agreeing to make this film, but most fans may say it's made of fans, if that's really true of it. <br /> <br /> The actual feature of the bit movie when it finally starts lasts only for 20 minutes or so, except for the smooth criminal sequence, and the masked Joe atmosphere as the powerful drug lord. Why MJ wants a dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ heard his plans? Our hair, Joe Bisky, disgusted that he wanted people to know that he was the one who supplies drugs and so on, so I do not hate, maybe he hates the music of MG. <br /> <br /> Lots of wonderful things in this MJ turn into a car, robot and full speed devil sequence. Also, the director must have the patience of a saint when it comes to filming a bad sequence for children, where directors often dislike working with one child, let alone a handful of them performing a complex dance scene. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on a level or another (which I think is most people). If not, then get away. It's an attempt to get rid of a healthy message, ironically that the best friend of MJ in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is really one of the most talented people ever to honor this planet, but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention I gave to the subject .... well, I do not know because people can be different behind closed doors, I know that fact. It's either a very nice guy but stupid or one of the most bad liars. I hope it will not be the last.
