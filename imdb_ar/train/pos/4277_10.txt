"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A tragic comedy with profound implications for the fate of the human race appears through the eyes of ordinary and apparently ordinary people from a Serbian province left by God before the start of World War II. I saw him in a small movie theater in Russia where the film was very limited, and I have not had the opportunity to confront him since then. It is unfortunate that this excellent film has almost been forgotten. I searched for a VHS or DVD version of it many times, and unfortunately - I did not find anything. I would be grateful to most other fans of this small jewel of filmmaking to suggest ways to buy a copy.
