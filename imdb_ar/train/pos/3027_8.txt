I see a lot of movies, good, bad and indifferent; there is usually something of interest to focus on, even if it's just designed, the trusted work of a good actor, or the lucky laugh that comes out of watching the uncertainty that has been captured forever. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, a film I had never seen before. Graham Greene has been translated into film several times of course, in masterpieces such as "Thin Man" and in lesser cars. The "secret agent" is one of those smaller vehicles, yet it is able to transport me to any place anyway, despite the weak tendency, and Bickal and Boer disagree as Britain and Spain respectively, and the absence of virtually any chemistry leads to two . In some ways, this latest "problem" begins to work for the film. How can we really love the atmosphere of Fascist and capitalist killing that converges on the tragedy of one person? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from the complex and guilt-ridden psychology of the filmmaker. I know that some believe that deliberate speed here is boring, and I can understand that. However, I found that clumping stands out rather than detracting from what is a world of phobia. I had to watch, not through any wonderful work (although Boyer was as wonderful as usual, managed to deliver a rich mix of global distress, tragedy, hope, enthusiasm with his wonderful voice and longing eyes), but by a rising rush of slim man hopes Against a world of persecution and money. What is a thief? What is good in the face of death? Where do profit-taking and exploitation begin? The film does not rise to the level of art, and therefore can not hope to answer such questions, but it is more than just amusement, murder and the comet is too dark. The lack of facade, or the "bubble" or "narrative" echo, helps make this film very useful. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending, because history wrote the end.
