The 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Kenner, Paul Rudd, Romano Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Jane Lynch, Jerry Bednop, Shelly Shelley and Kat Dinings. A funny comedic comedy about the famous Andy Stitzer (played wonderfully by the second permanent Karel Banana in a truly comical performance sure to give him the stratosphere to list A), a technical services representative for an electronics store in Southern California. His secret identity is by three well-intentioned but completely ignorant fellow coworkers (Rod, Malco & Rogen, each one more entertaining degree than the next) determined to get undefeated by their friend regardless of the cost. The following is probably a very warm love story with a fun mother (the wonderful Kenner, who has a lot of fun here), adding more fuel to the fires inside Andy. Amazingly entertaining and surprising comedy; the most entertaining since "There's Something About Mary" with a well-thought-out script by director Jod Apatow and Carlyle, which contains some amazing sequences of gastrointestinal infarction including David Caruso's amazingly accurate joke, , And send copies of the "History of Balucha" to demystify the war between the sexes with cheeky slit. A real and classic winner. The most beautiful film of the year.
