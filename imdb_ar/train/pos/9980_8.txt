Any film that shows federal pigs (people in government) to be crazy threats to power in real life has a lot to recommend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, supervision of the text and editing and even, sometimes, the output is defective, so there will be people who will disregard the entire film and ignore the good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original route again when it was new and hated it, despised it, and hated it. I thought it was an awful and irrational piece of trash. <br /> <br /> Now, though, I do not remember why. <br /> <br /> I think the two should not be compared or even contacted. <br /> <br /> I consider them different. <br /> <br /> Their values ​​are different. <br /> <br /> "Vanishing Point" provides a gathering place and a banner for people who want to encourage individuals, who believe in human rights, and who recognize the threat to the freedom government, could be, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "Sound" wears a cover with the New Hampshire state logo: "Live free or die." At one time, it was the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a movie to cheer.
