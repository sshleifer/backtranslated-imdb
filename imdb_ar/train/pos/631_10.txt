This film contains everything that must be contained in the fantasy film, romance, intelligent memories, wonderful acting, and a fair dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I totally enjoyed this movie and drew my attention to its original scheme (based on Neil Jimman's novel I am now looking forward to reading) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most surprising things for me was the extent to which the self contained the story. Unlike many existing science fiction films that leave open ends, this was a pure fairy tale, satisfying itself and not needing a series. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Feeling good imagination.
