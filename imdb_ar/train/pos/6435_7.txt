I think most people who posted comments on this film do not understand how to watch a movie and / or a little sense of elegance. First, to evaluate the film, you must understand how well everything in the movie works together. Modern sensibilities require great drama. No, I do not mean the great preparation of characters and conspiracies, but they seem to require largely tragic or largely comical emotional trajectories. This is a hidden film. Its beauty lies in precision (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this film. It is a beautifully filmed film that makes the most of the combination of sense, politics, human weakness and corruption ... name it. The world in which it was set up will be strange and incomprehensible today ... a world where you should boast now and loudly, even if you think you have it. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian because people understand the term today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps to adjust the record.
