If you have read "Mother Mother" and enjoyed it a lot (as I did) so much so that you only watch the movie, understand that you must understand the essential element in the writings of Vonngut - which is beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you can not put the human mind on the screen. His white writings and humor can not be copied through a script or even better performance. I think that this film goes beyond asking the main questions posed by Vonigut in his book, but those repetitive satirical moments of spelling on the page were not found on the screen. Does this mean that the film lacks the mark? of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a way for those very zombies to turn a page). It is successful because it takes the basic elements of a story created by one of the real artistic treasures of America and presented in a framework without a pretext. I have seen other film versions of Vonnegut's books where it is clear that the director tries to direct the genius of Vonnegut and loses control of his own craft. I will not put this film as one of the best I've ever seen, but it stands on its feet as one worth watching. By releasing Vonnegut from the film's narrative or trying to include it wherever possible, Mother Night narrates his story brilliantly and keeps the key lessons of the story unambiguous, distracted, or disappointed.
