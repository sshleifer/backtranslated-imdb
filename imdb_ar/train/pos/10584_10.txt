"Footlight Parade" is superb on many levels. There is no way that a staged "introduction" can be produced in any stage on the ground, of course. Think of the huge pools and long three-storey fountains of "By A Waterfall", for example. (Berkley directed John Garfield in the film "He Made Me a Sinner" six years later, and he sang "Dead End" singing "Through a Waterfall" while taking their lawn.) <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lille" is the best production number in the picture . It's a 1930's Warner Bros. catalog. African men observed mixed at the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. You will never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of that period unless they are porters in a train or maids in a big house. Here black men sit in the bar and sing with others. I also get excited when the military dancers present the "cards section" on Roosevelt's picture. There is also the Eagle NRA - the controversial National Restoration Administration logo for the new deal. Franklin Roosevelt was the new president and his hopes were so great that he would have brought the nation out of recession. You will never see something directed at the working class coming out of the MGM, of course. Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the rise dictated by federal forces. Management. <br /> <br /> Dear Miss Robbie Keller was not better off playing for the Chinese bitch Lille. She barely sees her feet dancing, which was one of her distinctive flaws. <br /> <br /> Pre-Code is fun. No. "By the waterfall" is wonderful in this regard. The girls turn to their bathing suits on the busy bus that runs through Times Square and lights up all the lights. The eagle girl on the camera offers a kind of crotch that can not be seen 35 years ago. Within a few months the production code would eliminate these naughty pleasures.
