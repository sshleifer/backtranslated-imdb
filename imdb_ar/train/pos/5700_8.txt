I have read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on DVD. To be honest, I do not really know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a respectable murder mystery, showing from different perspectives, from an eccentric group of potential killers / suspects often, including the late late king, John Holmes. Please read the plot summary for the fine details of the film plot - I would like to contribute to a review over a summary. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have gone so far to give this film his lowest rating due to violence but I really do not see it. Many of the modern films were worse - the rescue of soldier Ryan was more violent than the film, which often relies on impenetrable blood stains from actual brutal killings (the murders filmed in this film were performed using lead tubes, later). <br /> <br /> I was struck by half the film - the first showing John Holmes as a desperate drug addict, the second half showing his side as a secondary conspirator in a meaningless bloodbath. The film has excellent representation, although Dylan McDemorant seems more than just a place in his riding personality and his evil young personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also fantastic - a wonderful mix of the 1970s on the B side and the mysterious rocks, spread over a few hours in all the right places, Boogie Nights.
