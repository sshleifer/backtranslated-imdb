If you're the kind of person looking for a realistic film or a movie with a strong and understandable plot, this is not for you. No - you hate her. However, for those who like nice comic films, you will have a fun time watching this light film. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall works for the US Tax Administration and is investigating a very nice farmer who has never realized the need to submit an income tax return. Although it is difficult to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is very pleased. They have spied on him and treated him as a member of the family ... and they have plans to bring him to his daughter Debbie Reynolds. This is really all about the plot there. But the film gets high marks for fun text and decent representation. A really nice little masterpiece from the late 1950s.
