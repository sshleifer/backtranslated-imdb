I completely enjoyed this right shape to take the character of Dick Tracey. This is a good product that used modern technology to craft a story of a comic era filled with pictures. If you are a fan or have recently watched some old Dick Tracy movies, you will definitely get a kick from this delivery. The pastel colors and the larger characters of life that were presented in an authentic and painstaking style in an age passed as entertainment as expected. Personally, I find Madonna's music a key part of this film - the CD that shows her music from this film is one of the things I've heard so much over the years. She has been well done and performed and tuned in with that era. In my opinion, Madonna's finest moments on the screen but in a musical way. Surely the "boy" stands out in you.
