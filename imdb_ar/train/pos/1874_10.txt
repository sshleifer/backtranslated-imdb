Everyone should see this movie because each one of us has been broken in some way and may help us realize 1) my life is not as bad as I thought and 2) how important is the adoption of a needy child. There are lots of there. To think that the film was actually based on a real person made us think deeply about life and how the world would be and will remain. Corrupt, but this corruption should not reach your home. We all have a choice! I definitely recommend this ... While you're in it, I want to throw "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Losed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all life-based films that give us a glimpse of life.
