If there is more skillful adaptation than this presence, you will not need to search for it; you'll find more and more in this almost perfect show of the Charlotte Bronte masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a film that would encourage me to read the novel on which it was based, but I admit it here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I did not miss much in the way of dialogue and plot or intensity and emotion. I would just like to explore the novel because of the great curiosity and passion that this masterpiece aroused within me. <br /> <br /> You do not need to reveal anything in the path of the plot here. Let me say this: If you are not sure whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is Jane Eyre, I do not doubt it! Every atom of power and magic that Jane Eyre has nurtured as a popular classic in English literature has been successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> Unless Bronte brings it, Clark and Dalton managed to translate into the spotlight with tremendous intensity. There is no doubt that the success of the film is due in large part to their ingenuity in acting. <br /> <br /> I love Jane Eyre or hate her, but appreciate the richness, vitality and truth of the story; I love the characters; I love the actors; all as you like what is wonderful in the cinema.
