It's a play, adapted for the screen. 95% of the film happens in the wonderful home of the playwright Sydney Bruhl (Michael Kane). He is the author of a wonderfully successful Broadway play, but his last four efforts have failed - horribly. <br /> <br /> The aspiring playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended a writing workshop by Sydney, sent him a copy of his play. Sydney tells his wife, Mira (Diane Cannon) that the play is wonderful - a successful blow. But is it good enough to die for? Time will tell us. <br /> <br /> An intelligent dialogue and many transformations and turns in the plot make the movie enjoyable from start to finish. The whole cast seemed to have a good time. It reminds us of the joy of Michael Keane's other fun: Sloth. worth watching. <br /> <br />
