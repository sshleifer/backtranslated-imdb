"There is little nonsense from time to time, cherished by the wisest wisdom." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, you are very intelligent to survive. <br /> <br /> Fabulous, fantastic hypothesis, an artifact prepared by the sharp eye for more details. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just great! <br /> <br /> He rented it, sat down, relaxed, took it, smiled a little. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Then, thank me.
