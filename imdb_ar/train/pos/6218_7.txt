79/100. Fred Astaire and Jinger Rogers have produced nothing but great films together. Although this is not one of their best, it is an excellent musician. There are a few notable musical numbers, and good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable features, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, offer memorable performances from the early screen. The ball is particularly good, and the blonde as well. "Let's face music and dance" is one of the best duo music figures ever. Harriet Hilliard, more known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" plays the role of sister Roger Ginger. The basic plot is very familiar, but with this extraordinary cast, it works. The direction of the art is excellent and the result.
