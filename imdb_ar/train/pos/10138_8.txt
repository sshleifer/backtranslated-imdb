Well it's time. I have given up everything and all hope that there will be a prominent ring between the entries this season. Although there are still too many entries of hohum, however, this episode has at least turned out well. It's funny that director Rob Schmidt, who has only the wrong mistake, turns to credit and author John Esposito, whose work has so far included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift, which should give us the best of books and the most provocative ideas of a season. In "The Right to Die", we dealt with the story of Cliff and Deer. At the beginning of the episode the couple are having a conversation. Cliff Cloiff caught cheating and he desperately tries to win her back. While talking, they found themselves in a car accident where she left Cliff with only scratches and bruises, but my father was thrown out of the car and caught fire when it ignited a spark and caught the gasoline that dried on her face. This is just a people setup. Once you get to the hospital, Cliff must decide whether Abbey should live in this condition without skin or nerve reactions. There is also a side effect as well. Every time flat lines go, Abbey walks like a ghost and causes problems for all kinds of people. This is the best episode of the season, and certainly one of the best episodes ever. From the heinous effects to the taut text that made several transformations, I have never seen so moving and exciting that you can almost touch them, Right To Die must have the right to live forever.
