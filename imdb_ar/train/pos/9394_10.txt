"Red Rock West" was away from one of the best thriller novels of the 1990s with a wonderful film line (by John and Rick Dahl) that kept your guess across the edge of the film on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. John Dal made it brilliantly and saw a wonderful selection of actors such as Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, T. Walsh (in an unforgettable performance), making this exciting and exciting story not to be missed. The film did not have much publicity at all (in fact it was first caught on television), so it is one of those special little gems you should look for but this unique film slowly acquires a cult of followers. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is Michael Williams who broke up when he found himself in the small town of Red Rock. Wrong because of the contract killer named Lyle of Dallas, he was shocked to be offered $ 10,000 to kill the wife of the bar owner Wayne Brown (excellent GT Walsh). He plays along with the plan and decides that Susan Brown's wife (Lara Flynn Boyle) must go and warn. But then the plot intensifies and there are a lot of twists, turns and surprises - and the double deals - that Cage is brought from crisis to crisis and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation Can not get himself out of it! Then just to complicate things further, Lyle shows up to do the real contract murder (played by Dennis Hooper's favorite of all). When Hopper discovers what happened, Cage is pursued but no one can see the sudden events that followed. <br /> <br /> Some of the favorite lines of the film: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman hurt but a lot of money." <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): "Michael Williams Well, Michael, you'll spend some time with us until we get down to this." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "Are not you a murderer?" Cage: "It's true, no, but the guy who's supposed to be just riding into the city, so you have to get out of here." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "Well, how are you? Will I explain the impersonation of a hired assassin and take $ 10,000 from my husband?" <br /> <br /> An unusually amusing thriller (only 98 minutes) with a story that never lets you behave and is strong by all school principals. A film featuring J. T. Walsh is O.K. In my book and Red Rock West was one of his best. It was sad that the life of this extraordinary actor was tragically shortened by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period in Noir was undoubtedly the 1940s, but Red Rock West is a good modern example of this genre and jumped straight into the " Top Ten "in all my favorite movies. I look forward to more of this from director John D.. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
