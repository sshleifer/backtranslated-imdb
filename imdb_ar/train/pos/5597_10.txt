"Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is undoubtedly one of the most important horror films ever produced. Polanski stars play Trelkovsky, a shy file writer living in Paris, answering an apartment ad, just to find that the former tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the apartment. Talkovsky has to visit her in the hospital and there he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Torkovski immediately moves when the former tenant dies, and is pleased at first found such a nice apartment. This happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia because it becomes increasingly suspicious of its neighbors, who are apparently trying to provoke Trilkovsky to repeat the suicide of the former tenant. This movie is awesome. An atmosphere of dread and madness of greatness. Lots of wonderful moments like the classic scene where Tilkowski discovers the age of the former tenant in a hole in the wall, or a fever dream where he walks around the bathroom building to find the walls covered with hieroglyphs. The filming of Sven Nikvist is really beautiful. "Tenant" neglected gem. It may be difficult to track, but it is worth more than effort.
