I went to see Ashura in 2005 starting a fantasy festival. Man, that one cold kick was off. The director was supposed to be in Montreal to attend the premiere of Canada, but for health reasons, he is still in Japan ... Lord, I hope he will improve and make a lot of other films. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple, but somewhat original ... The demons roam Edo in Japan, and the dudes named "demon watchers" kill them and fear the birth of Ashura, the goddess of Satan who sleeps and is supposed to kick a big one. <br /> <br /> He leads us to Izumo ... a kind of elite duel called "Demon Killer" and his friend Jaku who is a violent and foolish asshole. <br /> <br /> It seems boring? Well, it is now thick ... <br /> <br /> Izumu retired from killing demons because he killed a young boy "on the impression" that he was a demon, he never knew, but was not killed. Izumo continued his life and recycle himself at Kabuki Theater. On a boat ride on a beautiful night, Izumo discovered a girl hiding on a bridge and changed his life and turned it back to slaughter demons ... for a good cause, cause love ... and fuck ... man knows how to handle sword and pull amusing massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo holds the movie as far as the game goes ... it's the full package ... he knows how to fight (hell yes knows), he's clever, he's smart and he has that grit. You do not ever have to shout: "Do not Izumu, it's a trap." The man already knows he has this common sense. He is truly the ideal hero. <br /> <br /> With regard to cinematography, aesthetic aspects are very interesting. It's a movie that looks more like a manga. It is full of special effects and nothing, at any price, will prevent this film from appearing realistic ... It is very amazing. Many of the colors are "unrealistic", otherwise ... it is clear and direct ... but as I said, the main character is the "A" movie to be seen, a wise story with brilliant hands
