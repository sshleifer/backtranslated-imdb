Over Her Dead Body was a nice little film. I've been fit and fun, while it's still very funny. There were a few cliches, but I found most fresh things. At first I did not think it would be good at all, when the show starts. If you can skip the first 20 minutes, the film begins to get more attention. This movie did not explode with laughter, and OH MY GOSH was not great. It was just a movie that you can sit back and enjoy. I do not see how bad this film was. Its rating is a little too low. I dealt with version 5.5, but also version 4.8? 1 is outrageous. It was very good and there was nothing terrible enough to give it 1, which is what most people gave.
