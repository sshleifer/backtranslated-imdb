This is very exciting! After watching "La Roue" this afternoon, a short short-hearted film, I consider this movie a real pleasure! This is very delightful and one of the most charming pictures I have seen this year. It is more amazing than an early modern and puts some great pictures of the 1930s for shame because of its innovative use of sound in cinema. It's simply full of music and a really optimistic vogue and in the end, made me happy! Obviously, it would not be too hard to retrieve the lottery ticket that male bullets were looking for, but the pace is very exhilarating and the film is so enjoyable that I did not think twice about it. Comedy is gay several times and I think it is superior to the Marx Brothers, perhaps the greatest comic power of the time. This is fairly perfect.
