This movie is really wonderful. Everything looks like it came out of the comic book. Groups, fashion, the plot is great. Clark Bartram is once again our favorite Batman. Looked a little better at a dead end, but he still pulls it. Superman is very great. The effects of flying are fine. But in the movie fan so we do not expect them to be the greatest. The shot with Superman catching the car was very reasonable. that was awesome. It's a movie I'll definitely see if it's real. You've got everything you want in Batman / Superman. One exception though, I would throw the joker instead of two sides ..... Overall I give this movie 10 because it's a wonderful movie
