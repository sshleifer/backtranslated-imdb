Kolchak is a huge entertainment. Wonderful stories, wonderful staff and nothing else. Darren McGavin presents an active show that attracts the audience. Simon Oakland, Jack Greenage and Ruth McDoufft give McGovern some kind of strong support that most key actors can not dream of. Some outstanding guest stars add color and modernity to individual episodes - Eric Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Rovers in Heights, and Antonio Vargas in The Zombies. It's easy to see how a child spent watching Kolchak led Chris Carter to create X. Daren-RIP files. Simon - ripped off. Ruth - Ripped.
