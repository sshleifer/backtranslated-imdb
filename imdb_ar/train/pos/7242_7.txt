It seemed that 1933 was a wonderful year for spelling ("duck soup" for example) and this fits well although it is a mania with a contract bridge. The tone is like a comic strip from The New Yorker, where the film begins with the "Goings On About Town" page. The only strange thing is casting. A few years later, William Powell and Mirna Lui were idealists. However, after 1934, she did not have to deal with adultery in this sophisticated way, or young and beautiful Loretta Young in some clothes cut and quiet, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on the radio. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you may still want to see a rare example of Hollywood satire.
