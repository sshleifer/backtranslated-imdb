I saw this movie with a group of friends, and although only two of us came out of the cinema thinking how wonderful it was, the others laughed and commented on how stupid he was. Well, because it was not supposed to be taken seriously, it's basically a film that makes fun of the terror of horror and does a damn good job .. There seems to be another film to be released like this, or ... Scary Movie ?? Well this is Australian, the original! Jessica Napier performs superbly while Sarah Kanas has a bright future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kayley was a better move. The impossible princess was the queen of the screen !! I recommend watching this, as you will guess until the end with Raffy, Hilary and The Movie, which is not over 20 years ago.
