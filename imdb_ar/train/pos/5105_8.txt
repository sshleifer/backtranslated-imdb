How can anyone argue with the fact that Urban Cowboy was and still is the best document about the life of Texas during the time period. Consider the following: Men beat their wives, then drank in bars at night, married to settle fighting, commit adultery, and compete for mechanical bulls. Try to name a movie that depicts real life clearly. They do not make them anymore. The current films seem to revolve around people with a lot of money, living in huge houses, driving expensive cars and not working. This movie features a festive scene about getting a video for pete! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watch it at least once a week. No kidding. This film has been dissected from end to end. Feel free to email me to learn more about why my documentary was called. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sisi - split - he knocks and waves amicably, his flying flutter - returns half of the sign of peace consecrates his horn to add an effect and then cries. Mom's sprouts almost call him. After 18 hours of arriving in the city, on Sunday, to see if he has a job yet - all he has accomplished is to fill and put (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt who cover him. <br /> <br /> "You live like a pig" Think about why this scene is needed. think about it. Was it necessary? Can not we figure it out without showing a dirty sink? God loved it! <br /> <br /> Cisse allows Wes to help her ride the bull. Just a few days (or maybe the next day) after Wes just expelled her husband's crap. Steve asks - Cissie, remember Wes? Oh yes, the pain overcame my husband the other night, so let's get this lesson, so do not mention the fact that she is seeking solace later during the battles of Buds and Sisi numerous, which happens by the way in public places - in Gilley's! <br /> <br /> For wedding pictures taking a hearing (oh humanity!) can at least arrange or move the chairs off the road. "Legs of Luggage" <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not put scenes like this in a movie to try to show insight into human psychology. It is a documentary about real life. <br /> <br /> I just hope there's a cut for the director ....
