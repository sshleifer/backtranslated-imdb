Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest movies, one of those movies I think you are more valued than the older you. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic novel. I consider that the film was his greatest film at the time of its release. The characters became more distant than the previous films, creating a deeper depth for the appreciation of the characters more. In my opinion, Cinderella is one of the greatest characters Disney has ever made. With her kindness and rush of dry humor, she is very beloved; however, this is the source of inspiration that makes her memorable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer, adhering to her dreams, and never giving up. Even in the strongest of situations, her dreams last, and will not let anyone take them away from them. Its example should be a source of inspiration for all, and to encourage never to give up your dreams.
