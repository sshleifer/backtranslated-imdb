When the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned its existence and identity, many films were expected to be used as inspiration. This did not happen, surprisingly, and it took the same kind of film to appear in 2002. But to say that Cypher is a clone will discredit her. <br /> <br /> The story is about Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for a job at a techno-tech company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company, while under assumed and fake identity. His home life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he is already doing. However, things start to split and plot and before he knows what is going on, he begins to question who he actually is. This does not help a wonderful woman who appears ... <br /> <br /> The twists and turns in every direction make you very fascinated, and nothing at all seems so enthralling or unreasonable. <br /> <br /> It is a fascinating journey through a not-too-distant future, and with good conduct, every tour will make you at the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
