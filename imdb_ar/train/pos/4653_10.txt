It's an annoying British comedy film and I can watch it over and over again without fatigue. Peter Ostinov did not play a bad role, this is no exception, especially with his dry plan but his main plan is very smart. Carl Malden has always been mine-impressed since he starred in "The Streets of San Francisco". I think Maggie Smith is the real star of this film, even though she seems to be incompetent in everything she tries to do but actually runs, especially when she tells everyone she invested so much money that she discovered while washing his clothes. There's one thing that interests me, can someone tell me why I can not buy this on any DVD or VHS format in the UK, can someone help?
