After reading the book, I took this DVD in Wal-Mart for $ 3 and thought, Sure, what the hell ... I got a DVD and watched it last night. When I started watching it, I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, well ... It seemed rather slow, knowing the story and how much it was. By the time I reached the actual killing, I was like, "How long did this stay?" Verification. "One minute? What the hell ?!" I felt incredibly cheated, believing that the film had only advanced through a third of the total story. <br /> <br /> But then, I happily noted that the DVD scene selection menu included one part and part 2. He had another hour and a half to go! Then I sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the film, more than the first one. <br /> <br /> I admit I have not seen the original film of 1967 (despite my sincere desire to do so), I have but read the novel and I felt that this was a fairly genealogy film, for television miniseries of two parts, that is. I think Perry's choice of role was completely wrong and that some minor contradictions have jumped in my face, but it is still good. The first half continues slightly, while the second half controls more. I think they should have adapted to the film even more like Capote made his book: 1/3 before the murder, 1/3 after, and 1/3 after the arrest of the killers. Instead, the film makes it more than half before the murder, 1/4 after, and 1/4 after the capture of the killers. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time, less convincing while making the first half go and go ... <br /> <br /> Now look back and realize that I made the same mistake in making things go on and on, So I'll close the hell. Go to watch the movie and spend your damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
