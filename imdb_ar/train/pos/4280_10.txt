A group of people travel to Belgrade on a terrible bus driven by a drunk conductor and his stupid son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their trip often stops because of the many fun events that cynically describe the spirit of the nation in 1941 and are so funny that they are still used today as common slogans. The man who "steals the show" is a four-foot farmer with his four sons nearly twice as large. In the end, the film takes a dramatic turn and the journey becomes just a swan song for a dying country.
