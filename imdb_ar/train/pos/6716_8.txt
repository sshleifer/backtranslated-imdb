More recently, the famous film director, "First Row," which excels in the ZZ program, has excelled at excellence with this amazing comic-thrilling comedic action that ridicules the bleak and delicious depths of the sheer and stupid absurdity of celluloid. In the gloomy future of the year 2047, sex was considered illegal by a great idiot of high-pitched zealots (Erroyo Abelin Fuller). However, Cinderella still sweet'n'sexy (the blonde cutie pie Catherine Erhardt) is determined to change things for the better. With the help of the Fairy Godfather, Cinderella is preparing a big ball with a specific plan to seduce the Dorky Vaughn Armstrong and teaching everyone who makes love is positive, a pleasurable and totally acceptable activity. <br /> <br /> Adamson directs these ridiculous lines with his usual incompetence from all the thumb, arranging the incredible sequence of the song and dance with a lack of skill and taste. The very "we all need love" number with people dressed in the fashion of absurd animals floundering strangely from the jungle is a very awesome marvel. As previously routine "mechanical man" abhorrent on par with a group of clumsy cavorting robots. Louis Harfarth's unique photography, his miniature plastic statuette, Sparky Sogerman's discordant nudity, heavy naked shame (Hottie, a charming brunette Sherry Cowell worthy of special praise in this particular section), and amazing child-centered brainwashing. Law enforcement in a particularly troublesome robot), and the monstrous performances (filmed by Rene Harmon, who is horrified by the mother of the wicked evil paternal aunt who wins the Big Booty Award here) further enhance the astonishingly abundant joy to enjoy in this delicious and horrible dupe.
