This film is such a cowardly goodness. <br /> <br /> A group of people trapped in a deserted school. They began to kill, and they know they are being hunted, what are they doing? One of the girls decides to take a bath, while another girl decides to cheat on her husband (who is also there) with her old boyfriend until she somehow finds beds (in a deserted old school?) And goes to her. <br /> <br /> Comes with Gore and T & A. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting historically / socially. When the usual slasher of the 1980s is a reflection of how we look at ourselves, how adults look at young people, or, as Hollywood sees in the rest of the country, this has a unique view. This is a British film made to be a vulgar American. It is funny to see how often British actors who try to speak "American" unintentionally retreat to their dialects in the UK. <br /> <br /> If you like cheese skewers 80 (like pieces) you will like this.
