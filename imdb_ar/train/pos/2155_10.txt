Accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) is bored of his routine life, confined to hard work and staying at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and his teenage daughter. One night, while he was traveling by train to the house, he saw the beautiful face of Tamiyo Kusakari on the balcony of a dance school. Two days later, he decided to visit the school and secretly take dance lessons every Wednesday night. However, he is ashamed to tell his family his secret. At the same time, Masako feels changes in the behavior of her husband Saad, and has appointed a special eye to see if Shouhi has an affair. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching "Shall We Dansu?" I really liked it. What a beautiful and fun movie! The story is surprisingly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The actors are excellent, and I was particularly impressed by the cool beauty and generosity of the director Masayuki Su's wife and the professional ballet dancer Tamio Kusakari. On September 6, I saw the new American version, "Should we Dansu?" For the first time, I found it enjoyable fun. But now I can say that it is an unnecessary remake, I recommend this original film instead. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dan√ßa Comigo?" ("dance with Me?")
