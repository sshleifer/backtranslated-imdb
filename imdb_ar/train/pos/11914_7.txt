You know, this movie is not great, but I mean, come on, it's about the Angels helping the baseball team. I find the plot line to be a joy anyway, my father says that he will return it if the angels win the flag (because he knows they will not). The child prays to his false God to help the angels to win, and helps God all the time (through the Archangel Christopher Lloyd, RIP). In the end, his father does not return him and goes on his motorcycle directly in the face of that children. It's fun to be adopted by Danny Glover and her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> I think the upside is that the old lady left alone to die with her sting projects and stories. The real winner here, though, is God. Because he later got a job as a writer in several joke programs. <br /> <br /> As a child's film, he gets 7. As a film about the mysteries of the blind blind faith and the nature of "God", he gets 10.
