Even if you are not a fan of Ramones, Rock 'N' Roll High School is still * * the greatest rock and roll movie. why? Because in all wars, it is treated with respect to the feeling of despised and obnoxious adolescents (often justified) in the boring, stupid and corrupt adult world. This latest scene is one of the most glorious and luxurious final scenes of a film I've ever seen. "Mine eyes have seen glory ..." Rock and Roll! <br /> <br />
