Barman only wanted to make a film because he wanted it. As simple as that, it succeeded. Not only in his goal, but also in making a wonderful film, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow motion sequences, tracking shots, slingshots, etc. in a beautiful and smooth way. This film gives a very comfortable feeling. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the lives of 8 completely different characters that have nothing in common but one thing: a party they all attend, and it is also the turning point of this film. The beauty of this picture is not the question of how the characters affect each other (compared to a similar film, of course better like Magnolia). I simply do not think this was the idea of ​​a barman. Beauty lies in the various details of the experiences that people go through and which make or cut their lives. Barman is very successful in recounting those little stories that describe small experiences. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, but it is no surprise that we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his dEUS band. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, contributing to the feel of the sunny and smooth film. At other times, we hear non-traditional pop / rock tones that give some scenes the power they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one drawback, the last half of the hour. Was it run-time, which was ruining me? Or were not the last scenes new and accurate from the scenes until then? I can not tell it ... <br /> <br /> All in all a beautiful sunny movie lifts Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! It is the breeze that flows through the girl's hair in the sunny afternoon making it more beautiful; it is the fresh breeze that makes you relax when you pass through a crowded party when someone opens the door; it is the breeze that carries the fragrance From that beautiful girl who sits next to you in the garden I just met a week ago; it's the breeze .....) <br /> <br />
