The distortion is the film that struck me somewhat ... a kind of multi-layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right now. To be more concise, he feels that his wife is betraying him, so he rents private eyes to snoop on him. His wife had no idea that this was happening. In the meantime, the actors in this play also have a few boxes that are flooded with tampering with each other and, as we say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. Everything culminates in the theater with all the actors present and happens (but not really) predictable. <br /> <br /> The widget manager keeps things really moving with the set of characters, and the adjustments in a way make you pay attention, it's a really fun movie, I did not think of watching it and recommended it.
