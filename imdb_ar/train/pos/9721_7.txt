How to lose friends and alienate people from a decent comedy with a little romantic approach. <br /> <br /> It is actually the story of Liddy Young (Simon Beige) who discovers in the field of writing newspapers and magazines and is interpreted in a funny way. Simon Pegg had a beautiful, worse than usual appearance. The movie is not joyful or funny along the way or anything like that, but it has its moments, and those moments are really fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and worth watching the English comedy cream for all the people who just want to sit back, relax and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you are about to watch this movie with a critical approach, you should only pass if you want to be disappointed and start putting it.
