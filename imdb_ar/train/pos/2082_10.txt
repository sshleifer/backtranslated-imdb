I first read the brilliant Pearl S Buck novel in my ninth-grade class, and I enjoyed every exciting page. It was almost inevitable to cling to Hollywood, and since it was done in 1937, the results were excellent. <br /> <br /> Some things must be accepted: In 1937 there was no doubt in the selection of Asian actors in the big Hollywood movie. In a way that makes this final product somewhat more interesting than if they were able to use a more realistic looking team. <br /> <br /> With this hurdle to be overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sydney Franklin (among others) took the trouble of picking out a fantastic hand and throwing stars. Paul Muni plays Wang Long. Mony was at the height of his powers as an actor during this period and could play almost anything. Once you skip the make-up (it's a good thing, but no one really misses it for a Chinese man), his performance is all about his best. <br /> <br /> Then there is Louis Reiner. After winning the Oscar last year for her performance at The Great Ziegfeld, the star of the Viennese actress was on the rise and got the plum role for O'Hall though she lacked experience in Hollywood. Her performance won the Oscar for the second consecutive, the first time in history that has occurred. <br /> <br /> Much criticism has been directed at Rainer's performance, winning an Oscar here. It was called a wooden one note. There is a little grain of truth in it. However, what is being said, all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, though not a Chinese, she played the role of O-lan as written by Buck. It's actually a great performance, and one of the best conversions from one book to another. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, this was MGM. They had the biggest list of stars and representatives of Hollywood personalities at the time, a big budget to pay for the best, and in the end they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film eases Wang Long's marriage from Ya Lan to some extent. In the novel, with wealth comes lusts of the flesh and takes concubine, a step that destroys his wife but her feelings as a woman does not interest him. In the film, one of the runners, Wang Long, returns to his wife on her deathbed, the two arms he took from her previous years, realizing too late that she was his real love. <br /> <br /> Corney, yes. But this is Hollywood. Given the obstacles they faced, the film may have opened up to laughter. But, despite the remarkable lack of real Asians in the team, the film has been surprisingly good for seventy-three years. In fact, the most surprising thing about this film is how good it is, when it is easily disastrous.
