Oh my God ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This movie takes you on a wonderful journey and you are not allowed to leave until the final blow to your face. This is a movie for Stormriders fans as well. Legend of Zu was created beautifully, although I did not like some things, but they used a lot of add-ons. I wanted to see the real person fighting, but ... well, a few small times, I did not like much until I saw her again, when she understood her more, she was kick A **! I encourage anyone who wants to watch a real Asian movie to watch this movie. Give this movie one of the highest ratings. See him when he comes out in America !!!
