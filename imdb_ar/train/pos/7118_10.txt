It's a classic 1940s classic film that was well produced. There are very interesting scenes in this film with John Garfield, (The Shame), "The Power of Evil," 48, and Dane Clark, (Lee Diamond), "Last Rituals," 88, fighting Japan during World War II surrounded and with only one machine gun. When Schmidt was able to return home after suffering a terrible injury, his problems initially began with his family and his broken girlfriend. Dane Clark gave a leading supporting role like Lee Diamond, who did everything to help Al team reunite again. There is never a complete victory for the war and we do not forget all the brave wounded army personnel in veterans' hospitals of all wars and current veterinarians in Iraq!
