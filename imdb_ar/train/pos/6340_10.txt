First, explain what makes the movie great for me. The excitement of not knowing what will happen next will make me enjoy the movie the first time I watch (case en point: Twister). There are other things in the great premiere like Good Luck (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), a good plot with good accuracy (Madeline and Matilda), fairy tales (all Star Wars-George Lucas episodes are men) Good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, sound of music). What makes me watch a film at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS? Characters. However, the oldest Cindy Lo of Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest were very good actors, especially Jeffrey Tambour, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baransky and Josh Ryan Evans. But, each one scene with Cindy and The Grinch - combined is excellent, very funny and / or sad. Cindy Lo is my favorite character in this film, and the most compelling reason is that the film is better than animation. Grinch contains a strong scheme, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can not start because I do not want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very funny like The Grinch - especially when he interacted with Cindy. And music! Wonderful! Excellent music for James Horner. I loved his choice of musical instruments and compositions. Very good work Jim Carrey - I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Stop! Your voice is enough reason to watch the movie at least once. Solo - Where Are You Christmas - Is Your Voice Really High As It Seems? Sounds like F #? This is an obscenity for a 7-year-old (obscene means best). great work. This is the best performance for a child I've heard about in a movie (Taylor won the movie Von Trapp Children - It's not easy!). Now to the actors. Jim Carrey was amazingly funny, funny and very sensitive (he showed up with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unambiguous expressions (one of the secrets of good performance in acting) are very strong, as Cindy Lo has become a real who. And when the dialogue becomes stronger. <br /> <br /> ******************************** Danger: Alert the spoiler ******** ************* *************************** ********** ********************************** <br /> <br /> Examples: Expression when you see The Grinch first Once. This is a classic quote ("You are the" and then filled with the Green Line "Da da da Grinch" - and then turned to the screening and saved by The Greenwich). Thank you for saving "The quote and subsequent response by The Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film is when Cindy The Grinch calls it Holiday Cheermeister. Between them Little Taylor talks Mumsen about herself completely with Jim Carrey in this place, and I sincerely hope to see Taylor Momsen in many upcoming films, and everything was wonderful in this film (except perhaps the feet and noses).
