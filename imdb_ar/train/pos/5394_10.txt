I was very touched by this series from the moment that Tom Long entered into a shot - everything the "evil boy" all was just an addiction. <br /> <br /> The story you linked, what will happen next - Joey will make the girl in the end, after spending five years in prison, all this time thinking about his lost love, crossing her ways with her again, and finding that he has a son. .. Although he is a violent bad man, only you still want to find happiness. <br /> <br /> A two really captivating parter - please take it out on video!
