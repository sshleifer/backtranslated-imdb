This game is great! Well, maybe he did not have some features that were supposed to be out but Digital Anvil still made a good game. There is a certain resemblance to Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons, ship from destroyers, and do missions), but this game has a great written mission. It's a wonderful job. Different control system uses the mouse! You fly basically to the spaceship around the system and work your way! The game features some good graphics even by making it in 2003. It should work well even on a modestly defined computer. The story has some brilliant sounds from John Reese Davis, George Takey and Jennifer Hill (appearing in every computer game). The stick with the story is constantly improving and evolving. There is also a race section, where you and your opponent must race your spaceships around a training course (including passing through rings). This section took me some time to win. Adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit tricky here and there but you can generally overcome this game. The game has an active mod scene on the net. Pick up some adjustments to expand the game. I have not played any of the adjustments yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the complement to this has been canceled, shame!
