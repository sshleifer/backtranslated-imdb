I have read many comments on this site and criticized The Blob for being cheesy and / or in a camp. The movie was wrong due to amateur acting and weak special effects. What do you expect from a group of people whose only experience was producing low-budget Valley Forge PA. Let me tell those critics who are overly critical that this film has not taken itself so seriously. This fact must be clear from the theme music mismatch complete with silly words played on the opening credits. What was supposed to be, this movie is excellent. I've seen some very few budget attempts, and Blair's charming project was one of those projects, which has no value for entertainment or clever thinking behind their plot. BWP was pure stools. Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well written and absolutely entertaining. The scene where the old man meets the meteor and proves the mass inside the stick was executed in a wonderful and truly creepy. The scene in the doctor's office with Blob was moving slowly under the blanket in the genie while the old man was consuming a cinematic horror masterpiece. Bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone there to take $ 120,000.00, overpriced for the dollar today, and created a movie anywhere near entertainment or as successful as Blob. It can not be done only. interval! <br /> <br /> Thanks for spending some time reading this review.
