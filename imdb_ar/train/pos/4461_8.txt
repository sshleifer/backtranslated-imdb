I really liked this movie. I've seen many clicks from Kelly Jen and this is one of his best. In fact, I will put it above the most famous American in Paris. It sometimes seems that the story is lost in Jane Kelly's movies because of the dance numbers and wonderful songs, but not in this film. Definitely worth a lease.
