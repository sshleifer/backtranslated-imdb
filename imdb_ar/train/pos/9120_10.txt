This film speaks in a universal language. One can relate it to one's own, society, society or the wider world. It is not only a way to open many questions but also to put a question in order to discover and ask the right questions to reach the point of conviction / ownership. The portrayal of stereotypes within the film deals with prototypes around us that must be recognized as the repetitive cycle of repetition, and the opposing force of innovation, creativity and growth. Factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be made clear and processed. Idea is definitely a film that is tried and not seen just because it senses the inner voice / conscience of the person through the appearance, it makes you feel like you are opposed to seeing only.
