As is known among the long-haired young people who are incredibly interested in the quiet hustle and bustle of Herr Graf, during the summer the aristocrats love to travel to exclusive and distinct places in order to avoid heat as well as hordes of coarse people take easily. Such a strange world is also happening in the Three Ages, a charming and elegant piece of silent action directed by the old hands, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Harry Eddie Klein. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this German number loved more the first part focused on the Stone Age because of the rapprochement felt by this aristocrat at that time old. This preference is for the second part that occurs during the glory of Rome (it should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, ie the barbarians, or the same, the Germans). Of course, the third part is performed during the modern era, but this Tutsi aristocrat believes that even 100 years ago should be eligible for a modern. <br /> <br /> The dominant movement that drives Keith Keaton and his companions to travel and carry strange and joyful events during three different ages is to find love, a very complex subject for understanding aristocrats who prefer to search for money and personal interests. Every time we play "The Three Ages" at the Schloss Theater, we are always happy to watch a funny and funny silent film (even for a serious German number), a film full of muzzles, tools, pictorials, pratfalls, acrobatics, Absolute silent parameters are ideal for allowing one to withstand the harsh and harsh summer intensity. <br /> <br /> Now, if you allow me, I must take my leave temporarily because this German Count must be flirting with an old Tuton heir who does not look like her age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
