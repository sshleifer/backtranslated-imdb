Another one of these brilliant young men who did their best and made a romantic film in the teen age (can I actually call it? - Satan will evoke his fans) with a small budget but packed with this taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett - You deserve more admiration and respect. Thanks again for showing the forces in the "industry" that stereotypes can be removed in the toilet. One site, a bunch of rich characters, low budget, good disposition (this is also amateur), decent lighting - genuine independent filmmakers must watch this and watch the STOP ... well ... you know what.
