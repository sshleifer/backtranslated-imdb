This is what the film should have when trying to capture the essence of what is very surreal. It contains the blurry color that is rarely captured in the film, it looks like a sequence of dreams and really moves you into a dark memory. The children were very acceptable and I expected some things to come from them in the future. Very natural for such little ones, I do not know whether Bill has taken it out or not, but that's not good. Bill recorded as much as I care and for the comment made by KevNJeff about Mr. Paxtons bad behavior, what one can do in this role. The role played well in my opinion. This comes from someone who said that Hamlet was good (Ethan Hawk version?) F. ......... Do not listen to his comments. Big flick to make you feel really uncomfortable, if that's what you want? Cinematography gets the highest average rating as well.
