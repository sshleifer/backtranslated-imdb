The performance of Noni Hazlehurst in the power cancellation tour (which won the AFI award) is at least equal to its efforts at FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni, and Michael Caton (the most famous artist in the castle) is a forgiving painter. (It is also interesting that Hazlehurst is currently host of the BETTER HOMES and GARDENS lifestyle program, and Katon is a group of real estate programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, ETC ...). This film reinforces the belief that Noni was arguably the largest actress in Australia during the 1980s to the mid-1980s. Rating: 79/100.
