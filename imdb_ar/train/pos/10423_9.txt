Yes, my love is the rise of Mario Lanza to fame and still popular today. His voice was strong and steady, very strong indeed, where MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself believed that he embodied Caruso. After reading the book Kostelanitz who wrote the biography of Lanza, demonstrates that the continuous practice and voice lessons have become a visionary Caruso to Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a great job in the story, but the story is not quite right; blame Hollywood! I used to practice singing on his songs for years and became well myself until I lost my voice due to the swelling of asthma / asthma ten years ago. Getting to the high tone of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
