I did not write a review on IMDb for the longest time, however, I felt compelled to write this! When searching for this film, I found one particular review urging people not to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! Nothing is a wonderful movie, full of laughter and above all ... Fantasy! Do not you feel tired and tired from feeding you the same old cycle of bubble dust movies? Sometimes a movie like "Nothing" comes and gives you something you've never seen before. I do not care even if you hate (even hate) the movie, but no one has the right to discredit the film. IMDb has a tremendous impact on reputation and there is no negative review that should distort such a film. Just say that you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people that they should not watch it. We have our own minds and we will shape our minds. Thank you. <br /> <br /> If I appreciate it, I would say that more people will enjoy this film than those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat your mind with a little candy! I see nothing!
