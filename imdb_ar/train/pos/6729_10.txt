If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or were interested in seeing the "real American" side of America, the Giants Ride will be deeper than anything I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is "unrealistic", an easy term if ever, but highly appropriate if you can devise any form of literal meaning from it - it's a 100% realistic documentary, but with every drama The opera, with a clear sense of love, expertise and knowledge that engulfs the direction and narrative of Stacey Peralta, brings you experience from bulge to great waves while keeping you fully entertained with all the privilege of watching. <br /> <br /> This film is a symphony, made in addition to the Beethovens 9, and began beautifully with an introduction to Hawaii, deeply daring to human feelings in Santa Cruz and ended with a fuss, a triumph and a stirring of Laird Hamiltons' exploits, Hawaii. Like classical music, such as the ninth Beethoven, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it deserves it. Trust me.
