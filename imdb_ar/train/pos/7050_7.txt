I do not want to spend too much time here roaming around the plot - I've seen the trailer, if you are not online. I do not recommend seeing it even though it was badly prepared and did not pack any laughter or magic from the film. So those who avoid this movie because of the bad trailer should give this opportunity. It's really funny. It exploded with intelligence and originality in this film. My first 40 minutes on hysterical ground - my only problem was that the film had evolved unnecessarily into a bad Austin Powers movie in the last 20 years. But this is one of the few films that did not finally make me finish the rest of the film (which is usually the case). Gives everyone a great performance (especially Joan Kusak) and there are some really wonderful moments. I personally plan to see it again when it comes out - just to discover all the details I was laughing at during the first viewing!
