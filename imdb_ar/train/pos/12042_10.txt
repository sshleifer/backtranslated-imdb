.............. as I was when I saw this movie) I will never see this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me a lot! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show it to us; it was because we had read a snippet of the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were intimidated when a "woman in black" came out of the window and floated over Kidd's bed, though, before there was something we were too afraid of when he found a soldier's kid under the pillow and he heard A child's voice says "It's for you." This scene still haunts me to this day, after about 7 years of watching the film. <br /> <br /> If you are easily scared, avoid this movie !!!!!!!!
