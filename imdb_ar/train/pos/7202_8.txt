Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (almost 23 years ago), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men enthusiastically kiss on the screen. Frankly, I was shocked. I understood this in terms of the plot, and my feelings did not really bother me (not much), but it was the first time I saw her, at least, in the film "Main." I thought it was a brave step for her time, and encouraged them to experience her, especially Christopher Reeve, in the midst of his career as PG superman. The male bisexual on the screen may have come a long way with "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note this incarnation which was early.
