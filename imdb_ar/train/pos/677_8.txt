**** Throughout Australia, summer has turned into a flood of rain and cold stones the size of base balls that have caused chaos in coastal cities like Sydney. Under these hectic circumstances, tax attorney David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, was involved in a case as a defense lawyer, including the death of an indigenous citizen found dead outside the Sydney Bar. <br /> <br /> After the arrest of five of his native colleagues because of Billy Kurman, Athul Compton, the death of a forensic doctor determines that Billy died of drowning not because of violence, although he had bruises on his neck and shoulders. However, the court decided to sue the five for his death on charges of manslaughter instead of murder. <br /> <br /> David, who defends the five, does not get any help from them in defending them by choosing the accused attackers to stay completely and keep what happened to Billy for themselves and take what will come to them from the court. One of the defendants, Chris, David Golbili, begins somehow to invade David's dreams as if he wanted to tell him what was really behind Billy's death. <br /> <br /> At first David did not take his dreams in Chris seriously in this real sense when meeting him in the courtroom. Chris assures David's dreams by showing him a strange black rock that David saw in his dreams. Later he met Chris, and it turned out that he was an indigenous Shaman, Charlie (Nandjwarna Amgola) who came home that evening. David was told that he enjoyed, like Charlie, spiritual powers inherited from his mother's grandfather. Will reveal to him those future forces that have to do with the strange weather conditions flooding the Australian continent. Chris David tells us that the earth is undergoing a period of great cleansing, although the ancient world is about to be washed and the new world is ready to take its place. <br /> <br /> David is confused about what Chris and Charlie are suffering. But as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves rise, they feel that something terrible will happen. David wants to know whether this is all folklore or whether there are some scientific facts, or logic, behind the end of something like the world. <br /> <br /> It is now clear that Chris and Charlie are members of an indigenous tribe. Right in the heart of modern Sydney. This alone can get Chris, in addition to his four friends, because of Billy's death. Since the Australian government will not try tribal indigenous people, leaving any justice done by the tribes themselves. Chris still refuses to admit that he is a member of an indigenous tribe and he and his four friends were convicted of manslaughter in the death of Billy with the judge's verdicts within days. <br /> <br /> David is now determined to find out why Chris was silent and why Billy had to die, as Chris took the scene. There, David discovered that Billy Khan of the Chris tribe went there with no Billy as a member of the original Chris tribe. He also revealed to David that he himself had some sort of spiritual relationship with Australian indigenous people, as Charlie and his mother, Rev. Burton, David Parslow told him. <br /> <br /> The theater is now set for the grand and final cleansing cycle that David was watching in both his nighttime dreams and the day-to-day visions. It comes in the form of a massive tsunami flowing from the Pacific Ocean to the Australian coastal city of Sydney and then flooding the entire continent.
