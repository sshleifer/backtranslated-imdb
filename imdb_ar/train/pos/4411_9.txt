Easily 9 out of 10 for a film director, we will continue to grow impressively. But do not watch this movie expected to be "entertaining". Ang Lee casts an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of civil war. What is beautiful in the film, like all my films, is that it does not "stand" with its characters. It creates characters, embodies them with life, problems, and mystery ... and gives them a reality that is often closer to home than many feel. This film has an impact, but it is not a movie lover because violence is very annoying and far from justifiable ... like characters, it is true. As you would expect about one of humanity's most horrific wars, violence is appalling. <br /> <br /> But as an exploration of a larger human mystery that certainly emerged within the civil war, it is a masterpiece. Was the war about slavery and abolition of slavery? It seems to me quite willing to blur this line which has become very common in cartoons such as blue and gray. It is not about idealism, as we saw in the movie "Gone with the Wind." It is about freedom, the desire to have something for you and to fight for it. When you see the characters, you will ask yourself "How can they fight to maintain slavery?" The truth is, I do not think they really are, and in this film there is a problem why many have fallen into the spiral of civil war. <br /> <br /> The truth is clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting loyalties to "home" even though they may never have looked at what the home represents or whether it really values ​​its values. The message viewer is very moving and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel Other examples of loyalty extended to the limit. When tension finally settles, these characters suddenly find themselves "free" ... we see the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> All this mixes with my beautiful fusion of the human environment with breathtaking horizons and frames. Lee has a unique style, a fairly slow "European art" (slow, not urgent), and an Asian in his epic and story development, yet somewhat familiar and easy for many in North America. <br /> <br /> Relax, leave your preconceptions about what a civil war is, what is "Western" as a genre, what should be a war movie ... Let Ang Lee take you to a very fragile world, so difficult, so real that little Of us can not see it comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he did in the Ice Storm. Again, the film is slow paced and without a clear "direction" ... a sure sign of my ability to output without "imposing" itself on the story or screen. His direction is amplified by what he gets out of Jewel (yes, the singer), an actress not yet installed that performs well. <br /> <br /> A movie for those who love movies and are not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic.
