Steven King movies are a funny thing with me. I really love them or I hate them. Some small animal products (such as despair and the storm of the century) I did not enjoy. Some of the smaller, I really liked. Sleepwalking is one I enjoy and see regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Marie. They are asleep, they are creatures of variable shape, although man in appearance becomes a creature-like creature. They are immune to scratching cats and whenever you move to a new city, put traps to catch and kill animals. When they move to their newest cities, they must search for a virgin and when Charles finds one, it actually falls in her favor, but his mother needs to feed her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles sing it or use it to save his mother? <br /> <br /> Although this story contains hints of incest that some may find unattractive, it actually plays a role in the story and is therefore not put into the film. For the scandal. Like most Stephen King stories, is located in a small town with lots of interesting characters. Acting is not the best, not the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to "gel" which is a wonderful and very enjoyable adaptation. <br /> <br /> For UK readers: This production contains most recently viewed on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror.
