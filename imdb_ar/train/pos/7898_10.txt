This film got terrible ratings, but because it was an exception and because critics do not "get" weird movies, I thought I would try them out. Unfortunately, they were right in this case to a large extent. <br /> <br /> The film also seems to have an embarrassing sense, which is the most important thing. The kind of feeling that can not be described, but it is not good. To further confuse things, the script is a dull, aimless, and mysteriously interesting thing. <br /> <br /> The enormously talented Thurman is drifting only through this mess, creating little impact. Hurt and Bracco tried unsuccessfully to add something to the movie with an excited performance but there was nothing in the script. It may be less embarrassing for them if they just choose to drift and replace it like Thurman. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that critics of the movie "esteemed" fail to mention, that the film is actually very funny. Whether it be moments of precise satire or some infamous alien moments such as when cowboys chase their farm with the smell of their unwashed front bottoms ... <br /> <br /> Because the songs have been received all the time, although I do not recommend this The movie, there is entertainment to watch and watch until Cowgirls Get the Blues deserve something different.
