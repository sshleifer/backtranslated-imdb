Me and my mother were on our way home from a trip to the northeast (especially Massachusetts) when we decided to move a bit to attend a film festival in Boston. Now, I do not know much about the film, so I thought this might be a little bit educational. The first film we saw was this, the Rome section. Now, I do not know about you but I thought this was fantastic! I'm from Texas and from where I came we do not see too many animations so this was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted that she was very violent, but she said I did not know much what she was saying but that was a wonderful picture. I was shocked by the great fighting sequence. Also, I'm a big fan when good guys win so I was thrilled when the Romeo ladies killed all the bad guys. This was a real shine. I'm not sure if the video was released, but if you get the chance, you should check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Although the word to the wise, they are somewhat violent, there are many violent words so you may not want to let your children see them. It's more for adults.
