It is probably not the biggest absolute participation in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly wins the most creative episode award! "House that bled to death" ?? I can shout that title all day without getting tired of it! Alongside the stunning title, this short film also benefits from a powerful script and a handful of truly exciting moments. It may require an extra offer before you fully understand the strange end-game development, but it is certainly an original idea for a short period of horror. The story begins with pictures of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle-class home. The husband kills his wife Sadia and after several years the "cursed" house is still on sale. Two young men and their young daughter move on and begin to recover, but the mysterious events occur and have a special effect on the little Sophie. Her beloved cat was killed until her birthday party was destroyed when one of the house pipes suddenly splashed blood all over the guests (chilling sequence, this!). Is the old house already haunted? Or maybe neighbors are seemingly useful causing all the horror? The answers to these questions are provided at their original climax and are somewhat unpredictable, and there is room for real shock in the end. The tension was built brilliantly and the titular house is filled with a strange sight, like a pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to kill his wife. A little warning, though, is difficult to see with the cat when you are a pet lover. In conclusion, another winner of the short-term television series Hammer!
