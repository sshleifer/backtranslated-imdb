Call me stupid, but I loved the 2001 horror film, Valentin. It was good, well written, good acting, good steering, etc! All about it was fantastic! There were parts that were relatively routine (Leila's death), and very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), absolutely terrifying and scary (Beige's death), and it was just totally tragic (scene I). I think the whole crew did a great job, especially the three shows: David Burinaz, Dennis Richards (each interviewed, got filmed, very nice people!) And Marley Shelton. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> I'm fed up with describing this film as "another clone of screaming." This film is, by no means, clone cry. In fact, this film runs episodes about Scream. Actually makes sense! Scream was not the only film showing a masked assassin. Excuse me, but Scream seems to have been too clone (important ... on Friday XIII, Halloween, and many scary movies also appeared on masked killers). I also think that the novelty of the convincing killer Cupid is wonderful. It is strange to see a beautiful face Cupid doing all these terrible things. Other novelty (nasal bleeding) paves the way for a wonderful ending! The end gives me chills every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you do not like it the first time, watch Valentine again and give him another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Follow my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! coming soon...
