(Not only the so-called "firefighters" (think of Stephen King's scornful celebration of a book of the same name), but also a constant disagreement with one another about a woman who has a rather bad habit For being a pyromaniac! Good special effects (especially to the end), exotic performances from a trio of very talented actors, and a really interesting and oddly funny soundtrack that finally makes Wilder Napalm a unique film experience to watch ... if you can find it! On the personal side, I was lucky enough to pick it up (so to speak) from a dollar box in my local video rental shop. (*** away from *****)
