The Ancient Mariner is a real classic work, where she / she was the original poem. The context / setting with the old Mariner itself is fine, clear, and without pretense. The artwork accompanying the poem's reading perfectly fits the time / period of the preparation and the work itself, with the audience moving to a period of accompaniment with still constant, however, using excellent fixed motion strategies that have been well overcome by pre-MTV producers and less visible in current work . (MTV channel brought to the TV and video fixed motion going through, often disconnected unrelated operations, from subject to topic without moving forward and without clear relationships to the subject or story). The sound, sophistication and vitality of Redgrave's reading bring this touching poem to life with all its fear, strife and pain. In addition, the smooth motion of the video emphasizes the rhythmic and sometimes monotonous (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) from the author's rendition of the old sad and nervous sailors story. This is necessary for any love of classical poetry, the sea, a long tale, almost real, and a story that has always influenced our world and our culture. Who does not understand the meaning of the word "albatross"? Or the concept of "water and water everywhere and not a drop of water?" Really great experience. Thank you Mr. Dasilva for the return of life to us, and can never be forgotten.
