Sunday will not be Sunday without action film, and when you want intense fighting, you can resort to Tom Bringer (platoon). <br /> <br /> Here is a sniper in the forest chasing the rebels and the drug emperors. Life is a bitch, so he gets a kind of green office (Billy Zan) to help with the task. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Luza, who ascended Anaconda. He does not do much here, but Berenger makes the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Sure, it may be too long - who wants to see a lot of walking in the woods, but good, tense work when the time comes.
