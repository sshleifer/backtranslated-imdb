A wonderful movie with a slow start - give him a chance to start cooking. The story builds in attention and complexity. The characters and the story sabotage the vulgar expectations at every appropriate moment. New York City's magnificent and real sites are a great antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the entire film is a hurdle to the HBO / Hollywood concept of New York City, sex and relationships. It is a rare film that treats its characters honestly and compassionately. loved it! With fantastic performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and attention to her love (I forgot his name!).
