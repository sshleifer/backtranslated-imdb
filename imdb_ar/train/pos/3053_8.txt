William H. Messi is more sympathetic and convinced as a loving and loving father who wants to get out of the family business without upsetting his parents. Much of the same space as the Sopranos TV is in terms of the midlife crisis of a criminal theme (here too it is a visit to Tksa) but it is still worth seeing thanks to some of the distorted directions of Brommel (I look forward to what this guy is directing), an excellent script, About great deals. Messi is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since Fargo. Donald Sutherland is at best a despotic father. Tracy Ullman gives an amazingly sexy turn as a Missy wife. The young David Dorfman is excellent like Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines look ribbed and exquisite). Even Campbell (who I usually find hateful) denies it, like the troubled young woman who picks up Messi's eye. All this interspersed with a moving result and a clear velocity leading to a predictable but still powerful peak and its consequences are meaningful and touching. This film deserves a much wider version, where I think it was connected to the masses.
