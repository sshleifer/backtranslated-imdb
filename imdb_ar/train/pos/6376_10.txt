If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, plot and fantasy - without having to break into a song every twelve minutes - this is a Disney movie for you! My children loved every minute of this film, and I must admit that I laughed loudly many times throughout the film. There are no happy songs to get a great story, and all characters are lovable and identifiable in their own right. This must be reduced as one of Disney's "classics" because of its beautifully photographed scenery and unremitting excitement!
