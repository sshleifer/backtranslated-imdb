The comic joke between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which contains one of the most unlikely and unlikely plots ever made. Powell may be the most intelligent detective of the 1930s, and he has a unique voice that often sounds like a succession of small ringing bells. It is very fun to watch, so take the plot with grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. Eric Blur also has some sitcoms like Butler Powell. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to refuse lending to another studio, but wanted to work with Arthur and liked the script, so eagerly accepted the task. They worked together in two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
