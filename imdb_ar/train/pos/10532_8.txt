Let the world go get it off my shoulder. Say the things you used to say, and let the world disappear. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in pickles, one for embezzlement and the other for kissing a child. Neither of them was guilty, but faced charges and their house was about to be demolished, they ended up, nothing. The whole world has disappeared, except for their home. <br /> <br /> It's strange, but it's also funny. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends only enjoy each other and do what they want. But it seems to be so fast, they begin to improve their lives through memories. The sound effects were fantastic during that time. <br /> <br /> Things really got weird in the end. The film was the product of a great imagination, written and directed by Vincenzo Natale, with the help of the two stars. You should only see.
