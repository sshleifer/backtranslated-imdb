Really, I liked the premise was good, and the story suited the place where both groups stopped, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who have become synonymous with a particular series, and then refuse to talk about it, or to make a possible reunion (a clear example of this is Susan Day, Partridge Family). In fact, Valerie says she would be thrilled to do another film, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I'll look for someone else ... But if that does not work out, then you can restart this one.
