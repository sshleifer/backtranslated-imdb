This film is a replica of a television series on the Indian television channel Doordarshan which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre" which means balloons. Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is more sweet and "convincing." Abhay Doyle does a good job but does not match the role of "normal" and "third-class" youth (as he calls himself in the film). In fact, Xi'an Munshi felt his hair cut and without clothes designed to fit Abhays's role, but Cheyenne did not have the talent to lay him off. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that you watch the series if available. It's the same story except running with mother and friends and the initial introduction. TV representatives were far better represented than these "stars." <br /> <br /> The only reason these films stop is that the director tried to extend the story of half an hour (or 45 minutes) to 2+ hours. So you should get draggy. Even the songs of nasal music could not be compensated. <br /> <br /> These films are good on a lazy afternoon and are really refreshing if you do not see the original TV series. The script and the end of the serial were much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## #### ## SPOILERS AHEAD ############## SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### THe was the end of the original series Much stronger as the hero himself drowned the girl until she thought she was ready to marry him. He is aware that he does not want to "pay" and has never helped. The director or script writes in some way can not capture the original finish in this film. The original end had bought tears for the girls 'eyes and had to agree to the players' nod. Delivery was not true. <br /> <br /> But personally I feel that this is a pathetic version. No credit should be given to the director / screenwriter. The story is amazing and is one of the novels of the famous novelists who rated them as Menashe. I'm not sure if this is a Munchy story before, but many of the other short stories he addresses are a series of short stories about Manchi stories from Manchchi and other Indian writers.
