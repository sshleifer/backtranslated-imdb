As a Dickens fan for life, I was always disappointed by adapting his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his work has provided a very accurate redefinition of human life at every level in Victorian Britain, they have all been a widespread thread of humor that can be both playful or sarcastic as the narrative dictates. He was somehow a cartoonist and a cartoonist. He can be serious and hilarious in the same sentence. Pride of pride, arrogant arrogance, celebrated modesty, sympathy for loneliness and poverty. He may be cliche, but he was a writer for people. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy that is often missing from its interpretations. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist is filmed in a serial format on the BBC television. Both misery and cruelty are, but not humor, irony, brutal. The result is just a gloomy gloomy experience: the story of a journalist rather than a novelist. It's not Dickens at all. <br /> <br /> "Oliver!" , On the other hand, is much closer to the mark. The official irony is entirely explained, from the blustering beadle to the drunken judge. The classic confrontation between beadle and Mr. Brownlow, in which he described the law as "ass, idiot" was not possible to do better. Harry Secombe is the perfect choice. <br /> <br /> But blinding cruelty is also present, and the country's harsh indifference, cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are certainly being presented as the Lord wished. <br /> <br /> Then there is a crime. Ron Moody's treasure as a labyrinthine hedge, while Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is not surprising that Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from the eastern end of London - enjoyed the freedom with Wagner to reinterpret him as a more benign fellow than the original Dicken. In the novel, he was quite ruthless, sending some of his children to the gallows to protect himself (though he was also caught and choked). While in the film, it is presented as an odd father, a kind of charity thief instead of eroding children, and the latter is anti-Semitic feelings for a long time. Otherwise, very few liberties are taken with the Original Dickens. All the items are memorable. Adequate threat and violence are maintained to ensure narrative accuracy while at the same time allowing children to be sensitive. Nancy is still beaten to death, and Pauli flees from drowning by a narrow margin, and Bill Sykes gets a loyal look of the cartoons. <br /> <br /> Every song is excellent, although it tends towards schmaltz. Mark Leicester simulates his wonderful. Each of my favorite scenes is the scene in which the world beats "Who will buy." It's schmaltzy, but through the Dickens through and across. <br /> <br /> I can move forward. I can pay tribute to the wonderful collections, in contrast to the rich and the poor. There is a high quality representation by more than normal players in Britain than you can get rid of. <br /> <br /> I have to give him 10 points, but I feel like Scrooge today. You can eat it with Christmas dinner. Not better than the original.
