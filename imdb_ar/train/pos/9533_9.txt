This could not be better. Strong restrictions on Mike Sullivan's expressions can not be portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks offers the best performance in his career. Young Tyler Hoeklin leads an emotional wheel. Play character as the basis of the story. Veteran Paul Newman has been one of his best performances for a long time. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a bold story by Max Alan Collins and Richard Pierce Rainer. This is the story of the father / son that mainly employs candidates not only fit for roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, so John Rooney took him. Although he was a decent man, Mr. Rooney was involved in organized crime. Therefore, Sullivan's debt was only to pay off in engaging himself in the business. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and tries to keep his children safe, but at the same time, his boss recovered. The events that will follow, will test the loyalty of Sullivan and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With great adaptation by David Silv, dialogue rarely comes out, but it is virtuous. The story unfolds in a beautiful atmosphere dating back to the 1930s (a brilliant brilliance of art by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Hay) covered with a dark rain facade (snow on the ground). Leading the story, is the remarkable result achieved by Thomas Newman, and settles only when necessary. <br /> <br /> But the most important artistic element in the film is the beautiful photography of Conrad L. This is some of the best cinemas I've seen; I watch a lot of movies. Scene When Mike and Michael are in the car, the Chicago entry is impressive. The shot begins at the front of the car, revealing Mike (Hanks) across the windshield. After that, there was Dolce around the side of the car, to see Michael (Hoechlin) waking up and looking out of his side window. As they continue, side-by-side trucking and puppets surround the entire car and reveal Chicago's spectacular 1930s landscape. <br /> <br /> Through a wonderful team of staff, the main man makes a shocking film. I'm talking about Sam Mendez, who first appeared in 1999 with American Beauty. (He won many awards) Prior to working at American Beauty, Mendes worked as a theater director for the British Theater, but decided he wanted to go on saying that there was nothing new in the theater. With just two films, Sam Mendez was rated in my book as one of the greatest directors (in a list of about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The film shines a kind of insolence characterized by his time and miss him and express the real subject brilliantly. Photography, acting and story is a phenomenon. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's Gangs of New York, but now, I'm quite sure to say this is "The Best Film of the Year". Consider it as competition (signs, insomnia, minority report) and this is a strong statement.
