Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh offer the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this juicy juice is the creepy and violent hopper juice and the JT and Welsh sneak. <br /> <br /> A lost man misses a successful man and tries to make a little dough outside, but I go over his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie, when Cage walks in a trailer in Wyoming to dig, with the help of his friend ... and the opening scene at Mount Brokeback, when the character is doing the same thing! But this is another story. <br /> <br /> Denise Hopper is at his best here ... cocky, step forward in a rude, angry and violent way. JT Walsh (RIP) is also wonderful like a guy with a dark past, trying to live legitimately (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real characters to be observed here, except for a hard working deputy in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first evolution occurs early, and from there, a nice adventure of Noir in some small town sleeping. His patients. 8 points.
