I waited ages before seeing this because all the reviews I read about her said she was horrible! I rented it I expect the worst, and although it's hardly the best movie for the sandler there, there's much worse! Sandler talks over and over again with the camera and does not take the movie itself seriously, but it's all part of the fun! Great way to waste the afternoon, you may find yourself laughing once twice! Good movie, worth a lease!
