It has always been my favorite movie since I first saw it as a 12-year-old boy in 1962 when it was shown on Los Angeles TV's "Late Show" show. The characters have been very busy since the beginning of the picture, and it is very bad that the film has never been released to a video, nor has it been shown on television (apparently because of the ban imposed by East Moss Hart, the playwright / producer / director who wrote the story and introduced it for the first time) Once on the New York Theater during the Second World War - it is difficult to understand why his show was rejected for more than 50 years after its introduction). I have not seen the film again in more than 30 years, when someone who was already an important member of the film managed to get my "bootlegged" version of VHS (poor video quality, but good sound). My memory was correct: it was still an attractive and wonderful film to watch. The stunning side of this film is how many of its stars, who just started their careers in 1944, and have become either animated stars or at least well-known actors and actors (such as Judy Holliday, Edmund O'Brien, Jane Crane, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Carl Malden, Peter Lind Hays, George Superman (Reeves, Red Pattons, Lee Gee Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the B-24 Liberators are superb, especially the close-ups where the giant launcher (at those times) can be seen as a four-engine launcher (and more than 18,000 manufacturers, now extinct). An insight into the different levels of training that the pilot has undergone on his way to appointing an explosive crew (of course, very gender biased as was the trend today: men only become pilots, women only support them in their roles - hardly acceptable in today's world). I hope it will be released one day on video so that a new generation can enjoy it.
