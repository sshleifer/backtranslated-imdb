I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought it was a regular animated film .... only when the bras and bullets started to fly. I have to agree that this film will make anyone and everyone unhappy because it has been designated to discriminate against everyone and anyone .... but the truth is that it's funny the hell. I recommend this to anyone who loves the classic cult. Also try Fritz the cat and the life of Fritz the Cat. If you're right, Ralf Bashki did this too. It includes a cat with difficult times with family, streets, jobs, etc. Since Konskin was an insulting title during that period, he was also named Street Fighter. Ralph Baski also presented Brad Pitt's Cool World Championship. Heavy traffic was another caricature of street life for a young man.
