This is the best example for anyone who may not know the form of a single actor's film. This plot is ridiculous and really meaningless. It's full of vulgar attitudes, vulgar lines, melodrama, comedy ... name it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can make anything convincing, and this film is no exception at all. Everyone turns out to be a decent performer - Shashi Kapoor, Wahid Rahman, Ranjit, Am Prakash, and Smita Patel ... but it is Megastar that overshadows everyone with his high attendance. Without him, this film was not principled ... The story is about separation / false identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / goodness versus evil - everything, really! Amitabh's is a wonderful performance in all areas, in a fucking movie! Have you mentioned that it is very funny?
