Dirty Harry has to track down the victim of rape, who takes revenge by shooting her assailants in prison before killing them. Perhaps the most appropriate punishment is to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever as they are and their sister ... Anyway ... a story full of events in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The main rapist, played by Andy Drake, is appropriately despicable and gets the penalty in the end (of course!). It is not a classic film but better than other films except the original Dirty Harry movie.
