Of all the football movies I have seen, this is one of the best 2 films. The other being pitch fever. But Hero is about the greatest World Cup ever, so arguably the greatest player in the World Cup, Diego Maradona. This story is mainly about him but also about other Giants in the game at the time. <br /> <br /> The musical result is full of vitality and powerful images. Michael Caen's novel is appropriately neutral and provocative. This story is not about the individual games of the World Cup. But the feelings of the players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting games like France against Brazil (one of the greatest games of all time) have been covered in the same context. Argentina V W Germany was also in the same direction. Highly recommended. Classic World Football. Be monitored again and again, especially if you love Maradona.
