Synopsis: It's business as usual at the Loch Casino in Tangier. The casino is about to close and is preparing for a great deal the next day. Leuche leaves the owner and some staff at night, leaving Modesty. Suddenly, a group of armed gangs storm the casino and shoot violently. Unknown to Modesty, they have already killed Louche, now after the money hidden in the cellar. But no one in the casino, still alive, knows the code for opening the cellar. The vault itself is heavily packed with explosives so that attackers can not blow the door as planned. Suddenly, she finds herself humbled face-to-face with the gang leader Miklos in a roulette game where their lives are at risk. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a written review that has nothing to do with any other published media about Belize's humility, nor have I seen or read any of them. The first point I would like to make is that this classification is a bit wrong. Above all I thought this was an exciting story with an intelligence battle between Modesty and Miklos as a master plot. Sure, there are some bursts but they are not an integral part or no matter the story. <br /> <br /> As we mentioned earlier, the main plot and the main scene full of suspense, is the game between Modesty and Myclus. It's an innovative and interesting way to uncover a person's background, and a lot of the story is done outside the casino very early. Someone said it looked like a demo of a TV series almost, and the feeling that it might already be used as such. But I felt it was a much better way to make a character than others. I was not disappointed in any way because of the lack of movement, instead I enjoyed this game, history is more than just a simple action film. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nicolaj Koster-Valladow, worked very well. Staden particularly depicts humility well, and truly carries this confident and talented personality. <br /> <br /> 7/10
