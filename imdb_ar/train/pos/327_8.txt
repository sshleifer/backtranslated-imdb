I have read one comment that this film described as "rubbish" and "waste <br /> <br /> time." I think this person got a lot of political clothes that I made a little too much. <br /> <br /> I've just rented a new DVD of Criterion in yellow and blue. > These films - although hardly great - have become at least of historical significance <br /> <br /> for the so-called "radical student <br /> <br /> political and social movement" in the recent '60s. <br /> <br /> I did not see any of the pictures and their notorious reputation, I was expecting some real porn (there is not any). There is frontal <br /> nudity (including frontal nudity which is still common (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 and Orwellian-X) in the United States, but I did not expect movies <br /> <br /> A democratic socialist message is in your face. <br /> <br /> Although it tends to be simplistic, I thought it sometimes happens well. <br /> <br /> Its points are well. Laugh out loud <br /> <br /> The director's comment made it clear that there was a lot of parody in the film. The first of these is very realistic. The two main couples <br /> <br /> are haggard, incompetent, ridiculous, and lovable For a scene of intercourse between them. <br /> <br /> The second - which caused most of the complaints - is fake <br /> <br /> The snout and the tongue The last is the end of an angry battle, <br /> <br /> This is believable. <br /> <br /> The additions include a useful introduction to the film, <br /> <br /> An interview with the original US dealer and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> Excerpts from the trial certificate In the United States and the commentary "Memoirs" <br /> <br /> for the director in some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is the film "Blue Noses Will Never Leave" alone and has led to a "pivotal interest <br /> <br /> pivotal with no standard social recovery value" <br /> <br />, Thank God, is still standing. <br /> <br /> Those who have an interest in historical quirks will find this necessary.
