I've gained this, which is one of my favorite movies on DVD lately and as usual, while watching, the whole thing amazed me away. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this movie has been put into tears, especially the "Will You" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This comes second after Quadr√≥vina (who played the title with Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack and great views of Britain in the eighties of the 1980s. The end is very sad, for hours after the film ends, I love a lame child. <br /> <br /> I expect to get rid of this DVD from frequent watching, I can watch it over and over and never get bored, simply for soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear your dad's love. God bless you all. SS
