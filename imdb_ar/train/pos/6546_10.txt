Maybe I'm one of Nancy Drew's biggest fans there. I have read each book three times and have played a lot of Nancy's drawn games. I love this movie. I kept enjoying all the time I saw him go with about 10 of my friends and everyone I loved. There were three women sitting behind us, apparently in their late thirties and early forties, and I asked them how they liked them, they said they loved him! So you see it will be a recreational medium for all ages. You just have to give it a chance. It also teaches you a lesson, be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly alike. In general, this was a great move. I'm going to see him again now! So stop beating her please. It's a really good movie!
