This amazing movie was a plot ... Wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gaquet and Hyde, having grown up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this film, a young boy Sho (Gackt) meets a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers because he is forced to live outside of others, a half-life vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad film, but it's not happy. The plot was unique, unlike your model Vampire flick. The story of the film was heavy with twists and turns and excitement. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I would like to say is that the film was, despite its lack of happiness - albeit peaceful - multiple languages. I had the unregistered version (I'm lucky because I understood everything except some Cantonese), so I recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was great.
