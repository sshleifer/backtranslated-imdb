I could not find anyone to watch DJ! Because nobody I did not know was fascinated by any of the gangs. Naturally, everyone assumed you could only enjoy this movie if you liked Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre, but that's far from the truth. The only condition is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the two groups work in parallel is an ideal representation of the tracks that the band can manage, watching the audience as it eats and renders Dandy Warhols wonderful. I agree with other reviews that remember that it would be good to have a final word from Anton himself, because he clearly depicts his worst enemy and the fortress's ability to survive only. <br /> <br /> The most interesting for me is Dandys respect for BJM (despite their lack or reciprocity) and for Anton (despite his erroneous behavior). Dandy Warhols respects the art produced by the group even if the group dislikes everything Dandy Warhols now represents (although this is controversial). The best thing is when the drummer tells Dandy "I will not find them new anywhere else" and the guitarist was unconsciously excused "I'll still buy their records though." To me, this only shows how good the music is. <br /> <br /> Definitely watch this movie, even if you do not know anything about either of the two teams. It's about rock music and how it evolves, which makes this movie interesting. It is rare to follow a group closely for a long time.
