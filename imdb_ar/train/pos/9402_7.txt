I watched this movie only after hearing the rave about him for years. Needless to say, the actual experience proved a little antlimactic. However, Alec Guinness is still driving a great team at Jolie, albeit in reverse, in the post-World War II industrial era in England. <br /> <br /> This is the familiar story of the wonders of inventing the ideal daily product. Remember a car that runs on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, the fabric is not worn or wrinkled or even dirty! Of course, textile manufacturers and workers feel terrified that they may be abandoned, so the piece of land becomes somewhat thick. <br /> <br /> Guinness makes the whole project worthwhile, watching him blow up the factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast! (These Britons ... always have a hard upper lip when exposed to fire.) The film may be mixed up just like the vaguely Guinness invention, but it's a good trip at all.
