All Dogs Go to Heaven, in my opinion, is the best animated film ever produced. I'm not a big fan of animated films, but there's something about this film that makes it better than any other animated film I've ever seen. Music is as great as Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" may be one of my favorite songs from any music I've seen. This is definitely a must for people of all ages.
