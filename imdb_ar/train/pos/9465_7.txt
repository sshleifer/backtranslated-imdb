Steve Carell plays again in a light romantic film about choices, family and pressure. By judging the plot and covering it, I expected a clear comedy, a lot of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Sure, the film had some comedy, but it felt much more than the drama light Lee and Steve Karel once again performed a wonderful performance. The film itself really handles the real notes and it was a powerful element I found. But, I felt the end a little hasty and predictable. All the time, the cinema was fantastic, the acting was fantastic and the message I made was clear but still very important. Nevertheless, it has reached the old, flat and predictable end. I thought that if different options were made at the end of the film (maybe even worse), this film would get better publicity. Still a fun movie.
