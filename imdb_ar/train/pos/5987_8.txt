Gabi Ryan (Frankie Thomas) emerges from the school of reform and returns to the slums. His sister Ann Sheridan makes every effort to keep him out of trouble, but seems to follow him. Regardless of his association with the termite gang, Gabi follows real gangsters with a plan to set fire to random buildings to collect insurance. They need to blame someone who is intentional, and he is stupid. It is up to the termite to work on the law in their favor and give the bands their fair sweets. <br /> <br /> The scene for dead children is really good. The boys walk in the new resident's furniture on the street and begin to make it. They talk to each other in luxurious and professional accents and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Bonsley takes a nap on a chair. The boys then begin a fight with the new boy, but after proving that he is a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. <br /> <br /> The start scene is very good, full of hurt that seems dangerous at first, but it is really clever and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Hallop is studying to become the boy's mayor, he has a dream about schoolwork. This is beautifully displayed, with small three-dimensional images of children walking on his face and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Angels wash their faces a wonderful title because it goes beyond the success of Angels with filthy faces, and really tells what children do. These boys are known for their bad behavior inside and outside the group. But rather than being deceptive, it makes some great laughs. This is a preview of what many boys will be in the Bowery Boys series. So we get a few distorted words from Leo Gorsi.
