I searched for this film after watching the challenging and linguistic "Clueless" (1995) and perhaps the most famous Alicia Silverstone effort since the beginning of her career in film. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, which should be useful in improving most film projects. In fact everyone in the team does a good job. The only disappointment I think is that the film for me is an embarrassing "sensation" for some scenes, coming from the need to run an uncompromising theme, growing up as part of what the tone begins as a schoolgirl adventure. <br /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is good at this. It carries well the naive enthusiasm and growing anxiety that affects Mary Giordano as she maneuvers into the truth behind serial killings. I think her MG characterization has some miles in it as well. The conclusion of the story line is that they continue their career in law enforcement. It may be really interesting that Silverstone recovers the older Giordano's visit at a time of crisis later in the officer's life. just an idea! <br /> <br /> The "real crime" of her director is in good light. Pat Verducci also has credit writing. I do not know which PV film work I have done. I can only wonder what happened after this promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this movie has very little known support songs, although Bill Nan (the detective Jerry Goen) is hardly that. Over the past decade, it seems to have been able to secure a large number of screen appearances. I remember seeing him recently in Carriers (1998), a television show with a military theme. Bill Nan played "Captain Arends". Fans of the American comedy show "Who's the Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers" because the main player is Judith Light, many fondly remembered for their long participation in the show. <br /> <br /> "Real crime" can not work easily, but it works well. I think it's an entertaining story worth seeing.
