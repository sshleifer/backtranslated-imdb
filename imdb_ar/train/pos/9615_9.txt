This is a great movie! Most of us saw Jurassic Park, where chaos theory is summarized by telling the wings of the butterfly, causing a hurricane on the other side of the planet. Well, the impurities revolve around this (or at least something, do not worry that this is not a spoiler). I'm certainly not a religious type and I do not believe in things, fate, etc. But this film certainly wonders if the coincidence really exists. .. <br /> <br /> Moreover, acting and acting are also excellent, another proves that it is still possible to produce a good film without a billion dollars
