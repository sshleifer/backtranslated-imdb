One of the best comedy series that came out of Britain. Marc Gattis, Riss Schermeth and Steve Pemberton are wonderful actors and artists who seem to be at home with drama as with comedy. With the support of their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they have built the series with the most memorable characters in recent years. Small Britain is dwindling in importance as a bad tradition of its ideas. I am always innovative and creative and I am sure that many people hate this series as their lover but I am equally sure that no one can have a say in the record. I have not seen a long film so far but I have heard good things and bad things, so I will keep the judgment. The original radio series came from an innovative LOG such as the TV series. I do not know if the TV series has reached the United States, but I would be fascinated to find out how American viewers found English humor humor.
