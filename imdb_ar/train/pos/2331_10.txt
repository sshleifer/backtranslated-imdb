At first I was curious that the main character of a television program could bring the dead back to life, but I thought I would. guess what? I love Daisies and I'm looking forward to Wednesday nights just to watch it, then the next week I watch it several times on the DVR. Colorful characters, witty jokes, fast-paced dialogue, and unique new attitudes attract me and capture from start to finish. The relationship between Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting because they start with their romantic relationship about the fact that they can not have physical contact. Detective Emerson Cod's personality continued to be complicated. And Olive Snook! Gemini Crispiz! It cracks me! The narrator's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that I'm watching a movie rather than a television show. I have recommended my family and friends to run "Daisies Pay" and they are very addicted !!! The offer is worth a week's wait for a new episode and if you have not seen "P.D." , I highly recommend watching it!
