It was screened at the first world premiere on 9 September 2006 at the Isabelle Badr Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This assumption had an interesting idea but it seems to have lasted for a long time with lots of footage of eWaste piles (recycled computers, consoles, cables shipped to China in tons, then sorted and remodeled in products New for resale) and other ruin. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers tried to get more people's interviews to promote the human element but were often prevented from doing so because of Chinese censorship. However, there was nothing interesting. One of Shanghai's finest real estate agents, surrounded by its magnificent palaces and gardens, intersecting with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions, was particularly spectacular. The opening trace of the plant's 480-meter land was also a good thing. The scenes of activity in the Three Gorges Dam project were also complemented by Jia Kang's films in the TIFF (Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and Dong) documentary that was built on the subject. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Bischwall, producer Nick De Bencier, cinematographer Peter Mitler, and subject Edward Portinsky, were all on stage to participate in Q & A after the first world premiere. Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most important person who helped reach the ground in China itself.
