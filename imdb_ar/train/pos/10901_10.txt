Maybe this is the best documentary I've seen in a long time. Johnny Kennedy was and still is a wonderfully beautiful inspiration. He was not only a survivor of one of the most painful diseases there, but used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and not to give up access to people and spread his love. Watching minutes of his long struggle would destroy his heart. Hearing his smart remarks about the donkey and seeing his beloved gestures was sad. And saw him smile unspeakable. I feel blessed because I was able to be affected by this little giant. Please, if you have a chance to watch this movie, consider yourself lucky to meet Johnny Kennedy.
