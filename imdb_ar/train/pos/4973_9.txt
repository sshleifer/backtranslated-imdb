I remember watching this is his original broadcast in 1962 when he was five or six years old and really enjoyed this. I recently had the opportunity to see it again, for the first time since then, as it was broadcast on Walt Disney Gifts on Disney Channel. I forgot most of them, some of them were directed at children, but it was still fun. I can not wait to show it to my niece and nephews.
