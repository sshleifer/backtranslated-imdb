With the exception of a strange scene, this imaginative fantasy has a pleasant and exhilarating lightness to the sardonic intelligence that draws its way into the public as well as a soundtrack that strongly moves this fantasy epic. Except for one of Robert DeNiro's scenes that does not appear smooth and looks synchronized with the rest of the movie's tone, this fantastical romantic fantasy tail has a wonderful sense of storytelling, strong magic and a delicate balance between serious adventure scenes and lighter spiritual humor. In the updated tradition of the bride's game, this modern show of magic and love captures. Eight of ten stars.
