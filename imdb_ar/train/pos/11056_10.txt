Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner continued the film "The Baron" with this, a fictional series of three supernatural spies for the man who kept the "man of six million dollars". It was my favorite when I was young, and I enjoy watching it. Stewart Damon and William Gunt had unambiguous chemistry on the screen like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while Alexandra Pastido made her way through her role as Sean McCready. The late Anthony Nichols has a wonderful honor. To a large extent, the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's "Interrogation" was positive with The Prisoner. I regret that there was no second chain; the concept was much of life left in it. Was Craig and Richard rivals of Sharon's? What if you knew Tremin heroes powers? Do heroes have any abilities other than those we have seen? We did not discover that, unfortunately.
