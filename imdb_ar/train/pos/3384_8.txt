My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I like this movie very much. Compare today with an irrational film (just a special movement and excitement and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" asks for something that no longer exists today: to think. <br /> <br /> Well, it will not be a big surprise to eat human "cookies" that are created with the human body. With all that happens on the planet, knowing how indifferent people are to all, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly takes some ages but the idea behind the film is real again. Rich in paradise, and others in hell. Good luck today, they TV and folly like "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> TV is a good brain. It is unfortunate to see that human intelligence did not advance like techniques. Since writing everything. <br /> <br /> If you like reality, show that this movie is not for you. If you think every politician himself too. If you do not like to ask yourself a question now and the future well, never look at this movie.
