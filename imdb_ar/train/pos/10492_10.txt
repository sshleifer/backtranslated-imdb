I saw Grace save directly after he came out on the video. Since then I have become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex but does not take away from entertainment. It is an envelope full of comedic moments and has a very good quality. The characters are the ones that make the film good. They both have strange qualities that add to the humor. The two old ladies played by Linda Curt Scott and Felida if she jumps to mind. It was a wonderful acting by everyone, especially Brenda Blythin. She and Craig Ferguson were wonderful at catching some fun moments. If you are looking for a good comedy I would definitely recommend this movie!
