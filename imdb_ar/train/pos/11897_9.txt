This is the little horror flick that is appreciated by independent movie lovers. She has a good disposition, a lot of gore, a decent plot. One will be reminded of films like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. The budget was obviously not so large, but the film is really compensated for the atmosphere and strong performance of the actors, who seem to lack a lot of films full of special effects for the big budget today. The movie really moves and there is an excellent direction and good work for the camera. There are no scenes lost, so the length of the film is a bit short. In addition, it seems that the end leaves an opportunity to sequel, which will be very exciting as well. So grab some popcorn, dismiss the lights and enjoy this one.
