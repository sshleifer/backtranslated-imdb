John Carpenter Halloween is frankly a horror masterpiece. It tells the timeless story of the mentally ill fugitive Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to chase and kill a group of nannies. <br /> <br /> This was the first and without a doubt the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows a great grip on storytelling very slowly and building charismatic characters; unusual for the horror scene. <br /> <br /> The strangest is the absence of blood and gore, yet remains the most horrific in Halloween yet. Get it! <br /> <br /> Halloween celebrated the first film by Jimmy Lee Curtis and a crucial point in the life of the late Donald Blaise. Classic real.
