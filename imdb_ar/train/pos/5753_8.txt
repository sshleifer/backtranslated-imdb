*** 1/2 of ***** While I'm not interested in the fact that this version is dubbed in English, as some critics have mentioned, it should be noted, as it seems to lie in the hearts of Quebec's indigenous people. However, this film was like a child I was very impressed with; taking into account now that it is made for children, I establish it on a relative basis. The story revolves around children in the winter break who build an impressive snow reserve and wrestle from behind to control weapons such as snowballs and other tricks, such as idle hands and leisure time on an equal footing with winter break lessons. If I have children, it is certainly a film I will try to make them care about, because the snow castle impressed me when I was young, and I think even today's children will agree, though with Pixar and all computer animation, maybe I'm out of date and just do not realize it . In addition, the film's message is fantastic and positive in that, for children (and adults alike).
