Corey Blimi. This film surprised me because it is a comic masterpiece. Billy Zan is an amazing character, and everyone is able to play it straight enough to be a natural and easy comedy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good, and the play pieces are fun. I recommend you watch this movie with a group of colleagues, a few bottles of your favorite wines, and be prepared to be amazing and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> It runs ideally from the masterpieces of falling art like Plan 9 from Outer Space is in the tradition of the real movie "B". But what makes it even more is the caliber of the people involved in the film. Ron Perleman for example. I still find myself laughing in the scene where Zain offers a series of steps for no apparent reason in ballet style. Every bit mad, and everything is better for it.
