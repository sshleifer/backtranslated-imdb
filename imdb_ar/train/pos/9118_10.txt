I watched this movie with a special show by Owen Alec Shehadeh. It is interesting where this guy came from. Now he may be the main independent African director in the world. I'm not talking about black directors, I'm talking about directors who have roots in culture. The idea if anything attests to the diversity and scope of African themes, with his film 500 years later it is an African issue. But the idea does not fit this template. Show artistic diversity. The film is an African team, but the subject is a human subject that most of us can relate to. I just loved the light comedy in it. The Kora of Tunde Jegede is amazing, it's really a technical gem.
