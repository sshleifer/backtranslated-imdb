I laughed a lot while watching this. It's a short amusing action with fun music and a lot of inattention. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the style of humor. The funny dialog box is often unexpected, and from the first line to the last thing seems to be flowing nicely. There is Max, who apparently led an awesome life. There is Edward, who is not sure of the life he wants to live. My favorite character is Tom, Edward's head crazy. Tom has a short but memorable role. Highly recommended to anyone who likes silly humor. You can find it online now, a bonus! I admire all Jason cartoons and I can not wait to see what happens next.
