# 3 in the trio of young John Travolta of films. Dancing on disco, rock and roll. Head to Houston to find work and love. Giles is a hot spot, this is a mechanical bull time. In order not to excel, I installed the bull at a club in Nashville. I watched this movie, which was almost forgotten on television, and I remembered how good it was and how well it was in 1980. I wore a black cowboy hat that year just like Travolta. Debra Wenger was in prime. She looks stunning in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Buds and Sisi seem idealistic couple even if they are a trash can trailer. They were divided just because they felt they were going back to each other. Urban Cowboy has amazing soundtrack. We got to hear Lyin 'Eyes by The Eagles and Lookin' For Love by Johnny Lee.
