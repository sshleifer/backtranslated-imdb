68 million people are expected to die prematurely between 2000 and 2020 as a result of AIDS. The expected losses are greater in sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths are expected. Behind dark statistics, personal stories rarely hear about. Christoph Honoreh describes one of the most thrilling films in the film "Close to Leo," a film produced for French television as part of a series on issues facing young people. Although they are fictional, they deal with a common position unfortunately - the impact of HIV diagnosis on a cohesive loving family. <br /> <br /> When Liu (20 years old) Leo (Pierre Menard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rudolph Baoli) and Piero (Jeremy Lipman) that he is infected with AIDS, the family is destroyed. Out of concern for his youth, they decided to withhold information about his younger brother, Marcel (Yannis Lespart), 12, but he heard the conversation and began to wet and behave in an unexpected way. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him but the little boy faces Leo and demands to know the truth. Liu told him he was sick and Marcel was sad but accepted. When Marcel comes to meet some ex-gay friends, however, the tension between them sparkles to the surface, paving the way for a strong result. <br /> <br /> Although I was not comfortable with the bedside scenes that involved physical contact between the two brothers, I feel close to Leo and the wonderful performances of Lespert and Mignard are more than just directing the scales in his favor. Watching the unfolding events from the young boy's perspective gives the film an originality that reminds me of Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Unlike some American films that dance about the pain of AIDS, the film "Closer to Leo" tells a harsh truth, but it does so in a very subtle and real way.
