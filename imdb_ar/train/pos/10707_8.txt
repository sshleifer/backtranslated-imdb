For the film, which received little publicity, and very few people heard, this was good. It is another film of modern British crime films that is quirky ("Kidnapping", "Sexy Monster", etc.). She is not as savage as "Snatch" but she is interesting and has some tough characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a somewhat trimmed and somewhat predictable end but early in the show - not too late - it has some wonderful twists to make it very interesting to the viewer for the first time. Basically, it's about a low-level British man who sends a Russian "mail bride" to finish with the help of two Russian male friends, and offers some big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Shakban and Nicole Kidman participated in the tournament, two very good players like Vincent Cassell and Matthieu Kasowitz as Russian knights at Kidman. This is a different kind of film and good representation. Kidman once again proves it is much more than just a lovely face.
