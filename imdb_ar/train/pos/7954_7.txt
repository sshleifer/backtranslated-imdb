Fantastic sounds, lots of adventures and intelligent dialogue make this movie very good. The addition of "personality" to the three main animals gives the story more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older colleague, Shadow, and the young hellraiser Chance. Previous versions of this film were not able to give animals any real character or motive, Ideal. Sally Field is loved in anything, but it really shines in this film as a proud, Sasi cat. A great contrast between the views of the cat and the dog in life, the right amount of soul and warm puzzles to make the plot and decision excellent. There is even an upscale degree and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with children. Hats off for Disney.
