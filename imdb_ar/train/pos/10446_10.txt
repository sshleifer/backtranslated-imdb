I watched this movie 10 years ago. And watched it on video at a rate once a year since then. It's a kind of timeless film, because the features are universal, but the stories and conversations are very personal. It's also one of the few films that pick you up from the first frame until credits are included, despite the fact that there are already two people (very included). This owes many participants the disposition of hawks and dulps, who make us think they are actually Jesse and Sileen. This is also the first film I saw on reality television mentioned, and now, this phenomenon rampant! I like how the film surrounds the audience in its space, and makes you think, no matter what you feel, that you are one of those characters. It also made me want to ride the train around Europe! I did not meet anyone who could not connect this movie. Maybe talking about myself, or my friends, or just a pure genius in this film.
