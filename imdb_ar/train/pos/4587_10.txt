Although John Woo's boiled steel film is my favorite film. But I must say that the police story is my favorite movie No. 2. I say this because stunts, battles and movement are the favorite part of the film when Jackie Chan jumps from the railroad at the top of the esplaner in the mall to a column surrounded by chrismas lights and slides down the pole through And finally landing on his back on a solid marble floor. OUCH! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something at $ 14.) A new home video from VHS. Any questions or comments feel free to reply. (I am only 14 years old but I know where you can find any film that was ever produced). If you're looking for a movie everywhere and can not find it, please reply to. Thanks and become good!
