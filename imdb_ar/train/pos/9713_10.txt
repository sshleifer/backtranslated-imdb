This series was shown on the cable television station "Comedy Central" in the United States. They were chopped to death and show from the sequence. This was a sad thing for the audience that should have attracted him, did not happen and fell on the side of the road. Fortunately, at the same time, my cable company became digital and got the BBC. Thank God I got to see the "League of Gentlemen" in full and uncolored order. <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen is perfectly located with Monty Python's Circus and Kids in the Hall in Canada. But ... a warning. <br /> <br /> "Gentlemen League" though it is one step further. It is not only the clothing and the projection of cultural ills, it is much deeper and darker. I can tell many of you now - it will hurt certain groups of people and will anger others. But remember, the only comedy .. Dark, dark comedy. If this is not your thing, do not see it. If you think you know a dark comedy, watch this - if you feel angry and upset, you do not quite know DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys understood it correctly, and the button directly. They are wonderful, they are excellent and I have enjoyed every personal creation. There is a full story that is listed here from the first episode to the end. You can not watch this episode at one time, Willie Nelly, this is one of the charms of this series. Watch it in order. Know how creative these guys are and how deeply disturbed they are. No one and nothing beyond borders. This, my dear, is the "dark humor". Bravo!
