I thought Baseketball was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen! The humor has made me brilliant all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt have finished at the top enhances the comedy of the film. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on a DVD and only one of those movies that will not tire of watching them. I have a very short period of interest and I think this film contains any funny parts that make me feel fun all the time. The comic quotations are unforgettable, and can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later. <br /> <br /> So I think in general that Baseketball is a great movie that everyone should watch, especially if you love me because it will keep you laughing for a while Long after that. <br /> <br /> Does anybody think it's strange for me to love them both? Hehe
