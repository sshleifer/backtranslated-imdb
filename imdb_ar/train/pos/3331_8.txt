Admittedly, I do not know anything about baseball. I'm not a fan of this sport, but that does not stop me from enjoying the latest Fever Pitch, an irresistible romantic comedy. The film does not revolve around baseball. Instead, it really is about relationships, emotional separation that can often happen. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? Give his best performance yet? The stars as Ben, a dorky schoolteacher, nudge lightly. Ben is a kind of men, who unfortunately have never grown up, and he encourages a semi-fanatic addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has dedicated his life to Sox, and does everything from doing a pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorate every square inch of his apartment in his tools team. <br /> <br /> One day, while taking his engineering classes with honors. On a field trip to her office, Ben meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore). Lindsay is a girl of a common professional nature, but she has a kind of attraction that Ben finds quite loving. He was initially reluctant to ask her out, believing she was on his way out of his "separation", and Lindsey did not immediately see a potential partner in Ben. <br /> <br /> Their first history begins at a disastrous start. When Lindsay suffers from severe food poisoning? Her threat to the mummies provides the first idea that we are, in fact, watching the Farrelly Brothers movie. Instead of accepting Lindsay's request - fairly urgent - for rescheduling, Ben is committed to playing the role of nurses, regulators and gatekeepers. So, Ben wash the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his desire to love is neglected with a bucket next to her bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsay wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch, the long and appropriate process begins to break down the network of anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her criteria. They soon fell in love, with Lindsay admitting the sincerity of Ben's fanaticism to his sport. <br /> <br /> After inheriting the season tickets of his beloved uncle, Ben organized his life throughout the season ?? He never missed a game. But their relationship, which has advanced without a hurdle throughout the winter, hit a snag at the start of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants Ben to do other things, like spending a holiday with her parents and the party with her friends, but Ben began to have trouble adjusting his attention to meeting Lindsay halfway. Can Lindsay approve his irrational sincerity for the boys in the summer to make their relationship work? Can she really absorb Ben's fascination with sport? Can Red Sox enthusiasts and sympathizers find true love after all? Of course, Lindsay and Ben come with a variety of colors from friends who enjoy their opinion. Robben (Cady Strickland), the staunchest friend of Lindsay, the thin, rich and blond man, insists there must be something wrong with a man if he is still 30. Skye offers a more optimistic and positive view of Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben's strangeness can be applied to any almost obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustrations can be represented by any woman driven in career. Fallon is as great as Ben, showing real potential for a big screen, and overcoming the daunting challenge of preventing Ben from being sympathetic. Barrymore, at the same time, is equally charming as Lindsay's addicted to work, especially as she struggles to accept Ben who is without missing out on her own needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works, and although there are plenty of inspirational comedy moments, the film also addresses the serious problem of sports addiction and the difficulty of couples in negotiating this fragile region. <br /> <br /> Much of the film was filmed at Boston's Fenway Park, which adds a good sense of originality to the action, as well as the atmosphere of the games, although the full appreciation of what happened with the team is likely to be a baseball fan. However, Fever Pitch has a text that is so beautifully written and funny that even novice baseball fans will find many things they can communicate with. Mike Leonard September 5th.
