Walk around with this on a dark and stormy night and get ready for fun, entertainment and fear alternately. The old, noisy plot about the imaginary train that is said to pass through the lonely English countryside at night may be unreasonable, but very enjoyable. There are some great old clich√©s like "The Incident" that locals can remember but will not talk about. But primarily the movie is a car for Commodore Arthur Ascii to showcase his own kind of voodoo-style humor among the scary bits. The Askey teaser is not very trendy these days, but if you let it sink in you may be fun. Maybe this is the best Askey movies.
