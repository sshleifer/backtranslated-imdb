Paperhouse is the most exciting and moving film I have ever seen. Often classified as a "horror film", I believe, this is a fatal mistake. Once described as "the nightmare of a thinker on Elm Street" and while accepting the logic of his conclusion, I can only think that it is a sign worthy of and misleading. Those who can not see the horror really die here and work only to show that they never think. <br /> <br /> In fact, maybe just trying to classify this wonderful work is a bad idea. Simply put, Paperhouse is ideal in every detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than I once said, "the film hits you at a very emotional level," which may explain to some extent why my comments have been relentlessly influenced. To be honest, I do not apologize for that. If you feel that my words are very drunk with your taste, stop reading now because there is more to come. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a movie that contains the heart of the pain and the pain of childhood and the struggle to overcome feelings of loneliness and loneliness that can overwhelm us completely at this fragile time in our lives. It is unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence necessary to make everything work. At Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spears, we had a piece inspired by the permanent casting and influence of Paperhouse that owes much to its ability to depict melancholy and expelling childhood (often ignored) in a smooth and convincing way. <br /> <br /> However, both bright young stars seem to have gone beyond the understanding of the studios and somehow fade away. <br /> <br /> Add to all this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), a fantastic cinematic film and the best soundtrack you may ever hear and you may begin to know why I have such affection and closeness in this A film that no amount of words can express. <br /> <br />
