Emma is a terribly flawed film based on the classic Jane Austen novel. I did not read the book, so I did not know much about the plot, but I still expect the entire chart. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of bad writing or output. The film however is for some reason very enjoyable and loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I did not like but the majority were acting well and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow offers one of her best heroine performances in Emma. The film also starred Tony Collett (who was alright but was much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who was also the best but still very good here) Alan Cumming (which I've never really liked and he's exactly the same here) and Jeremy Northham (which is somewhat woody at first sight but actually rather subtle, even if that is not what is required) there were much better edits than Jane Austen wrote but this one is still very amusing and worth watching.
