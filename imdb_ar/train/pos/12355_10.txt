I can understand those who hate this film because of the lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Gisha, but the tenants of brothels, and one does not know the difference will not understand half of the film, certainly not the end. This is a complete artistic work on women's lives and needs in this age. Everything is important, and certainly the way they are dressed, throughout the film means more words. For those who thought it was a boring Gisha movie, I suggest you read a bit about this community before you come to a conclusion outside of this reality. This work Kurosawa is life, I am sure that the director understand the silent meaning of the Kurosawa piece to the right intellectual scope.
