I saw this film for the first time in a festival. There were many good movies, but a few of them kept me thinking about it for a long time, and the Insomniac nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented filmmaker. The shots were wonderful. It was perfect molding. Domenech starred in his role, which he completely formulated. There was not much to know about his character, but she wrote the story in a way she cared about. And Ellen - I can not wait to see where it will end! I show a lot of talent and I hope you do some movies. With all the million dollar budgets that are trying to get cheap thrills, Tess shows that the whole thing does not need as long as there's a story and good actors. Glory to all participants in this film. Thanks to Tess & Co. For distribution on DVD!
