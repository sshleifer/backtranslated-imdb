What at first seemed just the introverted French flick that gave more than just a bitter feeling became, in the second show, a truly satisfying and satisfying presentation. <br /> <br /> Follow Spoiler of sorts. <br /> Poor Cedric. He did not seem to know what had happened. Weak audience At first we were trapped in what appeared to be a beautiful and romantic story just to be returned to a dark reality of mismatches. These two men did not come together from the first mysterious encounter. As far as Matthew and Cedric are sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional connection made it impossible for Matteo, an intellectual being, to find an investigation into sharing life with someone whose sensitivity was more in tune with carnival and romance on the beach. <br /> <br /> In a purely technical note, I liked the camera work in this movie. Translations were absolutely unnecessary, although my French language is "presque rien". I can watch them again without disturbing English subtitles and enjoy them more. This was a highly polished and professional animation. Although many scenes seem unnecessary, I am nine out of ten.
