This film can be interpreted on many different levels. Do not listen to other comments that hit the film and say it was a story that was once again shown or is about drugs. It has very superficial superficial metaphors about drugs. However, the rest of the film (and why I think it was made personally) does not mean that at all. It really makes fun of psychology and adapting society. It appears, for the second time, that the brother of the main character watches the sick videos on the Internet. why? My explanation is that to show that all this atrocity we are experiencing makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions rather than seeing people as people. As far as the view of logic is concerned, it also extends to people who were in smart, intelligent classes with 1% who feel confused and frustrated because life is unpredictable and mathematical and logical as it seems at the microscopic level. You must apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and principles of uncertainty) not only to physics but also to life and leave space to change your plans and adapt along the way. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The road may go over your head. It is not for you, it is for those people who have difficulty dealing with life and do not act as a mathematical problem. When you critically analyze a film or write your cash review, try not to read the back cover first (written by marketers and psychologists)
