Each film has great bands that has dramatic human streams. Do not expect an emotional story about guilt, revenge and despair of "Scarface". This is the story of fierce greed, corruption and power. The dark side of the legendary "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Anyone who complains about the "cheese" of this film is missing the target. Surface characters, cunning music, and dated costumes increase the criticism of this diabolical life. Nothing in the life of these characters is really important, nor at any human level at least. In fact, the film practically shakes the epigraphic boundaries, ironically considering all the gang rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. <br /> <br /> This is not the most powerful effort directed by Brian DiBalma, it is sometimes excellent and good to deal with (especially the unforgettable ending), but often sink into dirty and misleading. Fortunately, it is supported by a very powerful script by Oliver Stone (probably a good treatment for him, taking into account the habit of coke he was handling at the time). Consistent themes, focusing primarily on the life of Tony Montana, evolve his character as consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, as they comfortably see between humor and drama. There are many prominent lines, which have since made their way into popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The cast helped make it so, but this is a really Pacino movie. One of his less accurate past shows (more common than at present) is a world completely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. However, it is seen here as ever, in an entertaining form (very deliberate). It's hard to imagine Tony Montana after watching this latest film, in one of the most simulated shows ever. Pfeiffer was boring and uncomfortable at first sight, but I knew how to play the little wife's boredom. It is not an extraordinary effort, but it has been unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good, especially Paul Schnar as Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Strong, sometimes funny, sometimes horrific, and constantly controversial. "Scarface" is one of the 1980s movies (no matter what that means to you). The basic and accessible gang flick, the pop culture teacher. 9/10
