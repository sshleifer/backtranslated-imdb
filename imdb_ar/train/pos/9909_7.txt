Serious comedy. The release of Ross Hunter from the French play "Les Joies de la famille" (later known as "a very rich woman") is a wonderful and well-known film and sometimes funny ... Unfortunately. California's wealthy widow, who appears to be moving away from her money, is being hit by the railways of her two young daughters, who fear that Mama Rosie will inherit their inheritance carelessly. The full case of a vital woman - but old - is sent to the House of Rest against her will, and later proved to be reasonable in a court hearing, a substance sensitive to comedy (and fortunately, director David Lowell Rich does not exaggerate in the image of the gags Copper or clear emotions). Some humor is a little wide and does not work, yet Rosalind Russell understands the gravity of this scenario and never gets the wrong message. Sandra de is also the granddaughter of Rosalind, and James Varentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has a lot to say about the importance of our older people and the ways they choose to spend their remaining time, so that the theme of "Rosie!" In the rush toward a happy ending. The picture leaves you smiling - at the same time wondering how many older ladies have never been lucky. *** from ****
