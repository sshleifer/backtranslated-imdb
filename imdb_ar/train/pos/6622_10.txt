I just went to the film during the Expresion en Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One producer was there and gave a brief introduction. The film rolled and from the first shot I was surprised: one long and continuous shot of Paris futuristic in glorious white and black. <br /> <br /> I should not go on with the details "because I think it's a movie worth watching ... The story of science fiction can be found on average for many ... for me it was really good. The things that you will not be able to do or see are beautifully accomplished.The performance cast is good, in my opinion no one notices the wrong tone. <br /> <br /> Now, the thing that I found wonderful It is animated 3D grafics look 2D The comic book BW brought to life The details on the backgrounds provide more texture as if they were (I'm sure it was, but when the corners change, you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer spoke during the presentation about the hard work behind the film: 7 years ago! She said the director was wonderful, but maybe he was untrained because it was not He has only a short film in his autobiography, so many people had a true faith in them, they started their studio from scratch and since then they have faced the challenge they faced. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. You will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linclater to take a last look at this film better than my own.
