I did not read this book, but I was shocked throughout the film with only one idea in my head: this is Vonnegut. I did not see a writer, all the intelligence and life behind the works of the novel, translated well into a film. This film had the same complexities as in Vonigut's novels: jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and events and dramatic characters were often jokes. Nolte. He had everything that characterizes "hero" Vonnegut: lack of interest in political boundaries, dark dark humor that gives way to inertia in response to stress, and unwillingness to push his version of reality on around him. > <br /> In general, I was constantly surprised and impressed by this movie. It was the same feeling that I was reading "Cat's Cradle," Vonnegut's first novel, as if it were the most eccentric thing to happen, think about it, make it real and important. Yes, he has only surplus army "Christmas albums." So go!
