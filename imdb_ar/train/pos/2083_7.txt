This film was an interesting film by Hollywood about the novel by the same name Pearl S. Buck. While some may think today that it is pervasive in racial stereotypes, the idea of ​​Chinese heroes was progressive in itself. I found that white actors who play Chinese were not as bad as I expected, and that it was not the Asian equivalent of the black facade. At that time there were no Asian representatives in America (not even George Taki was acting) and Rainer did a good job of her own. This was not the greatest performance I have ever seen, but for pre-school, it was wonderful. The scene of the locusts was filmed well and included special convincing effects. <br /> <br /> I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression turns this film into a symbolic story. Especially the political upheaval that shocked peasant farmers and how they seem to have left them behind. <br /> <br /> The film had some similarities to that of John Ford, but I think the eastern influence also affected him. If this were a Western family, locusts would have won in the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust and rudeness. Yet here he learns the lesson, then wins.
