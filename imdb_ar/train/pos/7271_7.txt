Writer / director John Hughes covered all the rules (as usual) with this family film "Sunday Afternoon" bitter. "Curly Su" is an early sweet orphan, taking care of his "childhood" by "Bill". The couple live away from their brains as they travel to the great United States of A. Fate, and match them with a yuppie lawyer "very beautiful" and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie, where they can relate to the heroine, played by 9-year-old Alison Potter (who became "a girl to go!" from Pepsi's commercial ads). The character is supposed to be about 6 or 7, where she is urged to think about going to school. Some vocabulary suggests that it is every day of the age of 9 years or older. <br /> <br /> Like "Home Alone", there are a lot of small sticks and fists that squeeze the big fatty chin. Again, this is making a film "formula", aimed at a young audience. Fun and intimate. Do not look for any surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.
