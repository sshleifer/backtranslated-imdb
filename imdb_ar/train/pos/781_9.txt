"Crush" looks at women's friendship, and mostly avoids the quality of saccharine that corrupts many films of the same theme (eg, "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, reveals the power of sudden emotion to overcome the surprise. The events were very unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seemed real to me. It is not a film about the rush of cars and the explosion, but it is certain that older women respond with laughter and tears.
