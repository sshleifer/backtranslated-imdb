Man on Fire, is definitely one of the best drama / crime films I have ever seen. Despite the slow start, the story is so complex and sensitive that it sticks together well. This is the role of the ideal Washington Denzel, in which he plays a bodyguard, called Crissy tortured by his past and is addicted to alcohol but does not give up his duty to save his last characters, Beta. Dakota Fanning plays the role of beta, the very enthusiastic little girl who loves a lot of things and behaves in a very convincing way, with a wonderful future. As I said, the story is rather complicated, in order to fully understand it, it has to be seen several times. <br /> <br /> This film is made up of two parts. There is the first hour, where everybody is happy, all right, everyone is happily living until the kidnapping of a house takes place and almost a krissy is killed. Then there is the second part, the rest of the film, where everything suddenly becomes complicated, hideous and somewhat disturbing, when Krisi recovered from his severe injury and began to hunt down and kill many criminals and "La Hermade" who were responsible for planning and carrying out the kidnapping of a house. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows his most recent talents along with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film has not been sufficiently recognized, Washington really deserves another Oscar for its performance, as did Vening and the director. Perhaps even visual effects that were of very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like the excellent thrillers and the slightly distorted, that's what you see. What is most surprising is that the elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
