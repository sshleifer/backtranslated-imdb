An excellent example of the stunning Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. The audience must be very surprised to see James Kani in this type of car. Quite contrary to his "public enemy" two years ago. Cagney does not add spark and interest to a tired routine instead of a story developed and plot. But the highlight of the film is the three complex production numbers that go back. First with the conservative figure "Honeymoon Hotel" followed by the stunning "By A Waterfall" sequence, followed by the final Shanghai Lil series, Cagney is only involved in the last number he raised over the face bar with Robbie Keller. The "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is excellent, but a bit of the climate and turbulent collapse after the design of the incredible "By A Waterfall" dances. If you are the director, you enter "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and close with "By A Waterfall", which blows the other two numbers out of the water to speak in my opinion the best 3 numbers. 3 production numbers are frosting on the cake and add James Kane's ornamentation to the cake. A great musical achievement, a 4 star film, the final music, worth watching, will not disappoint you !!!!!!!!!
