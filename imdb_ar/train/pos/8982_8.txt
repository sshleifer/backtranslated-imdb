Damn, this was too much to swallow. I was fascinated all the time. It was very perfect, although I say that the amendment had a great relationship to it. I can not believe that this guy stayed in good relationship with a lot of them (Anton especially) to get all those shots without any serious meat .... Dandy has achieved the best performance, from the middle class who have benefited from their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Johnstown and especially for Anton, who probably was not what many people felt. A great piece of filmmaking and a great choice of theme (themes). I recommend this to any music / movie lover. You will probably learn something about filmmaking.
