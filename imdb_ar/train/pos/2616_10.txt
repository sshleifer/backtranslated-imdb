The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very nice story to go with The Lion King. Trace the original story of the Lion King mainly but with two transformations. In the film, e-vents are explained from the perspective of different characters. This story is still an original conspiracy. <br /> <br /> As far as the sequel, Disney is not all that wonderful in making them worthwhile. This part, being the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second). He already has an original idea while continuing to engage the first fun. Timon and Bumba travel in search of the perfect place to live. After searching for large places, they found the place of Hakuna Matata. Then they meet with a small lion called Simba, and they go through many things that parents are going through today. <br /> <br /> I think this is a very good movie, and I'm glad to add it to my collection.
