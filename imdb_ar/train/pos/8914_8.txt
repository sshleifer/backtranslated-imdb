I grew up in Roersford, Pennsylvania, the city where Jerry's Market was. I remember my whole family going out to watch the movie. I remember a man showing me "Blob" me and my brothers in a bucket. I also like to share that my mother was in the film. Her style was the same style as Aneta Corsaut and she was sick one night and saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with Steve McQueen for some shots from behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell her until she died last August. My mother was not a teenager and was a few months after the birth of my little sister.
