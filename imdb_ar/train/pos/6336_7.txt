Well, so foreign exchange is not a high budget. But this story is based on actual events. There is nothing to meet together to make two wealthy representatives, even richer! Because most movies rely on books, there are some things that do not fit them. Only two people said that this film was based on real events, not a knockdown because most people think it !! This movie is in no way related to TWISTER! Unlike both films revolves around hurricanes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems with hurricane science and storms in the movie, there are a few things you need to remember ... "Hurricane Night" was on June 3, 1980. So this movie was released after 16 years of Actual events. Try to think about the progress of storm research at the time. It happened in a big city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the film calls the city something else, it says it is a small town.
