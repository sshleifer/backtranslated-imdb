A simple but intelligent school film about a simple but ambitious secondary graduate with dreams of owning the world's coolest car to use as a "ballroom." <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, is spending his savings in full to get his dream car. Start sharing and making love quickly With the girls, Bobby picked up the local pizza shop, but he discovers that a lot of responsibility, danger and aches come with being the owner of this mechanical marvel. <br /> <br /> The Van is a guilty pleasure of mine. He embodies the mood of the mid-1970s and has enough unintended humor to put him in the category of "Too bad it's good".
