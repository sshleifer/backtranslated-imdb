It's been some time since I saw this movie and the series, but now I'm updating my memory! This was a very funny film based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Sean William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse manage Monchene in General Lee. When Boss Hogg dukes out of their farm, Bo and Locke sneak around the local construction site of Hogg and find coal samples. Soon they realized that Boss Hogg was the province of Hazzard that would ban the Gaza Strip, unless the Dukes could stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only problem with the film is that Bert Reynolds was not suitable for Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco Coltran was very dangerous. Other than that, I highly recommend the Desert Hazel !!!
