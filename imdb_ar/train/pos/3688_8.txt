A wonderful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film also depicts some of the great actors of our time, not only from France but from everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite district: <br /> <br /> Circle Four: Carol (Margo Martindale) from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and also to clarify the meaning of her life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: Perhaps there was no better way to start this film than this class about Paris's romance. Loin du 16Ã¨me: A picture of Paris we are better aware of since the riots in Sites. Anna (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's child (she is a nanny) than her child. <br /> <br /> Latina Cartier: Lots of fun to see Gerard Depardieu as a "Tenant Bar" with Gina Rowlands and Ben Qazara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Do not tell me you did not like those mummies! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Such treatment to see Steve Buscemi as a tourist who is being high contacts (no-no) with a girl in the subway. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is awesome. Ludivine Sannier also. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back! <br /> <br /> It was seen in Barcelona (another wonderful city), in Verdi, on 18 March 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
