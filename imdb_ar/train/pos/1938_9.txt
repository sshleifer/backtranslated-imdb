The big bad swim has a low budget, you feel about it. I often start watching independent films that had really good reviews only to discover that they were rude, voted for people who were very blind to the idea of ​​the film and its ability to be so provocative that they forgot that the film was a form of entertainment first and foremost. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the big bad swim has any message, meaning or metaphor higher, if I have missed it. <br /> <br /> From the start, I felt the BBS was right. It was easy, warm and humane. There was no big drama or meaningful visions. I contacted people directly. And when, as with all good movies, finally appeared, I felt sad to lose this connection. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something big, quick or insightful elsewhere, look for a movie that tries to make more than you can. BBS offers a truly powerful and enjoyable experience and feels reward and satisfaction after watching it.
