Kusturika made again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of its own features, with frantic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! Music is everywhere, as are photography, animals, crazy bastards, sex, tools and inventions, and everything is just right for entertainment. Pure cinema in essence. Great experience to watch. One particularly grateful because the good comedy is very rare, and very wonderful. Well, this one, if you have enjoyed the previous Kusturica movies, you will love them, although, as in all comedies, they relate to a chemical reaction and you must be in a good mood.
