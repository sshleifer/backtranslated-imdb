"The Case of the Scorpion's Tail" contains all the elements necessary to make an effective Giallo movie. The story is the standard Giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife, Ida Ghali, collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow goes to Greece for compensation but a series of heinous murders are followed. There are a lot of suspects, including a stubborn investigator (George Hilton) of the insurance agency and lover of the widow. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a rapid pace as the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (do not forget also in "Your deputy is a closed room and only I have the key" and "Who saw her death?") The heroine is wonderful looking. It is one of the best films Martino.
