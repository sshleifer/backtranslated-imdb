I own the Ralph Bakshis I forgot the Fire & Ice masterpiece on an old video rental OOP. <br /> <br /> Well for one thing, this is better than any other Conan-esque movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares? I have stood the test of time, and the only way I began to appear with cheese is to compare it to modern fantasy notes like LOTR: FOTR (although I love this movie.) <br /> <br /> The plot goes like this: After a battle between Fire & Ice, the daughter of kings abducted by the inhumane creatures of Jaros (Ace), while the only survivor from the village of a victim saves her. <br /> <br /> Yes, it does not seem as original as a home nurse, but that's not the point. It really offers an interesting idea about a world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. It has succeeded. <br /> <br /> As for traffic scenes: great. They are well handled, have great suspense, and have a lot of high noise. Just check the climatic battle, now this is the end! <br /> <br /> Representation and dialogue: competent. really. They will not be nominated for the Oscars, but they are fine and do not get your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is very good. Shot on three-dimensional and rotoscoped (I think), it looks good. Many backgrounds look detailed and well drawn, and although the designs of the characters seem a bit remote, they are fine. <br /> <br /> In general, this tiny gem is neglected and will entertain you more than any "entertainment" surface. 10/10
