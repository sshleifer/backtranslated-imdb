I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent model for young people and should be much appreciated. This film revolves around following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or telling them to criticize and criticize you. Holly check her dreams just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are times in everyone's life when people are judged by what they are not. Watching this movie will make you understand that you are unique in your own way and that you must follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to pursue our dreams. She will not know how much that means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest !!!
