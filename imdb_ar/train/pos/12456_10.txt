This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies of its kind. The interaction between dignitaries and morally powerful is an equestrian poem and a symbol of honor between thieves and police. It deals with subjects such as duty, guilt, speech, manipulation, and trust as few movies have done. Unfortunately, nothing I can remember since the death of the "politician" in the late 1970s. This sequence is delicious, not necessary, and does not live anything outside, thus driving the spectator into a masterful plot of right and wrong without having to attract eye attention and amazing scenes are often required in less samples of this kind in order to keep the audience awake. No such scenes exist or are required. The argument is honest sand for the spectator. An important asset in this genre that often achieves thrill by deceiving the public. No, this does not miss Marbel ... Note congratulations on the music for the film to watch and taste every minute, not just to see.
