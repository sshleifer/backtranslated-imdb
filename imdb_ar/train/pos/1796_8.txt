I caught an evening in the cinema with a lady. The evening is a flick with no apology for being like this, but I can say with some relief that he is not so estrogenic that it is painful to see a man with red blood. Except for one case at the end of the film, I watched with interest and did not have to move away or roll my eyes in any melodrama immersed in itself. For their part, ladies will love this film perfectly. <br /> <br /> Anne is a grown-up gentleman who gets up on her bed and spends the last few days on the floor as comfortably as possible in her house with her two grown daughters on her side. Annoyed by the memories of her past, Anne suddenly launched the name of a man her daughters had never heard before: Harris. As her daughters silently reflect on the importance of their strong mother's desire to remember and correct her ominous relationship with this mysterious man at all times, Ann is back in her head to the fateful day in which she met Harris - so the young optimism of the inevitable future has been abandoned. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters - one married and with children, one "serial committed" - are wrestling with the main question of whether true love exists, and perhaps even more importantly, if true love can bear Time Test. Are we all in one day fate to realize that love does not last forever? Do we all realize that compromise is the only realistic outcome? The hidden fact that Ann is still struggling with the answers to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters. <br /> <br /> A cinematic film of the evening is exciting - most of the film is being spent bearing in mind that it remembers the past, which is why I think the film was filmed as if it were overly exposed, giving everyone a ethereal glow (thus making it very clear) That all this is not real, but it happened in the past). Claire Danis is beautiful (she looks really very long, although she is really 5 "5") and captures perfectly in one climactic scene where her lyrical talents are finally tested in the audition. <br /> <br /> You can not really talk about the trash in the film, which leads to Claire Denis and does not give up: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Clouse fill the main and secondary roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I can not really say anything negative about this film at all, although Hugh Dancy's struggle for his character to emerge from a one-dimensional dimension is ultimately a complete loss. The spoiled, lovable, petrified offspring of the rude rich men who come up with the great Bravado but are secretly afraid that they will never grow up for anything will probably not do much to explore the character - he has taken orders and held on to them. <br /> <br /> In the end, ladies and gentlemen, my dear friend, they will surely cry, and while you will probably do so you feel almost affected, evening will surely be a waste of time spent watching the evening. Get it in the theaters or get it as a rental to swap for points when you want to be accompanied by the upcoming Die Hard 4 or Rambo flick. Your little Sark will not cost you that much at all.
