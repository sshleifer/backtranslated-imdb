One of the best kung fu films, but not quite as flawless as I hope in the light of incandescent ratings. The film begins well enough, with the jokes being sufficiently visible to translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you think in this era) and making the sequences of non-combat dialogue acceptable (for Kung Fu, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese motion films, which have always been distinctive or (in the wake of Jackie Chan's Police Story I series), Pedicab Driver gives us a glimpse of contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the film, it is tragic in the tragedy of the dark melodrama that I thought was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The work is generally good, featuring a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of the movie. Brothers Brothers are the only two stars, Car Long Lao, then fight in the end with that longest man who always plays the bad guy at Jet Li. There is only 20 minutes of fighting here, which is standard, but what bothers me is to speed up camera frames clearly. I realized they had to shoot half-speed to avoid hurting each other, but there were smooth edits and then there. It takes time away from the battles when it is clear that the footage has passed through. <br /> <br /> However, if you love kung fu movies, my opinion here will not dissuade you, and if you do not, you will only waste 2 minutes of your life reading this.
