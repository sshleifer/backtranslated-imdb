Not only does this feature one of the great film titles, but it also includes a third group of children's actors in the 1970s, Ike Ismanman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember that this film was broadcasting Halloween Week in 1978 against Linda Blair at strangers in our house. I missed it in the first round to choose another film. Later, on a repeat, I saw that I had made the right choice. The film is not really bad, but lacks any chills or surprises. Although I loved the scene where Richard Crane shot the family dog ​​to no avail.
