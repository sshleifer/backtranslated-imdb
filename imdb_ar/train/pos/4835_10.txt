It is a story for the people of Siberia from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1960s. It is about the passion and feelings, the Russian soul, very romantic. This film is not packed, it is slowly flowing. In the second part one can find wonderful songs - Russian romances. It is much better than Dr. Zivago. Move the director of this movie to America and make a Runaway Train for example.
