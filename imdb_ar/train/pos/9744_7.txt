"Yes, Giorgio" is a tepid / fun comedy / film that has beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie but it's a movie I've enjoyed seeing more than once. Some reviewers suggested that if one wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, it was likely that he would be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Although full opera may represent a better representation of Pavarotti's opera talents, opera often requires fashion and story lines that completely hide a person's appearance and nature. "Yes, Giorgio" allows Pavarotti to use his own voice and to show personality and personality in ways that the opera will not like. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seemed to find the story unreasonable. I disagree. Greatly talented people can be self-centered and charming - charming enough to capture clever and beautiful people. In addition, people who are completely different from each other often acquire ideas about themselves and grow in positive ways of interacting with people who provide them or take them in directions they may not choose for themselves. Giorgio and Pamela became more open to the unexplored parts of themselves in relation to each other. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself enter a rewarding and audacious film with Pavarotti at the height of his vocal abilities. Worth the end scenes from Turandot to Puccini alone enough time to get there.
