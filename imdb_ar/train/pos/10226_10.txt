I was seven years old when I first saw this film. It was not so special at the time, but after a few years I saw him again, and at that time it was fun, too :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the film are: body language in Yeti "special effects" . <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for movies made by Hollywood, so that this movie was almost produced. $ 1000 :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it. Movie and video version too (but I do not think it was ever shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> See it and enjoy it! Yeti Forever!
