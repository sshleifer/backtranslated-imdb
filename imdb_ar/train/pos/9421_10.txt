Contains * spoilers * - Also, my quotations may not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone is always joking about social comments and economic parallels - how true. But for me, I see this movie much more. I love the symbolism of this man in a glowing white suit. There is a lot of confusion and dirt in the world around him, but she will not stick. Alec Guinness was the perfect man to play this - his boyish smile and eternal curiosity are very appropriate. <br /> <br /> "This is a genius - can you tell me, what is the ratio of ink to gasoline?" <br /> <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention has not yet worked, standing there is almost complete. However, more than shyness is a simple disappointment that "did not work." Never scared people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we want to stop him too." <br /> <br /> It is barely moments before he stops trying to escape again. Does any sign of the pain caused by this betrayal appear? No. <br /> <br /> Daphne's role is also noteworthy. I'm fed up with money and power. She thinks she finally found love, outside her father's company. At first Sydney was not interested anymore than anyone else. But at that moment she fell from her car and came back to see if she might have killed him - yet still thinking only about the beauty of his invention. I have finally found something that you think is worth living for. The funny thing is that it is not even romantic. It is a friendship, but in an ephemeral nature, the title is hardly appropriate. It is more impressive, perhaps even inspiring. <br /> <br /> When they discover that Michael has no real love for her, and that her father is not fully qualified for her care, she gives in to ridicule and tries to stop. Sydney. Fortunately, you find that there are already people in this world living more than power, money and lust. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sydney, if you said yes, I think I've strangled you." <br /> <br /> I love the end, when all this crazy work seems to have reached nothing. But then, the twisting bubble starts and Sidney begins, and his stride follows the tune: to no avail. Where is Daphne? We do not really know - but they were not really in love and were not really knowledgeable. He got help in escaping and got a "shot in the arm of hope". (Pollyanna) A nice relationship would be nice, but as Billy Joel says, "It's more than I wish ..." <br /> <br />
