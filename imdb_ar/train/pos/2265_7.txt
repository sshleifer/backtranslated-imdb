I am very impressed by the work of Vonnegut and I am very fond of this film, but I will not say that this is a "Mother's Night" movie that I read. When people say that Vonnegut can not be solved, two things come to my mind. One is that many of its themes are very close to the joint or even taboo, despite the accusation that it is sometimes used against it to choose relatively "easy" targets for ridicule. This means less every day passes as far as it relates to the flamenco. It seems that the directors these days are breaking the taboo and I have high hopes in the release of "Bluebeard" which is now produced. It is surprising to think that an innocent piece such as Tony Fonnegot's "siren" is likely to be equivalent to "R" if it was filmed when it was republished in the 1950s because of its violence, language, sexual and objective content, the tragedy that no one came up with After with a film-capable script. In the current economic climate, I also hope that some directors will look closely at "Jailbird", "Galapagos" and "Hocus Pocus". <br /> <br /> The other is his storytelling style, which he plays with irony. The irony on the irony but still makes it funny. It seems impossible to challenge, and that seems to be the biggest obstacle to producing great films from his great novels, because the small comments that color our response to readers are not possible in films without resorting to often uncommon techniques like "talkovers." Vonnegut suggested that there The film "Breakfast of Champions" ("The Movie") tried to preserve the comedy and came a little bit of his pain, as did Vonnegut's turkey, Slapstick "in a more exciting way. <br /> <br /> However, there is nothing wrong with the director who gives us an explanation Vonnegut's profile and "Mother Mother" are an excellent example of how a good director, as another reviewer put it, adds visual poetry to a source like this, but much humor is lost because, although it is the same plot, it is not the same For the reader of the novel, I think a chuckle, even in the end, can be forgiven, but the end of the film is truly moving, and I think one of the successes of the film is that it can leave you You really feel like you've seen someone walking on a thorny edge between good and evil, and the jury is still Kh Face. <br /> <br /> Standing alone is in itself worth a look. Technically, there are some minor but stark mistakes, especially in continuity, often seem faint and playful, but they are often up to an acceptable note and sometimes show a great deal of imagination and trickery. Acting acting in general, even if the dialogue according to today's standards a little confused. <br /> <br /> He stays well very well by going back with "Slaughterhouse-5", and there is already a film shot Vonnegut "good" a little more, mostly copies of his short stories - Harrison Bergeron, "Who am I this time?" And some other things like, of course, a copy of the play very funny but disposable, "Happy Birthday Wanda Jun." There was also an interesting piece, if it still exists, was done in the seventies of the last century, which is called "between time and Timbuktu," which it is clear that Vonigut did not like much, despite his participation in production, because he felt it was misinterpreted Public. He mentioned the strange surgical experiments in HG Wells's "Dr. Morrow Island," but it was an excellent introduction to his work. <br /> <br /> But if movies do not make you want to go to superior source material, they do not function. <br /> <br /> As the man said, more or less, the big show is inside your head.
