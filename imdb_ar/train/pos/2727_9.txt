One of the best real crime films ever made is very faithful to the book by Truman Cabot, who invented this kind of real crime fiction. The plot is Quincy Jones musical and brilliant acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Peri, the killers. Why did not Wilson continue to become a great star after this film became a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The black and white film industry and editing in this film are first class. Rebuilding the murders is scary, because it leaves the actual murders of your imagination, even more terrifying than if they had shown that the gun was starting. The film was filmed in the actual mess house that was sold to someone else after the murder. The film has a very documentary character --- along with scenes in the house of actual chaos scenes were filmed at other gas stations and stores of killers who have already gone to it. The beloved Nancy Cloeter horse, Babe, is even in the film. Will Geer has a significant role in the role of the prosecutor in the short trial scene, which was filmed not only in the actual courtroom, but also filmed many of the murders of real deans in Clutter as jurors in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and scary film every time you see it.
