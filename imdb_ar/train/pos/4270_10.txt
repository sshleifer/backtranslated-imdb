Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy at all times. Believe me I saw a lot of movies and comedy but tell me what makes you smile each time you see them. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special. It is disastrous for Serbia. The whole of the former Yugoslavia knows it well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can not enjoy it very much. Because subtitles ruin the pit thing. But they should try at least! Yes, it's ridiculous! This is the best flick in Serbian history and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have a chance to see this, do not blow up OK!
