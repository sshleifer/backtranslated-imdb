The Williams family lives on a farm in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves at great risk when the place suddenly bursts into a spiral of time where the past, the present and the future collide in an chaotic and unpredictable way. The film director John "Brod" begins to film the film on a mysterious background and gradually allows things to become strange, crazier and more exciting when the loopy story unfolds. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with a lot of dazzling images and does a great job creating a real sense of awe and wonder. The impressive and true actor is represented by a number of actors in the film as another major addition: Jim Davis, Patriarch of Hearts Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Anna, Christopher Mitchum as Richard On, Marcie Lafferty as his beautiful wife Pitt, Natasha Ryan Jenny, Steve is bold. The non-traditional special effects are inspired by the heinous miniatures, the animated animations that stop moving (including the creatures, a small, mindless man, a big burly beast, a flute and a rough lizard man), and elegant, non-shiny graphics. Richard Band's full-fledged orchestra reaches an exciting point. John Arthur Morel filmed a sunny and equally thrilling film. Fun flick.
