I was very touched by the story and because I passed something similar with my father, I was already connected. It is very easy to forget that someone who failed his body was one day alive. Then there are the mistakes they made and they have to live with. I loved the performance of Ellen Burstein and Christine Horne? It's a great! Real discovery. There is probably the most exciting scene I have seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown - it has been done very beautifully. In general, the shape and feel of the film was amazing, a real emotional journey. Cole Houser is very good in this picture, it gives a human character to a man who flows down. I liked the way the director handled this woman's life, she was never emotional, not too many - just enough to connect us, but not enough to overcome.
