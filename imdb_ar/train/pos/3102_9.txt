I've seen the Bourne Alarm last summer with a friend, Wow! I have already seen the first two films and loved them, but Ultimatum, I loved. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a CIA memory loss agent, in an effort to discover who he is. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I liked this movie from start to finish, without plot holes, slow scenes, everything was going well and well suited to other movies, but in all respects it was a lot better. <br /> <br /> The best stunts, car chases, actors, and influences I've seen in Action all summer (amazingly because of Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) but I was not "just working in this movie, Jason does not just kill and run, he has a spirit and the public feels it, so the drama is included, but that does not slow it down. <br /> <br /> This was the best for all the "three stones" that emerged last summer.
