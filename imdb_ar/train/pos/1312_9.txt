Chalk this one in the winning column, this movie was wonderful. The performances were fantastic and the screenplay was equally great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was as wonderful as Riverside police officer Gina Pulaski. Gina was a complicated figure. She was a rising policeman at Riverside Police Station. She ended up in an affair with a co-worker who knew he had a wife and children, all the time she was doing a dangerous job of going to catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Ray Liotta alike) did a great job as a confused, often stumbling police officer who had a relationship with Gina. He was an apprentice as an officer, but he was just the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his relationship outside marriage. <br /> <br /> Stephen Weber, especially from the sitcom "Wings", has done a nice job such as quiet, dutiful, socializing. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but under the surface lie a cold killer. Weber took a young, childish, avid young man to kill young boys. <br /> <br /> The entire movie was great. Every scene, every oral exchange let us know more and more about the characters. The production team did a great job with intensive days, if not weeks worth of events in a 90-minute film. This film was a good example of doing a lot with little.
