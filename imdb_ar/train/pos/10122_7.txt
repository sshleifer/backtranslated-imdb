I found this a little difficult to follow to the extent that it seemed to be retreating in the middle while I tried to put a head or tail of who was fighting from and why. One of the problems is cultural / language one. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem we do not know anything about and we simply read English translations that inevitably lose some fine details. Another problem is that it seems that there are a lot of half only explained twists and turns. However, it seems unlikely there will be a totally bad Miiki movie and this is definitely not the case. Many of the elegant and great acts of violence, which affect some non-traditional sexual matters on the side of the family. All in all a decent ride but maybe checking out a story might actually be helpful before watching this one.
