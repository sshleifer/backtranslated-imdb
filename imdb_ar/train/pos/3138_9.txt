Yes, I did, where I sat here red-faced, remembered that I felt almost guilty when I saw him two weeks ago while my wife chose to watch something illogical (compared) as "Mommie Dearest." <br /> <br /> How can one explain the attraction of "Batman and Robin" - the only ones I've ever counted, Adam West and Bert Ward. It was a terrible show, with terrible plots and terrible representation - and yes, it was a very funny thing! The same is true for this film "reunion" and "flashback". Adam and Bert are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it is stolen, and our friends (in their personal capacity) leap into the personalities of their old characters (if not their fashion) and go to see what happened. Along the way they remember the series, and see how things merged with memories of the past, where Jack Brower and Jason Marsden played the role of Adam and Bert in the television series. It was really interesting to take a backstage look at the old series, and Adam and Burt have just returned to normal (although they were not really personal) - well, you have to watch it to see what I mean.) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshen. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the old series, you'll hate it. If - heaven allowed - you already believe that Michael Keaton and George Clooney have made "Batmans" acceptable, you hate this more. But if you grew up with Adam and Bert and are still willing to admit that you did not miss an episode - well, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right - 9/10
