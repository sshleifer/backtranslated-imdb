But this is a great martial arts film. Liu Chia Liang ranks first in choreography, while Samo Hong holds the best comparisons. This is immediately apparent from his proud display of technology - instead of flashy camera angles etc - during battles. The direction is tightly controlled not only to excite the viewer through speed and movement but to provoke her horror with the subtle skill displayed. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance in the concert scene, which opened the film, is one of the most important points in the history of Kung Fu films. Liu is supported by Hui Ying-hong (from My Young Auntie fame), the talented and talented Hsiao-ho, who is engaged in astounding acrobatics, preferring any amount of metalwork with respect to the plot. This film follows the theme of unusual revenge, but with moral character and development Along the way, the most convenient decision. Humor in this is also better. If you see only one kung fu movie, it will be a good choice - it contains everything.
