The film did not work well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a quick preview. <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed the film. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the film where the former players moved to it. <br /> <br /> It was not the best movie ever, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Robin has done well with his role. <br /> <br /> The best line of the film at first, by the character of Robin Jack: "I was that SOB!" They were cleaned here so as not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> He was happy when it came to DVD a few years ago in the form of a screen / character box. <br /> <br /> I'm not a football fan or a real sports fan. But you do not need to be someone you like this movie.
