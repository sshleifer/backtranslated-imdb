While browsing the internet to see previous sales prices, I met these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a film, not a pornographic film. I've got this short film from my father for 30 years and I was always happy with it. I have shown it to many of my friends and they all love it too. I am proud to have this silent 19mm white and black film from Shirley before it became popular or known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the film is "full of vitality." Great deal! I just wish it was longer. It seems I have to be the only person who owns one of these original copies, for sale at least, so I wonder how worth it?
