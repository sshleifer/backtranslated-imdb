This is one of the best music concerts anyone sees and hears. I grew up when All My Lovin became new and became heard again today by the original artist as a measure of Sir P Mc's ability to spell any audience of any age. This document goes beyond the scenes to show us life on the road, not just for the band but also for everyone on the way. I have seen this man live in Australia in 1975 and assure you that his performance here on this DVD is no less than he has been for nearly 30 years. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system working to achieve this justice, and I recommend this to anyone, especially the Beatles fan. This is the closest you will get at the Beatles ceremony today. Singer, songwriter, lead guitar / rhythm / bass, piano, guitar, pure genius. There are a few artists who can stand alone with one instrument and keep the crowd in hand. If you want to make a perfect music note, buy a recorded CD in the studio. If you want to hear raw music as intended and spontaneous for the crowd, with all the excitement and passion of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
