This film is a bit of a shock to IMDb. Like so many movies, this is not Shoshank. But it's a good dance competition / a good personal growth film, if you can predict it. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a type of 8 miles versus a step dancer, I think you'll like it. <br /> <br /> From the IMDb classifications, I think this was the film that was approaching the top 250 films, and "the sounds were bombarded" with a large number of films, as is the case with many films that do not revolve around mobs or have no effects Private, or include non-white or non-white characters. <br /> <br /> It is an American film, but it is not an American film. The sermon is mostly set in Toronto and some fans have thought it was fully developed in the United States just because of the final competition in the Detroit border town. <br /> <br /> I loved music. I loved dancing (but I was not convinced it was worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title sucks it. I do not remember anyone in the movie saying these words, it must have "s". (No, not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There is not much hate for this movie (let's be honest, the 1 vote means you hate it) so I can only assume that it is an expression of hatred for that kind of people in it, and that's sad.
