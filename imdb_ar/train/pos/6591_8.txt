The hidden man is the love that everyone must show! It reminds me of the old 80 school chain (team, erolph, nitrider) The special effects are small but very effective !! But more importantly, the fun they have filmed from this series. This really shows! Cast full cast perfect in the presence of roles and it seems they can do what they want !! Especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Vantriska. Ventresca really shines in this one! For me it is incredible that the actor who has a lot of irony is his acting style does not get a shot in a big movie (Mr. Tarantino, this was a show that I had to bring out! Show if you can ... well worth it !!!
