The Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short story, not because of the subject (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay showed Little Nemo at this time) but because it depicts mistakes in storytelling! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to portray actual errors that he was fighting but he could not get her to do so on the camera because of the hot lights they had suffered until he took the dead and began using motion-stopping techniques to manipulate the movements to his liking. This abbreviation does a good job of placing human characteristics on small creatures such as motorbikes, painting, painting, kissing and dancing. Starwicz will also make Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933) but the first notable work will be this. If you're interested in this and other short points mentioned, check out your local library to borrow the Cameraman't Revenge DVD and other great stories from Image Entertainment.
