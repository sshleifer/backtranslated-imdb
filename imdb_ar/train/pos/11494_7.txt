The Unborn is the production of Roger Korman, and therefore it is bad and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check out this movie because it is full of past murders and failed abortions. Brooke Adams stars as Virginia. She and her husband go from one husband to a fertility clinic because they can not have children on their own. There they meet with Dr. Meyerling (James Carin of ROTLD 1 and 2). Dr. Meyerling achieved a very high success rate in carrying couples. (Enter humor here.) Is it because some children create deadly killer killer? This is what Virginia begins to think about when she begins to get some strange side effects and intense mood of the treatment. When she begins to take things in her hands. <br /> <br /> In this case, you will need to get the rest of the details elsewhere because if you tell all the good things you may be experiencing, put yourself on the Netflix rental queue very quickly. It's a bit slow movement for some time, but once you pick it up in the last third, all the systems will go! I strongly recommend the strengths of fetal violence outside the computer. 33 1/2 of seventeen stars.
