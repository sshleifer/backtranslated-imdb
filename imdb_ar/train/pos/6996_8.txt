This film was a flick of something that affects us all. I know I personally encountered this many times. Thank God, Will Smith jumped into the social issue of text messaging while driving. People, do not do it. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough time for this reason. Personally I wanted to throw my cell phone after the film. I was pleased to see other people in the theater watching the message and throwing their phones with empty popcorn bags. I decided to disable all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, let them watch this dynamic public service announcement on text messages while driving or kill seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.
