I am happy that someone has made a film about how difficult it is to risk your heart for the second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what promises you - beautiful and fun and gives you that good feeling about your heart when it ends. This plot may not be very innovative, but there are millions of ways to tell the story that have not yet been used. The cast was ideally chosen despite the fact that Scott Woolf does not appear to be the father of an eight-year-old child or even when wearing a suit. So, sparks are in all the right places, and support from the cast is lovingly supported, although you might expect the whole movie to be a channel you might not want to change. It is just an appropriate type of entertainment on a Sunday evening.
