The word "classic" is being given these days very loosely, but this film deserves a label. A mix of Neil Simon, Walter Mataho (probably the best live comedy actor in the world), and George Burns's late lament make a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to think of the format of the film if death did not prevent Jack Penny from playing the role of George Burns, as planned. As is the case, it is unlikely that the reunion scene in the Matthau apartment will be bypassed as a side-by-side. Definitely one of the island's desert films. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
