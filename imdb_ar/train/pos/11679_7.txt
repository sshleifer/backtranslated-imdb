The beauty of Clara Bau and her wonderful tunes are the main reason for watching this film. "Hula" does not live up to the best Clara movies, but it's still fun. She dances and mounts her horse and follows the man she loves. The film is just over an hour long and has been released from the winner of the Academy Award in the future (Go with the Wind). The movie moves quickly and Clara checks the arc from the screen time. If you love Clara, I would recommend Hula.
