I meant it in a good way, believe me. True in life, it is not. The whole Oirish is a bit thick, but you enjoy the cast here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. I also liked seeing Mike Mazurki of course playing boxer, what? The usual 1940s click with familiar faces and fast-paced scenes, one by one. <br /> <br /> Flynn is fine like a gentleman Jim, you never get a one-dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but everything is okay, it's a caricature and a gratification, that's all. The boxing scenes were very good, and the Foodville registration at Ward Bond was a riot, and you wanted to see all those hobbies that Billy Club was racing to the scene several times. <br /> <br /> The site you will not really enjoy, Cork was on the roll at the time, obviously see the reason why the audience liked him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
