Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hol Holbrooke and all the actors and actresses in the film "The Men of Honor" met to make this film great. Mark Isham wrote the film, so you know that music is really good, too. <br /> <br /> But: after observing a huge number of idiots, loopholes, and excessive heart attack from the start, he had to vow to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. If you can do it, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Bracher, the real hero, is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. Look at him online ... The whole story is more of a movie, as the director admitted in his comments. There were only three divers from the US-African Navy in World War II. However, none of them reached the status of the US Navy's main diver. Carl Bracher was the first African-American diver. He was the first amputated diver to be certified or rehabilitated as a submarine in the US Navy. (Applause). <br /> <br /> On the downside of the movie ledger: Do I have to tell you about one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I will mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and do it ... early axial scene where the helicopter hits the wireless mast and drowns in the sea: they do not have time to fit Mark V Diver, even if the legendary head Billy Sunday, Fitting to be "... a few minutes late" rescue pilot. <br /> <br /> So, for loopholes, idiots, and over-dramatization, I have derived "honor men" from 10 to 7. <br /> <br /> Does Hollywood ever realize that unbridled truth is better So much so that their excessive approach to storytelling? I doubt it. so sad!
