The best part of An American In Paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end, with Jane Kelly and Lizely Karon being the living embodiment of many of the main painters. Kelly was earlier established as a Paris pavilion artist, so the sequence is the logical end to a musical tone full of life and energy, composed by Gershwin, and cast members such as Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at his best here - it's a bit different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the whole effect of the film is one sponsor topped by ballet giving it a dazzling factor. No wonder the sequence of this Entertainment ended after all the outstanding musical highlights of MGM had passed!
