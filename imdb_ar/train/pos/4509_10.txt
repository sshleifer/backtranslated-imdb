The arrival of white men to the North Pole in Canada defies the freedom of Eskimo's fearless hunter. <br /> <br /> S. Van Dyke, the managing director of MGM, was responsible for this wonderful view of life in the Arctic between the Inuit. His production was on site from April 1932 to November 1933 (although some of the disturbing rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place in the studio). Although it is considered a documentary at the time, it is possible to call it a "dramatic document" where it is written impressively and narrates a story. <br /> <br /> The film shows the daily life of the Eskimo, both Winter & Summer, and actually begins at the warmest time of the year without any snow or ice on the horizon. It depicts the continuous pursuit of food, and the viewer can watch the exciting hunting of animals with walrus, polar bear, whale and caribou. The mother tongue is used throughout, with the use of address cards; English is spoken only by fishermen and the mountain faced by the Eskimo. In fact, it is the arrival of white men, whether good or bad, and the change they make in the Eskimo community, which is a key element in the narrative. <br /> <br /> This Pre-Code deals in a frank and refreshing way with the Eskimo Code of Ethics, especially with the practice of wife-sharing, which was an important and absolutely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life that would disappear quickly even in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> None of the actors receive a screen credit, which is a shame because it is some of the highlights. The most important of which is the role of Ray Wise, who plays the leading role of Mala Eskimo. He was an original Alaska native (1906-1952) who was very wonderful and absolutely believable in what was a very important part. Like any Hollywood star, Waseem will continue acting, using the name Ray Mala, in an intermittent film career, often in small, unqualified roles. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Japanese actress Lucy Long plays the role of Mala II's second wife; the names of the beautiful actresses who play the role of his other two wives are now mysterious. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a stern inspector in the northwest of the police. Joyce Sawyer and Edgar Derring, the illustrious representatives who have to hand over money to Canadian justice, play the role of actors in long films. The Danish author Peter Frechen, who based the film on his book, has a short and wonderful role of the evil wooden captain with wooden legs that angers Mala's glacier.
