Alarm spoiler! This film, Zero Day, gives home to the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who resent and hate anyone and anything connected to a school there. <br /> <br /> They go into a series of self-thought "missions" that all led to the huge task, which is today zero. The contents of zero days are not specified until the middle to end of the movie. The viewer knows his seriousness and is full of hatred, but he is not quite sure until the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know, if the film is based on the Columbine massacre, the end is quite clear. And the end is no different from any other film about the attack, they go and kill many of their fellow students in the end. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies in this attack, and this film by Al-Aqsa is my favorite, and most respected. It gives the viewer and looks from the inside to the lives of these two teenagers who hate life, and frankly gives the viewer some understanding and closure in this terrible event. <br /> <br /> Being only 7 when the events were executed, I never realized how serious the shooting was, so my article in English was set on an article or story about a crucial moment in our generation. Well, I knew that everyone would have chosen the twin towers, but I wanted to be different, because of course the Twin Towers were very tragic and specific, but I did not think it was the right choice for me because there was really nothing about it, I had no idea what it all meant. But the fire did not leave the impact. I remember the interviews, the sky's views of the school, the harm and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attractive film, to the ground, a horrific masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone.
