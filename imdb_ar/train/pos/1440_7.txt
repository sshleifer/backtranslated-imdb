I liked the quiet calm of the first part, representing Pacino and Cusac, especially watching them together. It was a temperamental setting and the intersection between the old Paul and the ideal youth. I hope Bridget Fonda got more scenes in the film; she was a serious and attractive character. The film ripped me off when the mayor's assistant began to snoop around the mafia to get to the bottom of something that obviously his boss did not want him to interfere with. Remnants. Here the story became unreasonable. Something I do not understand: Why did the policeman Vito get a firefight if the latter provided information that could bring down the corrupt judge?
