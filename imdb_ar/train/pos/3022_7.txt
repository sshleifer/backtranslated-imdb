She never realized that Charles Boer (Louis Dunard) appeared with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in the film together and enjoyed their wonderful work together. Even Peter Laurie, (Contreras) had a role in the film and had misfortune in the bathroom that caused him to be overheated. This story is about a public hustler, Louis Dunard, visiting England during the Spanish Civil War and trying to disrupt the coal mine contract, which is causing great harm to other countries. Loren Bacall (Rose Cullen), assisted by Luis Dinard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love and then continues to help him escape from an angry crowd of English miners who threaten his life. The real bad guy in this film is Victor Frankin (Licata) "The Beast with Five Fingers" which gives a wonderful performance. Great Classic 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
