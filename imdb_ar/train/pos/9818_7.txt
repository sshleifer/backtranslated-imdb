Robert Kolb (they call him a "doctor" ... I think he's a veterinarian or something) and family members move into a wealthy low-tax suburb and do not apply the law. Colp approaches the lantern, made of the lantern and his dog, almost when some of the neighbors' neighbors drink and drown in the front yard at 60 miles per hour. He presses the charges, which infuriate the children, and suddenly he and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing joke campaign. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Manson, er, Marilyn Mason instead, plays his boiled and boiled role. A non-polite wife, urges him not to use violence against his defeated brothers, who really wants to go somewhere with decent public services. But the system does not get Culp anywhere, and he's not about to leave his house because of some evil children and their rock and roll. We all know what people do when the system fails ... (but that depends on the real story, making it better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while the evil troublemakers get proper "teenage" music in the seventies of the last century, they warn us when they do not reach a good level, and the film ends by actually treating the age brackets evenly (really!). It does not make much of a generation. Glory to it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you love dogs (or at least believe in the protection of their civil rights, like me), you love justice, you love fire, love justice for dogs by way of fire, and you think people who are worried Of troubled societies are "very naive," so the spirit of this is the same. No, this is not "good", at least not in any sense widely recognized for the word. There is nothing subtle, simple or intelligent about this, it is just a kind of long PSA features to wake up. However, it captures the feeling of some memorable scenes in other beloved works. Remember in Frank Miller the Dark Knight returns when Batman drives the mare on horseback to retrieve the city of Gotham? Remember this scene in the Christmas story where the child weighs the face of the bully? Remember how wonderful it was? Or do you really hate to be seen by your neighbors in a funny matter? Yes, Monday. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie was dedicated to television in 1973, and I met it at 4 am on my local WB branch, and maybe it was not for a DVD version. But after this movie inspired me, do you think I'll sit here and take it !?
