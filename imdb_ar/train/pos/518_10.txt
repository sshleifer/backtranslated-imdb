Also known as "stairs to paradise" in the United States. During World War II Peter Carter's British plane (David Neven) was shot down in combat but survived. Meets and falls in love with Jun Beautiful (Kim Hunter). But he seems to have made a mistake in heaven - he must have died! The French soul comes to get him but he refuses. His case quickly pleaded before a heavenly court that he should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> It seems silly, but it's a really wonderful film. The script is good with actors playing the roles perfectly straight and beautifully guided - the scenes on the floor in the stunning Technicolor (I have not seen such a beautiful blue sky) and the sights in the sky are black and white! Niven is a bit harsh at times but Hunter is gorgeous (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is wonderful as a doctor trying to help Niven. The pictures are all amazing (especially the stairs and during the final experiment sequence) and the special effects are really fantastic (given the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Neven collides with a totally nude boy who nurtures a sheep! It is a beautiful and thought-provoking film - highly recommended. This is still unknown in the United States and is a disgrace.
