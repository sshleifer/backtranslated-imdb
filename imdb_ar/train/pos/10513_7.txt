If you have any idea about the production of Jane Austen, you will now repeat the same thing in all of her novels: Marriage, Marriage, Marriage! In my opinion, all the films made from her novels are a bit boring, but I love the Austin characters, because they all have a certain character and typical words they want to repeat as in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she's very good at her leading role. Also the fact that every person of the characters in the film does not seem to be able to think of anything but how to get a good partner and soon married making the movie fun.
