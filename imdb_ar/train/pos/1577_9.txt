The spoilers inside. <br /> <br /> von Trotta appeared to be more comfortable with the balance of the personal story with the history of the events than in her previous film, Versprechen, Das (1995). <br /> <br /> The direction seemed to be carefully controlled, and I felt visually that it was very attractive - especially with regard to visual narration (the combination of title sequence and the lighting of a new candle in the modern era commemorating the death of different personalities in the past). <br /> <br /> To illustrate two points that many people have been puzzled by: First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this may seem implicit, it was not intended. Von Trotta told me so! Secondly, the time frame of the events was in fact historically accurate (the actual dates are displayed at the end of the memorial) and the prisoners were suddenly released as in the film. There is evidence that Goebbels was upset about doing so, and was planning to recover what was eventually released. <br /> <br /> In general, I was most impressed by the fact that it was an original story from the story of the "over-transfer" era. It seems a shame that this movie takes a long time (for various reasons) to reach our screens. <br /> <br /> More of the same, O Margaret!
