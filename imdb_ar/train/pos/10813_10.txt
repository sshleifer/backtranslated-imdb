I turned to this to see the amazing Ethel Waters I now read about. I will confess to the pox when the pork slices and watermelon references are flowing, but people can not see this film as a representative or racist piece. It is a short film made by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was completely isolated and the stereotypes of the people involved were the jokes of their time, old trends exaggerated because of humor. See the modern black films do the same, but with new trends (stereotypes), "is" and "hood" as well. I think if you look back in eighty years, you'll find that today's movies will look completely racist. What viewers should appreciate about this film is Waters' talent and Sammy Davis Jr. the size of a pint, which draws its contemporaries, the Temple of Shirley, and looks the same way remarkably as he did with adults. It is clear that all participants in this film had a lot of fun. Why do not you enjoy what it is, rather than what you think it should have been?
