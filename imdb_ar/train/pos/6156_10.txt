This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then on 11/21/01, I saw Anwar 30 from this DVD movie. I remembered why I liked this movie. The DVD is very cool and has an extra 30 minutes not made out of the original. I did not know that when I first started watching. The film has since made much more. You must leave the music they made. You have not seen this movie until after viewing the full version 131 minutes. Many people say that music is memorable. I remember every song in this film by heart, each song has its own charm, and comes in the form of a hole. I remember when I was younger I had a song "Eglantine" stuck in my head for several days at a time. In addition to "Briny Sea" (that song was intended to marry Poppin but was cut off from the film). Please watch the new uncolored movie 30 and re-vote for this movie. 10 it really is.
