I have not seen this movie! At least not in its entirety. I've seen some embarrassing passages that left me wondering to see everything. One sequence remains in my memory to this day. A spacecraft (very compelling) revolves around the dark side of the moon. The pilot launches a flash device to depict the hidden surface beneath it. The moon shines in vision. . . . For a few seconds there. Parallel lines, squares, you could be .. then the light fades and the short glance of what ... the time has come to return the vehicle to the gorgeous ground. I have seen some other clips too but I would love to get the full movie.
