This is quite a boring film. With very realistic and very special offers from Depardieu as a bad boy and boy with realistic moods and home art connotations failed everywhere, it fails because the director does not take any position, position or critical comment on the subject he states. One of France's distinguished partners and organizers in the films with Depardieu - I think they gathered 7 - Pialat failed to engage. There seems to be an article about why women fall for the evil boy who will suffer when they have an intimate friend ready and a good-hearted husband. Isabelle Hubert, who plays the role of the phillyer with an unambiguous distinction, makes inappropriate answers such as "I do not know"; "I love his arms"; "I like the way he loves her" inquiring husband who tries to expel her from the house but relaxes and repents because ... . So he accepts and hopes what? She will wake up one day and come to her senses. Such objects are not answered in the Pialat dramatic style documented with long sermons and longer scenes do not accumulate. I know the answers do not add up, but please take a stand. Jules et al. Jim, this is not so. The last shot as cool as the movie we've just seen is a soreness and headache just for the most tolerance.
