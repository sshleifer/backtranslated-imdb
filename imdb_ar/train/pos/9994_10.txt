"Stinks of life" is a parody of life, death, happiness and depression. Black and white are always present in our lives. Mel Brooks's performance is superb as always, and other actors are also doing well. This film contains some Cabra flavors, which is why it is very good. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable gags like those where Brooks tries to make some money dancing in the streets, and all the people who pass by just ignore him, or when he meets a crazy crazy man who thinks he is Paul Getty, then Start arguing and slapping each other. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it, you do not know what you've missed. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality is that this film has a happy ending, and the reality is not. <br /> <br /> Yes indeed, life stinks.
