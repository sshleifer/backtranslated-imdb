Although we know how the story ends, this film scans the wall and is very much like political excitement. During the calm before the storm, we meet Hugo Chavez as a man with a more attractive personality than life and an unbreakable link with the 80 percent of the population, but they have already been excluded from Venezuela's political process and its oil wealth. It seems dedicated to them as it is to him. He travels to the country feverishly, reaches into the campus, talks to huge crowds, embraces and accepts ordinary people, accepts messages on scraps of paper, and listens to requests for help. People are excited because someone has reached the highest position in the land. There is an electric feeling of hope and optimism that change for the better comes to the shabby Barrios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with this attitude. Spain's pure, bloodless Castile elite, who represent a small minority but possess all wealth, is full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unintentional moments in the film is when Anne Coulter, in a meeting of residents of an exclusive gated community, complains of the attacks, "they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice." Minutes later, one of the speakers told the meeting "with caution from your domestic servants - they may be supporters of Chavez." Doh! Of course they are. <br /> <br /> In an late-night interview with the crew of the film, Chavez reveals something about his soul as he tells his grandfather's story. He can be a sensitive and poetic person, although he has a sense of humor, even a clown (as we saw when he addressed the United Nations and described Bush as Satan.) <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to gather because the coup organizers call for protest And cynically manipulating their fans to change course at the last moment and march in the presidential palace, knowing that it is surrounded by Chávez's supporters and violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot falls as snipers begin shooting at Chavez supporters, some of whom responded. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this violent reaction and claims Chavez supporters are slaying the protesters. Then pull out the camera and reveal that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The demonstrators took a different route. Needless to say, empty street footage was edited by private television stations against Chávez (which was a constant stream of propaganda calling for Chavez mentally ill and sexually stabilizing Fidel Castro). Immediately after the coup, the gang leaders proudly boast their media propaganda pillow on screens Television on how they deal with the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of both supporters and opponents. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are still at the heart of this chaos, the rapidly changing situation with a military coup surrounding the palace and threatening to bomb it. Chavez finally surrenders to avoid bloodshed but refuses to resign and is whisked away to a sea island where the plane is waiting to take him - where to? United State? How can the remaining cabinet members avoid the arrest of this heavily armed plot, Yemeni soldiers and wealthy businessmen who are closely linked to the Bush administration and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy? Watch the movie and discover! <br /> <br /> If your only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela is from the American media, you know nothing. He is not an "unregistered tyrant" or "dictated by decree" - he is very popular, being elected and re-elected many times more than 60% of the votes (something George Bush did not achieve at all) and dedication is an inspiration to ordinary Venezuelan people, Which in the end caused the failure of the coup. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film about an unusual man in an unusual situation. The talent of the directors is to be unobtrusive and the story unfolds through the voices of Venezuelans at all levels of the Barrio to the presidential palace, the bustling scenes, chaos and confusion that comes out of each coherent, tense and tense. And moving. Not to be missed!
