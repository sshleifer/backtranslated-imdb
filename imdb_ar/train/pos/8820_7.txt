I watched the film while recovering from a major surgery. While I knew it was just a "B" movie, a Western space, I loved it. It may have lacked the flash of high dollar production, which was less imaginative in my imagination and provided a great escape. Unfortunately our society has a lot available, and small deductible is very easy. In the same way that I can enjoy Shakespeare School performance up to grade, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for art. I am a cop found affinity with retired LAPD. Dreams like I am told that at the moment of crisis I will not be able to respond to someone else's life (or my life). While it was a romantic end where Farnsworth took out the bad guy (predictable) you needed a little happy love story where you could win the good. My world is really very cynical.
