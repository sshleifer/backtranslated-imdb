Every movie critic and metal head hated this film but I enjoyed it. I saw this as a child on television somewhere, and I was amazed at the scene in which Sami appeared on stage and played Trick or Treat by Fastway. <br /> <br /> The film itself was typical in the 1980s, when a man was chased by bulls and evoked supernatural help to overcome bullying but went further and must be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt from Melrose Bliss picks up on Skippy from Family Ties until Sippy gets a record from Tony Fields of Gene Simmons for his rest and loses all breaks in Hell, where Tony's song (lip sync) and a metal song Before it hits the fan shyt. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of bugs and things but the music and the overall picture was enough to keep my grip pumping 8 out of 10
