I would like to say that it is time, this film was wonderful ... and yes if you do not want to become a Christian, why bother to watch it. I saw this movie after it was already saved and found it very moving. I now see that they moved these films to another level and created a series Left Behind ... They run a close comparison and are certainly more modern to reach people. I think that in order to actually judge this film, you should see it, there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken ... Do not use our comments to judge, watch the movie yourself! ! God bless you if that is why you are watching them.
