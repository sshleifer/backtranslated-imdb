I have never known a movie that has been such a debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this film will eventually be remembered as a classic at all. I was waiting for this movie where I already loved Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some negative reviews, I thought I would be very disappointed. I loved this movie perfectly and can not wait to see it again. This film is quite different from all of the above-mentioned Richie movies, and it is much better. I have a choice from the favorite directors, but none of them did a great job like Jay Richie did with this film. I think he moved the film industry to another level (I know that most people will laugh at this comment that directs the reaction to this film, but I think the time will prove to be right). This movie is very confusing and lasts longer than the second hour or so, so I could not stop thinking about it or trying to put things together. I now have a good idea of ​​everything that happens in this film (some answers from long hours of thinking, some answers from reading other people eating the movie) and now I can not wait until Sunday when I see it again. I just hope that people go to the cinema with an open mind and hope that they will be rewarded as you and many others.
