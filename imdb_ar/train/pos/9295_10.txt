It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments regarding the dust on the stars. I laughed through the whole picture, as well as my whole family. The film itself was known as an old gang comedy - the actors were hysterical - I would bet they had fun while making it. Of course, Gold Plum and Dreyfus were wonderful - and what about my sister Everley and all of Falco and the Divine music all the time. Rob Rainer made a limousine driver laugh, and Gabriel Berne was a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Haines, Bert Reynolds, the character of Sleepy Joe, the bodyguards and the entire grave digger. Paul Anka himself was fun and enjoyable, with the added attraction of running jerk after Bern decided to make Dew from his "My Way" welcome at home to perform Vick. <br /> <br /> I see this movie was a comic tribute Frank Frank Sinatra and friends. Drifus imitated him well. I also see that no one, at any age, might consider imitating the actions that took place in this film - it's a joke - not a "terrifying" film. Cars and clothing were impressive, as was Vic's Place. <br /> <br /> Indeed, I think "Mad Dog Time" as a musical comedy is less harmful than many cartoons, TV crime series, and talk shows. I recommend the video for a family entertainment evening.
