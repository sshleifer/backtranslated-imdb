Listen, I do not care what anyone says, because Cypher is no less than a 5 star film. Cypher is not, I repeat no, film b. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say, I am an expert on the finest spy films in the world, and this film is nothing short of a first trip. I can not overstate the importance of this film. Cypher is one of the best spy films that were designed and manufactured at all technology in this movie ended in Horizon Space Time. In fact, I must admit that Cypher completely surprised hell of me. In fact, I recommended this film to my colleagues more than any other film. Other critics, some of whom underestimate the importance of the film, have no idea of ​​the hell they're talking about. Do not listen to the haters. In fact, for the most part, Cypher's observations were largely positive. It should be noted that Cyher is not just a good film, but it is also a wonderful film. Cypher is a movie genre that has been dramatically developed and made very superbly, so that it has become the head of most critics and all cynics. There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher at all. Again, the cinema, backgrounds, technology, story-telling, and acting are all top notch in the world. Of course, I will not give anything away. This is not the spoiler. Although some critics say that Saiffer should have been in cinemas, I think the opposite is true. Cypher is a movie that seems to fit perfectly for the DVD version only and not in a bad way. Cypher must be the biggest spy spy underground to hit the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... Be careful! Cypher is equally rewarded for putting it in AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Stars Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is spyware at best. Hands down and hats off. Nothing seems to be a strange truth to fiction. The future is now.
