I keep watching this movie again and again. I have to watch it at least once a week. I am from Africa and have looked at this film taught me some things I did not even know about Africa. Denzel films are full of lessons for people walks of life. I wish I were my brother. I've also seen and love Masala Masala. What an exciting position. When Denzel tried to tie his brother to the task, he reminded me of my teenage boy when my brother was always angry with me because of the preoccupation all the time. My brother always nursed my old father and wanted to see me the same way too. By the way, where did Denzel get this African accent in Cry Freedom? I first saw this film in Africa and I did not know then that Denzel was an American until I moved here.
