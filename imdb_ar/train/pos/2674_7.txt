If the repetition resulting from getting off the boat, boat, bus or bus is a way to waste time, you have to go back to the Hollywood movies that conclude this section with one montage to be able to shoot money. Thus, you are left offline and in a state of film stalemate that results from not really showing the facts of life. Long-lasting travel sequences allow the viewer the same frustration and "wait-to-wait" feeling that the characters must bear. Depressed? Yes really. vital? In fact. Forgetting this travel is the key to "not rooting" this Turkish family. Beautiful film with great representation. Sad, but worth it.
