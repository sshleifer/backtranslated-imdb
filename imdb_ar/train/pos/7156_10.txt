The holes is a wonderful movie. I love her a lot and one of my favorite movies. It's one of the few clicks produced by Disney is not cheese. Holes are usually a great animated image. I hope Disney makes more pictures like it. The holes are in fact a rare breed of Disney's brilliant flash offers. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not mean to make Disney worse, but most things are geared towards children and that's good. Children deserve to enjoy their entertainment too. But Disney was guilty of trying to attract an adolescent audience and usually fail. But not with holes. It is a kind of film that anyone of any age can see and enjoy and does not think it is inherited. Really, it's a kind of movie you might enjoy even a lot of small covers because there are characters in it you can relate to. <br /> <br /> The holes do a good job of being a combination of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a bit on the edge. I hope Disney has more risk and makes more clicks like this.
