I've loved this film since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at the accuracy of Kurt Russell's portrayal of Elvis, and how he moves and expresses himself on his face. Sometimes it's scary how it looks, acts, and speaks like the real Elvis. Fortunately, this is released on DVD, so we all can finally have an excellent version of the full-length movie. I have heard critics, who say there are some mistakes, or some neglected things, but I think that taking into account that John Carpenter had only about two and a half hours to work, and that he was shown on television (just two years after Elvis's death!) Good work with this. In fact I did not watch another film from Elvis approaching this film. Highly recommended.
