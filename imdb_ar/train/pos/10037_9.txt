The ship has sunk but the movie has not !!! The director, James Cameron, of The Terminator, did it again with this stunning image. One of my favorites is the "dinner table" scene, where Rose and her friends meet Jack after saving her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman must meet when she meets The One ... I hope to see her when I'm in the room with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have to have a connection that is "MOVIE STUFF", but it's a good thing for movies. Our greedy mom and her lingering elites are stuck with close relatives who live outside the riches of their husbands. Rose almost suicidal but Gilbert's star Grapes save her. I really liked hanging out on the boat scene. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long but awesome !!! Good story, good flow, good reps !!! Go see him twice if you want, worth it !!!
