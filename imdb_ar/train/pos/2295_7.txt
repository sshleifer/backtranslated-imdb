There is some smart humor in this film, which represents a parody and a tribute to the actors. However, after a while it seemed just an exercise in style (despite the great gags like continuing Balasco in the part of Dussolier, and good acting by all involved) and I was wondering why Bellier produced this film. Everything is finally revealed when Blier, who runs Claude Brasser, receives a phone call from his father (Bernard Beller) - from heaven, and gets a chance to tell him how much he misses. Capper's emotional is obviously effective heart. But there is no emotional tension or enough emotional involvement to keep the rest of the movie fun throughout the show. However, some scenes and sequences are really nice and anyone who loves these "sacraments" of French cinema should get quite a bit of fun from this film.
