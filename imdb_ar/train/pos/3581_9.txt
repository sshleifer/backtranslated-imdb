I saw this movie back in the 1980s and I had forgotten it when I noticed that it was on TV again and watched it. I remembered that I loved this little sleeper when I first saw him, and I loved him better in the second viewing. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duval, Glenn Clouse, Wilfred Brimley, Frederick Forrest, Jason Brisson (as a twelve-year-old boy and responsible for the accidental death of his older brother) are terrific. The film has a very real sense of it - a quiet, quiet and very moving story for a grieving family. The dialogue is sparse but expressive, and the behavior is fantastic. Is somewhat like a simpler rural version of Ordinary People without a psychiatrist but family dynamics are just as impressive. <br /> <br /> The Stone Boy deserves all the time and emotional energy to share it.
