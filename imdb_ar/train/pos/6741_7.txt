The title sequence shows the credits written on the flooded sidewalk while people walk around; the music is played by someone yelling "The Street Scene" to Fred Newman. Then we meet Diet. Sgt. Mark Dickson (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something that was not his old leg: a man on the right side of the law. But he is too wicked for a good man. After many complaints about his ruthless division, the boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), lowers his rank. Foley tells him he's a good man, but he needs to put his head straight and be like Det. Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden), who just got an upgrade. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Tommy Scalise has an illegal flowering game and is looking to make a sucker among the wealthy Ted Morrison (Harry von Zell), brought by Ken Payne (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Jane Turney). She realizes too late that her husband is using them as a stake, and Pane strikes her when she refuses to play. Morrison, the pessimist, intervenes but Pine shakes him cold. This seems to be the worst, but later it turns out that the man has died; it seems that Pine is guilty. <br /> <br /> But this will not be the story of Payne. Dixon soon fell in love with Morgan ?? But not before he loses his temper again and commits a terrible act that tries to cover him up. Morgan's father, a taxi driver (Tally Talley), may be taking rap for it. It's up to Dickson to try to blame Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger Sinarywa quotes Ben Hecht and three others from "Night Cry" by William L. Stuart. This is a powerful Noir film with excellent performances and all the mysterious imagery and mysterious ethics we expect of this kind. Continue until the end is brightly lit, which looks like something the studio image to appease censorship. Of course, the classic Noir directed by Breminger and starring Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You will enjoy this, but you can not miss it.
