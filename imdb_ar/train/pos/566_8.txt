West is surprising from the director who had a few of his peers in this genre. Just like the other Anthony Man pictures, The Far Country blends a powerful boiling story with an impressive scene to influence the landscape. They both play among some of the Piccadilly of Man such as honor, integrity, betrayal and of course death! The story is that fishing partners of fortune are Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) traveling to Oregon with a herd of cattle. Conscious of the booming gold boom, they plan to make a good profit from selling cattle in Clondike. When they arrive at Skagway, they find that Judge Gannon (John McIntire) is a self-appointed judge and is ready to meet Justice Webster because Webster broke the law, all because of an honest case along the way. In the punishment Gannon takes the partners from the herd of them, but they steal them and return across the Canadian border to Dawson with Gannon and his men in a hot pursuit. Here beautiful women and the outlawed city fill the destinies of all concerned. <br /> <br /> Interestingly from start to finish, The Far Country benefits greatly from poor James Ant Stewart's protagonist waiting to shoot and Mann. The direction of the spot is narrow text Borden Chase. Cinema of William H. Daniels is wonderful, did not do any preferences by copying the current DVD, and the film has some surprises and "Will it not do?" The essence of reeling spectators. Paying dividends on re-viewing for hard-core fans, there is still something fundamental to the first adventurous viewing in the Western world, but Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 10/08
