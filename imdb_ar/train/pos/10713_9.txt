The angry boy who lost his parents tragically is taken care of by his grandfather. Together find common ground in Gaelic folk tales that have been transmitted verbally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic events, such as highland passes, appear in stories, there is a tremendous amount of humor and joy. Everything was filmed in Sky, so there is a double dose of beauty. The scenery of the mountains is spectacular and is a rare opportunity to hear the expensive Scottish language. I am English, so I had to read the translations, but the sound of the spoken language is wonderful. Presentations are just what you expect from non-carefully selected actors - in other words, you see the real thing - people who are deeply interested in folklore and history. The community's precious work, especially on Sky, has made countless small miracles to produce this film. Anyone with the slightest interest in gaelic language, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice should go and watch this film.
