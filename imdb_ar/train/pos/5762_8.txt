I must admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them watching them all. Special horror. Me and my friends all meet after a hard week at school and work, hired some crazy tapes, asked for pizza and blew up. This box had a big box, so I was expecting less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a housing project built on a nuclear facility that contains layers of land in bulldozers, and the other covering underground layers simply. Residents of this neighborhood find a covered facility when some children fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombie. <br /> <br /> From this point, it's a big city. Fundamental influences and actions never end until the end credits expire. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not a great art, but this dialogue with its internal dialogue and awful jokes was my favorite evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party bars" that I was happy to see. You can say it was done without money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the manager looks like Brendan Fraser (he has a hijab) and it's just a land trip.
