An excellent example of "Noir Cowboys", as it is called, is where Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses an unemployed job because he insists on being honest (he has a boom leg). With nothing else to do, he decides that once he is lying. When he walks into a bar, the owner Wayne (the late great GT Walsh) complains about the assassin Wayne succeeded in doing in his young wife Susan (Lara Flynn Boyle in good shape), Michael plays along and accepts Mal Win. Then he goes to Susan and informs her of their husbands intentions, and accepts her money to get rid of Wayne! If this does not complicate things enough, the real strongman "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in an ideal role for him) shows Michael in a bigger problem than before. <br /> <br /> Red Rock West gets a lot of sites. Director John D., who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick, was smart enough to realize that a story could take place in a small, isolated town that could see better days and could involve people in any way. . It is also an amusing idea of ​​the kind of problem an honest person might face if they decide to abandon their principles and surrender to any level of temptation. It is a dark and challenging story with a group of key characters that are, if not corrupt, at least morally like Michael. The lighting of cinematographer Mark Ryszewski is wonderful in her mood. Even the peak set in the cemetery adds pretty satisfactory quality to everything. Even if the writing is not "particularly logical or reliable", the film has a great way to excite and draw the viewer directly. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job in the foreground, but his co-stars have a great old time drowning their teeth in their greedy and greedy characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh can be enjoyed in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shur are fine by Walsh's deputies (in a particularly good twist, Walsh is also a local sheriff), and there is an armed veiled role for the country's star and western star Dwight Joakam, who also oversees the film with an end-to-end melody. <br /> <br /> It's a very good film worth reviewing. It moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else is never boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
