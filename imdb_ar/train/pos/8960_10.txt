This may not be "war and peace", but these two jumps of Academy Academy could not have come if they were not for the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films I've shown I fell in love as a child and returned to without dissatisfaction. Whether you have any interest in what it offers in a fake way or not, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best, I'm not an expert for sure. But the appearance of this film is stunning. I love everything about it; Elsa Lancaster, Cat, Hoo Doo Crazy, and the Retro Center. But the way the film was shown was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> So I like the contradictions referred to in this page above, and the "special effects" that seem to be lagging behind. All this creates a truly stable world.
