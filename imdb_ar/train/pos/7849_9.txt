This in short is puzzling. The words let me down here, because this is almost indescribable, it is technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the images are wonderful and sometimes amazing), this is not something you see if you like normal or "normal" Strange, worth checking out, but if things like Rain and Stimbi hit your head, you might want to skip it.
