One must admit, that Dave has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break to Zainat Aman, the successful model, as well as the former winner of the beauty queen contest, by choosing her role, which was first designed for the first time. The spectacle with its gilded glasses and its swaying in the sleeping music made it popular for the audience. This movie is fun for the eyes, with its scenic places, people of ethnic origin, the temples of Buddha, and the excellent, naughty naughty, who seems very attractive, in his ethnic clothes and dance skills. Dave of course, adorable, this is one of his commercially successful performance. Hare Rama has been able to continue to pay attention, as she is carefully written, edited and captivated. Like his other film, Des Bardes, Anand dealt with the subject of the usual fall of young people from drug addiction, and the theory of them coming from troubled families, and troubled childhood, is very reasonable. A good artist, this film keeps its up to date!
