<br /> <br /> "After dark, sweet" is a strange mix of sensuality and eloquence. The film runs very slowly, but it takes a rhythm to tell a story about murder and emotion. Jason Patrick was never sexy and powerful (the man gives real performance), Rachel Ward is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, pshycological heat and the effects of the past flashback scenes, the oddity of Patrick's character, all become an exciting mystery. I recommend this one reason is the most boring boring film I have ever seen. Check out the love-making scene, it's very exciting.
