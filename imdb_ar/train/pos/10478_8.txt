<br /> <br /> This is definitely a "must see" for those who sometimes smoke a refrigerator in their secret hideout, in an effort to avoid falling into the hands of parents, teachers, police, etc. The protagonist is a lady in her forties who lives in her palace , The breeding of orchids, not fully aware of the fact that the so-called rich and honest husband is broken and betrayed. When all of a sudden dies, they face the truth. The assignor comes to tell her that she is a big fat city. She does not know what to do, so the gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain. I decided after a long thought to get rid of her flowers and start breeding the pot instead ... The story is completely original, and the shows are outstanding! I can think of a few films that made me laugh more than this film. Still, a melodramatic touch exists. Typical British film: Jokes are not common and there is no violence. We should not mention that it is advisable to take some drafts before watching "save grace". It will be much more fun! Especially that scene with the old ladies in their tea shop. I thought the jaw bones would explode. 9/10
