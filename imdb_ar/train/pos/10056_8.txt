We have seen this in my "Women's Health Issues" section to indicate how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and I absolutely love this film. I plan to try and get a copy myself to see it. The story is very impressive and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I liked different cultures and this film was what I needed. This is a film for the entire family, despite its classification. This is a film I will show my children. Our teacher in our class meant that the film was primarily too much to educate women, but this film was more than that. It is one of those films that will remain forever and will be a favorite.
