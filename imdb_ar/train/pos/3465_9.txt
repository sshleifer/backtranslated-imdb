I sat down to watch this movie with a lot of fear and little hope. I did not think it would be possible for this film to rise to its subject. But she certainly did, then some. First, I must say that Jared Harris did an exceptional job like John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris was directing Lennon. Often the resemblance was strange, and he clearly studied Lennon's behaviors and vocal influences. Eden Quinn was just as good as McCartney, and he also carried a striking resemblance to Maca, although he sometimes performed a trip on his "scoose" accent. <br /> <br /> This imaginative work was well written and well directed. It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a snob looking at the keyhole at this meeting. The scene on the roof was particularly moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard before as a child - it was worth and importance, and it could never have been his fault that his family had given up. I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the couple danced with the absolute abandonment of reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be this: I'm not sure that John was enough as he was filmed in the film at this stage of his life. He had settled into his home very well and was actually known to have been very friendly when the fans called him. After only a few years, he was very friendly when he approached his murderer for the first time to sign him on the day of his death. <br /> <br /> Mostly, this film has rekindled those feelings about what might have been John's life a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would come back together at some point. I am sure that Lennon and McCartney will remain friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I will see it again and again. <br /> <br />
