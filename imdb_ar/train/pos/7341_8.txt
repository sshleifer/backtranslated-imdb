I enjoy Ralph Beckshi ("Wizards", "Cool World", "The Lord of the Rings") and I'm a collector and fan Frank Frieseta. I also admire the sword and sorcery that I love the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed launching Fire and Ice in 1983 and looked forward to seeing him on video or some revival since then. So 2005 was a dream that really came to me. However, I have bought it with some fear, because I hope it is not worth watching once and then put it on the shelf as a "collectible" collectible collection until my day of death. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I was delighted with this film. <br /> <br /> As with the art of Frazetta, this film is a courageous film that enjoys physical and sexual hard to find in most fantasy / sword and sorcery movies without being cheesy or dirty. Good art and views of the Frazetta at its best. Even my young children loved watching it with me and asked to see it again and again. However, my wife had some objections because of a princess dressed in meager clothes (Frazetta-esquire too). I do not mind because it is reasonable and there is no sexual scene. <br /> <br /> There is a specific domain to use, but I personally enjoy the Roto experience. It provides more realistic and realistic movements for characters that are difficult to find in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some problems of continuity, I recommend this movie to all lovers of Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan, sword and sorcery. Enjoy!
