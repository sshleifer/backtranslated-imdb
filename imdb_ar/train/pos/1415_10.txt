I saw the German version of the film on German television and I was really surprised. I generally like watching documentaries, but I can not remember seeing a better film than "The Earth". I knew some scenes from Youtube videos that I found through random browsing. I also remember seeing parts of the film on multimedia stores, working on high-definition TVs. After watching the movie, it became clear to me why the footage is very popular among Youtube users and multimedia retail managers: it's so wonderful and amazing that you can only help staring at the screen, regardless of whether you're interested in the nature of documentaries or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation 10 out of 10. Sure, there are more exciting movies, but as far as documentaries are concerned, "Earth" is definitely one of her best films.
