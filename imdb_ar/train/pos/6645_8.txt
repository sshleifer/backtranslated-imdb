It seems that the very modern house in the rich neighborhood is the reason for the strange and deadly behavior of its inhabitants. Or at least that's what Lara Flynn Boyle's character, Col. Kennedy, argues. After a series of deadly events in a nearby giant house, Cole knows something he has to offer. Mark Paul Jocielar also acts as the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the sites (beautiful house) and elegant collections. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention very startling. It brings credibility to her character and makes the film interesting. Without it, it would have failed. "She's alive" announces a potential buyer in reference to the house. Yes, it's alive. But the story itself is not many. <br /> <br /> The presence of Browning Boyle does not happen here much, where a huge amount of film is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I loved it anyway. Cinematography gives the film a polished look. 8/10 at the expense of Boyle, the premise of a very villainous house, sites and cinematography, setting decorative and wardrobe.
