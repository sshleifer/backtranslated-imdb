After watching this movie months ago, I continue to return to my consciousness and feel that I should buy it or at least see it again, although I saw it at least 3 times when I hired it at that stage. <br /> <I loved Hal Hartley several years ago - I found that these films can make me laugh in a place that is rarely enjoyable. It's a strange feeling, a grant, and I suppose most people there do not really understand it, or make them feel rather confused and uncomfortable - I think I just get it - it's as if these films were made for me. <br /> <br /> Although I can not remember whether you really laughed loudly during this film, it is still one of the most watched movies for many years. If you do not see the humor of the grocery bag carried by Fei from the street to the church, to the office of her brother's publisher, to the office of her son's manager, she lacks the intelligence you most admire this film. The pouch is a silent figure in itself, where it is pulled around as an icon of a motherhood that is usually noisy, and Parker Bossi must carry it before the international plot for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I think "Henry Fool" is my least favorite of Hartley movies. I honestly do not remember her well - I think the character itself was so nasty that I found it boring. Hartley seems to be the evolution of female personality. <br /> <br /> Regardless of Posey's brilliance, it was great to see Elena Lewinson, one of my favorite actresses, again. Her extravagant naive is ideal for Hartley's direction. His ability to make the awful look ordinary helps him define his style as a delicious, chronic paradox all the time. <br /> <br /> This film breaks out in the story of a very relevant international conspiracy, explaining political positions in Afghanistan. This is never suspected at first. The complexity of the development of this film is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> This is an example of a "stand-alone" supplement. The less you know about Henry Fowl, the more uncertain he is about him, the less likely he is to appear at the end of the film - as a complaints machine for smoking an alcoholic chain, and the insults he has inflicted on his Islamist terrorist who seems to respect him in one way or another. It's like discovering Santa Claus is actually a sedition at a 12-year-old school. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and pleased with other Hartley films "The Girl of the Mondays" and "Nothing", "Faye Grimm" far exceeds what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality the Oscar winner never dared .
