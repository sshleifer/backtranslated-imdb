I took my 10 year old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and found myself quite fun. First, they were clean, and I mean by my standards. Most children's movies today are filled with raw humor and loud jokes to make cheap laughs from the crowd before the teens. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, and humor is sensitive and smart. <br /> <br /> Played starring with a refreshing vitality by Emma Roberts, which is gracious and polite without becoming annoying. Unlike the Brady Bunch film, where characters are sarcastic and cynical, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It is a wonderful moment when the boutique owner refuses to wear "elegant women" with their Paris Hilton Walker clothes, while Nancy is embraced in her lounger dress and her homemade dress. This film avoids the girl's experience that we need to enlighten and correct in many Hollywood movies. Nancy remains true to herself and her values ​​all the time. <br /> <br /> Mystery is often tense enough to be attractive. There were several awkward moments when my daughter grabbed my arm by the arm, but there were no unwarranted shock scenes. It all depends on stress and mood and is a lot of fun. Cast good support, especially Marshall Bell as a caretaker caretaker. There are some great films by Eddie Jameson, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves better ratings than others. I was not only happy not to go to another animated film on the computer, where the animals fly around and the gas goes everywhere, but I was also very fun. If I were there without a child, I would still enjoy the film. This one DVD will have my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
