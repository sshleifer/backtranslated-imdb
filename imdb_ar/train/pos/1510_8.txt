Yes, this horror film was a lot of fun! That's because, although the film was clearly horrifying, some stories were light-hearted - and there was some laughter at times. This is not a bad thing at all, where horror films are sometimes suffocating and very dangerous. Because of this and because all four stories were good, they are one of the best films of this style that I have seen. <br /> <br /> The common theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories include people who rent the house or explore what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> The first part starred Denholm Elliott as a horror writer with a block writer. Therefore, to change the scene, they rent this house. Almost immediately, the Elliott block disappears and works steadily on the story of a serial killer. Surprisingly, shortly after his disappearance, he begins to see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychic killer appears and then disappears - making it seem as though he is losing his mind. This may be the best of stories, because the nice ending makes the story come alive. <br /> <br /> The second, although not bad at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays the role of a single plotter for his girlfriend who died some time ago (although her image looks amazingly contemporary). When he enters the museum of the city's dreaded wax room, he sees a waxy figure who reminds him of his lost master, who is intrigued and afraid of it. Later, he visits a friend (Joss Ackland) who, too, sees this figure and is cocky with it. All this leads to ending it, and frankly, it was a bit of a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Then Christopher Lee plays the role of a cruel and stern father for a pathetic little girl. During most of this part, I looked like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his behavior. Despite its slowness, this part has ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth part was the hottest and was supposed to make fun of it. John Pertoy (the third "doctor" of the WHO television series) is a very moody actor known for his portrayal of Draiola. However, there is nothing true about the film according to him and in Pique's fit, he moves away from the group to find the best props for this vampire movie. It is really interesting that he played this role, as it seemed normal to Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires many times (give or take a bite). I enjoyed the Pertwee line when he basically said that Lee and the last incarnation of Dracula were all folly compared to Bella Lugosi! Maybe that's why I did not take this part! Despite some very silly moments, it was very amusing and fun - maybe good or better than the first part. <br /> <br /> Considering that the film started and ended well, and was excellent acting and writing, it is hard not to like this movie.
