Joan Fontaine is "The Girl in Trouble" in this 1937 musical film starring Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The film is about a British woman (Fontaine) in a mistaken American love for Aster, a musical comedy star. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Fantastic Work If You Can Get It" and "Foggy Day." The best scene is the number "Stiff Upper Lip", which happens in a fun house. <br /> <br /> The sound of the song Astaire is more powerful in this film than in other films, and it has a few dance numbers. Burns plays his role as top publicity and Allen is Burns' secretary. It's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Esther at the end of the film. It was easy for Stevens to use the multiplier because he was dancing in a long shot, and it happened between the trees. I thought they were double except the dance was very poor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing though its flaws.
