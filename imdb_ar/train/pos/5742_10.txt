Tom Holsey plays another Oscar-worthy show, like Dominic Luciano, the brain-wrecking trash man who helps put his brother (Ray Leota in Eugene's picture) in medical school. <br /> <br /> This is a must. For all film lovers and all lovers of life and people! <br /> <br /> ===========> From the small studded to the mobile dance to the repeated words "Oh, Geez" When Nicky is in trouble, the performance of Tom Duo is so excellent that you have to Focus to remember that he is a representative on the screen!
