This film depicts the fame of Emily Watson, a celebrity breaking the waves. This film is about man mania in a resort where a chess tournament is held. The chess master arrives shortly after falling madly in love with a woman, played by Emily Watson. She is in this strange man, a maniac of chess. All this in the fear of her mother, more interested in seeing her with another young man; a suitable man. Her mother feels that this is just a fleeting whim for a young woman, as she tends to grab exotic animals as well. What follows is often a journey across the psychic man. It tells the story of how his past is closely related to his present. Emily Watson is amazing in this, as is the actor who plays the main character. It is certainly slow, but worth seeing. The end was satisfactory. :)
