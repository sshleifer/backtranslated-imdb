Rock Star: Inks was the best musical television series I've ever seen! He had some of the best rock and roll songs ever written, performed by 15 talented singers / performers. It was also (in my opinion) the most endearing sense of heart and a sense of satisfaction and surprise in reality TV. It actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner !!! During the 13 weeks of this televised contest, the audience became acquainted with the audience and became familiar with all the contestants. After 30 episodes, the remaining contestants, like friends, seemed more than just a few strangers competing against each other on a real TV show. The fact that INXS was and remains, one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever, has just added to the emotional tension resulting from this remarkable reality series. If you do not have the recorded series, ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a great alternative.
