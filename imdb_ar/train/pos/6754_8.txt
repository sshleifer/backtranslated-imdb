Director Otto Preminger meets stars Laura Dana Andrews and Jane Turney in this bustling and quiet movie: The Pier ends. This film is complemented by a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, intelligent dialogue and attractive appearance with superb camera movements and bold and bold Nuer illumination. Dana Andrews starred as Mark Dixon, a famous gangster and policeman, who has a very strong reputation with criminals. After seeing one of Dickinson's cases in search of suspects and their answers, he became more involved than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is wonderful in his role - harsh and sharp, Andrews Dixon is ready to hit anything and stop him if he stumbles on his bad side. It's the best anti-hero film Noir - it's not very nice all the time, but we still get it. Jane Turney plays a strong role in her role, as it is, as a beautiful block for Dickson. Terney's role may not be too much, but it certainly goes beyond what others can do, and expels everyone in the audience with her kind smile and brilliant way of flashing her eyes. The support team is not so bad - Carl Malden is the most outstanding, where he intervenes and offers good support performance as a lieutenant Thomas. The Sidewalk Ends does not end, but it's a great movie full of characters, story and picture.
