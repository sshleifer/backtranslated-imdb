I've seen years of drugs on VH1 and I love them. I think it reflects the history of medicine very well and most importantly it contains a strong message for all generations. There are firewood, there are deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, and there are many examples of drug abuse and drug abuse. It fully covers the timeline and development of drug abuse in America in good and bad ways. In my opinion this documentary has been well executed and I would like to congratulate the creators because this is exactly what it takes to play on television these days. I am waiting for a DVD version. Must definitely see it! This movie is amazing - great time!
