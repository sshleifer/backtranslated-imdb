This film about two Italian brothers came to Germany with their wonderful family! <br /> <br /> It's not an ideal film, I say it shows life as it is or it was in the sixties and seventies the main story takes place. The characters are very nice but also have some "dark" aspects, which makes you think that these are real people. Fantastic movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character says Gigi.
