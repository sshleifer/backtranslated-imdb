Two heroes are not invited to the feast of manhood. "Geniuses are essentially masculine": This is the golden rule of Antoneta (Sophia Loren is better than ever) embroidered on her throne; Antonetta, whose world lives up to her kitchen, whose pride is her offspring. At the beginning of the film, she is a victim of this very dangerous world, but she does not realize it. She believes she should be happy.

The longest part of it, is about to be captured. <br /> <br /> When you forget all that comes between them, you know what they share and make love. This is a rebellion, especially for Antonita, to whom he belongs. Morals should prevent such a thing.

One of her last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio. <br /> <br /> Expecting the unexpected and perhaps the doctrine of masquerading a human being you will see his intimate personality that her days are numbered.
