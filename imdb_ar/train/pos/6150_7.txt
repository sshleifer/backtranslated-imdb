I have personally seen many Disney movies in my life, although none of them match in any way with Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I personally did not have animated animation with animation, it was only an improvement to try to wear cartoon characters. The film digs three evacuees from World War II who were sent to stay with a silent and socially embarrassing woman in the country. I would say that the casting was wonderful. Angela Landsbury made the perfect Miss Price, while David Thompson showed great interest in entertainment. The ends always surprise me and this was no exception. Neither happy nor sad, although I do not know if this is intentional. The dialogue was not great, but since it was designed to be a children's film, that's fine. Overall, I will give nine performance out of ten, dialog box six out of ten, throw nine out of ten and fashion eight out of ten.
