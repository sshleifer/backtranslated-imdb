The title "A Father Still Out of Action" was the title for review after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many people think the same thing but the unique expression of Kosturica is still present in his new film which is a reason critics can not touch. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Costa Rica suffers from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it remains unique and uncontaminated. Amazingly good performance for Stribor Kusturica. Much closer and less landscaping then in Miracle Life. Marija Petronevich has deadly potential of world class, please do not spoil it. Sure, I recommend everyone watching this movie.
