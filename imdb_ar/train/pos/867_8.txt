As in Amelie, recent French films seem to take a stereotypical view of the relationship between males and females, focusing on a woman who has one true love. In this case, despair leads to condemnation, leading to its evolution into a prototype of the mob. The story is clever and surprising in many ways, except that the female exists to support males. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, the translation is a bit quick, but it is not reasonable. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack, as it increasingly appears in relation to European films, is fascinating and perfectly coincides with the film forms. Nothing seems forced. Visually, this reminds me of various urban horror films. There is the Craven Wes in Chicago feel it.
