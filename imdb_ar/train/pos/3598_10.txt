Being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies, and feels that he is focused only on boxing and not the characters themselves, this film really moved me. I loved being able to see the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) going through many things in a short time, it was great for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) played such a wonderful role in Diana's play, especially as this was her first acting experience, showing true passion and portraying Diana beautifully. All the actors have the chemistry on the screen and made this movie more spectacular. I highly recommend this film even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
