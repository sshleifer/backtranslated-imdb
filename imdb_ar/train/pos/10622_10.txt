"Hate Moment" is a very beautiful film. Psychic excitement takes you on a journey through a nightmare is the life of the serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film "a must see" for any film student or fan of horror. The truth of the story and the humanitarian side of Eric tell this film about other psychological killers. Some shout to the producer, Bruce Campbell, as well as to "The Evil Dead," adding some humor to anyone who knows the genre.
