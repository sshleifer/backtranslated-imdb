This film is a moving story about an adventure by 15-year-old Darius Vimes. Darius is suffering from Duchenne muscular atrophy, an incurable disease that killed his brother at the age of 19, the number one killer of children in the United States. He and a few close friends travel all over the country to Los Angeles with the aim of putting his wheelchair on MTV, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorites. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and did not leave. The gang is heading west on a journey that will not be forgotten by all participants. Darius gets on a boat for the first time, riding a hot air balloon, swimming in the ocean, and visiting the sights he always wanted to see such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. It is clear that the filmmakers here have an emotional relationship to the material. They do not make money from sales of $ 20 DVDs. $ 17 goes about searching for the disease and $ 3 goes towards making more copies. The film won more than 25 awards at festivals, and I agree with Variety's quote for the film, "Certain to Stir Hearts".
