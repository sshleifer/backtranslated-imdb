A very interesting story from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who joined David Deutchovni and Michelle Forbes on a trip to the West. The couple are looking for the infamous killing sites of a forthcoming book; a serial killer house on the lam (not known to Dave) and Juliet his poor companion and not there. This is a good film and the story goes forward, but Pitt is not as deadly a killer as a serial killer, although he's one of his best former roles. The best thing here is Michelle Forbes, who has always managed to shine, both in her roles about "Murder: Life on the Street" or in a short series entitled "Wonderland." <br /> <br /> Voting: 6
