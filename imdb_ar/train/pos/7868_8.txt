Once again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a journey to the wild side. The wonderful thing is, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai's ultra-pure society - stars and stars, charming puppets, witch doctors, businessmen and types of brokers, yes, the whole stinking group - a sharp focus here. In typical tabloid style, their worlds unfold, with each colored story a clever sub-plot in itself. <br /> <br /> A star of survival struggling by the product after her pregnancy, a hostess and her husband, a prominent homosexual businessman, his nervous wife, correspondents and the police captain; all the shadows displayed and countless shapes between them. <br /> <br /> Hindarkar has a swollen task of digging dirt on the kings of drama, dance queens and living dead. Atoll Kolkarni is packing for you, as do Iranian Bowman and Sandia Merodol. Conkun Sain Sharma was effective as a reporter for former perpetrators, but she could have been slightly in harmony with the changing job and the party circuit. <br /> <br /> High-concentration (140 min runtime) and a refreshingly different film, well worth the money.
