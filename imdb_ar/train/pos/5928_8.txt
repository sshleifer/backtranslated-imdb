This is not a good film but I still love it. Cat Clovis is the gold in the jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - fundamentally opposed to the sleeping evil. I think there's more to this film than people realize, it's basically too harsh, but sometimes this ambiguity can be good. It contains the lines filled with the sudden end and comedic element carried by the complaining police. <br /> <br /> Has anyone found the incest somewhat disturbing? In the end, this film is cruel and random, it is very effective, and I like it Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, change the supporters. I think the surprise works too. This is not a film you want to put on, it works only if it's short. <br /> <br /> I'm still not sure whether the director lacks depth, or he did it with purpose, we know Stephen King has the ability, but I did not even read it, and I've only seen some of his films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you love hard wheat films with 80 tones, just watch it. But do not expect too much. It's really very bad of good.
