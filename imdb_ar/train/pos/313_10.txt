I'm a black American and I loved the soap opera. I have seen it dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo, about 5-7 years ago. The story was a true story of black slavery and an affair with a white leader led to her leadership and her strange and frank way of life. <br /> <br /> Many of us can learn from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her potential. Many may argue that she sold herself - but she was trying to secure her future and the future of her children in the future. <br /> <br /> It was an excellent soap opera, where I thought it would be released on DVD but not released. The soap opera was the best soap opera ever. We need to release it on a DVD or broadcast it on the TV again. He currently plays on Azteca America, which is only available in Mexico or the United States with a pay cable. We need to be released back to Telemundo.
