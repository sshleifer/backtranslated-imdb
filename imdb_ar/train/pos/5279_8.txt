I will not repeat all that has already been said by other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is an excellent film, not only as a very human story of the growing relationship between the father and his adult son, as well as a small window on the world practicing Islam, for those like me who are not familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is the young man's relationship to his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude toward religion seems to change in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them. A well-made film I recommend to anyone with a brain and a heart.
