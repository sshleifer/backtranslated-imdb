By going to this movie, I heard good things about him. Out of it, I was not really surprised or disappointed. Simon Big plays a rather childlike character like his other films. There was some laugh here and there - nothing too funny. Perhaps my favorite part of the film is when dancing in the club scene. I must try it exactly the next time I find myself in the club. Two stars are here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Donst, Those Chick of X Files, and Jeff Bridges. I found it interesting to see a wonderful look for the second Newton in a scene. She was of course in an earlier film with Simon Big, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a toss, you will enjoy it to some extent or find it somewhat boring. I would add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this film. : 3
