Gosha's last great film of 1960. Goosa, a staunch designer with a great sense of purpose, collaborated with Shintaro Katsu (from Zatouche's fame) to produce this harsh accusation of reckless national loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" is the word shouted by loyalists while assassinating enemies or "traitors" to the cause. Katsu plays the simple loyalty of his character to a manipulative politician in the name of national pride. Anyone who doubts the politician is called a "traitor" and becomes a target of assassinations. <br /> <br /> One of the best shots of its kind ever shot is a wonderful work of form, color and light. The fighting scenes are frequent, very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes part of the palette used by Gosha for his image. Wonderful and disturbing. While the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complex. While the basic history lesson of this time in Japan will be very useful, you can fight through the film without it. The few drawbacks in the film are the length, length and breadth of the Katsu scene. He has a drunken scene that outperforms the film, but he actually depicts a very careful drunk. <br /> <br /> Optimistic but one of the great films of Champra.
