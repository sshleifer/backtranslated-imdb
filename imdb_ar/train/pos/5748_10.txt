This film was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Holce and Ray Liotta's performance brought tears to my eyes and the joy of my heart - this film shows that there is still hope in the world. If this film was released at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, it is certain that Hulce would have been nominated for Best Actor Oscar. Definitely a must see!
