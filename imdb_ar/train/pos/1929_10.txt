I recently enjoyed seeing The Big Bad Swim at The Ft. I must say that Lauderdale Film Film is the best film I have seen all year and the only film I've ever felt since it inspired me to write a comment / review. This movie was beautifully directed and merged with realistic script dialogues, excellent acting, and inspirational message. Normal life is combined in an adult swimming pool and becomes unusual in celebration of the diversity of life. This is vividly illustrated by the pictures in the first minute of this fascinating film where we see only the legs and trunk of individuals in different shapes and sizes entering into a pool of water. This film is brilliantly directed where actors are placed and placed in captivating scenes, which attract your attention and imagination.
