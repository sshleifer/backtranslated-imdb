This is a wonderful film, and it is a shame that he will not get much attention outside the vulgar circles and the students who stayed up until 2 am to watch him on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but works very effectively, and the blurring between the imagination is like a baby and the hard-hitting nightmare is very obvious. The budget seems fairly low, but for the account of those who participate in it do not show much. Nor did he date it. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to close this TV when it was a few years ago, and it held up half of the scenes. It is one of those films that will not appeal to everyone; though, as usual, those who have a more imaginative approach to cinema will get a lot of this. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Puerk performs as well as Anna, the spoiled brat, and she seems to have a shame gone from the acting scene. The cross is also very good, as it carries a good personality in the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing moments (and I'm not saying so slightly) in this film, both of them traumatized by the second half and more tensions. Watch it turn off the lights! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
