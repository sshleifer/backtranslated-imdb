This tender tenderness of beautiful production pierces its bitter sweet depths in Kony. Unpublished pupils, bus drivers and teachers' personalities provide an initial discussion when the story is revealed. The adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, the bus driver, each one of their views is very reasonable and well known. When a major accident occurs on the bus, we are sent to the circle of views. All the time, teen energy charms are kept only under the control of flight organizers. Mr. Harvey suffers a lot of pain all the time. It reminds me of the teachers who were affected by the war and I did not understand them when I was a bad student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and producers deserve great acclaim for this well-designed British film. Acting flawlessly, and appropriate scenes, should be widely available but does not seem to have been given the appropriate opportunity.
