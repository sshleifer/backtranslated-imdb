A wonderful play by Paul Mazurski, Richard Dreyfus, plays Jack Noa as a somewhat successful actor, who is on the scene filming a fictional Paraguayan parador of Latin America Parador, ruled by the fascist, Alphonse Simms who surrendered to a heart attack indulging in many local cocktails ! Raul Julia plays the role of police chief who compels Noah to impersonate the deceased dictator with Noah, and Sonia Braga plays the role of lustful lover of the dictator, who gives Noah some lessons on how to act as a dictator. , Jonathan Winter is literally speaking about the actors as a CIA man in Barador, pretending to be a swing vendor. Can Noah beat the people of Parador? And repel the rebels? Giving lifelong performance without losing him in the process? Sammy Davis Jr., who has a small veil himself that pleasantly pleases the national anthem of Barador as well as Begin the Bigney, frog number one (Fernando Rey emerges as a gentle servant, Sharo is also at hand as a bankrupt maid).
