Many mysterious stories follow the standard whodunit path: malicious killing, gathering clues, potential monks collapsing, spraying red herring, inevitable confrontation between evil snake and even smarter in crime. <br /> <br /> "Forget" gives up the well and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed atrocities. The fact that at the end of the three episodes we do not have easy answers nor a closely linked package may frustrate some, but for me it was a reference to a cleverly crafted tale that investigates, nagges, and chases. What does a wicked person look like? <br /> <br /> Combining acting and excellent production to make the puzzle is not easy ... forgotten.
