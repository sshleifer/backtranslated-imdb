This is the first time I have seen this show and admit that I was impressed by what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is ideal in the role of a family man and as a reliable agent responsible for three difficult tasks at the same time: finding a murderer for important political protection; finding a traitor in his agency. He finds his teenage daughter, who is in trouble, trying to save his marriage. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Address (Brazil): "12:00"
