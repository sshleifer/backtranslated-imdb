"I'll take you there" tells about a woebegone man losing his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedy films, this small film is mostly a situational comedy of the tongue featuring Rogers and Shady with little focus on romance. Enjoy a kind of trip on the road with lots of fun, and some exciting moments continue to stay alive, a worthwhile hour for entertainment lovers.
