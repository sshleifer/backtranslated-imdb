Quite simply, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and enjoyment was not about anything other than the subject itself. I have heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how the life of the working class in northern England and their attitudes (as they lived in it) and this interesting portrayal seemed to faithfully represent what they told me. In particular, the father but smug father who "knows" what is best for his family along with stubbornness when this model is challenged. (So ​​much has changed!) <br /> <br /> People who watched the play are likely to be disappointed with the film because the story is not easily transmitted across the various media. However, the film is a historical document I have enjoyed personally, just because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon.
