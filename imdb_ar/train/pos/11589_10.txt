Man, I loved this movie! This really brings me back to when I was a kid. These were the days when teachers were still showing the movies on a real track, and if you were good, you would slowly return the film so you could watch it play back. I still remember one of the opening lines .... "Tutazema was named, he was an orphan, he lived with his sister in the village." It is a wonderful movie for children and the length of the red balloon. In the end, the other Indian boys in the village connect the feathers with a tautzema and become an eagle. He gets to live the way he always wants. Sky gets high.
