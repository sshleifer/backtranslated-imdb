The holes, originally a novel by Louis Sacher, have successfully turned into a well-made entertainment film. Starring Segorny Weaver as the leader, and Xia Labov as Stanley, and Helio Thomas in the film Zero, the roles were filmed very well, and actors portrayed their roles well. <br /> <br /> The film had intertwined stories. Led to the end. The main story is about Stanley Yellens and his sentence of spending a year and a half at the Green Lake camp. The second story revolves around Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism, a deeper story of the film. The third is about Elijah Yelnats and Madame Zerouni, which explains the 100-year-old curse on the Yellens family. In my opinion, these stories were woven together very well. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the beliefs of many people, I think you do not have to read the book to understand the film. It is easy to understand the film reasonably. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film was good, especially Xia LaBeouf (Stanley), Helio Thomas (zero), Segorny Weaver (the jailer) and John Voight (Mr. Dear Sir). Other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Meguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray) . However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team together. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney film, it deals with some serious problems such as racism, shooting and violence. The film was dramatized at some points. <br /> <br /> I would like to suggest this film to people of all ages, whether they have read the book or not. You should not miss it.
