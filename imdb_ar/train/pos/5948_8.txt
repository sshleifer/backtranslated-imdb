Some posters seem less sarcastic because this is not Mark Twain, Rodgers and Hart, but he obviously does not pretend to be. You'll find a lot of time to find a fan of Rodgers and Hart than me, but Burke and Van Hyosen did not have the cut-off liver. They also knew the Pingle monastery from the inside out and designed some wonderful songs - but beautiful, the moonlight is you. After Forever, etc. - to suit his very personal style and here they come up with another wonderful song - and unfairly neglected - once and for all, plus two optimistic philosophical entries in If you heel your neck on the moon and busy do nothing. This is not supposed to be taken seriously - why make Merlin heavy when in most other versions, if not all, a friend / directed to Arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why Sir Lancelot that has been sold to historians as a summary of equestrian and straight Turns into a bully in the schoolyard, you will not get much fun in what is essentially a fun film. On the whole, you do what you do, entertain, have a very good luck.
