Another comedy about a lovable little country struggling through the modern world jungle (for the 1940s) with wit and a local child just to guide them, this is a good entrance into the Ealing cannon. Terry Thomas stands out in the lead as a merciless man leads to the brink of catastrophe when a nation assumes responsibility for attracting world attention. Ian Panin is a brilliant romantic colleague and one of his quietest performers as a corrupt politician. John Le Misurier plays the genre opera as revolutionary leader strong. It was a lot of fun by everyone, especially the viewer; probably not at the highest level of classic Ealing, but very high up.
