Yes these films are tops. I could not recommend it any more. Gay or strait has a great doco for those who love the movie. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never dull. Great access. A film made with passion and interest. Some offers are just amazing. If you find this movie on VHS only, it's still worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I got to know a part of this document about 10 years ago and did not understand what I was watching. Interviews reveal the selfishness of performers who look like heavier boxers trying to get out of the ghetto. The director was apparently the first time to do so, what an achievement. Wonderful. Follow it.
