Marion Davis's great and demeaning features appear in this late silent comedy (1928) which also features the wonderful William Haines. Davis plays on his arm from Georgia that disrupted Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedy movies until Marion is "discovered" and become a great dramatic star. Passionate about Hollywood and its excuses. The Davies & Haines team was a great team (very bad, never having a conversation together) and guest pictures like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies) were shouting. Any serious movie buff or anyone interested in Marion Davis must still suffer from bad luck!
