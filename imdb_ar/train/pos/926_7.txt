I do not know why some people criticize this offer so much. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic and funny show - it may not be the right material for the main show time, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are funny, and everything you see in most comedy shows. Supporting characters are very hilarious. Individual ring plots and repeated Siegfried & Roy pockets are just above average, but you always have subdivisions or single lines that make you roll over the floor. <br /> <br /> The offer was worth the Â£ 8 you paid for it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
