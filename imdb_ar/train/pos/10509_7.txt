I did not read the novel, although I understand that this is somewhat different from that; the fact that I enjoyed this, in addition to the fact that this is not my country's class, leads me to the decision not to continue reading the book. Having read one word of the Austin book, I can not really compare this to any of its works. What I can say is that almost every line of this dialogue is intelligent, intelligent and well executed, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh very loudly, with perfect British and oral materials. Each acting performance has a direct impact, and Paltrow highlights the role of a perfectly pleasant dating maker. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. I found the two of them very annoying, yet I think that at least it was supposed to be some funny, it tends to repetition excessively, and frankly was not amused the first time they appeared. Editing and cinematography are fantastic, and everything looks absolutely great. The plot has great speed, you never get bored. It ends in a really clear way *, but maybe that's what they like. I can not claim that this did not please me, he did it from start to finish, and I was watching him again. There is a brief language in this. I recommend this to anyone who loves romantic stories. 10/07
