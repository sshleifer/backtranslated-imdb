Surviving Christmas is an amazingly funny film especially given the bad publicity when it was released for the first time. Ben Affleck funny as a repulsive millionaire pays the family that runs his childhood home to be his family for Christmas. Then the family leads to madness with the over-joy of Christmas. I have not been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I was impressed by Daredevil and Paycheck), but here is good in this role. I also love Christina Applegate as the daughter of a family that can not afford Affleck at first. Sure you can see where this movie goes but you do not care. Ignore what critics say and rented this movie because it is more entertaining than a lot of Christmas movies.
