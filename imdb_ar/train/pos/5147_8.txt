The first week of May, each year brings memories of the Holocaust, through movies on television. Among the many films they showed, this was the film I had never seen. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Hilter's life and how he came to power. He begins with his childhood and ends up with the highest position of strength in Germany. <br /> <br /> The movie has been pre-screened as a TV series and later turned into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays the role of Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and rhythm to give a true picture of this man. In power, and also trying to show Hitler's possible psychological makeup. The film is a biased view of director Christian Dugway? Who appears on Hitler as one person who threatens him and gets angry and screams ?? Who had such a strong grip on the Germans and people around him. Hitler does not appear to be attractive and attractive, and the film fails to convince Hitler. <br /> <br /> Although the project was dedicated to television, all production components are first class and on par with any mainstream movie stream. The value of production, collections, costumes etc. was ideal. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of criticism for this film, in the authenticity of historical events being presented. But the film still dominated, all attractive and entertaining. Robert Carlyle controls the screen and does not dominate it. Is it surprisingly good? brilliant! I wanted to see a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I think Hitler was able to highlight the feelings of millions of Germans and not the only one to blame for the Holocaust. As I said several times, it? Very sadly - our society loves wreath or trial of one person, as a representative of good society or evil respectively.
