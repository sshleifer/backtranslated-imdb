In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil), Orson Welles gave him the role of an adult. In "Lady of Shanghai," this is the only time I see her taking the role of the victim. The role of the culprit, Rita Hayworth gave him, I think he was in love with her. So, it's an interesting film. But I find the story excellent as well. The trend is ingenious, as usual with Welles: two particularly spectacular scenes: the landscape in the tub and the other with the mirrors. This movie is awesome. (10/10)
