I will not give up anything by describing the conspiracy of this film other than to say that it begins with the return of a blind young woman to Israel, her boyfriend and boyfriend committed suicide. The detective story unfolds as the blind woman tries to find out why her friend has ended her life. While pursuing their investigation and accumulating information, undoubtedly leads to a devastating outcome. The film is going well and the actor, especially by Talia Sharon in the role of poet, blind woman, excellent. It is certain that the Israeli film has reached the age of majority and is now quite competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the United States.
