When I first saw this film, it was the first thing I thought was more anime than a movie. The reason is that it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. Erotic actions are very similar to matrix movements such as motion very quickly for lead, jumping too far. Another reason I am good at the film is that the wonderful anime faces their faces during the film. The way Gackt works on the face of the frown or the way they act, VIME ANIME. I think it's a really good movie to watch it. ^ _ ^ The procedure in this movie is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde also 10). ^ _ ~ If you are a fan of Gackt and Hyde, you should see it.
