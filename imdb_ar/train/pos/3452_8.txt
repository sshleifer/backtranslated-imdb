I thought it was a very good film and it should have been shown in the theaters first. It was not like a big blockbuster game but it was going to make some good money. The film has suspense and makes you wonder how much of what is happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do well. Given that his first film did a good job. It's a good movie to catch and watch when you do not know what to rent that night. Must go just fine. The cast was great. So I recommend that everyone check out this movie!
