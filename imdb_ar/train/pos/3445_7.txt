First, this was a brave film. I saw irreversible, and can understand comparisons. However, I can not begin to understand the people who broke this film. I can see how the end may have reached the limit, but I'll lie if I do not say I wish that every man who forced a woman to have sex deserves exactly what Jared got. On the contrary, nothing has been resolved or made anything better, and the fact that the film does not pretend is what made me appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The previous comment on this comment was called the pathetic movie and claimed no adult will stick with. I certainly did it with interest. I am 24 years old. The way the film continued made it realistic for me. People used to watch the candy bars and the speed on the screen so much that if you asked them to focus long on one brick on a film basis, they not only lose interest, they destroy everything that was created, and call it garbage. When in fact it is their lack of patience and understanding that needs careful tuning and not the product of a creative mind like Talia Lugacy's. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson offered self-destructive numbness. I think she photographed Maya before and after the assault very easily and moving between the two is a job I rarely see well. Often, much like the "adolescent-oriented" films mentioned in the previous comment, the effects of rape are presented as either extremely obsessive, hasty or terribly depressing, isolated and unimportant. In my opinion, Dawson has been able to perform the balancing process. Many survivors fall prey to the following: the presence of drones in the hours of vigilance, work on a dead end to survive (and distract them) and then indulge in vices in order to lose themselves mist mist The drug rather than face what it brings. <br /> <br /> I thought this film told the truth and I appreciate it because it finally showed people a different aspect of rape. Many people leave the end of this film devouring the middle and the beginning ... I think Maya's face during the act is the end ... not the act itself ... not the revenge or the meaning behind it ... only her face ... <br /> < > Thank you
