Well, I discovered that there was a more disgusting and shocking show than the film "Little Britain" and I liked it! The League of Sisters is a sick British comedy that revolves around the most horrific, crazy and disgusting little town all over the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") look pretty normal !! The shape of the exhibition is very similar to the British LITTLE except that it is all centered around the townspeople in this hellish city. Both performances show the same plays again and again in each episode and some of them are clearly inspired "Little Britain" (especially the Job Seeker class). But the show is different because, although it is as difficult as "Little Britain" (and therefore not a children's show), the show has a sickly and sad quality that distinguishes it from all these shows. In particular, cruelty to animals and serial killings are seen as recurring themes throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now if you have not guessed, this is not an offer for children, people who are insulted or ordinary and that is why I liked it. However, you really need a very dense complexion and a terrible love to enjoy it to the fullest. Funny and incredibly unbelievable behind belief - you have to see her believe it.
