The clothes are very cheap in the atmosphere, showing great craftsmanship in the use of props, collections and effects (fog, lighting and focus) to create a strange texture and mood. The story is far from being, representation is merely functional, but it illustrates how influential effects can develop the entire visual narrative. This film is recommended for its mood and touch, not for its story.
