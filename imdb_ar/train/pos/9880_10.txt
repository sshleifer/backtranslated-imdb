This film was produced in 1943 when I thought that Judy was at its peak (looks wise). People in her former film, For Me and My Gal, often say she looks meager. Well this movie looks perfect. She is pretty and shows that she has a tendency to comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is hilarious, especially at first when trying to arrange a test with John Thornway. One of the most extreme scenes in my opinion is the delivery of Judy to Mrs. Macbeth and when John searches for her at the concert to give her a blow to the buttock (Laughter). <br /> <br /> One of the criticisms I have is that there is a pit in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean one minute that he despises her, and the next day they will leave on time, and the next time they meet after that date they will be in love. <br /> <br /> Another point I did not like was on the opening night. . If I were Lily, I would be angry with John but she was not ... This is illogical. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I had to give this movie 10 because it is just fantastic and almost perfect.
