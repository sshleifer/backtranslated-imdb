I do not agree with anyone who did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I used to love this movie when I was young and I still do. It is sweet and funny and warms your heart. It proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Although it did not include much of the story, it was still excellent, but I give it 10 thumbs. <br /> <br /> Oh, this proves that your deepest desires and dreams can come true. (Teardrop, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally if anyone says it sucks, I said "shame on you". Because it was a small movie and I am happy because some people liked them at least.
