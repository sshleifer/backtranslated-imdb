This film is wonderful. What separates it from science fiction in the fifties is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, no eyes, or anything, yet can not be killed. I particularly like the idea that this film is not done in a few days, but happens in one night, supposed to continue in the middle of the night. It's also scary that once the point arrives, you can not get rid of them. You are stuck in it, because it dissolves your body and slowly inspires your body. My favorite science fiction film for 50 years, and what is sometimes considered the perfect film. I can see why this rocket Steve McQueen to stardom. All this theme song is attractive! How can you go wrong?
