A wonderful film that deals again with the trials and tribulations of World War 11 in England. What makes this film good is touching the human element. This film is certainly of a tradition such as the British classic lines such as "Ms. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As with this film, we see people despair in time of war. <br /> <br /> The great performances here are especially by the bitter John Tao, who has been assigned a child who was evacuated from the London bombing. <br /> <br /> We'll see soon why this baby is wetting his bed. He came from a crazy mother who mistreated him terribly. <br /> <br /> The old man takes the child and brings joy to his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and looks for him only to find a tragedy. He kidnaps the child literally and is able to convince a higher person that the child is better off than in the boy's house. <br /> <br /> The picture was very good because it deals with and builds on the beloved relationships.
