I was tossing around the TV and HBO was showing a double fuss of incredibly horrible medical cases, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, this sounds fun" - I really like documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought that Johnny Kennedy was a young man, but then it was made clear that because of his condition, he never passed puberty, and therefore the higher voice and smaller body. He was in a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had a wonderful sense of humor with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, saw some more, laughed, woke up to get another Kleenex, then cried more. Once Johnny Kennedy's time was over, he went to heaven to be with the Angels. He was more than ready; he learned his lessons from this life and was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you do not have a heart.
