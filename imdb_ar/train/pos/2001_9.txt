I was lucky to see Oliver! In 1968 on a big screen film in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later, during the summer of 1969, I felt pleasure to see this film still playing in a prominent cinema in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Academy Award for Best Picture the previous year. > Oliver's success in both the theater and the screen reminded me that not all talents start on Broadway and end in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was brought admirably to the theater in London by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His charming music has become a hit in New York and around the world. The film was produced in England during the summer of 1967 and was released in 1968. Collections and musical numbers are mind boggling. The song "Who Will Buy?" Hundreds of actors are required and the British film director really deserves the Oscars to put it together in a smooth way. Some Canadian and American talent is also part of this wonderful production, but it is mostly a literal tribute to British film studios, such as Shepperton. good offer! Other film studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have given the world many films to cherish over the years.
