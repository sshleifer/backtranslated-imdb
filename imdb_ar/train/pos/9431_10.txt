This is a very disturbing film. I may be wrong, but this is the last film that Bert Reynolds considered an actual actor, who changed the role and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> John Voight and Ned Betty are also excellent. They are humble and uninterested; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. They did not know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and collections are realistic and natural. This was the days before Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about this movie is the fact that places like this still exist. In America, the people of the country still hate the people of the city; it has been almost a century and a half since the civil war. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in the rural areas of South Georgia, which still exist. Just do not skip this to Mobile, Alabama; this area has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
