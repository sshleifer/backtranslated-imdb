I do not know what the previous reviewer was watching but I think that's what reviews and personal taste are. Missed in this film was a depth, very deep film, and many layers of emotion, affecting. Love, hatred, confusion, a very emotional darkness, I thought, under the skin, you have to give up her anger, the film flows, not the love of the veil because of social beliefs, the taboos of the ages and classes, ethnic relations are not in very good condition of equality, Slow as mentioned earlier, release yourself for the flow of the film, will show the same emotions, and reveal the characters of their flaws, and bad, and excellent, and in fact very cruel!
