I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are quite different cats from each other, but collectively refer to themselves as "brothers". I often find myself trying to imitate the tired tone of Butler or Hovis or even the Scottish town of Gordon. There must be more episodes that speak about Kimberly Man. The episode about cats disguised as a teenager before getting a kiss for a spot in Kimberley to get her feet hungry for her favorite drink, Roter, classic hilarious. We can not drink the rootbeer in our house now without doing the sounds of Catscratch or Hanson Brothers from the film "Slap Shot". Classic in the future. Where can I get my first two seasons on DVD?
