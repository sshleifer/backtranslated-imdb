My brothers and I stumbled upon the heroes when our local station broadcasted its rerun in the summer of 1970. We were completely adored. There was something strange and mysterious about this, especially when compared to the usual American restart (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... get the idea). She had a similar feeling to The Avengers (it was not too surprising, because he was also British and in the type of spy / adventure). <br /> <br /> I would love to see him again now - hopefully to wait. I mentioned this offer to others and nobody had heard of it before, so I began to wonder if I could imagine his whole existence. But the wonder is that the Internet has allowed me to keep track of information about them. Hope you find a new generation of fans.
