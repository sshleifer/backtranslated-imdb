A truly impressive story about a recruiting camp in America, where young people prepare for the Vietnam War. I have always been attracted by the study of humanity when it comes to war films, because they translate personal and subjective views on war, and films of the opposition movement where the movement is analyzed, and technical data contrary to the human factor. <br /> <br /> The film can put a new spin on an already old theme and can distance itself from the usual war films, especially by focusing on anti-heroism from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bouz, who cleverly avoids evasion by the inhumane war machine, refuses to give up control of his destiny and fights for something he does not believe in. He tries to find ways to avoid being sent abroad, for himself or for your comrades. Ironically they end up finding their own just cause to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> Acting is truly exceptional, and documentaries make you feel transported to the movie. The film will also provide food for thought to those who enjoy the thrill of war movies or war war enthusiasts, and we hope to awaken some of the minds of the generation that fortunately survived the horror of drafting.
