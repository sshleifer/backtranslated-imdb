This may not be one of the best films ever produced, but in general, it's a very enjoyable and exhilarating piece of light that all participants seem to be having fun with. Highly recommended because it is a good factor on its own. Well, Frank Sinatra's "cast" leaves much to be desired, but it is a great asset to recover, and the songs fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra continued to produce many films where his ability to act was undoubtedly diminished, but in this project, his first project in Hollywood, his voice, not his acting, was his main contribution to this film. I just saw her on TV and still raise my mood the way I did the first time I saw her in several years.
