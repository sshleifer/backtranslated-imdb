In this film, 2022 looks like the 1970s. This is fun at first, but the viewer soon realizes how different this future world is, despite appearances, but the number of things we take for granted can become unavailable. <br /> <br /> Characters often interact in a strange way, with no tact, morals or respect. I think this is deliberate, not bad. After all, those who have seen social changes in the 1960s and 1970s may assume that by 2022, the population of a densely populated city will behave like this. <br /> <br /> I did not like most of the scenes, except for the priest's death: very cheap even for the 70s. The plot is not very polished. But the scenes and great ideas - such as Seoul's death and the way they deal with hooligans and corpses - "furniture" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
