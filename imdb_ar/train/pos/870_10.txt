"Read My Lips (Sur mes l√®vres)" is a contemporary, elegant and twisted story of office policies that have unexpectedly become anti-crime as the unusual matching characters turn up and down the slippery slippery slope. <br /> <br /> Both of them are magnetists, Emmanuel Devos (whom I have never seen before in spite of her long resume in French films) and even shaggy Vincent Vincent Cassell (who brought an exciting and / or threatening appearance to some American films) . <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is on the grass in a competitive real estate office which is a novice. The second half is on its own turf as an ex con and its adaptation to that environment. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Jack Odier uses the intelligent hearing impedance of an isolated woman as an input for us in her perceptions, turn the sound up and down until we hear her voice as she does (therefore, it is more annoying than usual when speaking to members of the audience), using Visualizations are also sensory stimuli. <br /> <br /> None of the characters behave as expected (she is not like that obvious victim of "In the Men of Men", not in individual interactions, not in scenes, not in the general arc of an unpredictable story line) (Well, even the last shot, but check that the audience was waiting for this achievement) as we move from a hectic modern office to a frantic disco to Roman and criminal interests. <br /> <br /> There is an unnecessary side story Objectivity is unnecessary, but it only gives us a few minutes to catch our breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of the favorite things of the year! <br /> <br /> (Originally written by Batar X 07/28/2002)
