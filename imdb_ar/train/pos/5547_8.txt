Strangler of the Swamp was made by the low-budget PRC studio, which is certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A man hanged for a murder he did not commit as a ghost to avenge the people who accused him. Uses a strand to choke his victims, and after several deaths, including the old man who runs the ferry across the swamp, disappears. The granddaughter of the old man takes the ferry by herself, also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of blurry atmosphere, making it very creepy. <br /> <br /> Cast Rosemary La Blanche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) have Stringler's role. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a necessity for old horror lovers like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
