James Dickey is a superb descriptive author. When one reads "survival," the person is immediately moved to the lush back forest in the deep south. When one sees the John Bormann film, one realizes how accurate it is to capture the essence of the book. The camera is descriptive like the narration. The characters are fully realized, and the images are wonderful. I first saw this film in 1992, after my first year in college. I was in a stage where I was watching movies that were all released within two years of my birth in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "All the President's Men"; This was easily group class. That says a lot.
