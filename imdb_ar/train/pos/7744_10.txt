You should see a film that has great dialogues, great music, a great performance and a great atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In the film, eight people will follow for a day in Antwerp, all of them individual and sometimes odd (so I love them!). <br /> <br /> I will not say anything else, just go and see and enjoy it.
