Charles Poyer is supposed to be Spain and came to London to buy charcoal in the film "Confidential Agent," a 1945 film starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxino, Peter Laurie, Dan Seymour and Luanda Hendrix. Pu'er is Luis Dinard, and everyone is out to prevent him except for Bacall. His papers were stolen, charged with murder, but he was determined to get coal for his people so they could fight the fascists. <br /> <br /> This movie has good, not good, points. It's high rates for atmosphere and suspense, and very entertaining. The Bacall is incredibly beautiful, and Boyer is passionate, and Paxinou means, and Lorre is slimy, and Hendrix is ​​patently pathetic, and Seymour is wonderfully cool. <br /> <br /> The points are not good: the English Bacall, and the Spanish Boer are supposed to be. Welcome. Boer is wonderful in his role up to the wrong accent, but Buckle is 100% American, not from the top British class. They do not have chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat miscast. Her acting does not even reach snuff; it's better in other films. But she is a wonderful looking woman, and we can forgive a lot. <br /> <br /> Paxino is out of the top and regardless. Dan Seymour steals the entire film as a guest at the hotel studying human nature. It is a wonderful part and its performance is perfect, while some other actors' direction is not good. This was definitely a lack of small parts, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching even with its flaws.
