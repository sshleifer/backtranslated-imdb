I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because everyone reviews bad. I thought: Although I do not read the books, it does not look like Nancy Drew that I heard about. But I was wrong. Sure, it was not a carbon copy of the books, but when you take a movie out of something, you have to adjust it to a large screen for entertainment. The plot was interesting and exciting with a lot of real concerns and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believing in her own way in portraying this classic character. There were several funny moments. In contrast to many of the statements, there was no time in this film that Nancy graduated from the hole. She was smart, conservative, polite and genuine. One of the things that this film has achieved well is balancing everything with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I love this movie, what a flick, what a flick! If you are wise and decided to trust me and go to see it, prepare for some frightening moments as stressful moments because I was a terrifying example! Go to see him or be a bum, let others decide your opinion on this film for you ... almost committed a mistake. I love it, I want to own this movie! I love Emma Roberts now too. It's like a mini-wild van de camp from DH. Love Love.
