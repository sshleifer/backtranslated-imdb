Manhattan apartment residents have to endure all kinds of inconvenience. The worst one is the lack of closet space! Some people who eat all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the cabinets are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, the great comedian of that era, saw the potential of Eric Hodgens, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can not stand in a narrow apartment where he and his wife Muriel and two daughters should share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, Madison Ave. Executive, has been it! When he sees an ad about Living Connecticut, he decides to take a look. Jim is obviously the first owner for the first time, where a real estate man tricked him into buying the dilapidated house he had taken for inspection by an unscrupulous agent. This is only the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Everything that can be wrong is wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a plan that does not work in the new house after the demolition of the original house. Because one of the problems is causing another problem, it is necessary to make more money, whatever the original cost would be, ending up with an overpriced price that Jim could not really afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun because of three directors in it. Carrie Grant was a representative who clearly understood the character he was playing and made the most of Jim Blandings. Mirna Loy, was an enjoyable actress who was always effective in playing against Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, the old friend of Mirna, who turned into a lawyer for Blandings, is a nice and irritating person, as portrayed by Milvin Douglas. One of Blandings's girls, Joanne, Sharin Moffitt, who bears a strange resemblance with Eva Marie Saint. Louise Beavers plays the great role of Gussie, but has little to do. <br /> <br /> The film was lovingly filmed by James Wong-Hao, who clearly knew what to do to make this movie look much better. Direction H.C. Potter is a light and has succeeded in this film which will delight lovers of classical comedy.
