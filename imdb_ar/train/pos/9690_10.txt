Pauli was nice, wonderful, fun and completely satisfactory. I went to this film and I expect to watch a typical "family" film, which in a few moments will bring me unconscious and playful on the ground. My mind changed instantly when I quickly sank the movie. It is rare to find a family film that is accurate and can be "healthy". Most of them are made at cheap cost, written and purely productive to attract young family members, who will then pull older founders into mind-numbing for 65 minutes of depression and excessive optics in sight. <br /> <br /> Piece. He tells the story of a little girl (Marie) and her close friend Paulie Parrot, who was incredibly talkative and had conversations with her often. Dorky's daddy's father found this incredible, and Pauli is believed to be hurting the mental health of his 4-year-old daughter and quickly rupturing her. We follow the adventures of Paulie (and the wrong adventures) while trying to reunite with his beloved owner, where he met many memorable characters along the way. Oh yeah, Pauli could speak (smart) and had a quick New Jersey accent. Wonderful. The plot was thick and pleasant all the time, which made me attracted. Pauli is the best family film I have ever found and I enjoy it honestly. Start. seriously. Take a copy and sit down and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family. Not sleepy. I promise you.
