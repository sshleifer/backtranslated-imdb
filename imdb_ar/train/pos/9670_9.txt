One of the best films I saw was an Irish film called Philadelphia, I'm here. I read the play before I saw the film and I loved it. It's the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not earn a living in Ireland. They are listed from the young person's perspective (which other characters in the film can see) and another young man represents his thoughts and feelings uncensored, but can not be seen by other characters in the film. It's a very sad film, but it's very moving, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to think about it. I love any Irish film, or almost any film about Ireland, and any film containing the late Irish actor Donal McCann gets my vote. I was watching that guy chewing gum for two hours on the screen, unfortunately, I have. It is a shame to lose him young.
