First of all, I do not understand why some people find this film anti-American. Certainly, there are moments in which the United States is directly accused, as in the sectors of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to some extent, Mira Nair. But come on, it's not naive charges; instead, it's based on real and documented facts, and all the CIA documents on Chile confirm this, for example. <br /> <br /> But by going back to the movie itself, the most I enjoy is a variety of moods. We find that children are learning to respect all the people who died in this event; we find an unhappy couple that will be changed because of the tragedy of that day; ordinary people who have reduced their feelings under the events of September 11 interact with each other with dignity or frustration; Someone in the movie who drops the fall of the towers for a moment of true happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - strong like these or more - offer a consistent mix and help the spectator to get a glimpse of how people around the world interact with 9/11. So, what we see is a much more complex panorama than whites and blacks, and this may lead to the anger of some people; but this is the world in which we live, and there is no room for Manichean ideologies, no matter what presidents or priests they may tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it's a shame that there is not even a release date for this film in the USA. It's shameful because most American people are asking why this disaster happened, and this movie can give some keys to them. This film clearly illustrates - differently from what some people think in this forum - that everything we do today will determine our future, and that the mistakes of the past will affect how we live today.
