Our song is a wonderful example of emotional filmmaking in its best aesthetic. It's actually a real wonder in the film. An insightful and insightful work of life recounts the lives of three young girls in the cities of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, during a certain summer of their lives when their perplexity of adulthood compels each of them to make a number of difficult lives change choices that are likely to redefine each of them, How they will continue to connect with each other in the coming years. <br /> <br /> The writing / direction of Jim McKay is graceful and ambiguous. There is no feeling of emotional gratuitous and no clich√© solutions in this film. What we see here seems, at times, like a real heart. There is a natural nature - no credibility, if you say - in our song that outperforms other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit in the film's spirit is due to key actors. The combined presence of Melissa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Lanisha and Anna Joyclynn is surprisingly strong. It will be easy - of course, blatantly - to reject, as it seems, the performance of these three as indifferent or unemotional. In fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw and sometimes unconventional intelligence throughout the film, go off absolutely. One has to be "completely away" from adolescent behavior or totally indifferent to his lack of cool originality as these three young women bring them to the screen. Similarly, the support team, particularly Marianne Forte, the mother of Lansha, completes the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie that should not be missed - by anyone of any age
