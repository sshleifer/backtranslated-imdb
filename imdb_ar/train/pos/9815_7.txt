Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released for years later), this is worth watching. The role of De Niro is not huge, but he is amused as one of two friends who first tried to prevent the marriage of other friends only to chase him later to force him to do so. Any fan of De Niro fans will get a kick from early performance through the best actor of the day.
