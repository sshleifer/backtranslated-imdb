I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw the secret of the ballot (2001). Now I know about four times that amount (I doubt I learned a lot from "None Without My Daughter" (1991)). <br /> <br /> Offside is a great Iranian budget comedy about a group of girls (working individually) to attend a crucial football match for their country's place in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to attend football matches, so the country's armed forces have been mobilized to rescue any woman trying to get in. Some teenage girls try to break up the party by wearing boys' clothes, but they are caught. The film is mostly placed on this outstanding pen where the girls are detained by the soldiers, waiting for some unspecified punishment (although the girl in the soldier's clothing claims that she was one badge away from execution!) <br /> > The film explores the absurdity of the situation. Thinking about banning women from football matches is a ghastly experience of the fairest sex - a philosophy unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This masquerade comes in her head when the girl needs to go to the bathroom, so a soldier accompanies her demands to cover her eyes so she can not see graffiti. The conflict is not about the gender battle: at some point there is some friction between a soldier from the countryside and urban girls. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film was not too culturally slow to have lost comedy to this neighbor and cousin of the Great Satan. You should be in a good mood, but no one should avoid this film because they think they will not get it.
