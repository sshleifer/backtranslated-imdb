Jim Carrey is as good as usual, and although there are a few "Jim Carrey moments", it's certainly not "Jim Carrey." It's such a movie. Has been promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey film, so those who anticipated the strangeness of the top comedy film were disappointed. I can not say I loved this movie, but again I'm not the target audience!
