I am a huge fan of Jet Li! He is the best motion picture star from Hong Kong alive ... and thus - shake this movie! I saw him in the video store, and as in the mainstream section of the mainstream video store, I did not record its existence at first, and I had to look twice. I knew immediately what I would be renting. My only assumption (I suppose I was expecting it) is that it was called (AAARGh) and not a subtitle. Elsewise, the original / alien / brilliant, motion-packed movie plot, has made one of the best Jet Li films ... although they all fall under this category.
