Not only can the good Korean film about Taekwondo, but what it needs to be good, such as the way thugs fighting, overcome the Taekwondo man in his sport because there are rules, just as in life and school and this film has clear implications for this idea. <br /> <br /> Martial arts in the movie are not so good but they are easy and fun. Friends who go to achieve something they mocked once become stronger through mind and heart. This film is not intended to be taken seriously because it contains a slap, but it also carries a message. <br /> <br /> Good movie back from Korea.
