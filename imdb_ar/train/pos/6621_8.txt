I have just returned from the pre-release preview of this fantastic fantasy film. It's unique pattern and very well. He was filmed with real actors, but was transformed into a black and white bar style that was never seen before. It takes one step beyond Sin City, and it does so well. It is a successful mix of French cinematographic cultures and cinema. Remember the story and mood Blade Runner, and if you like it, you will certainly like it too. A clever story, never boring and has some nice little transitions. This movie is a must see for any Cineville except perhaps those who do not like Sci-Fi or B & W.
