Made after only ten years of actual events, and placed in Bunker under the Reichstag, the movie Pabst is completely controlled. It smelled of pride death waiting for the perpetrators of World War. I have not seen this for more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting for the fence in her cave. Clear the dialogue between generals: "Does God exist?" "If he does, we will not." Shame This is not easy to view or buy because it will be interesting to watch and compare this documentary with Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" (also known as Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary) and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz.
