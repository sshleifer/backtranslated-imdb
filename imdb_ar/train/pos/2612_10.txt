This is a movie that has been done very well. I had heard mixed reviews during production and were waiting to be released! Cheers for the director and all the actors. Support team Eva Mendez gave what she needed to take this to the top. As everyone mentions here, the last part of the film is set. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character, because she did not do much work when the film was produced. She has quite a career in front of her. I was amazed at its performance. I totally enjoyed the film and wondered about my values ​​in life and priorities, and I am a better person for it! A great message lies within the film. Edit it so everyone can enjoy it!
