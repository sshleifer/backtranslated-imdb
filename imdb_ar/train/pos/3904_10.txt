In my opinion, this is the best presentation ever made. I became a fan of Eddie Instant after seeing Dress to Kill, but I must say I think this is his best job. However, I would say that you have certainly had the opportunity to see it live. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after watching the parking routine, a few times, jokes begin to age. But I must say, I've seen this show so many times that I literally have memorized the whole thing (which yes I realize it's sad) but every joke still makes me laugh. This is a really wonderful show. <br /> <br /> Dress to Kill will not be an old game for me. I own it and watch it anytime I need a good laugh.
