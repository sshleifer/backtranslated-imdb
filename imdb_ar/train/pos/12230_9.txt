The lost man ... the tragic victim of the space race, he died ... he never understood that the race had died ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand on the kitchen stove. But instead of yelling at something a normal person yells, shouting something that looks like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This film that has emerged ... is not an ordinary film. You've just made your first step in the incredible "The Molding Man", the famous man of the late 1970s, with the wonderful Rick Becker makeup effects. Baker was on the verge of becoming a star, and did so at the same time as the famous "Kantina aliens" in Star Wars. For a strange reason, Star Wars became a familiar name, and it was not done by the amazing man. <br /> <br /> It may be related to the fact that this movie is just awful. From the opening credits ("Alex Rebar as an incredible spoiler" ... that's what you really say!), To the fat nurse passing through a glass door, to the fisherman's head spilling over a waterfall and crashing graphically on some rocks, Many moments of unclear concept. "Why did they ... but how did they come ... why are they ...?" After a while, give up the question of why and watch it as it is - a piece of garbage is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> An astronaut returns to Earth in a state of melting and radiation. He escapes, and his solubility, as well as his body, begins a frenzy of killing a mad melt. The authorities quickly decided that the man should be stopped, but (perhaps he did not want to "cause panic") he wanted to capture him as quietly as possible. So they send one person with a Geiger counter. wow. <br /> <br /> Wrong, surprisingly little happens during the movie. Thawing man walks around killing people. A doctor looking for him with a geiger counter. Different characters are presented, ask questions, and leave. In the end, the doctor pursues the defector, but a security guard shot him for no reason, after explaining that he was "Dr. Ted Nelson." The melted man wanders and eventually melts into a large pool of goo. End. <br /> <br /> It is so mindless that somehow it ends up being a lot of fun, despite the somewhat pessimistic ending. Supposedly, a widescreen DVD was planned. Very special movie.
