One of the best movies of "Amitabh Awda" I liked. This was the stage where Govinda was strong with the shadows. The songs were wonderful and complete as we call it "Masti". An evergreen artist with the multi-faceted Anupam Kher. The storyline contains a lot of fun shifts and turns as is known by David Dhawan potboilers. With the appearance of Ms. Maduri "Nene" Dixit in time, it was a complete riot in the end. It was wonderful to see Amit performing this power and humor after a long exile. Although some might consider it a typical Bollywood masala, I was watching it every day. I give it an easy way 8 out of 10 just because it's pure Bollywood.
