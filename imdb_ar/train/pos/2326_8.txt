Danny (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister, Maureen (Emily Wurfield), so that they will begin to love each other with his neighbor Kurt (Jason London). But the two sisters have yet to realize a terrible tragedy that nothing can separate them and that their love for one another will never disappear. <br /> <br /> This was a truly tragic story of first love. Probably the most painful story about acne that I've ever seen. All acting is amazing and Reese Witherspoon makes great performance in her first film. I will give the man in the moon 8.5 / 10
