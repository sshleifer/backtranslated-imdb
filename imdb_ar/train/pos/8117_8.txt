I watched this movie for the first time 40 years ago on New York TV, and I thought it was a bleak look at the future. Wales sees restricting private freedoms as good. ("There are no private planes.") The 30-year war in the film was why the film was not shown to the British filmmakers who made the war: The concept of the future, the Korda-Ann concept of future machine machines are the real stars of the film, In the role of Bose, a combination of Winston Churchill and Edina of the Absolutely Comedy series Vaplossis, it is interesting to note that the negative Bose character is somewhat similar to Churchill's war time.
