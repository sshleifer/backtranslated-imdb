BABY FACE is a smart, fast paced, intelligent film that recognizes a movie that lasts for only an hour and 15 minutes, but it has 75 clever minutes! <br /> <br />! The story that covers so much land can be listed in such a short time <br /> <br /> making most filmmakers today feel shameful. A screenwriter of <br /> <br /> today has to study the economics of BABY FACE and reduce the puff that has overtaken many of their films. <br /> <br /> The story is not nonsense. An unethical woman rises to wealth first, then the bodies of men who fall in love with her madly. <br /> <br /> Certainly the production code has been hit by recovery, happy ending, <br /> <br /> but it is not difficult to see the direction the authors wanted to go, so enjoy what is and use your imagination For the rest. Stanwyck is as wonderful as George Brent and Douglas Dumfreely as a unhappy suitor. Not a great movie but certainly a fun movie. So <br /> <br /> BABY FACE never saw it the next time it was shown on the cable <br /> <br /> or rented a cassette. It's worth the effort.
