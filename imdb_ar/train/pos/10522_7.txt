This is a good adaptation of the Austin novel. Good, but not great. <br /> <br /> Cinema is innovative, sometimes crossing borders to tricks, but it certainly avoids the trap of making it look like a boring TV soap in fashion, given that the entire story is the driving force behind dialogue. <br /> <br /> Acting is efficient. Ms. Paltrow is in isolation, as her character requires, but the distance required from other characters is accompanied by a much less relevant separation from her actions. In other words, she does not seem to care enough about the results of her efforts in making matches. Some of the characters supported are guilty of over-representation - largely in the style that is appreciated on stage but misplaced in motion pictures. Personally, I have had problems accepting Alan Caming as Mr. Elton - without any fault on his part, except for leaving an impression like Dolly's gay buggy in High Life that it is now difficult to accept as he plays any serious role. The tribute goes to Tony Collett, who manages to radiate warmth, and Jeremy Northham, whose character is on the right level.
