This is one of the best Bollywood movies I have seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This film is romantic and really sexy at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or movies like this to keep the South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao have worked very well in this area, and the couple has attracted a lot of people to the movies. This is a movie to watch, it's a family movie and a romantic film. This film is also produced by Hom Sath Seth Hin and Hume Abc Hayne Kun. This film is the best they have now ... The film was a beautiful setting and it is also a great attraction. This movie must see ... Recommended for everyone!
