These are so-called "I'm satisfied" movies, but it made me sad somehow. why? Because I got the talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at the sports academy, and the fact that at the age of twelve I decided to leave football. <br /> <br /> Football is the red line in this film. Along with the youth struggle they have with parents' expectations. An Indian English girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family relationships, on the other hand, an English family with a daugther who wears clothes like a boy, plays football ... a mix that worries her mother! This film also shows the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It is about believing in your dreams, and living your life (where we heard it before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (Yasmina!) Play Yasminda, a girl not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and typical things for a 17-year-old girl. In contrast with her sister Pinky, he completed the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to see how a beautiful young girl struggles with her parents' traditions and finally finds her luck. With brilliant music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, and Melanie C, as well as successful Indian songs. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch, but if you're like me, I played football at all and did not reach the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.
