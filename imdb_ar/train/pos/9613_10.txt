It's hard to describe mistakes in words, it's one of those movies that you really must understand. It follows a more flexible and interesting narrative of anything I've seen recently in the Hollywood version. While their characters interact with the chain of events in different ways, and as events dictate different paths of characters to follow, the audience is merely an observer. The almost narrative flow of the mindset in Prostian, the spontaneity itself in the script will make you stick to the screen, and eagerly wait to see how everything works in the end. As far as the thematic elements are concerned ... there is a certain sequence in the film that moves from depression, to the bright and beautiful, then to the tragic, all within a minute. It works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It reminds us why independent film is the brightest star in the film industry today. Maybe with more Bug-quality movies, people will start to notice that.
