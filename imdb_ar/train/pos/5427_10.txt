Three British army sergeants stationed in India are sent to stop an uprising from a tribe of killers known as thugs. One of the corporals, Cutter, drives away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is picked up by Thuggees led by the evil teacher. Gong Dien, the water boy in the regiment, returns to the camp for help and chases the other two, but they are also arrested. Now the pilot sends the full details after the three, but does not realize they are in a trap put by Thugees. However, Gonga Dean who saves the day. He made a great film with friends, although it is politically incorrect today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks offer very fun and exciting shows with Jaffe very well in starring role and very nasty Cianelli like Guru. Rating - 10 out of 10.
