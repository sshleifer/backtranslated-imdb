This film brought tears to my eyes. John Roberts really knew how to get to the hearts of viewers, where this wonderful picture is directed where life is seen through mind and poole. From time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented managers like John, we discover that even small objects like Paulie have a heart. I could not stop my tears, although the film had a happy ending. That's great, after the thousands of movies I've seen in my life, "Poly" really touched me deeply. This is, after the "Ugly Duck", the second image that turned me upside down.
