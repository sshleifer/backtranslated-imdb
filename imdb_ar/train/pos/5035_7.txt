Makonhe in horror / suspense? I had to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is listed in flashback mode, and is about a normal, happy family of three people in a very strange predicament. I can not say much more without spoiling the whole film, sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you'll be surprised at least. <br /> <br /> All the major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job guiding these children, and his work is wonderful. Makonogi's representation is solid and fully consistent with the bill. <br /> <br /> This film defies thinking. Is my father crazy? Is there a god? Do demons exist? How far will you go to correct a mistake. What is "correct" anyway? I am still thinking. <br /> <br /> I therefore recommend "Frailty". 7/10 This is one of those films that deserve a second or third watch reward.
