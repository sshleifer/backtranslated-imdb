For anyone who has played video games here, anyone has noticed that the GTA: Vice City Mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie related to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game (Rockstar Games) to copy some things from this film, Best 80s movies there, I recommend this to anyone who has not seen it after 10/10 without questions
