An American in Paris is a show for Jenny Kelly. Watch while the gene sings, acts and dances on its way across Paris in any number of positions. Some are purely majestic, others are pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly did because he made the film just a year before "Singin 'in The Rain." He is certainly one of the greats of all time. It is interesting to look at the similarities between the two films, especially in the characters of Kelly, and the only major difference is that one is in Paris and the other in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Some have said that Leslie Karon's representation was less than pure. Cyd Charisse, originally intended for the role, may have been better, but Karon is fully believable and has a chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's short role in this film gave just what he needed, someone who did not look like Jane Kelly. Filling the role as a man is not an easy task, but Levent did it as well as any other progress. <br /> <br /> The song and dance routines are all perfect. Even the long ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film without him. Given that there was not much time to make this loving relationship reasonable, Minelli used this sequence to make it look as if I had spent four hours with them. Creator! <br /> <br /> I have to make this film with Singin because it is very similar in story and song. Singin barely gets a nod due to the performance of Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> The full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 Stars.
