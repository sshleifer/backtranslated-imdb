I am from Belgium, so my English writing is fairly bad, so sorry ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those unknown movies that only run once on the TV and they seem to disappear in the air. I was browsing my old VHS Video collection and encountered this title, I searched for it and got an IMDb score of more than 7/10, which is very decent. <br /> <br /> I must admit that it is very well placed to film and that is why I am perplexed. This is the only film made by this director ...? So how did not make a lot of movies after this good ...? You must force someone who has a lot of potential to produce another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really would like to see that he collects his works and makes another good film like this, please .... .?
