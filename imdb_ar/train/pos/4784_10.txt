It's good to see a movie with real people who have sincere feelings. Sissy Spacek is quite convincing as a simple, yet nice, daughter to Robert Farnsworth, who finally, in his last role, managed to show what a good actor was. It's hard to believe that this is David Lynch's film. It's slow and so sweet and moving. One of the best is that you do not like car chases and scenes of sex and violence.
