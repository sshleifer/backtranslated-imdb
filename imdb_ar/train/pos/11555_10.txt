A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... It's a wonderful movie I can watch over and over again. It's definitely one of the top ten comedy movies. Through a wonderful crew, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matau formulated an ideal scenario written by Neil Simon, based on his play. If you have a digital cable, you'll get the menu at the bottom of the screen to show what's there. This movie usually gives *** star stars but it is actually worth **** stars. If you're really watching this movie, you can say it will be funny and new a hundred years from now.
