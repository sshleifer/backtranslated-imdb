This movie contains more action before the opening credits than any Hollywood movies of this kind. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li. This team has provided you with many film productions in Hong Kong, including one series in China. The work was quick and furious with the amazing wires. I just saw the wires in the shots. Regardless of the event, the story itself was strong and not only used as a filler. To find any other motion movies competing for this, you should look for a movie director in Hong Kong in your area. They're really worth checking out and usually never disappoint.
