"Der Todesking" is not exactly the kind of movie that makes you fun? There is the second cult of Jurg Buttegre, which is actually much better than the notorious "Necromantic", which is in seven short episodes? One for each day of the week? Revolves around suicides unrelated to people. In between these very disturbing episodes already, Buttgereit enters really terrifying images of a badly decomposed male corpse. Not all episodes are equal in strength, however, as "Der Todesking" is ranked high in the most frustrating Art House films list. Wednesday's episodes, which include a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a stranger in the park, and one Sunday, focusing on a younger man who attacks himself to death, are too intense and devastating. The added value of this film, or any other shock like it, is debatable and I do not even know whether Buttgereit has any kind of messages to communicate here or not. There is a vague reference to a strange series message encouraging readers to commit suicide, but we are often unaware of the motives of these people to end their lives dramatically. Contrary to what I was expecting in full, Der Todesking is not an exploitative or a disgusting fee! On the contrary, in fact, I could never have hoped that Buttgereit would be accurate and educated in portraying pure human misery. The Thursday episode is an ideal example of it, as it elegantly displays different views of a famous German bridge while the names, ages and professions of people who jumped on the screen appear. Production values ​​are extremely poor and liberalization often lacks professionalism, but that is not what really matters in this kind of cinema. The subject is strong and forces us to think of less cheerfulness ?? But also indispensable? Aspects of life. Great use of tragic music, too!
