These French and those Germans certainly have a long history of disaffection with each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or the companionship in translation takes place in 1931. After only a few years, Hitler was besieging Germany and began his plans to seize the world, France was the victim of his ambitions. But these are times of serenity compared to the future. A group of miners on the border are trying to cross into France to get work. They are later rejected in a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster occurred in the French mines and a well-written and written scene, a group of German miners decided to come to the rescue. A simple story is not it? Babest was a poet of silent cinema and I'm not sure whether this is his first soundtrack, but his hair is there to be discovered. It is not difficult but it brings rugged realism to adversity. There is even a backlash of World War II that points to the purpose of this story. The film is supposed to be based on a real event, and the events are done proudly with management and tension. Smetimes, that's what the movie needs.
