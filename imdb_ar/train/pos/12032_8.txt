The film I will be reviewing is a small television film produced in 1996 starring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> Hero / protagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager. Who feels the pressure of such a dominant father (Baldwin). However, when she meets with a former con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "was not kissed") they "fall" immediately to each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where they took their relationship. She manipulated him to kill her parents, to protect their "love", but she just used it to get rid of her parents so she could be with Brad (David's future companion to "Sabrina" for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually surprised me as an evil maneuver, carrying the film well with her friends and Nick so she could get rid of the killing. The rest of the support team works well and keeps each one alone when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was produced and released the same year, Hart began portraying the charming Sabrina teen and this shows that she can act in the types of movies and television. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is somewhat dated it still stands out some of its best works involving drama or excitement and I look forward to the "Nine Dead" that comes out in November because it shows that they can be seen as Other people are not called "Clarissa Darling" or "Sabrina Spellman" <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina.You can see this online, so I suggest checking it out.
