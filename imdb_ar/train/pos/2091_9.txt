What Irving Thalberg did in making this film today will never be re-tested. He made a Chinese story with Western players even if they were Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly among others. <br /> <br /> Perhaps partly because the Westerners wrote the story, Pearl Buck, who won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Perhaps Ms. Pak, the daughter of the Chinese missionaries, has brought China to the consciousness of America more than any another person. It is not the political struggle in China, but life and misery every day that we find in the good land. Unfortunately later, Perle Pak became a defender of the Kuomintang Party Chiang Kai-shek with all his virtues and transgressions. The rest of her literary work did not match The Good Earth. <br /> <br /> The Sundowners have a great description of China's comparison to Australia by Peter Ostinov. When asked about the difference, Ostinov said that China is very large and very full, Australia is too big and too empty. That's what you see in The Good Earth, China is so big and full of people more than you can handle at times. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a young man buying a wife from a large house where she was a slave. The woman named O-Lan (Louisie Rainer) bears him two sons and sees him at all the good and bad times they have gone through, the drought, the famine, the revolution, and the plague of locusts. <br /> <br /> Louis Rainer won the title. The second of two consecutive Oscars to shoot O-Lan. You may have recorded some sort of record in that Oscar must be the leading player with the least amount of dialogue. Whatever you do practically is through facial expressions, it was possible to have her performance in a silent film with very few translations. I think John Mills only in "Ryan's Daughter" had fewer words and was playing mentally retarded. <br /> <br /> Money does not always appreciate how much it supports this male-dominated culture. Rainer helps in this area, bears and loves children, and does housework. When Mony becomes a man of ownership, he takes a second Chinese wife into the cup causing him a lot of grief. Rainer still bears everything smoothly. Mony is still not a bad man, and it is a tribute to the film and his representation and the book that you do not hate and fill the cultural gap. <br /> <br /> We now have a group of Eastern players who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised that Good Earth has not been to all the movies again at this point. I bet the Chinese government will allow some US companies to do so in a real location. <br /> <br /> Until then we have this wonderful classic game that we appreciate and enjoy.
