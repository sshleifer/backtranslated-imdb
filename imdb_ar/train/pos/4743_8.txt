This is a very strange film from Hong Kong in several ways. First, many business sequences are not really great fun. The first gun battle in the film was ridiculous. No silly cold, or even silly funny, but just silly. This does not mean that there are some great motion scenes, but simply do not hit the level of some of the other movies I've seen. The other side is that this movie already contains characters, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except the bad guys' head, which is flat as a billiard table) and most of them behave fairly well. All the fans in this movie are just fun to watch. Dialogue is very intelligent, and does not seem to lose much in translation. This film deserves his vision, but I hope he does not think that the uninformed American public is the best that Hong Kong has to offer.
