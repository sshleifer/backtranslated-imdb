It's really a light-hearted romantic comedy. You can not make a mistake in the kind-hearted Megan Ryan crap with the genius of Albert Einstein. Usually, I'm not a fan of fully fabricated fairy tales about actual people, now dead and unable to defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein may have had a chuckle of that. <br /> <br /> It's 1950 ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a beautiful, young, scatter-eyed mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), all ready to marry a stifling jerk, a behavioral researcher named James, just because he has the brains she is looking for in the future father of her children. However, it is a love at first glance when her car crashes and meets with a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Because she does not think Ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, not Albert Einstein, plays the role of the playmaker, and was assisted by three of his devious friends, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert has to make Ed seem smart enough, so the concoctions are a farce that he imagines as a physicist ... naturally with funny results. <br /> <br /> Walter Mattau considers himself the usual funny, and proceeds from the personality of Einstein completely effectively. With his three friends professors, Kurt, Nathan, and Boris, it was followed by a lot of laughter. Einstein had a real human aspect and this film takes him one step (infamous) forward. If you hang all the logic, you can imagine this almost absurd story! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite his main character) but it is a wonderful and refreshing film. One of the best types of comedy romance.
