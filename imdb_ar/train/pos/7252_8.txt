I saw this film before joining the British Army. I passed my basic training, at first it was difficult and then I made it easier. I spent my time at the height of NI's problems and the Cold War. There were times when I asked myself about what I got, not for a long time, as the training would always be received and you would always respond to the instinct. The sound that was used to show what the soldiers were thinking was the case, although I would have added breathing and heart rate because this sounds like hammering in your ear drums in certain positions. After a few years I was in Canada for a family gathering. My aunt, who lives in the United States of America and a lecturer in Columbus, Uni-Ohio, made a paper on the effects of the British army in northern New York State. I spent some time researching. Although the former Pat was very hostile to Britain. I made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only answer was to see the movie "Long Day Die". He is the closest to the civilian who will realize why the soldier is doing what he does. The answer is true in the end.
