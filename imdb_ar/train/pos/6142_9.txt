Disney's tasty film with Angela Lansbury in good shape as a middle-aged man turns his attention to magic in World War 11 in England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the film and is ideal for the part. It's Jessica Fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit of the children or the mother of England at a time of peril. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor of magic in an attempt to obtain certain information about magic. These three loved ones who have been sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are fantastic in this fascinating film for all of us regardless of age. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowell and Sammy Sam are given little to do in this lovable movie. <br /> <br /> I've really thought of Ben Stiller's film "A Night in the Museum" at the end of the film when the relics go back to life to fight a Nazi invasion in a small British coastal town.
