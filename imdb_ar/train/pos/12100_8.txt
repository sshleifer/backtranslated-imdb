The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Blood Castle) is very strange. That's because parts of the film are in French with translation and translation of the rest into English from French. Sometimes, characters turned between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to get a translation of "JUST" only or just mentioned, there was no difference! Strange, but still scalable. <br /> <br /> The story claims to be based on the story of Bo, though I can not remember any of them. In fact, Bo's character appears at the beginning and end of the film - although he does not look like him in particular. <br /> <br /> A rich man betting with a man on his luck can not stay all night at home. It seems like an easy bet to win - even if the house is too creepy. However, it can not be that easy, as the rich man says that all those who have already bet have died - yet this idiot STILL wants to make a bet! While in the house, Barbara Steel meets and falls madly at her. Later, however, he knows she died more than a decade ago! How could this be ?! I can tell you more about the plot but I do not want to spoil any of the suspense. See for yourself to know the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie gets very high marks to create a creepy atmosphere. The house, black and white film and music work together to shoot a scary film. As for the plot, it is interesting - especially since there are many twists and turns - so much that it only wonders who and who is among the uninsured at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake who was unnecessarily killed. I felt sorry because he was crazy, and it seemed necessary. <br /> <br /> Also, parents may want to know that in the end there is little nudity. A beautiful eye-catching woman looks nude, but it is hardly necessary for this plot.
