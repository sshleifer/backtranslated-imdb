A stunning film, in theory, must be boring but is presented with incredible and wonderful literature as long as you feel desperate to find it. Instead of relying on cliches and excessive dramas, the plot unfolds through a series of incredible real moments. The main characters are not ideal, so communicating with them as people you can know is easy. The film does not try to attract laughter, or put the ideal on the public, but it simply shows us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. <br /> <br /> Now I'm still waiting for the weekend so I can see the result. An exciting, thought-provoking and funny look at love I think it should be an absolute romantic romance there with Casablanca and Breakfast in Tiffany's. Will soften even the most difficult heart.
