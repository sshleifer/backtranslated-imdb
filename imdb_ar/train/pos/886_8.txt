This was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a group of six called "Frenchfilm" to clean our French language before our planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year. So far, in addition to improving our French language, we have greatly enhanced our appreciation of French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a refreshing breath of breath to drive the senseless, predictable, unimaginable, crash-shattering Hollywood car. What a good example of a screenwriter, actors, filmmakers and filmmakers to follow. It was also stimulating to see two characters that could be identified in the main roles without having to be glossy magazine cover characters. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked in this film was the slow character and the accumulation of plots that kept you guessing how everything would end. Is there any real good in this selfless bartender who constantly treats his na√Øve benefactor with what seems to be a kind of contempt that will appear ex ex? Does the heroine of our half-hearted self-defeating hero prove herself to answer her dreams and the situation that fate gave her? These questions raise the interest of the viewer, and the actors slowly and convincingly answer the questions as they confront events that challenge and shape each other. <br /> <br /> Once you see this movie, like me, you may want to see it again. I still have to find the manager's psychological motivation with regard to the sub-plot as a parole officer and that some nuances in camera work deserve a second look. This plot requires little imagination when it gives our hero an opportunity to help our heroines, who have been abused and exhausted in the office. You must also be wide in thinking to believe in her wonderful reading of the lips and how some activity falls into place. But if you go on an exciting trip with this example of French cinema at its best, you will come out more than satisfied. Four stars out of five for me.
