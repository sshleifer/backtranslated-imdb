I try to watch it every day most of the time, and although I have seen it over the past four years, I have not seen each episode. <br /> <br /> The show is about Danny Tanner, a young man on the job of sports news. His wife was killed in a car accident by a drunken driver and asked Jesse, obsessed with Elvis and a motorcycle for his hair. Joey, an adult girl who works as a comedian and makes caricatures all the time to take care of his three daughters, Donna Joe, they call her DJ and Stefini, the second oldest and Amishil, the younger. /> All of them live under one roof without anyone helping them. <br /> <br /> Later in the show, Jesse gets a girlfriend girl and later married her and has twins, Nicky and Alex. (This starts in the new seasons). This show is great, if you like The Suite life of Zack and Cody, This so Raven, Boy Meets world, and Designing Woman, you'll love it. (Starts to improve in the final classes) watch it, you will love it!
