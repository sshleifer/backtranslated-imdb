Thanks to the Warner Archive, I can see again this huge variety show that casts everything except the kitchen sink. (However, there is a bathtub.) This movie gives time to everyone who was contracted to Warner's at the time. If some artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were bigger in the silent days, and most of them faded with the popularity of the ahaadeeth. There are some truly outstanding artists of the vaudeville era as well. Winnie Lightner, who leads two figures, will be impressed. Also there is the French star, Irene Bourdoni, who sings with a love song in an exciting way. Perhaps one of the biggest events is the two-sector Technicolor China Fancy, which has been restored to this release. She's really beautiful, star Mirna Loye and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is a huge "Lady Luck" ending that lasts for about a quarter of an hour. This is really an epic of early modern age. Any old movie buff will love this.
