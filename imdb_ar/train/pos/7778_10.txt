Director Douglas Cirque once said: "There is a very short distance between fine art and garbage, and the trash that contains insanity is of the closest quality to art." This statement is fully known for its cinema, a unique collection of works that includes classical theatrical adaptations, adventure and war films, Westerners, and, of course, its famous melodramas. <br /> <br /> The Sirk melodramas, as the word itself refers to. Drama with music. The music determines the tone of his style, and each stroke of the brush (Sirk also has a painter) gives a strong image on the screen that has turned into a canvas. But this is not life but its representation, a tradition of life. Circus never tried to show reality on the contrary. No one of his generation's directors has made better use of all of Hollywood's technical devices (notably Technicolor) to artificialize the real thing. Let us remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood movies turned their attention to social drama (Blackboard jungle, Rebel without a reason). Circus always knew that cinema was supposed to be something else. <br /> <br /> Another of the Sirk phrases sums up: "You can not get to reality or touch it, you only see ideas, if you try to understand happiness by itself, your fingers only meet the glass." I challenge anyone who has seen a book written on the wind To calculate the number of mirrors and reflective images on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, we are in a hall full of mirrors where there is no difference between the real version and the false version. The city is not too real, with those hideous oil pumps everywhere.Therefore in this area influenced representation, fake decoration, clear trick Everything is pushed away from the limit (Dorothy Malone's sexual connotations with the oil tower, for example.) Cirque was criticized and seen at the same time. <br /> <br /> 'Angles are the director's ideas; lighting is his philosophy. On the wind we follow the fall of the traditional way of life, either geometrically or in terms of light and shadow, and the Hadleys' house, with its various levels connected to the spiral stairway, is quite metaphorical, like a mausoleum, and no party can cheer. Mysterious, circus photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters, as well as the colors of the clothes they wear Ha. Thus, drama was integrated into each element in the director's craft service. <br /> <br /> Cirque himself was considered a "storyteller" because he drained the standard material he was assigned to his style and purpose. Written on the wind is a good example. It will not work for others. <br /> <br /> Another director who used similar strategies was Frank Tachlin, who was a comedy in the 1950s of the same age and was a circus performer with Melodrama. Their films are full of American life - advertising, television sets, music, washing machines, sports cars, vacuum cleaners - to photograph and decompose their vacuum. I tend to believe that their films were viewed differently by their contemporary audiences. The game was played by both sides, so it was campground. Now we consider them a "cult" or a "stranger", because we are no longer these viewers anymore. That's why Todd Haynes' "Away from Paradise" honor turns into a state of confusion, for he is reproducing circus acts at the moment as if nothing happened between them. Sirk then turns into that outstanding painting in the art exhibition discussed by Julianne Moore and Bustani in the film. <br /> <br /> Sirk fully understands Melodrama elements. There were always immortal characters (Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here) who could assemble a series of divided characters. His balance through the contrast is striking and it is not surprising that we get divided personalities, because these are the ones that are interested in circus as well. When Robert Stack flies on the plane and lures Lauren Bacall with all sorts of worldly conveniences in the world beneath her (evident Faustian echoes), we are strangely fascinated by him, as we are when her little, demonic little sister recovers her past Mitch alone at the river. <br /> <br /> In the world of Sirk, the happy ending imposed by the studio will not have a negative impact. In fact they just worked great. Sirk was fond of the Greek tragedy and considered the happy endings Deux ex machinea in his day. Thus, the final scene of the courtroom fits well and one must also remember that the whole movie is listed in Flash, so we know from the start that the tragedy will nevertheless fall on the Hadley antagonism. <br /> <br /> Many similarities are written on the wind with the Godfather epic. I fully agree and I am sure that the parallel is not accidental. The two share the subject of the old strong father's head in an attempt to keep his empire intact while protecting his family. The mood son whose image Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance with Jimmy was Sony Corleone. Fighting a friend of her sister is identical. The son in whom the old man put his trust is common in both films, since both families bear the names of their city. Even details such as the gate that allows access to the property, and the surrounding areas of the house covered with leaves, indicate that Coppola was written in the wind during the development of his works of art. Because both films deal with the subject of power: power acquisition, processing and inheritance (even Kyle Hadley's infertility, an event that accelerates the disorder, is easily related to the main subject Power, in this case, a weakness in sexual power). The other big film that deals with power and uses American life as a representative is Citizen Kane. One can not think first of the similarities between Welles and Sirk, but there are many of them, ranging from gasoline trading as the origin of family fortune to the fact that Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), like Charles Foster Kane, was adopted by a teacher, His father is alive. Surprisingly, the same actor (Harry Shannon) performs both Wayne and Ken. These details can not be encountered. <br /> <br /> Written on the Wind is a masterpiece of all aspects, in terms of implementation and vision, both in terms of style and technique, highlighting the career of this wonderful director. Some say that this is his best film. In my opinion, "wonderful mania", "all that heaven allows", "there is always tomorrow" and "life tradition" are good. For those who put Sirk at the Dallas or Dinasty level wish them any happy ending.
