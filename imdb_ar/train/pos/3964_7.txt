I found that the story of the FBI is quite entertaining and aptly optimistic to watch the New Year's Day holiday. Her dramatic work and exciting episodes were exciting. The figure of hardness was well drawn and impressive. Overall photography, the script and the direction were quite trustworthy. Instead of taking the film as an obnoxious piece of propaganda, as some have done, I have enjoyed it as a well-established image of the need for brilliant minds and brave bodies to fight crime. Once again, a family photograph clings together even under the pressure of the husband's commitment to his important work (arguably), I did not find an ideal representation but is a perfect representation and ideal.
