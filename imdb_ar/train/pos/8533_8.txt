This movie is more of a thermos then more, especially coming from Funimation. Otherwise, it's bad, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very similar to the comic (which is the basis of all the elements of the third thermos). Lupine tries to get a huge treasure. Fujiko uses double lupine for women to try to get something out of it. The last thing is not that bad, he is with other women, but of course Fujiko is still number one. <br /> <br /> Many of the other Lupine movies are a family of more words with lyrics then Lupine. I think any true Lupine lover would be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after hearing a lot of bad things about this film). It may be a bit better without moving small animations during the credits (make them a little soft) but in general, not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few I see again in the films of Lupine III.
