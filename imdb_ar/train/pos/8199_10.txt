After what was considered a trio of official dirty trio with The Enforcer (1976) to be the last chapter in the series. Dirty Harry, an older and more rude than ever before since 1971, is back. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has in the past killed a mentally ill murderer, local police, and veteran terrorists in Vietnam. But now he follows a new killer, a murderer who wants to recover, by killing the attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact brings a new meaning and darker tone to Dirty Harry. Kalahan in a new murder case dating to a woman (played with her role), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who was left in shock. Ten years later, I went out in revenge for the attackers. At the same time, although Calahan is suffering trouble from his superiors after the mob chief provokes a heart attack, the mob also catches him. So in order to allow the heat to land within the city, Harry is on his way to vacation in a coastal town, but at the same time the ravenous victim is also present in the city, while pursuing her assailants one by one. Harry is under investigation and finds the killings very similar, as he lives in the killer tracks. <br /> <br /> The sudden impact in my opinion should be one of the top 10 revenge films, as well as the second best Dirty Harry movie to date, much better than The Enforcer and The Dead Pool together. His sudden influence was not what Dirty Harry had in the original, dark tone of amusing value. <br /> <br /> Do you feel lucky, punk?
