The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit combine the best two episodes of the second season of Doctor Who. After saying this, it must be clear that much of the story conveys essentially the plot of Quatrimas and the Moon (1967) to an ocean in outer space, with the history of the intertwined universe with the history of the 666 beast. These episodes reinforce the emotional cement relations between Rose and the Doctor, Rose's growing confidence in herself, making her a non-master partner, but he arrived there with our beloved Lord. Also noteworthy is the elegant Matt Jones scenario, which reduces the occasional over-dependence on single-doctor linings and full actor presentations, notably Sean Parkes as Captain Zachary Cross Felln.
