Yes, some plots are difficult to follow up a bit, and the bill tends to violence, but it's really a hard offer, and I'm not trying to miss it. The vast majority of episodes are very exciting and very tense, and the representation is fairly good, although I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabrielle Kent. I will admit, the best older episodes on newer episodes, and it is a shame that the program is now after the watershed, so I found it easier to see it when it was 8.00pm. However, the reason I like the bill is that it is not only fun, but also climbers in the end make the next episode unacceptable. It's true that this program is more melodramatic than it was, but I really love this program as a program that does not try to take itself seriously. Bethany Cox
