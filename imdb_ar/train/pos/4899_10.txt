I am very happy because I watched this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this movie has turned into a real gem. I loved that movie, a love story of some kind, was not about some beautiful things. Instead, it's the story of some of the 60 beautiful things that used to be something. It's a good story, well written, and wonderfully fun with the great WWII band music that was also released. They also got a pleasant surprise for the Scottish castle lovers. He left me smiling and ready to see him again, which I did several times before running it.
