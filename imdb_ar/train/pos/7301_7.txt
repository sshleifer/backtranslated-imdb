When I heard about Hammerhead on a DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought, "Well, just another cheap Nu Skin monster." These people have produced about Bose Davidson and Avi Lerner B - cheap and very entertaining in the last few months but also some disappointing movies. So I did not expect much, especially after seeing the shark area a bit disappointing just a few days ago. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s beast films. We have a crazy world, a group of people in a dangerous situation, they scream at women and girls in adversity, eat plants, of course we have the creature, a big mutant mix between man and hammer shark. All you need for an entertaining monster movie. The only thing missing is the graphic sex scenes and nudity you expect in films of this kind, but since the film was produced for television, it is understandable why these scenes are lost. It does not matter anyway why the "Hammerhead" is a horror action and entertainment at best. There are two reasons why I gave it seven points out of ten points, though: first of all, the beast does not see much and the confrontations that destroyed the creature are very quick and not done badly; secondly, William Forsyth is just not the right man for the "hero" part and falling in love With the wonderful Tylo Hunter. Other than that, I can highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves the monster movie there. Get a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and enjoy. Jasper B. Morgan
