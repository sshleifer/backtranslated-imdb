Skipping stones is certainly one of the best independent comedy films ever made. You must have a sense of humor to enjoy the full of this. This film for some reason did not receive its outstanding balance. First, let's start with the story line. Everyone loves to treasure. When the dead father leaves letters behind him advised by a hidden treasure, he not only brings together two families together, but begins a storm adventure. The Polish translator, the coma mother, the head of the schizophrenia suffering from turbulence syndrome, a homosexual hypnotist, and a single queen of drag are confused. Money not only makes the world revolve, it can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie should be Sister Addiction / Crack with Tower Syndrome, her sudden explosion will make you cry and mimic for weeks.
