I think this was a very good film. It was good to see a little more in the film about the two sisters who knew everyone who loved the same boy before killing him. I am sure that if the film is made this way, there will be a completely different end, which is why this transition made a good film. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers, you can always get it through it. If two sisters deal with a boy, the work through pain and hurt makes things look better and easier to work with. It's good to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get until you get closer after it's over. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do it now when it comes. I seem to find myself seeing him every time he happens. It would have been good if there had been a part 2 of this film, perhaps the great sister would come and give birth to her child, this would have put a wonderful end to the story since his death, and in this way his surviving though he died.
