Kantu 1: How Karimhead scorns Siegfried and how he is filled by King Attila Wu through his ambassador Rudiger von Biclaren: Karellhardt (Margarit Schon) insists on getting the head of her beloved husband's murderer, Hagen Trungi (Hans Edelbert Schlitto) King Gunter (Theodore Los) rejects her request. When King Atilla of the Hun killed Karimild through his ambassador, Rudiger von Pekler, made him swear by his king that he would not offend anyone. Hagen Trungi hides a Nebilingen treasure at the bottom of the lake. <br /> <br /> Kanto 2: How to take Karimhead to leave her home and how King Attila received her: Creamhead brings some land from the place of Siegfried's death, travels to the Hun Stadium, where Attila himself, who is also right to defend her, welcomes her. <br /> <br /> Kanto 3: How King Attila was enslaved Rome and Ruiz, and how Crihild summoned her brothers: When Krimhild gives birth to a child, Attila returns to his world and asks Krimhold to love her more than others. She asked him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Kanto 4: How to get Karimhead her brothers: Karimhead insists that she has Hagen's head Troni, but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again does not accept her request. <br /> <br /> Canto 5: How the Hun celebrated the summer drowsiness with the Nebelingen: Karehild asked Attila to kill Hagen Troni, but since then he has refused according to the laws of the desert, the guest is sacred. Kriemhild offers gold to Homs for head Hagen Tronje. There is a battle, and Hagen Trooney kills Attila's son. <br /> <br /> Kanto 6: The Tribulation of Nebilingen: Huns lose the battle against Nebelingen, but keep them under siege in Atila Castle. She promised to save their lives on condition that they give Hagen to Truny, but her brother Gunter tells that the German people are loyal to his friends. <br /> <br /> Kanto 7: The end of Nebelingen: After the death of Rudiger von Biclaren, Giselleher was finally captured by Gronot, Hagen Trungi and Guhther. Killhelm Hagen kills Trony, and ends her revenge by destroying Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> The story of Sigfried's epic is also derived from the film "Revenge of Creamhead" by seven dramatic cantons. The nature of the first part is a wonderful story of fantasy, adventure, romance and treason. The second part is an exciting story of hatred, revenge and allegiance. He produced a solid film with the perfect evolution of the characters and excellent performances of the film and the brilliant orientation of Fritz Lang's epic epic early on. Margarit Shaun is impressive with a completely different, obsessed and inflexible woman in her desire for revenge. The costumes worn by Creamhead are also wonderful, and her representation is based on her face and appearance. I was a little disappointed by Attila's reaction after the death of his only son, so I found it very negative. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Address: "Os Nibelungos ??
