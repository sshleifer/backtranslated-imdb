I had the opportunity to see this film for the first time at the Appalachian Film Festival, where I won the Best Film Award. This film is brilliantly done, with excellent actors working well with a band. My favorite shows were Joseph Karkur, Justin Lin and Adam Jones. Also, there are some wonderful effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, I was surprised to find out that this movie has been on a small budget. Writer Adam Jones, who I think won an award for writing, does an excellent job with direction. The audience loved this film. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the film. Definitely a must see.
