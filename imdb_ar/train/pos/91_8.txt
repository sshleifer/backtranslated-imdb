Overall it was a good movie with an ideal ending. The performance was amazing and the characters did not move away from their people. I liked the plot in particular, although you know what will happen, but it still represents the element of surprise in the entire film. However, I find that reaching the end could have been longer (maybe extended) - for me it seemed like a little rushed; as if the writer was trying to remove the linens before the rain. For example - what happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? We know he died in hospital. Maybe he was the one who put everything ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Can? If there is .. I can not wait to see him.
