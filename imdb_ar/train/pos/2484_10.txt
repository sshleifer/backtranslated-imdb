Olivier, Kocentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zephrelli, Almereida, all brought Hamlet out, but Branagh is the only film that got right. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie "Hamlet" that contains four full hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feeling to the entire story. <br /> <br /> Many directors can not come out without feeling bored by their audience, but Prang's skillful use of the Bravura style and a trick that allows people to see importance include scenes that are usually cut. <br /> <br /> An example of this is Gerardi DiBardo, like Ranelaldo, whose whole purpose in the film is simply "Yes sir" while asking him to spy on him. Billy Crystal was also included as a gravedigger, Robin Williams as Oscar, Jack Lemmon as Marcelos, and Charlton Heston as actor. <br /> <br /> Pranage's performance of the 4 movies of Act 4 (which is usually cut back usually outside) is no less than a cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back with increased intensity. It's a scene that made me really want to jump out of my chair and start clapping. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker who understands the importance of every scene in this film and knows how to convey this importance to the general public. <br /> <br /> This is a must for anyone who enjoys telling good stories, illustrious representation and stunning direction. All this part of William Shakespeare's greatest triumph.
