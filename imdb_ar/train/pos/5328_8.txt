I still remember seeing this first on TV. I could not believe TVNZ let her! I had to own it! You will lose a lot of humor on non-NZ'ers, but give it a boost! <br /> <br /> Since the completion of the Back of the Y series, Matt and Chris have continued bigger and better things (?). The greatest trick to dare the New Zealand devil, Randy Campbell often appeared in the British television series Balls of Steel. Yes, f ^ @ ks still raises all his erotic works because he is very drunk. <br /> <br /> Also, the band "Deja Voodoo" released two albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band consists of members of the Back of the Y team. Individual songs such as "I'll give you one of my beasts (but only got 6)" and "Were not born until the 1980s" continue to be humorous. <br /> <br /> Southwest Southwest Film Festival also screened his long film "The Devil Made Me Do It" which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> All up, if you do not find these people funny, you can just turn off% F ^ K!
