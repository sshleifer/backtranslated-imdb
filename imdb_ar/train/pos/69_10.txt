I was awake late in the flipping on the cable channels one night and I encountered this movie about 10 minutes from the start - every time I was thinking about going to bed, there was something that told me to keep watching it even though it was on the way to bedtime . <br /> <br /> It could have been another easy film against the gun, but they chose instead to examine the effects of the shooting. Better still, the film went on in real life - only when you think they will take the easy and distinctly clear path, comes the evolution and changes the whole look of the film. This film follows not only the formula but also how other events often lead to and / or affect what happens next. <br /> <br /> I just hope that filmmakers will explore the issues of antidepressants even more - the children from Columnbine who have been shooting them for years and it was frightening to see how Diana appeared every time she started Nightmares. Until recently they were distributing things like candy and were just beginning to understand the long-term effects of these drugs. It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story had been presented many films, where he had a relative suffering from mental illness, and I can say that the film was dead in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo's director and writer who clearly did his duty in these cases. For those who think that some things can not happen in the hospital (I do not want to tell any details), you're wrong in that too - I've been there. The text was very real, it was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Go buy this movie and show it to your teenage children before it's too late. Someday I will thank you for that.
