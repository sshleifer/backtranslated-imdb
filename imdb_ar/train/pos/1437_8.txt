We often see films about undesirable things happening in politics, but I still recommend the City Council. In the role he was born to play, Al Pacino is the mayor of New York who has to deal with shooting a boy. But it turned out that nothing he did would have any effect. In this film, the characters are as brave as we expect anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how confident you are in any particular politician, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not name any specific example of something similar to what this film depicts, but that's not a point. If we have perfect impressions for those at the top, this film will tear these ideas apart. Definitely one that I encourage you to see. Starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aello, Anthony Francusa and David Baemer.
