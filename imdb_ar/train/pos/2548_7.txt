Karlov and Lugosi - together again! This is one of those movies that ordinary fans will go over and do not tend to appreciate. It's not a horror film like the two previous hits, The Black Cat and The Raven. But, she deserves both talents, which is a fun film when she returns. <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hiller, a director mainly made by Westerners, but curious in these last days of the Laemmles era at Universal, found himself helping with that and the final horror film of Laemmles, Daughter of Dracula's. Both are clear and slim, and they are very light on the horror content despite the wonderful elements. <br /> <br /> As Lugosi went to the wilderness in The Raven, there is much to be said about the threat of Karlov in The Invisible Ray. One particularly unsatisfactory aspect of the story is that Karlov's character, Rukh, acts crazily before being poisoned by Radium X, and that there really is not much change once he starts to glow. This is very similar to the complaint people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining - it's basically just a lovable person from the start. There is no real transformation. Well here. Halfway through Karlov simply has an additional goal of revenge in his mind. However, I still enjoy his performance, just as a Lugosi mob did in The Raven. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Lugosi surprises you completely and gives a thoughtful and studied turn as a competitor to Rukh's science Dr. Bennett. Lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film, including an unforgettable warning to the police trying to catch Baruch, and I go along with the horror filmmaker John Sweets - "And if (Rukh) touches anyone?" Inspector inquires. Lugosi responds hesitantly, in a manner that only Lugosi can offer, "die". Just as Lugosi can be very far away, it can also be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the Karloff and Lugosi interactions are all very good as we get the crazy alien from Karloff against the quiet logic of Lugosi. Karloff will continue to play many similar mad scientists several times, yet one wishes that Lugosi has played a more direct role in such a role. He had only one other chance (Ninotchka). <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray is a very fun and enjoyable movie for the real fans of Karloff and Lugosi. It's one of those movies that gets better in every view, not because it's a masterpiece, but because of the attractiveness and talent of its stars and how this story complements their darker and more beautiful pairings. Special effects, by John Fulton's durable innovation, are superb and supportive actors are adequate. Francis Drake looks as beautiful as she did in the movie Mad Love and plays a strong woman, which is rarely seen in classic horror films. The scene in the end when Karlov is chasing her and she does not scream is one of the most painful moments in the film. Wonderful and fun movie!
