William Powell's recent stroll in Philo Vance has been the cause of the killing of a kennel where killing a dog in a championship kills two more people and tries one of the human kind. All this in knowing how it leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> The murders of Philo Vance by SS Van Dine were more common at the time, and Mr. Van Dine cleverly discovered a way to sell his books one by one to the highest bidder for the studios. That's why you see a lot of Philo Vances and many studios that put them. If Bill Powell had not been more famous with MGM as Nick Charles of Thane Mann, he would have been known as the greatest Philo Vince. <br /> <br /> It turned out that Powell had entered the young captain in the same competition as the murdered dog had entered, and then the owner of another competitor became the first victim of the murder. As usual, Powell shows "Eugene Pallet" as Sergeant Heath, whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was to use most of it to break the lock from the inside door where the first victim of the murder was found. <br /> <br /> I said I was locked inside and had a top story so I had to know how. Powell has a wonderful collection of suspects, widely as usually in the mystery of a thin man. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan and Mary Astor play their well-cast roles. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers loved this version so much that they actually rephrased it back in the 1930s with James Stevenson and one picnic just by Philo Vance. This candle does not carry one candle. <br /> <br /> Since this is the only Powell Philo Vance on VHS or DVD by all means, you can see this or get it if you can.
