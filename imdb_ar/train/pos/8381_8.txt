I loved this movie since I was young! It's excellent. Although it may be a bit for ordinary movie watchers if one can not explain some of the finer details in the film (for example, the name of our hero is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander, he was filmed in a rocket heel, Legends shot in the heel). This little fact is rather amusing! Anyway, a wonderful movie, a good story, it would be great to see it with special effects today! It is strange that Gary Graham has achieved moderate success, where he starred in the show T.V. Alien Nation. This movie is a fun hour and it must be more appreciated!
