Spoilers - as much as I describe the characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. The subject is simultaneously dim and controlled. The excellent design of Stephen Ria's character, Borakov, is simply captivating. With any due apologies to him, the bird luck game, constant expression serves the character well. It is, as we say in England, about the character of the series Inspector Taggart TV series, that must be grim because he sees three murders a week. Well, this is not exactly accurate because Chikatila has been working for several years ... <br /> <br /> You can get a real sense of resistance to the empty fa√ßades of the Soviet bureaucracy, which was brilliantly portrayed by Joss Ackland ( Designer of this kind of roles). <br /> <br /> There is a main character (I write this in a new version of the Invasion of Body Snatchers shown on BBC 1), a character of Donald Sutherland's "Mikhail Fitsov". His quiet support for Burakov is steady. This continues through Perestroika, and drives the FBI's participation in profiling. A wonderful. <br /> <br /> This is a must, as far as I care.
