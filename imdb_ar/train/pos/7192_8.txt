If you are a fan of Zorro, or Indiana Indiana, or a public act, this is a must. Directed by Republic of ae William Witney and John English, and starring Red Hadley as Don Diego / Zoro, What really matters here is Hadley's wonderful interpretation of personality / characters and the work of the trick of Del Van Sickle and Yekima Kanout. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the impact this film has had on Lucas and Spielberg - Zoro has been discovered in the original version of Star Wars. The Seasons, trapped on a rope bridge by Doom Temple in another chapter, move the Raiders from the horse to the coach and even escape through a tunnel while the bad guys kneel down a huge water tank and sink the tunnel behind him, just as Mula Ram does to Andy at the Temple of Death. In addition to all this, the whip movement is fascinating as Zorro disarms the bad guys, swings to safety, etc. with his secured eyelashes. Most of the work of the sword is fair, except for the first chapter, which is characterized by a magnificent sword brawl in Cantina designed by the legend of the sword / trick Ralph Faulkner, which makes the screen appearance rarely like Rodriguez the villain. This was the first series I had ever seen, on Matin√©e in Bijou when I was a kid and I was hooked on it ever since. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion offers the "Z"!
