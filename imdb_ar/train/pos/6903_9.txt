This little appreciation film is one of my favorites. I can see it again and again. Dreyfus and Braga are adept, but Raul Julia steals the show! Adams Gomez, tongue-in-cheek, and a humorous, threatening spirit, with the correct tone for this unprecedented parody of the story that I told her so much. <br /> <br /> In general, unwelcome and indifferent, Moon Over Parador lets you get out of the way and join the fun of the screen. Thumb thumb high!
