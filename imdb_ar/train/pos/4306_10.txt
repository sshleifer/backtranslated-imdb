Just the fact that I'm still thinking about the film after a decade is what is already talking about volumes about the film. For me this proves the Grand Canyon as a movie somehow held. I really think that before the Crash movie, there was Grand Canyon. The main difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of its release. I will not argue which is better, but I will argue that they share the same message. I would love to hear from those who have an opinion on the subject. I will start with a comment you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You may also find me there to post any other topics about the movies that we may share, because I have a real love for the film.
