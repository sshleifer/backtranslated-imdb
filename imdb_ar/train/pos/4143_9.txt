no I'm not joking. If you have, ever, you have a chance to see this movie see it. If you need to cut your arm to see it, check it out. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> The Fat Bus is not like any movie I've ever seen. Take the trash cinema and lift it into a work of art. Although it contains poor footage, stupid characters, bad dialogue, a strange actor and a cinematic film that belongs to the public in Iowa, he has managed to achieve his goal as a film. Strives to be the dumbest and strangest and most unwanted film ever. The child never succeeds. <br /> <br /> I will put a plot for those of you who are concerned about such things (obviously the filmmakers have not succeeded), but really do not need to pay much attention because the whole movie plot is presented in a very long text play Before the opening credits. Anyway, FDTB (as its fans call it) is the story of a bus tour across Chicago, led by Satan. As you see, Jesus is in the city, and all the passengers of the bus are supposed to die, and all their souls will go to hell, except for the presence of Jesus in the town, and stop in hell from work, and this angers Satan because, well, he does not like to look like a fool in front of a man , So he decides to get people on the bus to kill him directly, but he is a demon, so he has to deny, otherwise, he would go on a tour with him properly, so disguised as Roger and get on the bus, Kind of fat, so I think he missed. Bus (and knights) in a collision course with an idiot! <br /> <br /> Examples of some insanity: The title on the screen is repeated 3 times. I do not know why a person appears on the bus in the middle of the journey without explanation or introduction, sometimes sitting next to others and looking at her as if she does not belong. I do not know why two people fall in love and exchange longing glances, which are in fact the same repetitive footage over and over again. I do not know why after Satan gave a long monologue about conversion to human form, the title card flashed "Satan will turn." I do not know why One of the characters is a woman who is clearly a man in a drag, and is referred to by other characters as "charming Bridget." I do not know the reason. <br /> <br /> If one good thing came out of the training session at Troma last summer is get my own version of the Fatty Drives The Bus game.
