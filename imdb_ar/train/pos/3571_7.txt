I have seen this movie twice with my youth who love it. This one has to be a VV cult! Best line, "Your dress is so cool!" The Prince tells Sinderella. Kathleen Turner lights up the father's wife. I also love cars and motorcycles dating back to the 1950s. Prince melancholy is a great exit from a typical swashbuckler. He tries to remain calm, but he hides his love for the fairy princess. Her slipper is not a glass (true to the original story), but Cinderella loses it, but she returns it from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it does not appear more and it seems impossible to get it. We hope that Blockbuster or Amazon will start storing this product soon.
