Although Ian Kershaw has distanced himself from this project because of inaccuracies about Hitler's life and yes, it is very exciting but necessary. Robert Carlyle plays the role of Hitler during his last years, during this documentary, which deals only with Hitler from childhood until he became an adviser to Germany, including The Night of the Long Knives. This television film (also a mini-series of two parts) shows how a series of factors allowed Hitler to gain power, for example the 1930 financial disaster. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and a few other things, Fritz Gerlich and Ernest Hanfstangl. All in all, valuable and full of interesting actors, yet I feel that it should have been more tightly directed with the most powerful cinematic photography; most actors are filmed in half-body footage which (to me) makes a theater, not a cinematic position. The rhythm is sometimes soft, and the film suffers from it, with a length of about 2.5 hours.
