"Stairway to Heaven" is a prominent invention of filmmaking, and may never have been repeated. She has been classified as the "Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although she is a completely different kind of film about the African Queen. "Stairway to Heaven" is a psychological drama that uses performance concepts and artistic influences that, to my knowledge, are completely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a mixture of B & W and colored clips - as in "Oz", but the importance of the variation goes beyond the simple - beautiful effect - achieved in "Oz". In "Stairway", the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as strong. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect of "Stairway" is the concept of "time" and how to use it here. How can anyone imagine a better way to make time steady? Literally? Then there is the same stairs! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination at all, you agree with me. "Stairs to Heaven" is a real gem.
