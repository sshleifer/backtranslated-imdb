Well, I know this does not expose India well. But the general theme of the film is not India, it's Shakti. The power of the warlords, and the power of the mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallows you in their warmth. Then things go wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father in law - the strength of their dysfunctional relationship - and the life in which they changed are the strengths of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be a mere veil in comparison to Karisma Kapoor's reasonable despair. It is easy to fall in love, violence and salvation in this movie, and you find yourself breathing a sigh of relief at its climax. Musical intervals are strengths, validation, and well done.
