What if Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio and Senator McCarthy were to meet on a relatively forgotten evening? <br /> <br /> This delightful Roman story never uses the actual names of the characters you use in a thin veil and scandal not only exposes the individuals who should be, but also what they came to represent over time. If you are confused by a symbolic story, or if you like your movies are ready and full, you will not like this movie. Is a demanding authoring that rewards the viewer on many levels with his intelligently appreciated. <br /> <br /> By dropping, at the moment, a strict avoidance of the use of the real names of the characters, we see Einstein, about to deliver a peaceful speech to the United Nations hell of nuclear weapons, visited by Marilyn Monroe, after filming the scene of the infamous seven-year itch says Some have led to the end of her marriage to Joe DiMaggio. They have a beautiful interaction where Einstein stumbles with the proper professional folly about innocence, perhaps the biggest sexual symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Senator McCarthy, who thinks Einstein is red, has been introduced. He is determined to extract Einstein's assertion that he will support the activities of the House of Representatives' Non-American Activities Committee while presenting the final weapon in the name of peace. Joe, who is suddenly fragile and weak, may not have played like Gary Bossi, who hates the authoritarian spirit of Marilyn and believes that Einstein has become her lover, although Marilyn only wants to show Einstein that she understands the theory of special relativity. <br /> <br /> But there is more. <br /> <br /> Just like all of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which are revealed one by one in the memories of the past. It is these weaknesses, in the end, that add humanity to personalities that we can only see almost exclusively in the summary today. Finally, we see horror horrifying to see Einstein, and become a clear film statement. It is a powerful and unforgettable moment. <br /> <br /> Neglect is one of my best five films ever. It's absolutely amazing.
