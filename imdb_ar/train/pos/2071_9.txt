For those of us Pompeyers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate James Dean et al. Martin Chen showed us "the way in this wonderful feature." Car nut in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca, nor is it great literature, but it is a serious film about cars, rebellion, and geniuses that are Martin Chen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is and what it will become. I loved this movie as he grew up in his teens in the seventies and will love him as well.
