In general, the plot was much better than I expected. The laugh track was sometimes troublesome and was inclined to walk the way; however, there were real enough laughs in this episode to make up for it. My biggest surprise was finding the best lines and the parking spaces were not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, has not been best served in previous promotions, but its character is well encountered in the beta. There is enough eye candy to satisfy almost anyone and all the ordinary characters seem to have the task ahead of them. Now, if the authors can only rise to the level they started.
