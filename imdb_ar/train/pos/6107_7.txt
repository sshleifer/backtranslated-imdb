After that, I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why was this film a great success at the Korean box office?" Even if I thought the film had an intelligent script / cancel, the acting was not good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean film ... I liked the scenes of fighting. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is the right movie for you. But I recognized ... the film was childlike ... 6/10
