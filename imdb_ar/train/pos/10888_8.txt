This is one of the small Christmas movies for everyone. Our scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough, so he rents a family where he lives where he thought his family is. Okay? This is a very small soap in high school, PG-13, but small sexual references are comedy, so if your son can not deal with them, he will not be able to live in the real world as well. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a great piece, and as usual through this fun, OMG, remember when we did ..., the band piece as if it was in the stages of the end of some neurological infectious diseases. But that's good, because even this old Oracle still hopes that if Ben fits well everywhere, well, there's hope for us ladies yet. Luckily, the rest of the group - Catherine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Aggliette, Ado Kerr and Josh Zuckerman - and keep this shadow next to Ozzie and Harriet Christmas filled with joy, comfort and warmth. <br /> This movie is the kind you can jump into and get On the popcorn, when you return, everyone wants to back up to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> This happy movie, after all, makes you feel good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really is something for everyone.
