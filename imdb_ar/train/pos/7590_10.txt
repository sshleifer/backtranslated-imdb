I do not care if you want to comment or not, but I think that whoever writes that the film is not good, you are so obsessed with Hollywood films so you can not see how good this film is not a fan of Jay Chou, but I love his play and not just him ... You think there is not much sense in the idea and you might think it is not interesting but look deep there is more than just a film in love more than passion and tears and there are more than USA in the world and it's good :) really good. It costs a lot of work, so please do not criticize the actors caused by the directors because you do not know how difficult their work is to be happy at this hour and a half.
