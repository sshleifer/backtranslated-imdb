I could not believe the low 5.6 rating on IMDb for Johnny Dangerious at the moment I wrote this review and I think I had to do something to promote this memorable comedy as much as possible. Seriously, to get a very low rating, people who have voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention that there is a very open mind. If you do not like comic clicks, do not watch them! This film combines the collection of silly humor and the very good storytelling and super-speed provided by multi-run geeks. This is without mentioning the visual shackles included here and there, and of course, the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite organized crime films. <br /> <br /> This movie has been shown to a lot of people, and it has been shown without any specific expectations (except maybe watching a comedy) - the same state of mind that you should see for any movie in my opinion - they loved it so much. All went well, not long to watch and there is no slowdown in the development of the story, which I think is really clear. It's certainly not perfect. Some of the gags are a little short, but there is no perfect film, especially when you think about other opinions you have. That's why I rated this movie 9 out of 10. This film in my opinion is an introduction like "Very Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the ridiculous but well thought out comedy. Which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting the intellectual side and creativity. Gags sometimes need a culture more than many people imagine that they understand correctly, after all. As a last word, I would say: watch it yourself, do not follow the normal Joe's saying, and if you do not like it, you know that it is not good for your taste, this is understandable but unlikely in my opinion.
