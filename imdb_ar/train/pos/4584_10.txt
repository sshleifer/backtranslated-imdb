I have not seen every one of Chan's movies, but this is certainly the best film I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> The story itself is not really remarkable, so you won t deeper into it. What makes them special are stunts, fighting, good behavior, warm humor. The film has a raging pace all the way and you are surprised to see it. All the great stunts (of course put by Jackie himself) make you want to jump in the couch and yell. It's just great! Even my mom was impressed with this wonderful film when I saw it. <br /> <br /> I know that this police story can be a bit tricky, at least here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's worth trying.
