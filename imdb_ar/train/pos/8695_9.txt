Long time ago, I watched this movie from the middle on the cable. Then Mary Moronov walked over. I saw her again at Raul's eating. I was convinced that she was the hottest women on the screen. <br /> <br /> Maybe you are biased to this movie. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I own on the original tape.
