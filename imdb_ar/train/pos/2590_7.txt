The people who talk about this film badly are those who do not understand the film at first. These are the people who love movies and hurt any film that does not represent the star Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a neat little movie that may seem strange and maybe stupid at first, but what it lacks in the plot is more than just a substitute for content. <br /> <br /> There's one thing in particular about the film that I've admired that it was the use of music that plays a big role. Music students will notice how important the music is in the film, whether in the life of Vida or Wilder, and in the background. Both the Wilder theme, the Vida theme, and the Wallace theme are heard in the opening sequence, and it is funny that some words sing. For example, in the scene where the men sing "Duke Earl," Vida is with Wilder when men sing something like "She's My Girl" and then go to Wallace to give him something when the men sing lyric "She'll Be My Girl" cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers there All kinds of small complications like this inside the film, and while it may seem like flops from the outside, the real student of the film will notice how good the film really is.
