I was pleasantly surprised when I found that "How to lose friends and solitude" were not close to comedy "comedy" that pushed me out of the trailer. I quickly absorbed the narrative and remained preoccupied all the time. I thought the speed of visual content was more fun. (Meaning I got the impression that I was watching Pegg attempts to regain much lost control "in real time", so to speak). In other moments, there was time for the participation of the main protagonists (Pegg's and Dunst's) on how events affected them and what led them to where they now found themselves. All the characters have been cast well, somewhat interesting in themselves, and generally very lovable. (Ie a ruthless clear ambition appears to tend to soften the good flexibility of a suitable occasion.) Armed, intelligently written, brilliantly directed and acting admirably, I highly recommend it.
