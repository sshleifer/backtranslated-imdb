Linear travel within a nonlinear structure. It is a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows at this time between the present and the future and the past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the work of the projector itself, which is the disclosure of narrative. <br /> <br /> What we can see from behind the temporal theme is a reflection of the inevitability of our actions. . Terry Gilliam is a world with a small space of free will. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, we learned of the prophecy of schizophrenia, under which plague ruled the earth in 1997, forcing a few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus. <br /> <br /> Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: back to the mid-1990s to investigate anyone and who is linked to the release of a virus. There is no way to change the past: all you can do is gather information that can help present scientists (this, for us viewers, is the future) in finding treatment. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the present better. <br /> <br /> In a "return" in time, Cole is gradually approaching a striking dilemma: his past life is better than his current life. <br /> <br /> The latter is oppressed and inhumane, dominated by global scholars who elect "volunteers" (this word is ridiculously ironic) to embark on trips to the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievement in time travel, and Cole ends up on wrong dates - and this will later serve as a demonstration of his mind to psychiatrist Catherine (Stu). <br /> <br /> We can see, through the evolution of the story, that linear and nonlinear intertwined in a circular time. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up to almost the last - and certainly climatic - appears. He adjusts himself, according to memories of Cole's memories, which appear in his dreams. <br /> <br /> At the airport, a man is shot dead while running armed towards someone else. A blonde woman working behind a dead person. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past (where Cole is a child visiting the airport with his parents), present (narration time) and future (adult cool) throughout the narrative, Cole has the feeling that he has already lived the reality he now lives. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what has happened. The agents who shoot him prevent him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), who is responsible for spreading the disease. <br /> <br /> Unless you can change it. In Cole's case, what is what will be. forever. <br /> <br /> A film that is not well understood by many. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other good films with the same theme: Back to the Future Trilogy (which has another angle regarding the character of the "Mad World" and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - especially in the second film - is more optimistic than Gilliam's work, this is a strange Hollywood picture). <br /> <br /> In another record, Wild Bergman, one of Bergman's masterpieces, includes a wonderful and useful journey to the past through dreams and memories. <br /> <br /> I have never seen "La Jet√©e", but only because I can not find it.
