If you never see this movie and like old actors, this is the right movie for you. Frank Sinatra's vision when he was very young and very thin with a soaked cheeks and a wonderful voice sang some wonderful old songs. Michelle Morgan (Miley Picot) performed superbly with many dances and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played a major supporting role alongside Viktor Borg (Sir Viktor Fitzroy Victor) who played the classical piano and not a comedy of a slapstick as he did in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was very happy to see him at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
