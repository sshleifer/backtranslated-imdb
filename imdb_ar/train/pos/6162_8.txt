I loved this masterpiece and quite frankly, Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick Fandick) found me to be silly and holy. Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I do not know why people think this film is distorted. It was magical and had lots of fun to see. Each scene carries a certain magic where you know the characters better. You really see how this small family learns to connect with each other, despite age and difference. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was in the "Age of Non-Faith". Mary Poppins may be more popular and cherished by others, but this small gem will be what I love and cherish.
