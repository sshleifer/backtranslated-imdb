Wow, I loved this movie. Perhaps she did not have the funding and advertising that Hollywood's latest films got, but it doubles her passion. The story revolves around this one family from Utah, which is the connection between people in the family that supplies the film. The lead (Giovanni Ribesi) plays his role very well, at no time leaves you believing that he is acting with all his feelings. He is his brother (Elias Coutias) who stole the show for me. When the two were in scenes together, they tied their lines to each other and made wonderful performances. Great cast, wonderful movie.
