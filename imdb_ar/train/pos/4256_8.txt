This is a delightful movie! Warming very heart. One can not help falling in love with a Gigi character. He is adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist. The whole movie revolves around him. Live in a wonderful world ?? Live all life ?? Curiosity and desire and anticipation. There's a big brother trying to steal his glory but he really stays in the shade all his life. The father is a typical Italian as well as a mother. I wanted the father to come and unite with the mother in the last scene? And ask them to cry and laugh. I also hope there is at least something recovered on Big Brother. His character seems to have crashed completely. Passion and enthusiasm ?? This is the key to life. Looking through the camera? Focus on small details and taste the finer details of life.
