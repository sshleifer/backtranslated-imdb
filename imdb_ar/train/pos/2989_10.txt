First, I would just like to say what I'm a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good film with great actors (Bet Meidler, John Goodman, Treni Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies at all. He deals with the mother who raises a child on her own, and goes through many things that are on her way to raise her daughter Jenny who played beautifully with Treni Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you take a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert's feet is 3 1/2 stars! And deserved 4! Wonderful! I give it 4 out of 4!
