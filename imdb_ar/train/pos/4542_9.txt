This comedy centered in downtown Detroit and on its skirts, and I found it to be a fantastic new comedy. Noriuki Pat Morita is a very funny man, since he was a policeman from Japan following the industrial thief secrets, stole a super-quality turbocharger "proto", and reluctantly goes to the United States to follow a thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's personality collides with Jay Leno's character, who talks quickly, "but goes down to a Detroit-type business player." When they cross roads, Japan's respected "roads" meet at the old old Detroit Police School "Roads." The two stumble and walk on each other. After fighting one of the city's crime managers for stolen "equipment" and closing the case, these two people move from contempt to friends and work together well. A bit for wearing and they need an extended holiday over every y K, I have managed to reach the victorious end. This classified 9. Lewis direction makes' this comedy almost perfect. Fun for all ages. I recommend it highly. (***)
