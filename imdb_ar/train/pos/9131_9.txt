"I just wanted to see you laugh in the purple rain." This is an excellent film. It should have been reclassified to PG-13. But in any case, film the first and greatest prince. Continue sucking. But I have not seen for years, here's what I remember about it. The child (the prince) must compete with the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keep his band together (revolution itself) and tension in his family. But his band, The Time as Them, is destroying his life. Like Morris (himself) trying to steal Apollonia from Kidd. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. really good. Hire it, laugh and cry and if you love it, buy it.
