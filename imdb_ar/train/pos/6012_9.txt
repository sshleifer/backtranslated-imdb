Antonioni was aiming for another masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic instead of "blowing up". Success was not with critics and young people like the former though. why? Perhaps because it was a European view of America full of clich√©s that did not succeed at that time and did not advance in age. (The revolutionary students are initially embarrassed.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps when it was released huge films and those who target the youth market appear to be historians. If it had been released a year ago, it might have seemed like a hippie in the deserts ... it is a very interesting film, beautifully filmed with some fantastic Antonine scenes, such as the love industry in the desert, the silence of the desert palace and the explosive end ... That lead was two amateur did not help. She was beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Frichitt is a little better than Darya Halperin. It could have been much better with the right actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lang ... dialog box is very funny and sometimes moving, so you do not know how the lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very mixed document from the late 1960s is definitely worth a look for photography and music Pictorial ....
