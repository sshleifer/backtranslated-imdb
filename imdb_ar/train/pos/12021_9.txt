This radical West, which is often violent in the tradition of Beckenba / Lyon, is directed astoundingly by Andrew F. McLaughlin, who was the former Westerners (especially those who starred John Wayne) put John Ford basically. They are surprisingly traditional (good people / bad guys) and incredibly updated as well. <br /> <br /> Hesston is portrayed as a former Arizona provincial police captain who retired a year ago after handing over the reins of law to reformist mental workers (Michael Parkes) and finding ways to enforce the law seized by cars, telegraphs, telephones and railways in years. The first of the twentieth century. But soon faced a threat from his past - the outlawed breed (Coburn) that he put away more than a decade ago to steal a train in which four guards were killed. In a subsequent exchange of fire, Cobren's wife was killed; It involves kidnapping, and ultimately, the rape of the daughter of Heiston (Hershey) before him and his gang. The result is a taut and violent drive across the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona. <br /> <br /> The last tough men, based on Bryan Garfield's "Gun Down", are violent in many places, including the confrontation between Heston and Coburn, the rape scene involving Hershey and two members of the gang Coburn (Quade, Paull) is highly questionable like similar scenes in STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE. But this does not detract terribly from the psychological approach of the film to the Western genre. McLaughlin is capable of dealing with the bloody story with great pain, and perhaps Heiston's performance as an old law man was his best in any of his films in the 1970s. Coburn makes him heavy in cold blood, and Parkes and Chris Mitchum (as Hershey's intended husband) play a good role. The music here was distributed from scores of Jerry Goldsmith to 100 RIFLES and a new version of STAGECOACH 1966, but it still works here. <br /> <br /> He was filmed quite wisely on site in southeastern Arizona, and using Old Tucson's group, LARD HARD MEN should be released by Fox on VHS and / or DVD soon. It is a Western that deserves nothing less.
