It's a very funny movie, easy to watch, and it makes you happy almost all the time. The manager's work is known and the humor type is his trademark. The film is a typical police partner's history like a deadly weapon, but jokes and comedy of the Argentine genre. The twist is that one of them is a psychologist who plays Perretti and has to go with Detective Diaz (who plays Loki) in his duties while also helping him (Diaz is upset because his wife cheated him). Some fun dialogues around the world: understandable and funny anywhere. Very good overall, it's worth 8, but I'm ranked 7th because it gets little in the end. In a personal note I must add that this is "Bravo" for Argentine directors, keeping in mind that a little good will come recently.
