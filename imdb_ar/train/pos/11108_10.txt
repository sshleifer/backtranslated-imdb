Well ... easily the favorite television series ever. I was contacted by clich√©s of walking mail, but included violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs etc. In view I was already winning points in my book. Combine all that with a representation that beats anything you have never seen before on a small screen, add a guideline to the cinema of the old genre, and most of all that writing blows the mind (and some brains along the way) and you get yourself this will be very difficult to compete With him. <br /> <br /> First of all, two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Eddie Falco, stand in the role of his wife, Carmela ... For Guandolfini, he suits him in a way words can not express, if you do not see him As Tony after, I have seen him now! <br /> <br /> I can continue every day in the program, mental brilliance, and hold it. Scenes, etc., but you will not be able to stop me so all I can say is that this is the only show with Seinfeld, which I can watch over and over from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more than.
