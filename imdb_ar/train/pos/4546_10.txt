This film will collapse in history as one of the greats, along with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Lino to do a supplement! Lino and Morita are two-comedians, who have not seen each other since Abbott and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan, and Randall's "tex" cup will give you chills. The character of Dingman as buffalo buffs hears back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the peak. Oh my God, climax. It will not spoil you, but it makes the death star explosion dim. If you can track down these gems that are hard to find, do yourself and your family well-known and buy it right away. I'm still hoping for a special DVD one day.
