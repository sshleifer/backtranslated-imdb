The idea of ​​making a film about the Beatles seems to be a doomed idea, because there is no production that can hold on to the actual Beatles idea. After that, it may be best not to try to re-create the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with other Beatles materials available. This is exactly what "The Birth of the Beatles" offers us, a simple story known to us without any magnificence. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS HERE ON *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that it is not all that careful as some Beatles graduates might expect. He sees the Beatles performing songs that were barely written at the time. The Beatles perform "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You" and "Do not Disturb Me". Beatles graduates should see that if the Beatles in the film only present songs they have already performed in Hamburg, young viewers may no longer be familiar with the Beatles they have learned to know. From the original Hamburg ammo only "Johnny B. Jude" and "Love Me Tender" by Stu Sattcliffe. <br /> <br /> It seems that the players who play with the Beatles in this production rarely look like the original film still make a good watch as the film is for the rest fairly accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does it well and the rest of the band is not too bad. Brian Epstein is wonderful, and perhaps the moment when Best House is dismissed from the collection is the most unforgettable scene in the entire film. Also as a reward you get to see the original cave club in the movie.
