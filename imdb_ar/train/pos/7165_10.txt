I've recorded this a while ago but just got a tour to watch it today. I've been sick so I ran out of things to watch! I am very happy to see him, which I erase my memory and see again for the first time. This movie is very cool! It reminded me a lot of fried green tomatoes at the Wieselstube Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story is back in time and at the end of the film we see what the links are. Some people said that this is a film for children. I do not agree - it may be made by Disney and many characters from the children, but I am 23 years old and loved it! There were moments when the spine twitched. The story does not resemble any other film these days, full of adventure. I have requested the book from the Amazon, I can not wait!
