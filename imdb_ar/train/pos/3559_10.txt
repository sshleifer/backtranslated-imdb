I like this film. My only disappointment is that some of the original songs have been changed. <br /> <br /> True, Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this film, but it's also good that it is not just another Frank Sinatra movie where he often sings. <br /> <br /> I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice because he had the sound that suited him and I could not see anyone with that wonderful sound going away from the gangster's sense of his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye's book "Sit, You Rockin" is a long, long-lasting, love-only band that is hard to follow with his novel and I still love the best. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Blaine is excellent in this part and "Adelaide Lament" is my favorite for her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part.I might not have thought of it first, but after seeing it in the part, it was logical . <br /> <br /> Choreography by Michael Kid Khaleda If it is re-introduced in 2008, I will not change anything. <br /> <br /> I often find that something is lost from the play version to The release of the film, but it kept a sense Stage, although it was in the film. <br /> <br /> I thought that the film was good. I've performed regional copies of this it is one of my favorites in that period.
