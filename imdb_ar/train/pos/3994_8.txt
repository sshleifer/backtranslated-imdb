I went to this movie just because I went there and I would leave again immediately because the audience was mainly made up of older people and I felt that I was misplaced. However, the film was quite charming and away from its targeting of older people. All the characters were very authentic and believable and I found myself talking about the film, characters and story for hours afterwards. There are a few wonderful sights out there but they are necessary and help you understand the situation better. All in all, this is a wonderful movie and values ​​- a little far from the mainstream but that does not mean that this movie can not be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream. It's an exciting and interesting film experience.
