This is a documentary drama about the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. He especially looks at the problem of hinting, gossiping and predicting when dealing with real dramas. <br /> <br /> One of the issues in the story is how people expect to all give the same emotional response to similar attitudes. Not everyone goes to melodramatic hysterics in every major crisis. Just because the characters in movies and television behave in a certain way is not a reason to expect real people to do so. This is particularly suitable for reporters and news editors who seem to be looking for a great sigh scene that would pull ratings. It's a problem that needs to be addressed constantly. <br /> <br /> The performances performed by the characters are profound, personal and sensitive. They are ably supported by a large team of all individuals who play on the basis of reality. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting actors in this story are known people in Australia as comic actors. It reinforces my idea that comedians offer some of the best support in dramas because they know comics how to create quick impressions of individuals. I have to say something very personal here; in fact I am already an Adventist and I was a practicing member in Australia at the time of the accident; so I have a different impression A little bit more about the story than others. I think creativity is treated with amazing personality, emotional heart. I think the best scene is where the couple is chasing the new helicopters. She mastered the themes of the story brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Chipsy say in an interview that he asked representatives to "play the best cause for their personalities." While this is particularly appropriate for this story, I think it is also a general principle that must apply to all behaviors as well.
