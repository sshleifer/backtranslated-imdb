An excellent film depicting cross-currents in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of extraordinary people in rural areas of the Northwest Pacific. Strong guidance and writing along with good acting, especially the performance of Kwame Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly enough, the film was produced in the same year as "Crash", written and directed by Paul Hagis. The pace of activity may not be as hectic as in Los Angeles urban areas, and characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in "apart from that", but the personal relationships of characters are flawed and disturbing ringing stories such as those of "Crash". For those viewers who can "crash" this is a must see movie. Also, the fans Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes like this film.
