I am a writer working at home and my personal Diagnosis Murder is my companion during the lunch break - good fun, clean, cheerful spirit and nostalgia for the days of Dick Van Dyck's show. How innocent we all are (and how innocent people are killed). I especially enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgic characters like Joe Manix. The wicked always catch them, the wicked continue. It is clear that the stars enjoy themselves and have a ball without taking themselves seriously. <br /> <br /> One Beef: Why were so many bad women or at least bitches? Amanda was very dizzy. It's hard to imagine her doing anything as horrible as autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we have not seen another Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens. At lunchtime!
