A kind of road movies in the old trains in the province of Sloanian late summer. At first, you see a man in black trousers wearing black trousers. When the young man, wearing his black trousers, leaves the house with a shovel, you see that the part of the trousers is missing on the mantle (his father seems dead). On the train meets a young lady, and almost without words, but many small gestures, begin a wonderful love story. It is a somewhat surreal film, very poetic, and a somewhat bizarre film, with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
