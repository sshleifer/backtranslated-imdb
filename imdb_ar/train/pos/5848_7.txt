And gave him a high score of 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because he shook the bloody well. While there were a lot of other shows related to games / games, this presentation was unique in that it contained overlapping stories. As others have said here it was before its time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is why the show was a fate. They have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series so far. I hope it will come out more. <br /> <br /> How does this compare to watching it now 20 years after it first appeared .. I do not know I still like it despite the sometimes outrageous animations, and that IMHO is just a drawback. The writing was in the foreground almost and advanced to the competition ......... <br /> <br /> I hope to get more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in the right order ... DVD's are good but I do not think the stories In their proper order, but although this exhibition shook.
