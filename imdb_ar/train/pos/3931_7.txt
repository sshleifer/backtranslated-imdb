A somewhat fictional biography of Abraham Lincoln's early years directed by John Ford, with a primary focus on a trial in which the young lawyer defended two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film presents an interesting picture of this important American form and well-made film, but it seems somewhat incomplete without any great moments of his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious goal was to portray Lincoln as a young man developing the traits that make him the great man he will become. But the result for me is that while I was impressed with the shooting, it was not as satisfactory as I thought it could have been in a larger range. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln, we have Henry Fonda, who effectively displays a quiet power. Fonda's performance includes some extreme behaviors and other influences that are fairly effective in presenting Lincoln's image, especially when combined with some effective combinations and costumes that are sometimes slightly public. <br /> <br /> The support team is surprisingly strong that it does not include many of the regular supporters of Ford (sometimes referred to as its own securities company) but we have Ward Bond, one of Hollywood's most prolific actors. Bond appeared in more than 100 AFI films from any other actor, both in the original list and in the review. He has also appeared in the top 11 photo candidates. <br /> <br /> The film shows one scene that seems to have inspired a very similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", where it will do even better here, although this scene is one of the most effective in this film .
