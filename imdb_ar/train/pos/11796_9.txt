Given the fact that it is based on the most famous mass suicide incidents of modern times, it was enough to give attention to the film made specifically for 1980's television. But the fact is that it is a fascinating re-enactment of the life of Rev. Jim Jones, who built a church in a virtual empire and encouraged it to disintegrate In a humiliating cult, a member of Congress and his entourage were assassinated, and 917 followers committed suicide by drinking the Kool-Aid, which is covered with cyanide. <br /> <br /> Your taste has ended, but it is shocking enough. Unlike the amazing Samain cult, Joeyan Tragedy is distinguished by a team of stars, including Ned Betty (as MP Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Doriff, Brenda Vaccaro, Lever Burton, and Mide Sinclair. But Powers Boothe (in his first big role) is really emerging as Jim Jones. He actually becomes a man, his performance is fixation and chilling. Thus, it is no wonder that this film continues to attract attention after more than twenty years.
