An excellent moral tale and pre-encoded with Barbara Stanwyck as a newly inspired (through the writings of Nietzsche!) To expel their sensitivities and exploit themselves, the use of men to their advantage. It is not really fair in the German philosopher, but it is interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version does not do much for me but it certainly performs well here, she drives the car herself and the film forward. There is not much meat offered here as one might expect but a lot of rising positions and amazing jokes and insinuations. Great fun, if not a particularly attractive offer from men and I wholeheartedly assume that it is not a very attractive view of a female golden drill. However, this is life!
