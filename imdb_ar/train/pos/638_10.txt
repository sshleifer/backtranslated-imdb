For anyone who may think this offer does not suit them, please try it. Network television has degenerated into presentations that represent cloning of cloned animals or reality-based programs involving some often unrealistic people. This is a return to family-oriented television where the focus is on learning some lessons of life, learning what real friends and family are about, and maybe even learning a bit about our national hobby. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in the theatrical business today, and is a very impressive actor as the new, slightly naive young Pat Boy of the New York Imaginary Empires (a great name!). Dean Caen, Christopher Lloyd, Mar Winningham, and Kersten Sturms roam the main crew, all of whom are exceptional. This exhibition deserves an opportunity to catch up and see it. We hope this will continue for several seasons, and we can see Beth Young (Sumpter) as she learns and grows.
