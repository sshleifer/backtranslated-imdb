Not surprisingly awesome and well animated for one of Disney directly to the video throwing supplement. Like the previous series (The Lion King 2), I was happy because Disney brought back most of the original vocalists, making a big difference and maintaining a good level of traditional animation. The plot has been around for a while but we are engaged in a series of endless jokes ranging from hilarious to boring. To break the conspiracy and separate jokes, give us some ridiculous musical sequences, which are like jokes, ranging from fun to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part, moments like the MST3K are nice and full of unexploited possibilities, and do not really add a complete set to the movie other than as a way to restore memories of the past for an hour. The new characters are at least loved, and the old people do their work, so I can not hurt them there. In general, this film is not bad and leads to a cute petty stuffing between the most dangerous Lion King titles.
