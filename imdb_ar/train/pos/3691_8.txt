All are not even close to the sum of the parts. there is no problem. This film features a group of the most creative and versatile directors of our time and some truly famous names in the team. The parts are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends there. In fact, given that the style of character from all these different directors takes many forms, it is amazing that we feel that we are still watching the same film. No great effort has been made to transform it into a comprehensive one. This buffet has many wonderful ingredients, and I'm glad no one tried to put them all in one dish.
