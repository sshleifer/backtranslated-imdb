I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. I am firmly convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the geniuses of our time. They have the exotic ability to add this level of tampering to pop culture and make it silly but in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This is basically what makes South Park sooo funny. Once you get past the fact that it is likely to be the most vulgar and uncommon caricature ever seen, you see in each episode the message being transmitted. This is evident in BASEketball. Although directed by David Zucker, which is quite ridiculous, he has a sincere message about American companies and the shame of the major league sports. I'm also a sports enthusiast, so I find this movie fun sometimes because it is real in such an exotic way that people hate it. The opening introduction is wonderful ... tears of laughter every time I see that these football players are starting to rebredans! Some may not like this movie because it is not just a cup of tea for everyone ... but, just like South Park, once you look beyond the ridiculous ... it has a truly real message conveyed by a literal comic genius. This movie was given 8 out of 10 stars.
