I do not care about the number of bad reviews that purple rain gets, this movie rocks! Excellent movie, contains everything, great music (Prince Coarse!), Romance, drama. <br /> <br /> This is a very sad film, very moving. I do not want to say much more, I am not giving up the plot, but I will say that this film is very realistic, there are a lot of romantic relationships that go through these problems, and many similar families one depicted in the film. I think this is very realistic and real, making the film more animated. I love Jelly this movie that grew up, so many of us love the prince and there is a great relationship to any teenager who has similar problems. <br /> <br /> However, it is certainly not just a youth film, we recommend it to all age groups. Not all is dark, the film contains some great music, band performance scenes and exciting fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
