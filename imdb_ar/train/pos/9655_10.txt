Presque Rien may not have been the best film ever produced ... but it's better than many of you have said. I still have not seen a film of a better home character than this film. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching very narrative films, with a clear beginning, evolution and results. But European films are less narrative, but they make you think a lot and feel them. <br /> <br /> Many of you did not understand the meaning of the film .. The purpose of this film is not to show us a "simple summer" loving film, "with commercial characters" fall in love and live happily forever. "Summer holidays and the beach are only This film is directed to every boy who may feel empathetic to these boys. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some of you did not understand this movie well, given three parts movies, as the memories of the past have shown. In Pornichet, when they meet and love.- After a year and a half of living together in Nantes, Matthew does not go to a psychiatrist, he tries to commit suicide and he takes something, - The last part, when Mathieu returns to Pornichet, is in winter, alone .. to think about how his life changed, how he became his life, and try to find himself . <br /> <br /> It's possible that some people can not understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed with each other, but anyway, as I said before ... this is not a funny film. Someone seeing him is the flesh, we have Belami movies. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, what you want to show us, is how hard life can be for a boy unsure of his feelings and unsure of what to do in life. Matthew just wants to go away from home and tries to live this kind of life that I think could bring him happiness .. But what seemed complete at first .. later not as good as he thought, became disturbed, and felt that he lost his way in his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. Finally, he became depressed and tried to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? Not a funny film. Very hot scenes? Just a few .. But this is not a movie for entertainment. It is all about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel sympathy for life and Matthew's problems, and that's what the director wanted to do .. We have the harsh reality of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> To me, the best home-made film ever.
