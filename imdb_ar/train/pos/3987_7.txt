Mother is one of those films that you know are good, maybe wonderful, but they are like eating vegetables or doing math as a child - a lot of work and a lot of pain to invest in. <br /> <br /> It is likely that the story is disturbing in many ways: the death of a character during the first half hour, romance from December to May, the idea of ​​a man betraying his wife and then cheating on his sweetheart with her mother, a group of thirty weak and unpleasant people A certain extent, and the apparent indifference of adults to children in their lives. The film was produced in 2002 or 2003, but it is a return to a collection of British films (usually dedicated to television) from the late 1980s - which have a moral hazard that never allows them to produce, resulting in intense anger. <br /> <br /> The mother is impeccable, but that's partly the problem; if a film that deals with a lot of sensitive issues has some drawbacks - text inconsistencies, some lesser actors - it keeps away from the edge, but if this movie Perfectly perfect, the experience of seeing it is old and painful. Even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer suffer; London in this film is bright and open, filled with harsh intermittent light. <br /> <br /> If you are cruel as a nail, or you are one of those super sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with great pain or sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the mother. Anyone in between, give it a miss, or be prepared for confusion. Be careful: as far as the film is from start to finish, the worst will come. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it (to sleep with her boyfriend). The daughter quietly says she thought about it and would like to hit her. The mother agrees, both standing, and instead of a good slap, her daughter beat her fist and made a boxing hit. Erg !!!
