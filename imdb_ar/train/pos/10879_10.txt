I've wanted to see a cut since the day I heard it, which was sometime in the past year. Anyway, I saw the day, when the film started, I thought it started a week, but it improved after 10 minutes or so. I thought the film was good. But what I did not like was how the killer was created. I was thinking before I rented that he was likely to be sucked up like the legends of Urban: Finally, I almost died. Mostly everything in UL final cut needs to be improved. CUT 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT is killer and death scenes. The killer is kicking MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give 8 out of 10 pieces
