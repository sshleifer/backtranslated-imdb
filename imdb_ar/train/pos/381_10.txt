I've been given this film 10 not because it's a great movie, but for its sheer ability to stir up emotions in its audience. The story of the struggle of one woman against all odds is an old clich√© so far, but very few films have carried so much warmth and sincerity like The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> He showed a different aspect of the African-American experience - showing that after the slaves were granted freedom, many fell in the ways of the hated "white man" and abused their people. I find this to be an important point because it contrasts with the direction of the film "White-Black-Black-Black-Violence" and "Win-Oscar". <br /> <br /> The performances are also great - especially Oprah I'm working on now and enjoy new respect found. <br /> <br /> Worth watching - but keep some tissue at your fingertips.
