Although this film will not fall into the wonderful cinema records, it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The movie is finally released in a video where it was supposed to appear for the first time in the first place. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a select group of friends who gather for dinner called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays the role of a woman acting as an alternative in order to get a boost for the restaurant you want to open. Bill Nan plays the role of loving a Cadillac lover who becomes her lover. Fox offers great performance and touch, and Nunn is as reliably talented as ever. Michelle de Presse is shouted as a more than a senior lawyer. Groups of actors - composed of familiar faces - work together well to revive this exotic group of characters. This is a good rental and one of the few that you can see with all the family.
