The first part of the infamous horror series is presented as a quick film discovered by producers and prepared like an amateur camcorder, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. He shows a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men and torturing her for several days before finally killing her. The wretched victim is savagely beaten and thrown into the raw flesh before pulling her fingernails with her pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye pierced with a needle, and so forth. <br /> <br /> Scene, the women's abductors burned it with hot water and dropped it in the burns. The series received a lot of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen tried to believe that the series contained an actual murder, banned in the United States. An investigation by the FBI found that the films were apparently only for most viewers - re-creating a patient using bad but obvious special effects. This film was shown in a shocking way by the famous Japanese comedian Heidi Hino, who directed the third and fourth episodes, a sure way to clear all but the most forgiving rooms. But hunting dogs may not find anything special.
