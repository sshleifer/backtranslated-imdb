Besides the fact that in all this horror, this movie has exceeded all my expectations, this masterpiece of film history depicts the excessive use of crappy filters at its best! Paul Johansson and Craig Scheffer appear to be brothers with everything. As usual a woman satisfies her true intentions. The end came as abrupt as the death of his older brother, Keith Scott. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the "walking ground" are exactly as I remember from my early travels. - To be honest, my passion for trash movies makes this person a must in my never-ending group. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone they love with the most wonderful brother of One Tree Hill. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
