I was not very impressed with the TV until I saw it 24 times for the first time. I arrived at the chain very late. The fifth season ended before I saw the first episode. A series of series 3 was on the DVR box while I was sitting for the weekend at home. It took this one episode for me to be hooks and hooks in the world of Jack Bauer. The boy was addicted to drugs !! I watched the next six episodes without turning a blind eye. I went the next day to Blockbuster and shared an unlimited monthly pass for $ 20, and needless to say it was the biggest money I ever bought. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. This is a 72 episode forty minutes! I'll say that finding out what happens next is easier on a DVD than waiting for a full week. I can only imagine expecting to watch the sixth season of the week to the week !! I find her somewhat tortured and cruel, but I will try her experience and watch it just like the rest of America !! The DVR is set and you can bet I'll chomp in bits !!
