The title of this film is meaningless, so you see it running, because it's the sound that a young man makes when he's running a fictional band, which he does all day long. He is just one of many exotic characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunkards who trade with wives, there is a man who has aspirations to be an engineer, and his little son who sends him begging to eat. There is a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of the mind in everything that goes around him, and there is a businessman who has some severe nervous convulsions that have a wife deal (and everyone else) like dirt. <br /> <There is no specific plot for this, in fact, it is a collection of stories that drift between each other, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. All in all, I thought it was good, and I was dying to see it for a long time based on his description. I was not at least disappointed and I would definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10.
