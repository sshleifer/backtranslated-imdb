I've stumbled across this re-run several years ago, and I fell in love with it. Featuring Tia Leoney and Holland Taylor and they kept laughing at me, one after the other. I think it did not make it too big, it was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was good and I would suggest watching it ... if the opportunity arises.
