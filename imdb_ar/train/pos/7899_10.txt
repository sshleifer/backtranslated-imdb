This was an excellent film. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There were so many things you could contact, lots of beautiful pictures, and a lot of sympathy in things that were not said. I was quite comfortable, and I felt happy and happy, just like I did when I finished most Tom Robbins story. Now I have not read Robin's book specifically, so I do not know how much it matches, but I can not imagine that this film was so bad. The film leaves you a lot to define yourself, the best part of any novel Tom Robbins, dreams of detail. <br /> <br /> For everyone who said that this film was the worst film ever, I feel pity for the little that should be left of the faint light in your hearts. Far from the worst ever, this film was glorious. Long live the turkey jack.
