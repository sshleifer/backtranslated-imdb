Two sailors on vacation - a man of ladies Joseph Brady (Jane Kelly) and timid innocent Clarence Dolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Katharine Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There's more, but you probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for music in the 1940s) is ridiculous and everything is beautiful and healthy - it becomes very annoying very quickly. Also this movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and that's too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring figures for Jos√© Iturbi and Orchestra. This is still worth attention. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances or sings Sinatra or Grayson it becomes magical. Do not forget any of the songs in particular but Sinatra had a great voice that you would not care about. It has been filmed with rich Technicolor technology with all MGM glosses. The acting was fine - Kelly was okay (although seeing him as a man would pay him) and Sinatra was wonderful (although seeing him as a shy man was also paying her!). Graceon is given nothing to do but is incredibly beautiful to look at. Some of her shots literally took my breath away! There are lots of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly the Great for dancing and singing. Sinatra sings anything; two songs of Grayson and a well-known cartoon sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - a moving mouse! Tom is a very funny veil. There is also a little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene in it. <br /> <br /> So it is too long and the plot does not hold up but it is still worth seeing. This was a great success in its day.
