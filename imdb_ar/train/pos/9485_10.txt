I watched this film for the first time in several years - and it was shown in a moment. It's great and much better than J. F. K. Because you must always think, "Can this happen to me? Can I become a murderer?" You can not turn on the TV or VCR without thinking about the plot and the end, which you should not miss under any circumstances.
