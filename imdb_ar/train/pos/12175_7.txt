What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having a bachelor party with some of his close friends at a man's bar in Hawaii? Each sail is so smooth that it takes off the Single Hat. What do you say about him talking to one of the dancers united and then sleep with them? What do you say if that girl is exactly his cousin? New low level, right? Well, Paul Coleman, who played Jason Lee's comedy, leads this experience of oblivion to nausea and a new low. I must say that this is one of his good leadership roles. However, I think his role in Vanilla Sky was better represented. <br /> <br /> High actress Salma Blair played his role in financial funding named Karen, while Karen's character, Becky, played a beautiful and talented role. Julia Steeles. Back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with an emerging problem. Get sick, deal with certain people, play lying games with stealth or any member of each family can get P.Oed, including a relative who has not had a "bowel movement" for 14 days. To the long-awaited wedding with a hilarious scene before summing up all the hell that Paul and his brother had to pass. <br /> <br /> In general, the game of Guy Theing is very funny and well. If you're a Canadian and a fellow in CTV Brett Butt, Corner Jas, you'll get to know a small role played by Fred Ewanweek The same man who plays Hank in the series This film is fine, it is another feather in Lee's hat (a completely empty hat so far). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
