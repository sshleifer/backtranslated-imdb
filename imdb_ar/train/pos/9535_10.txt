Road to Perdition, an undisclosed film that year, the Oscars are the second work of Sam Mendes (and, in my opinion, his best), a director who won the Oscar three years ago for his widely acclaimed but controversial American beauty. It is a wonderful film, at the same time moving and sad. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a wealthy and relatively happy family from outside appearances during the hard times of the Depression, when the father, Michael Sullivan, the father of two children, played with the great Tom Hanks (I am not a fan of him but I must say so ) Is a man hit the local Mafia, played Paul Newman. His eldest son, a 13-year-old boy, Michael Sullivan Jr., played by Tyler Hutchinson, ideally, after years of pleasurable ignorance to discover what his father's job is and what his family lives on. Driven by his curiosity and ambition to know the truth, accidentally becomes a witness to a murder committed by John Rooney, the son of his father's chief. Such discovery infects an innocent spirit and causes many events that have changed his life forever. In this atmosphere, all backgrounds and decorations are created perfectly, editing and filming are almost impeccable while the story is well written. But the main line of the film, the most important moments and points of the film and the main factor of the success of the film, is difficult parenting relationships in bad times. They have shown with depth, strength and conviction. Tom Hanks enjoys an excellent job and has one of the best performances in his career in a very unusual role for him, and everything that acts in all areas is wonderful. Finally, it is worth mentioning the very nice result of Paul Newman, and as a result, we got a wonderful job for all the people involved in making this beautiful masterpiece (but again sad). I think Road to Perdition is one of the greatest filmmaking achievements of this decade and is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> My estimate is 10 out of 10
