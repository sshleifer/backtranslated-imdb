Those who engage in a film camera in the early part of this century must know some of their potential very early. This is a good story for a playboy who needs money and sells his soul to the devil unintentionally for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul doubles and it must confront him constantly, tearing his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes where people fade, and of course the scenes when the two are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but Faust's story is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general non-gravity of people in the film. Also, they have moved far away from many of the actions that would have given at least a bit of life. I was first introduced to this film about 25 years ago and finally managed to watch it. I was not disappointed.
