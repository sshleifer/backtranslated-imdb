Well, I must admit that I never saw "Roda" and one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I do not know anything about this comedy talent, I still love this film very much. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose tries her luck in being a comedian. Roda is struggling with photography. And Meredith ... What exactly do you do again? These three stories that we follow for two hours are entertaining and entertaining in their own way. When the two friends meet a long time ago, it makes the film better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the quality of the writing. The little jokes that Mary and Ruda threw were funny. The script is well prepared together. <br /> <br /> I've seen Moore and Harper in other films over the last few years and I thought it was very good. But I had no idea they worked well as a team. Although each of the two actors did their part to achieve the title of this film, they never let me down. (During the running of this film.) Joey Linz and Marissa Ryan play their roles well but nothing is great. Other actors like Jonah, Cecile and .... all others work well too. <br /> <br /> Since this reunion, you will expect any fans to enjoy any of these offers. I'm still not enjoying this little meeting. The lines of a good story for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good. (The latest version of the song does not affect the MTM attribute either.)
