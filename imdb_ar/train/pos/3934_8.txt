Young Mr. Lincoln is a beautiful poetic film that captures the legend of one of the most respected figures in American history. Henry Fonda has a difficult task of portraying a mythical character while at the same time making it human enough for people to care. Maybe this is the best rep. See how he stops alone killing the mob. Alice Brady is wonderful in the role of a simple farmer woman. Most of the last part of the film plays in the courtroom, and here lies the only part of the film. The negative thing I can say about this film. Most of the characters from the judge to the viewers are given a lot of comic lines that distract attention from the serious experience that exists. But I'm used to it because humor is a trademark of Ford. Cut support from Ward Bond and Donald Mick is very good.
