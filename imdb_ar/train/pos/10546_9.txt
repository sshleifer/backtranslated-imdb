I came across this movie because I got a new free version of Blockbuster and I needed to get something quickly, as the store was preparing to close in the evening. Plain white cover and title intrigued me. I am an "old" woman (relatively) and my son is a 30 year old. I adore films that are just entertainment, like The Sixth Sense, and an interview with a vampire, Harry Potter and Peteljos. My son, on the other hand, is a film graduate and enjoys highly specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Herzog. We generally hate film choices for each other, however, we have seen the film and have not liked it! It was unlike any film we had seen before. We are both sarcastic / critical characters, and we usually break films while watching them - but in this case we laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish. In our opinion, if this film were to be promoted and exhibited in major theaters in the United States, it would have been a great success already.
