In October 1945, the German-American descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrived in Frankfurt after the war and his uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Jargard) got a job on the Zentroba train line. While traveling on the train he learns his profession, sees occupied occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sokwa), the daughter of a former strong businessman in the field of transport and owner of Zenitropa, Max Hartmann (JÃ¼rgen Reinberg). Leopold remains neutral among Allied and German forces, aware that there is a terrorist group called "wolves" that kills sympathizers and acts of sabotage against allied forces. Falls in love with Katerina, and soon reveals that she was "dejected". When Max commits suicide, Leopold is under pressure from "wolves" and needs to take a stand and a decision. <br /> <br /> "Europe" is an impressive and exciting story by the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an Expressionist style Fritz Lang alternates with a great black and white film with some colorful details. This film reveals a difficult period in Germany and some of the problems that this great nation faced after its defeat in the war. It is very impressive that the occupation forces destroy the resources that can allow a faster reconstruction of the devastated country, and corruption with the Jew who must determine Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an amazing performance in the role of a man who wants to remain neutral but is manipulated by everyone everywhere. The hypnotic narration of Max von Siddo is another touch of class in this award-winning film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europe"
