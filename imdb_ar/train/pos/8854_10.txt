The Bible teaches us that love of money is the root of all evils. The love of money leads to greed that can lead to pride and ultimately to destruction. Two brothers, Andy and Hank, will discover how much money they love and the people they love most will cost them. <br /> <br /> Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) will be more different. Andy seems to enjoy successfully working in the New York real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina (Marisa Tomei) who is an idea about a cup wife if she ever finds one. Hank, however, is the absolute who finds himself at the mercy of his former wife, expensive school bills, and the endless amount of child support payments. A well-meaning man with good intentions, you can not afford to escape the water that slowly lifts over his head no matter how hard it is to swim over him. <br /> <br /> Problems with the only difference between him and his brother that he hides them better. He has committed a fraud against his company and has been heavily involved in drug abuse in order to escape his fears. The pressures of his life and the lies he needs to maintain his appearance have made him think of fleeing from the country with Gina to start over. Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do it and thinks he knows how to get it. What? Steal their jewelry shop owned by their parents and run it. This betrayal is the place where the Hanson brothers, their families and many other lives will be destroyed by greed, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of "before Satan knows you are dead" is how the story is told. After the failure of the robbery, the killing of Annette Hanson (Rosemary Harris) the mother of both Andy and Hank, the story is listed from a variety of different views of several days before and after the attempted burglary. Learn more about not only motivated Andy and Hank, but also reacted to their father Charles (Albert Finney) to die his wife. The relationship between Charles and his two sons, especially to Andy, is also explored and the discovery of another possible motive of the kind after it emerged that there is little love between the two men. Perhaps Nanette was very loved by her children, but their father is a different story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman once again proves why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood today by portraying Andy not only as a greedy criminal with a lack of morality but also, paradoxically, as a man we can sympathize with. Ethan Hawk also brings Hank alive not only as a loser, but as a man desperate to cling to what little is left of him. Thus, Andy and Hank were brought to life in a realistic way so that they are easy to consider not just personalities but the very real images of the lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> Before Satan knows you are dead, a moral tale of how our actions lead to consequences that we might not expect to face. What's more, our choices can also affect those around us in ways we never expected. In what should have been the best picture of this year, we see how people's lives easily collapse when love of money becomes the ultimate requirement in order to ease our troubled lives. In other words, there are no easy solutions or answers to our problems and trying to find them can make things worse. <br /> <br /> 10/10
