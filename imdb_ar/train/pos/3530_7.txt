I can safely admit (like IMDb) that "Lady Phantom" will not hit Noir's Top 20. You may not sneak into the top fifty. But instead of discrediting the film because it is not as good as many other classics of noir film genre, it should be noted that "Phantom Lady" has strong and durable images enough to make it worthwhile. All that is required of the viewer is the ability to move beyond the frighteningly slow start. <br /> <br /> The film is not cooked until the movie "Ella Raines" begins to try to prove everything but the innocence of its president, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. "Kansas" is Anderson's daytime secretary and amateur detective at night. As the beginner proves that she is doing well for herself while working on the streets of New York at night. Little by little, you begin to assemble pieces of the mysterious mystery. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines, thanks to his success in attending the film at all. It is somehow capable of bringing life to life in a film about a convicted man who is not at all interesting. I'm not sure whether this separate dynamic of a prominent man with no personality is making the actor or director wrong, but clearly this is where something is terribly wrong with the film. As a novice investigator, things are actually speeding up to another hideout when Kansas makes a late night visit to the drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr) for some information to help her convicted boss. She and the drummer paint the city with a new kind of red color while visiting jazz clubs "all night long". Trying to describe this scene as either unfair to the scene or worse, the scene may be destroyed together. You will know the scene once the last shock is over. If you're lucky enough to have this movie on a DVD, you're likely to rewind this scene again and again. As good as Raines, this scene makes this film remarkable. The main reason for this scene is to label "Lady Phantom" at 7 instead of 6. <br /> <br /> For the most part, this film is cool and pleasant with a few wonderful sights and one great scene. It is a "drum / sex scene" that separates this film from anyone else of the same kind. <br /> <br /> As in the movie "You Never Mistake Vanilla," I would like to add that "going with flannel" is a safe return option when you can not decide to take a more tasteless treatment. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
