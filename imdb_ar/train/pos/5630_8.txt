Marjorie (a wonderful and cultured performance by Farah Fawcett) avoids being assaulted in her car by the evil rapist Jo (who has played wonderfully with James Russo's vicious and heavy condemnation). However, Joe steals her wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. She pays her a fateful day visit. After Marjorie was subjected to much deterioration and psychological abuse, Marjorie was able to turn the table over to Joe and lock her in the fireplace. What will Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and scriptwriter William Mastrosymon have a cruel, intense and often troubling moral tale that highlights the glamor of brutal brutality and the painful degeneration of rape, while also showing how anyone when pressuring extremism can commit horrific acts of violence and humanity. Joe looks at women strictly as objects while Marjorie sees Joe just as an animal. However, this film refuses to its impressive balance making Joe out just a one-dimensional crawl. Instead, he is a real and pathetic human monster in the end with a wife and child (especially Joe's recognition is particularly influential). Fossett and Rousseau are both prominent in the lead. They receive good support from Diana Scarwood like Terri Passive, Alfry Woodard as Patricia's reasonable role, and Sandy Martin as sympathetic police officer Soudo. Both Curtis Clarke is a graceful cinematographer and DJ. Redford buttock, the skin crawl result greatly enhances the great phobia tension. Real power.
