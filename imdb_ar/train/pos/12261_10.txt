I and Tentin have recently been sent as a link from P.O.V. Series. It is based on a recorded interview by George Remy A. K. Herg, creator of Tinten, since 1971, discusses in his various experiences the publication of his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, and then in his series of comic books. Great views of various comic pages and surrealistic images of Herge's dreams. I first encountered Tintin on the Digest Digest pages in my local elementary school library that read the secrets of Unicorn. My mom later got a CD subscription and I read the whole red treasure for Rack Rackham every month in 1978. I remember seeing some of the illustrated Tintin books in a local bookshop afterwards but for some reason I did not get anything because I was 12 years old I thought I'd beat them. I have a book, Breaking Free, written by J. Daniels and published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. You have not read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life as when he left his first wife after an affair with a colorist in his work (he married her later). Her name is Fanny and she was interviewed here. If you love Tintin and its creator, this movie is definitely worth watching. Updated: 9/4/07 - I've read now Breaking Free. Tintin and the Captain are the only ordinary characters to appear here designed to fit Mr. Daniels' anti-capitalist views. Tintin is depicted as a flimsy grandson with a slice on his shoulder, yet he cares about the captain's tribe. The captain here just tries to meet with his wife and daughter he loves dearly. They and other construction workers pledge to strike after the death of a fellow employee in an equipment accident. Everything happens in England with the Cockney accents of the working class intact. This is not the kind of thing that Herge would agree, but a pleasant read though. Oh, yes, the Snowy dog ​​appears only in the upper left corner of the cover (where Tintin runs on the police!) And on the dedication page.
