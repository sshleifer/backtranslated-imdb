It made me wish my happy bird could talk. Tess Tiss on the references that distorted the film. A sweet story will be enjoyed by people of all ages. Pauli is a lovable little treasure. He has quite a few smart lines that made me really laugh. I particularly liked the dance sequence during his Chopiz period. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s as you rejoice in his quest for Mary's reunion. An enchanting film featuring two strong characters who faithfully survive the small parrot separated from its young owner. I wanted to see more women with blindness and have to give up their mutual journey. She loved her artistic and poetic inspiration, a shame she could not share with Pauli. Pauli blesses his new home, finally with Mary, perhaps joined by a gentle young man who helped him defeat opponents to complete his journey.
