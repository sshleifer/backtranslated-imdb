Although loving Rita Hayworth, finding the last few strings of the movie Sedition and the ability to appreciate some aspects of the "symbolism" of the cinema, my Lady did not work from Shanghai completely for me. I encountered a problem with most presentations, script and overall structure. In a film that often talks about people talking to each other in different situations, that's a problem. The lady from Shanghai ended up with "C", or No. 7, for me. <br /> <br /> The lady from Shanghai revolves around the character of Orson Welles, Michael O'Hara. O'Hara sees Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in Central Park on a trip that moves and hits her. Later, he saves her from theft and takes him shine. O'Hara is a sailor from Ireland, and Elsa encounters a yacht with her husband Arthur (Ever Sloan), a well-known and powerful defense lawyer in California. They talk O'Hara about working for them, despite his initial reservations - it seems to him and to the audience that Elsa is only looking for someone who has an affair, and O'Hara does not want to participate. <br /> <br /> Shortly after going to work on their yacht, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), a strange man, says he is Arthur's partner, appears in a port of communication and begins to cause trouble. In the end, Grisby asks O'Hara to enter into a highly dubious and dangerous scheme. Absently, O'Hara agrees. Of course, he faces a lot of trouble, and in the end a number of puzzles are revealed. <br /> <br /> My problems with the film may lie in the fact that, to date, I am not exactly a big fan of Orson Welles, and here, he produces, writes, directs and consumes most of the screen time. I have not seen anywhere near the majority of Wells' work, but I was more inclined to admire his later films when he became more attractive and performing. For example, I liked his game at Casino Royale (1967) when he insisted strangely on allowing him to do magic tricks on the gambling table, but Citizen Kane (1941) did little Lee, despite giving him 3 or 4 chances over the years (including almost a year ago; my rating was low 7 - is the same as my current grade for The Lady from Shanghai). <br /> <br /> Welles's performance and the dialogue he wrote for himself seem to me to be both touched and toned for me. It is a little talk, a little bit of mor, and a little monotony - tends to look as if he was reading. I was reminded of what I saw in the Welles version of Moby Dick (IMDb in 1999, but "completed" in 1971, which can also be seen in Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995)). It is by its very sexy nature. I am also a person who almost never complains of accents, but somehow Wales can make his Irish voice felt and also show me off. <br /> <br /> As for the other shows, I can only think that I thought Hayworth did an excellent job. Of course it's wonderful, which does not hurt. Lots of eye candy here. Like Wells, Sloan also seemed a bit affected and ambitious for me - I never bought him and his family and so on, and Anders is simply curious where the stranger does not seem to fit. Wells often falls close to him, and Anders always has an overbearing expression on his smiling face. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the lady from Shanghai is very unequal. The first 50 minutes or so is very delicate and practical soap, although the soap opera administrations tend to approach the quirky twist. Once Grisby has made his plan, things get a bit better and often get better as we approach the end. But by the time the Lady from Shanghai becomes a crime / mystery film, it's too late, and it soon turns into a drama in the courtroom before the sudden and exciting ending that comes almost nowhere and ends very quickly for her close relative. <br /> <br /> The end is more action-oriented, less conversational, more diverse and strange in settings, and sometimes, somewhat abstract. Wells handles this combination of materials skillfully as an outlet. If the lady from Shanghai had a great mix of crime / mystery and the end of the loop, it would have been easy to reach at least 9.. The final scenes are easily 10s, as Welles moves from the Hitchcockian suspense scene at the Chinese San Francisco Opera House to another suspense scene in a Chinese park. Peak Funhouse uses cinematography which was experimental in his time. It is well integrated with the script, because it provides complex accuracy and feeds a lot of symbolism. <br /> <br /> Cinema around is interesting, even if it usually can not compensate for the problems in the foreground. Wales blocks the viewer skillfully. There are lots of attractive photo settings, from Central Park to Acapulco to various San Francisco locations. Wells effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his actions, from the confirmed highlands and rapid downfalls in Acapulco to the maze-like streets of the Caribbean, the beautifully framed and shaded footage of the San Francisco water basin, and so on. Romance material, which serves Aquarium as its single background, is impressive with a kind of unease throughout the film, but on the other hand, the romance never works as a romantic friendship. <br /> <br /> Welles fans will certainly appreciate the lady of Shanghai much more than I appreciate, and of course worth watching if you love Rita Hayworth. In my opinion, The Lady from Shanghai is not a terrible film, but it is dangerously close to not passing. Advance cautiously.
