Betty Beg was the icon of pent-up fifties, when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but it was high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young people. Gretchen Mol is doing a great job in filming Bettie, who was a little girl in the city with ambitious ambitions and a wonderful body. Her acting career did not go anywhere, but her body brought her to the height of fame in a famous field. Black and white photos intersect with colors when you graduate from the world of exploitation in New York. This HBO movie has good production values ​​and a very reliable support force. The problem is that it is somewhat emotional. It's hard to make a connection to the character, where Bettie is portrayed as a shallow and naïve person because of the work she was in. Self-serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time, eventually slowing down the film. But it is certainly worth watching the history of that time, and seeing the harsh government repression that characterized the fifties. 10/07
