The comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". It is the first association between Laurence Olivier and Meryl Oberon, before this little film about the uncontrollable passion of English marshes in the nineteenth century. Although Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suited for spiral comedy, they all flow well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in the suite of the Olivier Hotel for divorce lawyers, through an English haze preventing travel. She does everything in her power to irritate him - but, in a crazy way you go movies, falls for her. It lies to him. But there is a serious case of mistaken identity that occurs when Oliver believes in the film "Lady X" in Oberon (this is all that Oliver leaves in a note) to be a married woman. To make matters worse, more fun, Lord Mir (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier wanting a divorce from his wife that Larry believes dear must be Oberon! There is some nice dialogue between a gender battle, and an enjoyable exploration of sex politics. You can see that Olivier is not confident of comedy, but in real Olivier is a prominent professional, and presents. It handles transitions and coil coils, probably not easily, but with Jost. Oberon did not shake as an actress, but she was usually qualified enough, and despite their famous hatred outside the screen, Olivier worked well. This was portrayed in the early Technicolor which looks very primitive today (everyone seems whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe you need print to clean.
