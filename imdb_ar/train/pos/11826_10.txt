I never got the midnight show for a movie before "Dick Tracy" came out. <br /> <br /> I still have the "shirt ticket" I had to wear to get accepted in the show here somewhere, like this shirt, "Dick Tracy" has been stuck with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the movie, the sharp visuals, bright colors, and powerful characters have entered your mind. It's a wonder to see. <br /> <br /> As a director / star / co-writer / producer, Betty knows what works in a movie and shows it here, and takes on a familiar American icon and recreates a whole new era. Still set in the thirties, "Tracy" has a kind of timeless quality like all good movies. I've lost track of the number of times I've seen Tracy and still find something new every time I do it. <br /> <br /> All of them are first class, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (a reminder that he can do comedy best), so Madonna, who does not breathe Mahoney's passion, has a connection to that in the environment Appropriate, can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still many issues that have been addressed, such as family necessity, self-preservation, good versus evil, until the Machiavellian subjects are explored. Strange for a comic striped movie, but hey. <br /> <br /> All in all, Dick Tracy is a classic in itself. Compared to other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It is a good and strong film that does not rely on blood, violence, obscenities or nudity to prove its point of view. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to learn here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
