This movie should not be compared to "The Sting" or other caper / heist / con. Making it a great film experience like what you say about relationships, deception and trust. It is also critical critique of psychiatry, since the protagonist is a deflated con easily and then behaves in a primitive way in the end. Did Mr. Mamet have an unfortunate experience of treatment? High, highly recommended!
