This is the film in the intermediate period in Antonioni, which most critics quickly deny, as a flawed view of American youth culture / policy in the 1960s. For what he deserves, I found him more touching and memorable than his famous films such as Laventura, perhaps because he shows more passion and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but used as a framework for Anthony's brilliant observations and criticisms about American consumer culture, student life, counter culture, and the entire anti-war reverse response, which was very prominent at the time. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is a beautifully prepared film, from the opening credits sequence to "Love" in the exotic desert, and even the use of billboards, to the deadly conclusion that used 17 sets of cameras (In its own way, as strong as the peak of the Wild Punch). Also, Antonioni chose one of the leading lady hell with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever that screen grace. There is not much "acting", because this sounds like a documentary drama, so the use of non-professionals as a leading couple works very effectively in this context. The soundtrack is not only full of great music, but its use is also impressive (I can not forget the beginning of the film, mostly because of the choice of music - by Pink Floyd - which creates images well). Contrary to popular opinion, this is a major achievement in the cinema, one of the activities I enthusiastically recommend to anyone who has taste or tolerance for the fools. Worth searching for one of those major movies in the 1960s that require a DVD restore / release.
