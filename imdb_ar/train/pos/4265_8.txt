If you do not see this mysterious little magic, you should look for it. It is the war-worn Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray), which is listed in the F-4 list each time it tries to join any branch of the military. He finds a magic lamp that of course contains Jane Sheldon, but the genie is more alert than McMurray does, sending him over time to serve him at all times and places more wrong than he needs. It is a gentle, pleasant and pure fluff you can only love. The plots are largely like Disney, especially as MacMurray and Sheldon made many Disney movies in the 1950s and 1960s, though they were not together. Needless to say, all this ends well for everyone, and the viewer disappears in good shape.
