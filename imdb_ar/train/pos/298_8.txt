New York never looked so good! He has no one in this film. Although the script is a bit lightweight, you can only like this movie or any of the characters in it. I wish people like this existed. The attraction of the actors is what he really put in (John Ritter, Colin Camp, the late Dorothy STARTEN is very good.) Buy, rent or buy this movie you'll be happy with.
