One of the best three shorts Stooges at all. A nervous house full of bad guys and "The Goon" defy the best detective alert men. Shemp in the best scene in the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitka offers excellent support in Mr. Goodrich's role as the target of a murder plot. Before it is finished, the "small reliable shovel" for Shemp is used extensively. This 16-minute gem moves as fast as Stooge moves and fills it twice. Highly recommended.
