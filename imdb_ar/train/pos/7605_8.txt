Lost is a very good TV series about some of the people who lost on an island. There are a lot of twists and turns so you can not really determine who your favorite character is, in one minute and then do something so be cool and then head to do something so it will be cool then the suspense builds up and as you are about to end the loop and end up like noooooooooooooooooooo !! !!!! So you have to wait a whole week to watch the next episode but it's worth the wait. It's the thrill, the movement, the romance, the humor that distinguishes everything from naked girls, but that's good because it means you can focus more on the story and the story is all about it. So if you like a good story and like suspense, this is a good story, but I think it's better than 24 years old (I have a review about it too so you can check it out). Because it is very unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
