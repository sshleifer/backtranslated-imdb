No one knows, where can I see or download "What I Like About You" episode 4 online? Because I will die to see them and here in Germany will not be shown on television. Please help me. I want to see season 4 bad episodes. I've already seen Episode 4 and Episode 18 on YouTube. But I could not find more episodes of season 4. Is it possible to have a web site where I can watch episodes? Because I read some comments in the forums of Germany and there were people who actually watched the episodes of Season 4 even though they were not shown on TV in Germany. I am happy with all the information I can get. Thanks Kate
