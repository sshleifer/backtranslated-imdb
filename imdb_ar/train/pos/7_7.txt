Although I did not like Stanley and Iris as a film, I was impressed with the acting. Jean Fonda and Robert de Niro are wonderful in this film. I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work, but here they are sensitive and powerful at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make every role he plays in representing gold. He has a wonderful performance in this film, and there is a wonderful scene where he has to move his father to the house of the elderly because he can no longer care for him, breaking your heart. I do not really recommend this film as a great movie entertainment, but I will not say you will not see a lot of behaviors anywhere.
