There must be a subtype in the West called "Robert Mitchum West". The shrewdly private Westerners in Mitchum, usually underestimated, personally import his own film Noir to paint some attractive dark personal drawings, bringing a sense of comfort in the world more familiar with Sam Beckenba's films. "Gunman" is one of his best. Directed by Richard Wilson, attorney Orson Welles, is a monochrome, monotonous, full of frightening images and terrifying revolutions of brutal violence, while Mitchum comes to tame a city terrorized by a monk with a special army. Mitchum's retreat from a stranger to speech into a warped killer, with a combination of dark emotions between them, is a marvel of expressive physical representation.
