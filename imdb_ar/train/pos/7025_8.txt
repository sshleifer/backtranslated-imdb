I found this adaptation charming, full of vitality and full of fun. With the exception of two major mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to echo some of the previous comments - Chen Phillips is a terrible teenager. She is 27 years old, very old (and yes, showing), and lacks Broadway singing "clips". Vanessa Williams is a good enough singer, and for a non-dancer, she is enough. However, they are not Latina, and her personality is certainly. It is also very powerful throughout, which has become tiring. <br /> <br /> The fans of Conrad Birdy are already flocking to Sweet Apple - with special tribute to Britta Dau and Chiara Zani. I also enjoyed Tyne Daley's performance, though I'm not a fan of her overall work. Finally, the "Shriners" dancers are rioters, especially the three in Dorky. <br /> <br /> The movie is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
