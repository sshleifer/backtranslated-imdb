Like Peckinpah with STRAW DOGS, and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Bormann presents an effective film on the side of a violent man in DELIVERANCE, arguably the final horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, John Voet, Ned Petty and Ronnie Cox portray four businessmen in Atlanta who decided to take a canoe ride to the wild Kahulawasi River in northern Georgia before turning into what Reynolds calls "one big dead lake." <br /> <br /> But the people of the local mountains take a grimly painful view of the "city boys" who care about the forests. The next day, and continuing on the river, Betty and Voith are assaulted and sexually assaulted (SQUEAL!) By two evil mountain men (Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward). Thus, what began as more than a tomb through the Appalachian Mountains has now become a nightmare in which our four heroes see the fine line between what we think as civilization and what we think of as barbaric. /> <br /> James Dickey adapted the script from his best-selling book, and the result was often shocking and disturbing. Often known as "SQUEAL!" And the "Dueling Banjos" sequence, DELIVERANCE is also a severe adversity, with the four leading men playing great roles, and McKinney and Coward make two of the most feared villains at all times. A movie should be watched for those wanting to seize a chance.
