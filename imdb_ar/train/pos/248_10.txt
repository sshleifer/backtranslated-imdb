"Ned Kelly" is a wonderful Australian film made by a real Australian hero. We've taken Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and other members of Kelly Gang, as the film explains and probably justifies Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> They present all the great performances, which bring life to the film. (Fantastic job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was as wonderful as Joe, where he played the role of a calm and loyal man. I have swept into the moment. For a moment I believed that gangsters would win the battle in Glenoron, unfortunately, that was not the case. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictional, and as a thirsty fan of Kelly's hand (and supporter), a little disappointed by this. Maybe the film could have been longer, to cover more of the life of Kelly Gang / Ned - I felt it was not covered enough. <br /> <br /> Regardless of some drawbacks, this is a moving film, evoking all kinds of emotions. (Hey, I suppose this movie would be better to watch instead of Mick Jagger who tries to portray Ned ...)
