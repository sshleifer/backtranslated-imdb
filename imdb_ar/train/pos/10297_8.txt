Well not really. This movie is very entertaining though. I went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the routine "I think there might be something in my eyes". The film is a wonderful mix of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carrey is as wonderful as a reporter who has the ability to change himself and the city where he lives. In fact all the characters are wonderful. The film is not too funny or happy, flick to go to see with the wife. <br /> <br /> All in all 8/10 .... Note * I'm not a student in class. This is everything from BigV over and over again!
