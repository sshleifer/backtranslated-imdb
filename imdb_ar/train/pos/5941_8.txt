It's a short fan-making film that claims to be a preview of a new film that blends Batman and Superman! It's a kind of movie that viewers like and see in places like ComicCon and made by the same person who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie goes, I can easily choose it apart. CGI effects are certainly not perfect and fashion far from perfect. But, this was made on a volatile budget and for a movie like this it is incredible. I was particularly impressed by Superman too - he was not a small wrinkled man! If this was just a preview of a real movie - they would have lined up here to Omaha to watch it. great work.
