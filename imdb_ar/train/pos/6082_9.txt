I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's releases of the Shakespeare Classics, where he's always done a very good job, but in this film, the person who takes the whole film is nothing but the "always greatest actor" Lawrence Fishburne. He certainly made some bad choices in films, although he is a wonderful actor, but in this film we give Othello the real passion and intensity of jealousy because it grows stronger along with the well-filmed paranoia of Fishburne. , We finally got a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him a mixture of sympathy / hatred, love / hate, and do not forget, those fireballs ...? Branagh Good As always, but not at its peak, the Desdemona of Irenne is fairly good but a bit dark, while Laurence Fishburne really raises it and makes it a very enjoyable and enjoyable film. Do you watch it?
