I was able to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my friend. We were deeply moved by the complexity of the plot and found it moving emotionally. They were very well directed with strong images. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short time. He had an original fantasy approach to a very real and dangerous subject: this film revolves around a young girl who visits a demon show to help her with her abusive father. There is also a sudden development in the end which made me feel very cautious. This tends toward a Gothic feeling. I would like to see this as a full feature film. - Carrie
