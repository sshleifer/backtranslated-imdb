The message of the world on the brink of war is ignored by the masses. The legendary city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it can represent any country in the world. When the war finally arrives, the ruin does not last for another five years, but until 1966 at that time every city was completely destroyed. To make matters worse, humanity is "wandering sickness," a disease that lasts another four years. <br /> <br /> "The things that will come" balance the deadly and futuristic worldview, where science highlights the hope of reviving civilization. The concept of "Wings Over the World" plays a somewhat minor role, although Kapal's spokesman (Raymond Massey) is unshakeable in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If it fails, others will follow. This message is constantly reinforced throughout the film, and was brought home convincingly at the end of Massey's speech. The unsatisfying man needs to test the limits of knowledge and achievement to the "all-universe or none" mentality. <br /> <br /> Remember the film's picture of automation and machinery in the second half of the great silent movie "Metropolis." With Everytown rebuilding and transformation by 2036, the scene of the rebirth of the city is a chord, It is a modern day that the vision of the productive prophetic film has begun to bear fruit, where the film is mistaken for sixty-seven years, although it is the first mission of man to the moon. But in 1936, a 100-year calendar may have seemed more legitimate than 1969 . <br /> <br /> "Things to come" is one of those scanties in the film, the picture that makes you think. It is not a convenient question, since both options present inherent risks and unknown consequences, those who choose to be spectators risking being swept away by forces beyond their control.
