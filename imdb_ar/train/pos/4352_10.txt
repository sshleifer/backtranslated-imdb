I was looking through the movie listings in my area on Yahoo and watched a movie that was not announced. I looked closely and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it. After watching "Mad About You", I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I am a big fan of Peter Falk. So the husband and I took a chance. We both have this story. Beautiful scenery, sincerity and family sense and moral values ​​rarely seen in movies and in the world today is not this unwanted junk, but the real life situations of people like real life. So I have to say, Paul Reiser was excellent, although I still would not watch "mad about you". I do not know where this movie went. I heard it was put off in a limited edition. Should be shared with the world. It's one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. M.
