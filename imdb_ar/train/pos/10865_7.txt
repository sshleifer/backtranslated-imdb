This movie is very interesting to see if you like movies from organized crime group. Those who are looking for a crime film of charismatic starring with the dreams of grabbing in a bad way, may be slightly disappointed by the way the film goes. <br /> <br /> It's fun with a criminal criminal but you're not familiar with Hong Kong movies, and you might be surprised by this movie. I was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices that I made a wise story but overall a good crime film. Some things were not logical but it seems that this is standard in East movies. <br /> <br /> People do things randomly regardless of how their characters are set up in advance. It's a little annoying pattern permeated even in this film.
