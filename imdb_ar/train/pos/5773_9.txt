Since I am very interested in Lake Beaches, this film has really been engraved. This movie is worth watching. If you want it awful they are good types of movies check it out. The effects are really good, just think of "Lost Land". I first saw this film in the early 1990s, perhaps more like 89/90 in a monster show of the local channel called "Morgus Presents." I saw him on DVD in the local Circuit City and I bought it right away so I could give it number 9 because it has a personal spot in the heart right there with the monster band and Gremlins. Good B movie fun for all ages.
