"Johnny Dangerous" is a kind of successful comedy movies that lack laughter and "huh". But I suggest you give him a chance. I think it's pretty much over. Not many people give this film a chance. It's doing the work. Just think of it as a little parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny is a serious gangster who wants to rise in life. He works his way from great leaders to a beautiful wife. And of course like a lot of mob movies, someone wants his death. 90% of jokes get laughable. I said, Give her a chance. You just have to take your favorite gangster movies and mix the comedy. You have a "dangerous Johnny". <br /> <br /> 7/10
