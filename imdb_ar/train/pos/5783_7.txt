I have read Kerching reviews on IMDb, and frankly, I have not seen a single positive review, yet. I really like Kerching. Kirscheng revolves around a teenage boy named Taj Lewis, in order to get Â£ 1,000,000 for his mother, created a website called Rodboy. The site offers lots of interesting things, if only Taj and his friends - Danny and Seymour can prevent Taj from being exposed. I find this presentation very funny and enjoy watching it. Representation is O.K. , But could certainly be better, funny characters, especially Danny Spooner, a friend of the crown, his stupidity is what makes him funny. And the other crown prince Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of a cafe called "cold". We never see him, only hear from him. Brother younger brother Taj, his older sister Messi very funny. Best friend Messi Carisha. Often, the crown is almost exposed to the detector, almost. In addition to comedy, the drama in Kerching like the love of life and the loss of loved ones make this program great.
