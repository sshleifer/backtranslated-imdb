What a fun movie! If you are a fan of Gialo, the Red Kane kills 7 times and is the real winner. First of all, it's hard to fail with Barbara Bushett and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. They are both wonderful - especially the innocent-looking innocent Bosch as a guilty woman who is scared for her life. The scenes at Red Queen Kills 7 Times are particularly beautiful and have enough blood to please most fans. One of the first murders comes somewhat unexpected and achieves a good start to the film. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most spectacular killers seen in an Italian film. Seventies collections and fantastic costumes. In fact, all the visual images are interesting with the red-haired Queen passing through the bridge at night to be one of my favorite moments in the film. The plot twisted my interest all the time. Finally, the degree of Bruno Nikolai may be the best I have heard from the composer. The main feature is so memorable that I could not get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> My only two questions with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come at the end of the film. First, the person responsible for the killings is very easy. If you've seen more than a Gialli couple, you will not have any trouble determining who is behind the killings. Second, the end feels very quick and, as a result, a bit confusing. I'm definitely not the person who needs every specific plot point for me, but I admit I'm puzzled to explain everything. A second view may only erase this.
