One thing about Hollywood, someone has been successful and always pushed to copy it. Another thing is that players give some of their best offers away from their studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson won these awards for his performance in the Texas-based Giant, which Universal executives had to think about, let's quickly move to another trendy place in Texas. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Robert Stack got great ratings for The High and the Mighty like a pilot who was cracked under the weight of a damaged plane and naturally gave him another catch-up role. <br /> <br /> These two sides were achieved in my book on the wind. Before Hudson was the owner of a large farm, he now became the son of a hunting companion for the father of Robert Stack, who took the Hudson under his wing. In other words the James Dean is part of James Dean without the racism of the giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency used by Stack Hadley Oil. Hudson loves him, but she is fascinated by millions of Stack and when he gets a girl he has the means to really pursue the campaign. Stack is married. <br /> <br /> Last but not least in this mix we have Dorothy Malone, an immoral Stack sister who has a yen to rock, but Rock is not about to tangled with this wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone has spent more than 10 years in a whole series of colorless film heroines before landing in this gem. She was awarded the Best Supporting Actress for her role as actress Hadley Hadley and was well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you love the fifty artistic opulence of this wonderful movie you.
