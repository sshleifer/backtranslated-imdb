Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I own the original VHS, from this purchased from a rental shop. I've seen it countless times .. <br /> <br /> While it's a fun movie for kids, it's an adult movie. I once saw this movie whiile you .. not sober. I opened my eyes to things I had not noticed before. I have seen ethics very encouraging, publicly and to some extent .. I wish to remember all the things I have noticed in particular, but it has been a very long time since then. Rest assured, there are many things that were mentioned during the film. If you have the opportunity to see it ... not sure ... do it, you will not be disappointed. In fact, you will feel somewhat happy and warm. <br /> <br /> Unique and wonderful!
