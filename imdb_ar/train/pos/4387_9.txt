This is a powerful film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is straightforward. In fact, it is the standard story of a simple, respectable man whose honor contrasts with the more educated and richer men of that period. <br /> <br /> The poor versus the rich, the honest versus the cheaters, the classics but the good story without much glamor in the Hollywood stinking screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can smell people almost on the screen. :)
