I think the film tutorial. However, it failed to deal with the issue that aroused much controversy: pluralistic marriage. Also, the film fails to reveal what LDS has adopted. I missed a great opportunity to tell the world what they really believe. I have not been able to get a clear idea of ​​what LDS views relate to the main themes of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends who are good people. It was good to have a clearer picture of how to see their most controversial prophet's statements. The comments may be so controversial that they can not be dealt with in a film format, but it was nice to hear the full story of Joseph Smith's really interesting life. After all, it gives insight into American thought on religion in the 18th century. I hope they will make some documentaries about this wonderful subject, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. We may have a Mormon president someday. After all, Smith was nominated for the presidency.
