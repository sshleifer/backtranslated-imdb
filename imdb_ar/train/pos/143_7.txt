Riget II is a good supplement, but not as good as the first. This string does not appear to be as serious as the first string. There is more comedy in this good film, <br /> <br /> We went back to the Danish Rigshospitalet Hospital, the Danish National Hospital. Ms. Drouss is about to leave the hospital immediately after her work, but fate wants him otherwise. Soon the ghosts are chasing and Helmer is making everyone feel crazy and things get worse soon as black forces are unleashed in the kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story includes more comedy than before. After all, a lot of fun, but it makes you take the serial a little less serious. The story kept many elements from the last string and added some new elements. It's written well, but some new elements are just a bit silly, but they make it look like a comedy. A good story, but not as good, innovative and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are similar to some additions to ordinary actors. They are all very good. It is a strange story and preparation. Some parts are a total obsessed display and changing characters during the show so keep them serious and keep them real is not an easy task. However, these representatives deal with this situation as a whole. <br /> <br /> Many good qualities from the first series remain intact. Cinema is one of those qualities. The portable camera that made Trier's world famous and highlights reality. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow characters and Trier benefits from these capabilities. Well, the movement, the brilliant brilliance, the composition and the fine adjustment makes it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to see a better effect on this sequel in the first. Be prepared to see more. I did not think the green thing looked very good. He believed that he was not original and did not fit. Never less, the effects like ghosts really good. The non-digital effects look very good. The little brother looks very strange, but you accept him. In all parts I would say that the effects from OK to good. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. Moody and gentle. Some of the really touching. It fits really nice. As the first song there is little music in motion scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> Together, this makes a good complement. If you see Riget, you can see this without disappointment. Many have the same qualities as the first string. However, I recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These are a series you do not want to miss.
