This is the greatest film I saw in 2002, while I used to circulate films. It is rich and makes fine artwork from these short films. 11. From the technical information (the selected directors), I was afraid to have an anti-American basis, but ... it's a kind of personal honor (11 times). <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y Shaheen: he does not succeed in "swallowing his pride" and this is a good punishment ... It is indeed the weakest part of the film, but this testifies to a real freedom to express the entire piece. The strangest thing that comes from Mexican film is almost conceptual ... I'm still unsure of the meaning of A. Gonzalez Inarritu. The other nine people are idealistic (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or nearly perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either smile, cry or even leave me surprised. I still do not know whether the story of S. Imamura really linked to the September 11 disaster or not, but it is so beautiful that its final place "makes it".
