It's a very difficult film to watch, especially because it targets the deepest kernel of our lives. But in the end the film is very beautiful and very moving. I must say that anyone who finds this irony should have missed the letter of the entire movie message. For those who are already watching the film, they will see that the way in which the issues are handled is absolutely necessary, and the result will eventually be lifted. Certainly, it is very difficult to watch, a difficult and even brutal subject. However, they are closely related to society and everyone. It shows the climax of what the world cinema is doing right now (I will not only shorten the term on France) and everyone should try to see it. I would say that it is better to engage in a clear head without affecting conflicting views, and let the film work for you only.
