Seven young men go into the forest in search of a bear. Soon they are all chased and brutally killed by a Vietnam veteran. "Trumpa Invernale" is a very interesting Mexican ocher that reminds me of the many "The Zero Boys". There are some good death scenes, such as cutting the throat or the ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much emotion, so the Grand Geniol fans will be disappointed. However, if you are a fan of slow films, give this rare look of Mexican horror flicks Very vague (I've just seen "Alucarda" and "Do not panic"), so this must be another reason to see this interesting dissector. My ratings: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
