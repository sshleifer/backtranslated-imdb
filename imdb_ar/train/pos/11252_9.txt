This is my second time through a perfect spy. I saw him two or three years ago and I liked it. I still love it. It is natural to compare it to the other large Le Carre, named after the Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the play "Spies"; Perfect Spy gives us the other axis - what kind of spy person. There are a number of topics that these films share, along with other themes in this genre. <br /> <br /> Mystery - moral, sexual and personal - that creates a multidimensional space of truth versus false, from the inside versus the outside, love versus responsibility. In a way, these characters are happier when they are dealt with more harshly by people who love and respect them - "backstabbing" in various nuances. <br /> <br /> The subject of parents and father figures is also important. One of the most intriguing figures in A Perfect Spy is Rick, the main character of Magnus' perhaps the father of ersatz. Throughout the story they betray and betray. Every time they meet, Magnus asks, "The rogue who always manage to climb up a ladder when he is dropped, and who seems insensitive to what others think of him," do you like your old man? And never, "Do you love me?" You may say this somewhere else, but the perfect spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another topic is the subject of malignancy. The nature of work is the heart of others - their heart against their government, against their friends and colleagues, and their heart against their values ​​and beliefs. In each of the Le Carre movies I've seen, The Spy from the Cold, the glittering glass war, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People, and Perfect Spy, the role and transformation is the foundation of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is not a subject as much as a technical touch - in each of these films there is usually only one shot, or perhaps two shots that book the story. Violence, torture and cruelty are always under the surface. We do not see their results in the form of bloody currents or poor prison cells, but in the things that Le Carre figures cling to because they are absorbed unambiguously in the swamp. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the movies above, and you enjoy A Perfect Spy, you are in a great place. I would also recommend Sandbagger (Yorkshire TV), where the second and third seasons begin to reach this level of complexity. IPCRESS and Burial in Berlin are beautiful, although they are light. For the political plot, try a very British coup, House of Cards, and yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If the British are to put his hand in making the Three Kingdoms - there will be a film of intrigue and complexity.
