First things first, this film is very beautiful. The person who works on 3D CG movies as a lighter / author, blew the pictures away. Every second I was amazed at what was on the screen. As for the story, well, it's fine. You will not set the world on fire, but if you like your future tales in Blade Runner-esquire (and who does not?) You'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I must say that I felt that the vocal representation was pleasant and subtracting from the film as a whole. I saw it in English cinema, but I hope there is a French version floating somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
