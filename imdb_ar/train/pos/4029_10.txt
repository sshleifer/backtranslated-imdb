I have no words to describe the quality of this film. Only a genius like Amrita Prittam could write such a true picture of the days of partition. The film continued to haunt me for days. <br /> <br /> Ormila did her life in this film. She developed a life in the role of Puroo and Manjaj Vajpayee did not say his role in the role of Rashid. It is hard to imagine anyone other than the two leading role of Puroo and Rashid. Punjabi fashion looked very natural in Urmila and Manoj looked like a Punjabi Muslim Muslim. <br /> <br /> Sandhale Sinha Like Lajo and Suri, Ramshan also did a great job that Bryanushu Chatharji did a good job like Triluki. <br /> <br /> Some scenes you can not get out of. When you meet Puroo Lajjo for the first time, they bring tears to your eyes. Peak is just a killer. I was expecting a tragic end but fortunately, the finish was fantastic. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as the movie Bakeze, Mogul Al Azam, Panaras, and so on.
