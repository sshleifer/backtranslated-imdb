I saw this film at the premiere at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I watched the first video four years ago, and from that moment on, I was waiting to see the final result. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's a full-length 3-D movie with a contrasting black and white display. It is clearly inspired by some comic books, such as those of F. Miller. In this visual field, one step goes beyond the excellent "Sin City" adaptation of R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) no gray or any average color, but the cartoon style is never seen before in a realistic animated film. (The scanner can not wait dark) <br /> <br /> The intense use of Motion Capture provides a lot of life and credibility for characters and soon forget the technical aspect of focusing on more classic elements, such as direction or drawing. The trend remains solid and controlled despite the unlimited possibilities of the broker, and this is a really good surprise. <br /> <br /> The future story (Paris 2053) makes film a classic fantasy and continues to interest the viewer to the end. Despite the classic core plot (an achievement beyond the initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurrent themes (genetics, the absolute power of certain companies ...) give this film great attention. <br /> <br /> Although it is an animated film, it is clear that this film was not made for children. You will not find here any funny pet or any stupid moral family, just cold reality. It is much closer to a good film than Noir. <br /> <br /> I found that setting is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel the famous Paris, but turn into a wonderful touch of futuristic. <br /> <br /> However, I regret some mistakes. The montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two clich√© effects slow motion and some poor dialog boxes. Although the technique is excellent, it does show its limits in some romantic sequences (like "Final Fantasy"). These little things make them 7/10. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a successful technical challenge to watch if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (fortunately, they did not ask John Wu to do the job!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is a film with explosive images, a clever story and a wonderful artistic direction. Watch it if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse spelling mistakes.
