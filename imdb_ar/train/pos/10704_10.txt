Are you a giraffe? ... Ask John to Nadia, and she will certainly respond well, and respond to him: Yes. In this way never communicate between a man and woman do not know each other, at the same time, questions and doubts in the "girl's birthday." The film I heard so much, but I dare not see it ... until two hours of writing this. <br /> <br /> "Girl's Birthday" is a passionate movie that makes me count, at the same time, that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actress (besides she's pretty and smart) that I've ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely and ruthless man looking for an online wife. The woman he finds comes from Russia. They seem to be that sensitive, regular woman, and nothing more. One day, her birthday suddenly comes, his cousin and his friend. Man, begin to discover certain things. Since then, he will not be the only routine man who has always been. <br /> <br /> Many of us believe that this film is just an ordinary film with an exploiting plot. Many of us will think that excitement and excitement are certain and not new. But "Girl's Birthday" is just the opposite. This film is full of good surprises, good performance and fantasy plot that I have never seen before. This romantic film with a certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with lots of shows for films of this kind. "Birthday Girl" has some beauty and spaceiness in their sights, but at the same time, some influential nature, makes it deeper. <br /> <br /> "The girl's birthday" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end, it is quite satisfactory. I am not sorry to say that this is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... well, if any.
