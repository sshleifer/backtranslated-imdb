Samuel Fuller brings his usual and fashionable direction to this obscene story, and manages to create one of the undiscovered jewels in the cinema in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark plays a tough little thief (a role he plays in many movies), who takes the purse of a young lady (Jan Peters) on the subway in New York with a piece of microfilm that is most needed. This is 1953, so the microfilm is the property of the Commie spies who will not stop at anything to restore it. When the girl shows up in the Odemark water hut, sent by her abusive boyfriend to retrieve the film, Widmark feels a chance to shake her and her friends for the money. The plot flows, and people start to die, and fall in and your blood and Petters in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller deals with the story of love in a clumsy way, but more than a sense of indifference than writing or bad direction. It seems as if he has included a love story under duress, making it unbelievably deliberate, as love stories have often been and still are in Hollywood films. Peters offers great performance such as the strong New Yawk cookie, part of the Gangster Gang and the Girl Island in distress. When violence occurs against her, we really care about her well-being, and a model of the dissident Fuller style, before the style of his era that the happy ending is not necessarily an inevitable consequence. <br /> <br /> The ultimate success of Pickup on South Street depends on the world's weary Thelma Ritter, which plays Moe, a sophisticated lady who makes money in any way, whether she sells neckties or works as a police informant. Ritter gives her career; in a stunning monologue, she moves without addressing him directly on the whole sad track of her personal life, and the desperation she feels as she wakes up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship. It seems as if every character played by Ritter converges in a brief moment to give vent to all the feelings that have not given the opportunity to vent in those other films. The scene is the highlight of the Fuller film, highlighting the 50s cinema, period. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
