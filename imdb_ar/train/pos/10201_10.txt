It is a very good film, not only for the fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who love animated films / series of adventures and fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around an innocent girl about murder for something she did not do, but for the daughter of the governor of hell, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then seek revenge ... and the rest you see better than the movie. <br /> <br /> Much like the movie, characters like the original comedy, make up the mess. I never had the chance to read the first parts of the story in the storyboards, just the final parts, after the videos, so I can not tell you if the events are exactly like comedy, but ... one way or another is the story of the lady of death!
