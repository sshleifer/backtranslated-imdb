This wonderful movie plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film starts with a scene where Hank sings a song with a group of children called "When you hang your finger on the moon" it reminds me of the song "High Hopes", it's fun and inspiring. Great music all over my favorite song sung by King and Hank (Bing Crosby) and Mr. "Sagi" Sagamore. In general a wonderful family movie or even a wonderful movie history. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. The Princess played by Rhonda Fleming is wonderful. I like this film!! If you love Danny Kay in Court Jester, you will definitely love this movie.
