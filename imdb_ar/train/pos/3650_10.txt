Sometimes, the lucky lady smiles at me. I had originally manufactured - and copied - a VHS tape for this wonderful TV show. I felt sad when I realized what I did because I could not get a copy of it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I recently participated in a digital cable and while looking at the upcoming movies, there was a surprise broadcast of the film. However, this time, I copied a copy of it to a DVD, so there is no chance of repeating my mistake. <br /> <br /> Finally, I saw her again after eight years and was as exciting and tense as when I first saw her. There is little preface to this story in my first contact with "Pandora Clock" came a lively reading of the book on the public radio. I came across the radio station on my way home for lunch, and since the first batch, I was hooked. Every day, I waited anxiously to read the next chapter. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that the book would be broadcast on TV as a movie, I made sure to clear my schedule for the event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would say that the film was very true to the book, contrary to what another reviewer said. This, in and of itself, is a rare achievement for television films. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about this offer. I did not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could have been disrupted and burned without proper representation for this pivotal role. Anderson was never the best, and it's a shame that we have not seen more of him. In fact, all the team members did a great job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film - and the book - was to intercept the "terrorist plot" to arm a private jet. Air-to-air missiles have the pilot's leg and the downed plane. Basically, we're talking about less than 36 hours to manage and implement a plan like this, and people, that's not realistic at all given all the players involved. It was also not realistic how small the plane was affected by the first aircraft, and then the detonation of two of its engines. <br /> <br /> Next to this beef, I enjoyed the thrill of the building and found how to believe the reactions of foreign governments in the film, as well as our own images. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to watch this movie, do it by all means.
