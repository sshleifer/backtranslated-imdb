Fans of "Capital" rejoice! This first season of this series is now available from Network DVD and I recently got my copy! Although CAPITAL CITY's Capital Group offers us different moments during both its first and second seasons when each team member plays an important role in a central or peripheral plot line. The staff of Head Trader Wendy Foley (played by Joanna Phillips-Lynn) from the staff team is balanced with their own behaviors, interests and distinctive personalities that help make fairly unusual for most people the theme Sterile financial trading seems to enter reasonably through attractive offers to representatives. In fact, this young team, which seems to be very dynamic, contrasts with the old-fashioned top management of Sean Longman represented by Lee Woolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Dennis Hawthorne). I think that such an unconventional way of working as a Wendy team would not be true if the lonely young Peter Longman did not inherit his 30 percent stake in his company and allow for more modernity, the way modern business relaxes has become a reality. To a certain extent, Wendy (I am the leader of the belief), direct supervisor Leonard Ancien (John Bo), continues to establish the traditional way of managing the company, yet his fondness for Wendy is that he occupies the "middle ground" on most occasions. I think the main interest in this series stems from the attractive romantic attraction between Douglas Hodge and Dicklan and the brilliant blond-haired German trader Michelle Hauppmann (played by Trevain McDowell), who were constantly questioning whether the position between these two colleagues would develop beyond friendship / admiration Which is no doubt. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to browsing this title, we hope the second season of the 13 is not too far away!
