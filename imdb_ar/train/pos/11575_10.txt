Saying that, I mean this is not a good film but it is a very good version of the real event and the best filming yet. If you're a fan of World War II, that's right for you, because there are three out of four vandals who play roles in this film. It's a theater acting at best, but this is still as mentioned before a semi-documentary. <br /> <br /> Personally I was a fan of our heroes in World War II, and there should have been hundreds. Of these films, which show us what they did, will not be forgotten by future generations. Because children these days do not read books, but watch movies. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a great procedure, you have to rent a private Ryan, this is the truth about constant pain, obsessive stamina and the will to fight when everything seems lost.
