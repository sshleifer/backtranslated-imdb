Although I have watched this film for years, its effect has never left me. Stephen Ria depicts the deep and moving detective. His sadness for not being able to stop deaths is obvious. Everyone in the team is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts, for the troubled citizen x. Every day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think of this film and the tedious work of people trying to find killers.
