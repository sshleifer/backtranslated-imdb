This film was very decent. This movie is good for sitting, enjoying and entertaining. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will not win an Oscar or anything, and certainly not worth one, but I thought it was good. The width is similar to 24 but is set in movie format. If you love everyone, we have to stop the terrorist from killing the president's movie, you will enjoy this click. I personally think that the story of the story has been implemented a lot, but the guard adds a little distortion with the mole in the secret service. All in all, this movie will not leave your jaw on the ground or change your life, but who says that every movie has to be like this to be good?
