This story is in the world of the Prague Depression, the story of an ambitious writer in a shop in love with a mysterious woman who has exchanged romantic messages with him, only to discover that the mysterious woman is only a sales girl from his store, who seems to be constantly quarreling with his colleague. Add a small touch (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee - Stewart - has a relationship with the owner's wife), leaving Stewart for a short while, recognizing that the sales girl "impressed" Stewart all the time, happy ending is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although a very recent date (references to poverty and I have a wife and two children to think about), besides pointing out that many small things of pleasure, such as cigar music, are out of reach for ordinary people) , This film is more effective (and more credible) than re-making the 1990s "I got a mail." In the rewriting of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual sequence of events is so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly insulted. <br /> <br /> "Shop Around The Corner" Innocent roam the memory lane at a less complex and less romantic time and place known as the Utopia novelist. Romantic comedy lovers will enjoy this picture!
