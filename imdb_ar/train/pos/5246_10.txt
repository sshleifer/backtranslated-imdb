This film deserves 10 years to portray the wonderful world as it has been tried in the mind of a playboy. While I found the world morally repulsive, the film has done the best storytelling, and this brings us to an experience we never did. Tim Meadows convincingly depicts Leon Phelps, and the story has attracted me to the impulsive world of Lyon, so much so that I have forgotten for a moment that I was watching a parody of the Playboy world and felt I had to rebel against it. Here lies the retreat of the film because its great and daring achievement in storytelling comes at the expense of its success. Realizing that the vast majority of filmgoers will only respond to the story of this film on the surface, and reject that story, I hesitate to misunderstand them and admit that I loved them. I loved him not only because of his brilliant vision of the playboy's deceptive mind, not only for his armed portrayal of the foolishness of the human race, but also for his courage to explore what is without fear of the opposite sex. Besides, it's just funny.
