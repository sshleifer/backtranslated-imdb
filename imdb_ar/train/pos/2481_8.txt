I admit that I only saw about three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo, Juliet, Macbeth, and Hamlet) and one I admired, the other found him (Macbeth), and Hamlet I found a masterpiece. I am pleased to inform you that this amendment is very good like the dramatic and dramatic play. The representation is very strong (with a cast featuring Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal how can you lose?) And the change in time period (sounds like somewhere between 17 and 1800) plays beautifully as the characters move around and say their infamous lines directly from the same text Any Shakespeare fan will get chills. If you are in this popular drama, I strongly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 amendment by Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare fan.
