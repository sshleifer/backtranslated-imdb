This film is essentially a documentary film of a series of chronological events that took place from April 10, 2002 to April 14, 2002 at the Venezuelan Presidential Palace, Caracas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The film's tracks are real and one feels the pain, sadness and joy of people who lived during the failed coup of President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> One comes away from watching this film, which Hugo Chavez considers a truly wonderful historical figure. Hugo Chavez's personality alone brought Venezuelan people to the overthrow of the three-day military junta and the reconstitution of the Venezuelan democratic government. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the footage that George W. helped Bush and incited the Venezuelan coup. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media helped and incited George W. Bush. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing is that very few people have seen this movie and how few people are aware of the total corruption of the American media. <br /> <br /> It took only 20 years to eliminate Ronald Reagan from the 1986 equity doctrine of turning America into a blind state. <br /> <br /> Hugo Ch√°vez may open the eyes of patriotic Americans to truth and beauty. The true American vision.
