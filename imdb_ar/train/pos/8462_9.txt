I recently bought one set of this great series, and even after watching only three episodes, I'm still fascinated by the elegant design of animation and the slow and deliberate storytelling. I'm still impressed ... with some minor pain. <br /> <br /> Although this installment in the Gundam epic is very impressive and has nothing to do with the previous series - an elegant comic way to tell the mistakes of war and not to give up the need to control or control everything (looks familiar?), I have to say that this one gets a bit maddeningly dramatic to continue to explain the life of the main characters and their constant need to express all that is happening and what they have to do to prevent the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially the character named Wufei ... I mean it grumbles more than personality Sam in the soap opera. Get a counselor, right?) <br /> <br /> Besides the exaggerated drama (I think most of them come from dubbing voice actors in English), this series is still very exciting and will always attract me again. I mean it can always be worse. It may be like the last batch, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic .... I'll talk about it later.
