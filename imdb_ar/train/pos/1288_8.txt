Preston Waters in a bad summer. Besides his next birthday, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First he has to share his own room with his brothers who will run a company. They can not do it in their rooms because they do not have enough space. When you arrive at a birthday party, you get only 6 symbols while others get $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50. When one of his birthday cards comes early, he only gets a check for $ 11. <br /> <br /> He goes to a bank who knows he needs at least $ 200 to start an account. Leave the bank, steal the bully check. The kid chasing after almost running him (definitely ruined his bicycle) by a criminal named Kegley (played by Miguel Ferrer) Quigley's just came from the bank also gave the owner $ 1,000,000 to give this guy tomorrow. Quigley begins writing a check for damage, but only succeeds in writing his name before the police car goes around. Fearing, he gives Preston the check and tells him to give him to his father to finish. <br /> <br /> That evening, Preston told his father that he did not want a new bike, he wanted his country. The room is back and better than his home. His father restrains him to his room for the rest of the evening. Sticking to his room Preston sees that things can not get worse, he realizes he forgot the check because he is still in his shirt pocket. It's empty. <br /> <br /> Using the computer and after careful consideration, he tests it for $ 1 million. The next day, while trying to pay money in the bank, he was taken to the owner who is believed to be the one who is supposed to make $ 1,000,000 and do it. It is not as if the real person named Juice comes later. <br /> <br /> Now the three have to track Preston down. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston enjoys the pleasure of buying all sorts of things including his own home and even going on dates with a convincing bank lady who is an FBI agent (who tries to track down the three bad guys). He makes this person named Mr. Macintosh who works for him and even plans a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But in the end things go (money runs out and the bad guys get it). <br /> <br /> Overall, the flick is very funny. Miguel Ferrer plays a very good role. If you enjoyed it in another Stakeout app, you'll like it here. He does all the crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Dokomon (Ghost Team in the Machine) plays a great friendly driver in this film.
