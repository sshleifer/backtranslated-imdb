I loved it, as I was a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the background story would be - did not fail in my joy. I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz, I did not know one person - this is refreshing, just like BSG. I've given me a whole lot of new talent - I can not wait until the serial starts to broadcast. Ronald Moore and his team did well - excellent work. Special influences, dialogue and acting were all of interest, and I felt emotional tension in the story. I know there are militants who may not agree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was much higher than most Sci-Fi products produced in the past decade.
