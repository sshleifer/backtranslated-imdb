I must be just 11 years old when Mr. Peepers started. It was inevitable for all the family, I think in one. Nights. Rob repeated the gags when Rob opened his wardrobe (he had to use a barometer or an indicator to set the correct place on another cupboard and do some other things, finally the place where he opened his door), and taking pins from a new shirt (at the beginning of any episode, A new shirt for the rest of the show, where the rest of the show is stuck one by one, missing when the shirt was unpacked, timing was everything, and the pins were laughing a lot.) I remember a aunt pushing Rio like Jack Benny and I always wanted to say "Sony" to something scientific. He was thinking and coming up with a "half-permeable membrane" or an osmosis causing her to say how wonderful it was. (You had to be there). Marion Lorne was robbed of the show every time she was on the screen. Why did not they continue with "Bove" when Wali resigned (he was afraid of being wrong but by then it was too late) I would never know. I saw somewhere that the first TV wedding (a big party anyway) was Tiny Tim in the Carson program. Horsecocky. I've had Rob and Nancy (I've already got the temperatures for her) and I remember she made the TV guide cover and got the press in all major newspapers and magazines. A trip to the New York City Radio Museum years ago was disappointing because they had very few episodes at the time and may now disappear. I still remember it was wonderful and I wish I were older.
