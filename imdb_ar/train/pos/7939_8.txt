It's good to have a movie that the whole family can see together. Jesse Bisette and Rob Estes (married in real life) play the role of a couple who get married in Las Vegas for a whim and then not only have to publish the news to their children, but they must try to mix their families (two children, two boys and two girls) into a cohesive family unit. What is clear when the group of four teenagers, two of her children and two younger children makes one wonder at first whether there is real happiness for Carrie and Jim. The battles between children (and a small love affair between two of them) make one wonder if everyone will be able to continue. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, what a totally enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a film feel good for all ages.
