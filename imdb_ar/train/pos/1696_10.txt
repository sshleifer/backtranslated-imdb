These are the things of worship. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this film. Its very funny and very dry. I have seen this step dozens of times and have not enjoyed it yet. The actors are funny and getting better with each watch! If you enjoy a "fool out of space", you'll love it. A wonderful play on the war of the worlds. I love Red-Neck Rampage for Aliens, defect on the cover, mod, hot-trapped pesticide, mine field, red camon, breaking speed limit 1800Mph! "I'll get a bucket!" so funny. I would love to come out on this DVD! Forget negative reviews see it yourself!
