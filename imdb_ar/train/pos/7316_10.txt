This movie is one of the best films ever, and certainly in this kind of horror. Terrible atmosphere is awesome, music is as good as the film and killer creepy as possible! The actors are wonderful, RIP Donald Pleasance You're great like Dr Loomis, I made the film better. Without it the film would be missing a vital element. Jamie Lee Curtis is also wonderful as Queen of Our Favorite Scream! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that he pursues until she finds her friends being brutally murdered in the house, which of course is one of the best scenes in the cinema. It gives tremendous performance. I loved this movie because it scared me like hell when I saw it in the early eighties and I still watch it to this day because it's a great movie that brings you into this world if you could chew it like a fish at every turn! The fact that he is just a crazy man in a mask has escaped from a mental refuge and is ready to kill anyone on the horizon without having any idea that he is there, it is terrifying and sexy to indulge more in the film as events though fantasy can be easily achieved. We all know that, unfortunately, there is evil in this world, and certainly the crazy man who carries a knife is not a common thing, he is very concerned about all this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most horrifying way. Horror must be reasonable, and that makes the movie fun. It's just a simple story turned into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. In addition to the wonderful story of Siku, which I adore, I think the formats are the best that horror offers. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have ever seen and I will see them all my life and I will never tire of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
