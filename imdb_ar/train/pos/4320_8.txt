This very underestimated film is (for me) what everything should be in good writing in the film. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and sets it up for everyone to see and wonder about. The film revolves around divisions created by people to isolate themselves from violence, hatred and intolerance in everyday life. <br /> <br /> Along the way a question is asked after a question about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself "did he produce a violent film (and thus we enjoyed it) causing violence in society?" "What kind of world is casting something precious like human life?" Asks Claire. Mac is not immune to the question: "Is it possible to transcend the boundaries of race and finance (a tougher step)?" This is not, of course, quoted from the film, but in general: others ask their questions as well, and be honest they raise more than they answer. But in life we ​​strive to find answers to questions that we will never answer. In some cases, we must make answers commensurate with our needs and desires. Humans, we thrive on questions, we can not answer them. Some answers are real, Claire and Mac realize that although they can walk the easy way and allow the state to come He finds the light and decides not to produce violent films, but the next day turns around and rejects the Epiphany as a follower of his art. <br /> <br /> We are all Looking for answers, this film does not answer them, but reminds you to keep looking for answers. <br /> <br />
