The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil, Sadashiv Amrapurkar and chemistry are all superbly performed, along with the simple approach of story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani. Vijay Tendulkar's dialogues are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another film like this. It's a complete one, each piece fits so well into the plot. You can not be affected by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes as a climber and "baap" to Puri's mother. Um Puri is the young man who was caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the regime. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty only gives a suitable touch to the film with its soft, soft smile. The first meeting of Anand Villanakar with Rama Shetty at Sadhashiv place is very spectacular. Smita Patil does not play a major role, but her role does not distract attention from the main plot. <br /> <br /> To add to all this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who deals with the system and its actions. Say the right things in the right places and learn how to stay away from problems. He is also the "teacher" of Um Puri and helps him whenever he has a problem. <br /> <br /> The film focuses not only on the focus of the difficulties faced by a police officer who is trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutality in police custody. Um Puri embodies the despair and desire to emerge in this extraordinary performance in the land of Satya. <br /> <br /> Fun for all Indian movie lovers.
