*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father had recorded this film for me when I was 3. At age 5, I saw it more than 400 times. I saw it and saw it. I still do today! Her dark story, the mother of the lamb killed by the wolf - very emotional scene - want to become a wolf, like him. After years of training, Lamb is made into something really really evil looking. He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, no matter how much he wants it. He ended up killing the wolf, but was no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends, and could not return to his previous way of life. Well, well, the voice representation is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> All in all, just * see this movie, it's a wonderful masterpiece. Although it is very hard to find it today. <br /> <br />
