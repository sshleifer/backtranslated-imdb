I personally despise The Jerry Springer Show, however, I have found that "Ringmaster" is the most extreme film I have seen this year. The spelling of Jerry Springer's "The Endless" guests, which begins in the opening scene, makes you laugh throughout the film. Despite the short scene in which Jerry Springer makes a weak attempt to justify his existence, I certainly recommend this film for pure entertainment value.
