I do not see how you can say that Freddy's nightmares are cheese and rip. You obviously do not know good TV when you see it. The episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddie is creative in killing people. I love Freddy's nightmares and I hope I get 44 episodes on DVD. Best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze, and Love Stinks. If you think this series sucks, then you deserve your opinion but remember that you only think that does not mean anything. Freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best serials ever and will accept this fact soon. If you do not like it, do not see it, but do not deny that it sparkles.
