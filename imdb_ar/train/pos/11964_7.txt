I went to the cinema theater this afternoon and I expect to be frustrated by Scoop. Fortunately, the movie exceeded expectations, at least a little. Nothing heavy, nothing deep - not anywhere as good as any number of real Allen masterpieces - but it's also quite fun as a light comedy and joking. There is something simple and simple. The word "nice" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they left after the show. Allen does not seem to be starting a masterpiece here, he seems to want to make a small comedy and enjoy doing it. Compared to almost everything that Hollywood produces, Allen tends to charm. So thin stuff. These days, it is refreshing to move to a film produced by a real person.
