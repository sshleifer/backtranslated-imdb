Well, like many other movies, I came out of the SNL play. But Tim Meadows does a pretty good job of making a one-dimensional character for 3 minutes in a moderately viable comedy character. It is one danger that is in constant danger, and Billy De Williams is there even though Landau's days are long gone, and the whole thing is being well shot. True, it's not a great art, but if you go to Wayne's world looking for The Gone With The Wind, you've made a mistake. Enjoyable on what is .......
