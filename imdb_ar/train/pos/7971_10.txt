It's a great movie for all ages. In a story about three animals how they should find their way home. There is little distortion at the end and mainly throughout the entire film. You never know what will happen next. This movie makes you cry and make you laugh. You just do not know what will happen next. The home trip is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife sights. The producers also spent a lot of money on this film and it also shows up. The animals were well trained in this film and are a great actress / actress. All about this wonderful movie! 10 of 10 on the whole road! I rent it or buy it today and I can guarantee that you will love it all the family
