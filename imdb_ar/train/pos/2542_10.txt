With a special telescope, Dr. Janus Rukh (Boris Karlov) successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but very powerful element. Dr. Bela Lugosi is an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", which is stronger than radium and is very radioactive. Karlov becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by touching him. The sparks begin between Lugosi and Karlov in the classic science fiction film of the post-World War II period. Helyyer used some standings from the "FLASH GORDON" series that were filmed at the same time and included some electric machine clips from Frankenstein. Universal kept the audience unaware of the special effects used in this wonderful classic film. Karlov and Iosuke were at their best and enjoyed working together and would be enjoyed by future generations.
