I finally got a DVD set to rent DVDs so I can find movies that are not available to me in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Melloni, and I also love small films that are often overlooked. <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome! Meloni has such a charm in this part. It's easy to hole it, you only see his replacement ego Elliot Stapler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an older, separated from the service who collides with sliding in several ways, only to find a way to happiness for an unexpected person. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Meloni and Tim Bosfield is real and not finished. I have not seen Busfield since 30 days and it was fun to watch. But every movie was Chris. Become a fan girl again. <br /> <br /> It's a bit slow at first, and I'll admit it. I thought that some "memories of the past" could have been edited. But in general, this movie - whether male or female - will delight you as it has a fresh and refreshing vision of relationships today.
