Audiard presented here an interesting film. She begins by describing a young, semi-deaf woman in her working world as a secretary who has been ignored, frustrated and rejected ... The appointment of a trainee as an assistant seems to be a way to find her in her life: but the man is out of prison. Both were rejected by the community gradually reunited. The characters describe deeply, and enter into the details ... Both begin to help each other; they can read on the lips, which reveal that they are very useful to him ... will gradually evolve, far from what they were at first. <br /> <br /> It was beautifully filmed; everything is very convincing, even if it turns into a Noir film in the end. Particularly noted for the beautiful gesture in Audiard's photography. Emmanuel Devos should be nominated for Best Actress Cesar for her theater. Working at the end of the film prevents him from being just a "weird game". It's actually amazingly amusing: 8/10.
