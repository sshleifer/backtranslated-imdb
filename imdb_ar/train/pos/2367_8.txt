I could not keep my eyes away from this film when it appeared on the cable. Dialogue and fashion are high quality and are easily connected with the porn core. In this case, the appropriate plot is a way to have sex but for serial piracy with nunchuks. (Maybe for sex too, but not on Indian TV, anyway.) <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of the kind I could not put Jeff Wincott in, and I had no strings to look for. Only once Brigitte Nielsen trades in her future nurse friend (very mayor!) For the great vanishing we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II, you've made a positive identity on them. <br /> <br /> This movie will no doubt show you enjoy any fans of the early 1990s or schlock-nink-schlock Ã  la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a label for "so-bad-it-good"?
