I remember seeing this years ago when I first came out and was impressed by Barker's performance. The film was also good. For anyone who has spent a long time in a nightclub scene / hours later, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not very serious, often funny, Parker Posey undoubtedly makes its way through these talented independent gems. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed with Diaz's character (he reminded me of every DJ struggling at all). Many other films can take some references from this film about how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being dull and nice around it. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
