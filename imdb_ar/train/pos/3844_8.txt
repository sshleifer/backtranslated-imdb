When you read the summary of this film, you may think that this film is a little strange, in some respects, because the character of Gerard Reeve (Geron Crabby) is haunted by visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) hidden hints of what will happen to him as the story continues and it is very interesting that the viewer tries to discover the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of the symbolism and two hints to the end of the film, the film retains a very high level of excitement all the time and does not get bored for one minute. This is mostly due to the great performances of Gerwin Krabi, Rene Sutendijk (Christine) and Paul Verhoeven's great direction. His style of output is clearly visible and one can say, when viewed from different angles, that "De Vierde Man" is a typical Verhoeven film. It will not seem normal to people familiar with his American films due to nudity and violent scenes of painting, but will also look typical for people familiar with his Dutch films, because of the same things and talent in telling a wonderful story. When people watch Verhoeven films, they may say short-sighted people, who have no talent in telling a good story and focus only on blood and sex. That's what some people think, while I think it's a very talented director trying to convey a deeper message in every film. Although not a good film, Hollow Man is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction films, and companies may have to trust him more and give him more diverse films. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch movies. They not only show that he needs a certain amount of freedom, but they also show that he has a wonderful talent. De Vierde Man has made it one step from Hollywood and is definitely one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
