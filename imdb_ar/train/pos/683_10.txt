I love ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps at night, sounds that can not be explained. Now I see a lot of them. Since the special efx has more and more grip on today's movies, and sometimes to find a real jewel, you must turn the clock back when the authors and directors really have to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now, this very rare experimental episode of the Ghost Story television series "The New House" was one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen. That was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, but nothing since then even compared to it. With each remake being in Hollywood, one should do this one "as is" with any efx more special than the original. This vicious circle was creepy right as hell. I'm lucky to finally find it on a DVD today and it's very rare and hard to find. The only other ghost stories that came close to the film were "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in The Changling. I wish someone would do more ghost stories like this.
