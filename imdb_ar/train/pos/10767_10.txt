Of course I had to give this film 10 out of 10 because my uncle was the main screenwriter once for a crime. Rudolfo Sungo wrote scenarios for more than 50 years living in Italy. The narrator was a great story and someone suggested putting his stories in writing. So did Rodolfo Soneo. If you review his autobiography, you can see how many movies have been produced in Italy. Alberto Sordi was the main actor who starred in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city, in 1968 to check the locations of "Girl in Australia" and made a wonderful film about a proxy bride after World War II. You can see his humor in all his films. I found a copy of this movie on a DVD recently. Great
