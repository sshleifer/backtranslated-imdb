I like this film! 10 out of 10 hands down! This is damn good! I'm not a movie fan but I'm telling you that this person has opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast power. I was lucky to catch this while watching Zoinks movie! The Boston Film Festival, and the story wraps me from the start. He had a lot of subjects and adult characters and when I finished I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. that would be fun. My only problem is Melissa Connor's performance as Ania. Ugh! She suck! I've seen a block of wood pulling the best performance. I do not think about what the director was thinking. But if you ignore it you can only give this movie ten movies !!!
