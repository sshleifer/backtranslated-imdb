It is shameful to see this film in the United States. I found it through a rare video dealer and it was definitely worth it. This is undoubtedly the best film ever produced during pre-code and the best film of the 1930s. The creative director Frank Borsage filmed great films about the Depression, and with Castle Man, he created a fictional story amid the difficulties of the times. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them, helping to make this movie a wonderful love story. Youngs Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Tracy Bell is tight and closed. Dynamic interpersonalism creates one of the most difficult ones, but in the end, relationships are rewarded for the film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the most prominent movie of the pre-focus I've seen. Borsage uses the foggy and dreamy style to transform the random village where Bill and Terrina live in a palace. Depression difficulties are not ignored, they are in fact an integral part of the film. But with Borszag portraying the film as a soft-focused fantasy, love between characters makes the situation seem less harsh. It makes the film warm and hospitable. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is a great achievement in the pre-code era. If only more people can see it.
