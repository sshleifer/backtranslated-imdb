The Best of Times is one of the best sleepers of all time. Setup does not force your patience, constant development, and many interlinked relationships are affectionate, and the kams and bits are all working and all funny. There are a lot of emotions. Kurt Russell plays Renault's Hector in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams who plays with Jack Dundee is certainly ever introduced. The cast also includes a large number of supporters. Jack's wife was played by the daughter of Jack Palance, a beautiful, as well as Reno's wife, a wonderful comedian. I can not tell you how many times I saw this movie, how many times I enjoyed it and how many times I wish more people would see it.
