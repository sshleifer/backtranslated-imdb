Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's just as predictable as The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, and so on. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is very enjoyable. They often take each other in a loop, which adds a lot of humor to the show. Contains many car chases in almost every episode, but, who does not enjoy chasing a good car? Especially with a wolf! <br /> <br /> I just wish they had made a clean TV like this one and I highly recommend this!
