I was 13 years old when this film appeared on television. It's superior in action to much of most movies ever since. Martin Chen is excellent, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also offers excellent support. Vic Moro as a wonderful villain. <br /> <br /> When Sean tests "water" in his '34 COOL car along the mountain highway, it will be great! <br /> <br /> The Great End. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed by the low vote he received. I think younger generations have a greater interest in a lot of junk that will come out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste strikes the masses!
