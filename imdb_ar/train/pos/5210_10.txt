It's a shame that she did not get a screen credit, she has done the best job in the film where the girl was on the cross, and the best part of the film. She had a much more influence than Avril, or anyone else in the film. It's almost made S / M look like fun! She really believed the S / M model that he was afraid of putting. Although they seem to have really spoiled this kind of dreamy feeling by looking for the bad guy, these groups were well built but they were rummaging on the surface of what was filmed. This is one film that both cuts should be made available. They seem to have ruled out much of what was filmed, and almost all the dark things that would have made the film more gloomy. This kind of like they stopped the tag they were going to during filming. What was filmed would not have been rated R perhaps NC-17 or X, but that was what he would need to make the film the way it should have been.
