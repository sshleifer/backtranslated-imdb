The sudden effect is a two-fold story. Harry is targeted by mobs who wish to kill him and Harry is very happy to re-benefit and show how it is done. This little war puts Harry in suspension and he does not care about him but he goes on a small holiday. Now the second part of the story. Someone kills some bad guys and Harry steals to this position where he meets Jennifer Spencer a woman with the secret that the small tourist town wants to keep quiet. The police chief is not a hidden man and warns Harry not to get involved or cause any trouble. This is Harry Callahan. The mob follows him to this town and opens hell while Harry goes to war. Meanwhile, the keeper hits again and the gang he counts is ready. Jennifer Spencer was captured and Harry comes to rescue her during the climax of the film. The sudden effect is not the greatest Harry is dirty but at the time Harry gives us who is a very hostile hero ready to go to war just to seek justice. Again, not the best is not the worst but the most memorable line. Go ahead and make your day.
