This is a very rare film and probably the least famous of Shirley Temple because it is not present in any of its collections. The reason for this is probably because he has no happy ending, unlike all her other films. He is also not a musician, although she sings one song entitled "The world owes me life." The film was produced in 1934 and originally in black and white, my version is in color and on VHS, I would say that they did a good job because the color seems realistic, unlike I say the color films are horrifying Laurel and Hardy. The film is good for his age and the story has never been dated, and I am surprised that no one has tried to make a remake. Sometimes the film is a bit talkative, as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem to have come out, in some scenes, it seems like it took 15 minutes to explain what you could say five times. Do not be late because this movie has really good moments, especially when {Jerry} Ga ry Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's teddy doll. The tension and slowness that reaches his actions, [while at the same time singing his daughter to an audience in another room} is directed very well. Facial expressions when placed under scrutiny are also very good. In all this good film from the early thirties, accept him for his age.
