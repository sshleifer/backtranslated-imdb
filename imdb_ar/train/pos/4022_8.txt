Another detailed work on this subject by Dr Dwivedi brings us back in time to Punjab before dividing it. Dr. Duweidi chose a difficult subject for the first time in his film. He worked on all the finer details of the story. Subject handling is very sensitive. <br /> <br /> Although we did not go to the area during that period, the collections and costumes look real. Unlike most of the films that were produced on the division, this film does not focus on the strange details of the violence to attract the audience, but its subsequent effects. The characters come to life. Briancho Chatterjee gave a great performance. Manoj Bajpayee acted in his heart and showed the plight of a man suffering from sin. The rest of the staff did a very good job.
