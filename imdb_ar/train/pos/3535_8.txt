** Warning - contains vandals! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this game. I got it for Christmas two months after dropping hints to my dad. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> First, I would say that the only player was very good. The first level may be one of the best games in the game, when you're in a party in London, and some bad guys destroy it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. Of course you have to save it, which is a very large level, but it is likely to take you at least five minutes. The best part, I think is also the most entertaining part, is when you are in the jet pack, people are wandering around the Big Ben clock. Just equip the most reliable rocket launcher from the Jet-pack and burst clock and enemies. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but they are too short. There are four mini levels you can open, which is one of disappointment, because the first two and only two are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just the targets of "kill 25 enemies", I mean, two c! We've got lots of points to unlock these tasks, and the last two bonus tasks are really bad! <br /> <br /> The multiplayer player, me and some of my friends, agrees that it is very good and presents a great challenge, even if there is no walk. Halo did not have any robot programs but this is still some great multi-player games! You can be a burden of bad guys, face each other, you can also set traps, the best way to kill people without looking at their characters. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be very repetitive and bonus tasks can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is a strange sketch but this is not often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no comment needed, it's great, you can drive in jet packs and vehicles). Audio - 8/10 reboot value - 7/10 (the only levels I return to are Loondon and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> There may be some improvement, but it is still good.
