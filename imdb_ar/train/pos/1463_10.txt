Mardi Gras: Made in China offers a fascinating and complex link between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the manufacture of beads. I saw this film at the Boston International Film Festival, and I was expecting a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was a visually overloaded show of shocking images from both China and the United States. Open-eye film is a sense of humor, in-depth, serious, non-sponsor, and leaves you want more as a credits. It's worth comparing with Murderball - it's simply good. Young women working in China have different views, and the owner is surprisingly open to discipline. The most prominent Carnival revelers, but only because this excellent film provides an in-depth context within the factory in China without a narrative. Bravo for the director to get inside and finish the film! I have never thought about the relationship between beads, China, and New Orleans; now I think of the human relationship between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make these links without guilt after watching this film, unlike other films I've seen about globalization.
