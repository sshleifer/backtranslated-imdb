At the beginning of this film, one commentator said he was told he had two blows against him: he was black and male. But in addition, he has a third strike: he is an anomaly. "You must be stronger than you imagine," he was told. "Paris Burns" is a documentary about gay men of Hispanic origin who are transgender or transgender. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris Burns" is that director Jenny Livingstone takes a subject that can easily become a strange show and allow people to humanize it. We learn their views about homosexuality, men and women, their hopes, their disappointments, and their dreams. Some of these dreams are unattainable, they are tragic. Many people are in serious denial; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are footage in this film of transgender nudes. If you have a problem with homosexuality, this movie is not for you. But if you see this film, you will realize that Paris is burning is not really about men in women's clothing. It's about a group of people who are routinely marginalized and ignored by society as a whole and what they do to get a sense of society in their lives. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says a lot of things: it's a commentary about materialism in our culture, the gender roles of the rich and the poor, the media, what's celebrated, celebrity, and flattery. "Paris Burns" is one of the most humane films, the most sad, I have ever seen.
