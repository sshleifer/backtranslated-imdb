Ed Harris's work in this film is back to its usual level of superiority, that is, it steals the screen away from anyone involved in it, including the phenomenal Shaun Connery. The film, which is more than a little sacred, does not come alive except in the scenes when Harris is questioned by a lawyer for his conviction. It is breathtaking, a key category in technical control. <br /> <br /> All other members of the cast are all adept and Connery is reliable, as in Fishburne, but the story itself does not contain a large group. The conspiracy is largely based on the assumption that the black prisoner is always subjected to ill-treatment and coercion by white law enforcement officers. This is the engine that moves the story, right or wrong, and makes you feel cheated in the end. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth watching to watch Harris at work.
