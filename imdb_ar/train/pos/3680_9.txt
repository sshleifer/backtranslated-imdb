Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a 18-section film. You can do math - 18 part in 120 minutes means every director has seven minutes to tell his story. The movie relies on the premise that you can already narrate a story in this short time. The hypothesis works. Almost all sectors are strong, complete and satisfactory. Each side offers a different aspect of Parisian experience, and almost every director directs great performances from a group of great and semi-great actors. <br /> <br /> There were lots of powerful photos in this movie so it's hard to choose one or two of my favorites. Perhaps the most memorable thing for me is Juliette Pinochet as a sad mother in the category "Place des Victoires" and "Gina Rolandz" as the old knight in "Quartier Latin" and "Catalina Sandino Moreno" as a servant in the section "Loin du 16ème" and Margo Martindale as carrier Colorado Mail I learned to speak French so you can visit Paris ("14ème Arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> Special mention should be made of Gulliver Hecq, perhaps the smallest boy to harass any American tourist in a Paris metro station (the "Tuileries" section). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. My wife and I decided to rent them in a few months so we could pick up some of the finer points we definitely missed. However, Paris was so beautifully portrayed that I would suggest you try to see it on a big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
