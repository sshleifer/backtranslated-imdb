Higher education is a slap in the face of those of us who were in a very long wardrobe regardless of ethnic background. It is a subject most of us wish to ignore, but we can not afford it if there is a real gradual change in how we can absorb and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as hateful or stupid, but the fact is that ignorance prevails in the world and many continue to help it control our society. Everyone involved in this film has done a good job of showing the steps that must be taken so that they do not have to produce movies like learning. Make sure it sounds like a distant dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps.
