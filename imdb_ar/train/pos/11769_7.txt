I bought this movie a few days ago and I thought it would be a very nice movie. But when I popped into the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But Timothy Dalton plays a good role in the role of Sharif. The "finish" scene, in Bill's house, is extremely excellent, good work for the camera, nice dialogues and good representation. Bill "Mouth" Manuccie stole $ 12 million from the Mafia. He lives with his wife in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the mafia is chasing him and wants to get $ 12 million. Bill can trust only the one person he knows from the inside out.
