Reading the various foreign reviews of Roger Ebert and other famous film critics makes me reluctant to admit how much I love this film, even though I only have a dubbed video version of it. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics consider it incomplete the story hypothesis has been used before, and most famous in the great film "It is a wonderful life." For me, the great premise is the great premise no matter how many times it is used, and I would be happy to see more movies using this particular premise - the disgruntled man who gets the chance to gain a new perspective in his own life through a little "divine magic". <br /> <br /> I assume that people and critics of more intellectual weight are not taken to the story, but I do not go to movies to criticize them with a notebook in hand - I go to movies to throw myself in and let them take me where they want. <br /> <br /> If you are as emotional as you are, you will be rewarded with watching this picture. The performances were excellent all the time and the film was very good. Great selection of music, too. Michael Keane is awesome as a sympathetic waiter. Jim Belloshi is doing a great job as a "normal guy" who wonders if his life has not gone well. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, again right here as a loving wife. John Lovitz enjoys himself as usual, and even has some surprising moments in Mr. Kadir. <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Al-Qadr" is not "It's a wonderful life", but who says it is? "Mr. Destiny" was filmed on his own terms, a fun, funny, animated film. I've watched my video, which has been named in Japanese several times, and I'm sure I'll see it multiple times. If that somehow makes me "lowbrow", so be it! I'm glad I did not read any reviews for "Mr. Destiny" before seeing it. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should have the courage of my convictions and give the film nine or ten stars, but I could not help but doubt myself after reading all the reviews!
