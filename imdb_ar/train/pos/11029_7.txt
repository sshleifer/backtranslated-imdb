I'm far from the Sylvester Stallone fan and I think the only time I appreciate his appearance was in the French film Taxi 3, a small role that is almost nonexistent. However, I must admit that this film was not actually bad, although I was afraid the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gaby (Stallone) fails to rescue a friend's friend and drowns in her death from a mountain peak of 4,000 feet, he can not force himself to continue working as a mountaineer. For almost a year, he was no longer food in the reserve, but he returned. Shortly after his return, they received an emergency call from a group of hikers caught in a blizzard. At least, that's what guards think. In fact a group of thieves who crashed with their plane into the mountains after the failure of their bold plan to steal cases of money from a failed government plane. The situations spread throughout the reserve and need help from professional climbers to retrieve them ... <br /> <br /> This of course is not one of the most intelligent movies at all, but in this kind of fun one. I particularly enjoyed John Lithgow as a wicked mind master and leader of bandits. I know him better than the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also enjoyed his performance in this film. In general the representation is fine, he has had a lot of procedures to offer and of course also some fonts, but also made a very beautiful decor. This film was filmed in a wonderful natural environment. I loved the mountains, the snowy valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests ... and that's probably why I give this film a higher degree than I usually give to an action / adventure film of this kind. Give it 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect much, this is a fun movie.
