I am a college student studying levels, and I need help and comments from anyone who has absolutely no views on the subject of mothers in the film, in the mother. Whether you've passed something similar or you just want to comment and help me find more about this movie, any comment would be greatly appreciated. Comments will only be used for testing purposes and will be included in my written exam. So, if you have any opinions at all, I'm sure I can use them, and you can help me get A! I'm also studying "About a Boy" and "Tadpole" so if you've seen these movies too, I'd be grateful if you could leave a comment here on that page. thank you.
