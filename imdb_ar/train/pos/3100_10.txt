By the end of the first hour, my jaw was resting comfortably between my feet. The film never, and I never mean, will leave work. It may be a light procedure but a procedure. Again, each member of the team fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were possible, and the fighting was incredible. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> All I really say is that every Bourne movie gets better and that's no exception. Action, bets, plot. How they do that I will never know. I salute the man who wrote the screen playing on each of these films. Because if he did not do such a great job with the first film, we would not have the film to talk about. <br /> <br /> So do not go to see it in the theaters, go to the theater experience if it's still outside where you live, but if not December 11, Bourne returns home!
