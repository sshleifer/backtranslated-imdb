X tells the real life drama about the search for a serial killer called "The Rostov Ripper". This wonderful film illustrates the long journey it took to try to capture the killer. The film shows how deadly politics has helped to ferment for more than 12 years. (Probably more than 50 victims, mostly women and children), Stephen Rhea was the lead detective and Donald Sutherland, since the overall investigation was impressive. Jeffrey Damon as Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the kind of movie that will astonish you and immediately urges you to look for the real situation. This film should not be missed. For the first time I think of HBO and I never got a theatrical show, as I understand. Great movie
