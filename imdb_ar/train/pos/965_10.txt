Yokai: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) A film about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" of folklore. Also known as Big Monster War or Ghosts on Parade. <br /> <br /> The yokai from the first batch includes clown teapot, kappa water and live brella, a woman who can grow her giant sheep, a woman with a second face on her head, a dwarf priest with a giant wrist resembling pumpkins, etc. . <br /> <br /> These exotic monsters are not only derived from fantasy science, but also from the kind of summer entertainment of the Tokugawa era, which is similar to those inhabited by Halloween today, or "exotic performances" of yesterday, but with phantom freaks Exclusive. Monsters and Monarchs Monarchs were created to create "chills" during the hot summer. This woman was rebuilt by tricks or fantasies, based on the monsters depicted in the medieval scrolls; if their design of the film is simple and enjoyable, this makes them more representative of what was historically created for summer chills. <br /> <br /> These beloved monsters must face the ancient destruction of a Babylonian vampire demon who came to Japan and was disguised as the samurai master. Although some Japanese apparitions are a bit clumsy, and a lot of costumes are more than just masks without moving the lips until you speak, all that poker plays is very facelift and very charming. It has some beautiful cinematic, as far as it will be provided in the CGI film of the same decade. Due to the right mood or with the right friends, it is exciting, exciting and influential. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was the special FX manager of the excellent Daimajin trio. Yokai Monsters series are not equal to Majin at their best, but Yokai is a wonderful fun. The first film is miike which is the most child-oriented of his family's films, with GOZU and IZOO respectively more serious though nothing too extreme for young viewers.
