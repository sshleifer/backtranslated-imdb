Spirit is a unique and original look on Western life from the point of view of wild horse and Native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and risks faced by the wild horse, Spirit, during his life. <br /> <br /> The presentation has been done very well, using the technology available today to deliver stunning images in its depth. And realism. <br /> <br /> The music is great, with the songs of Brian Adams, and the music of Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the very famous music of Disney King's 1994 song. <br /> <br /> The story is not very deep but the truth It is not quite in depth because some movies do not see it detracting from the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie I enjoyed so much, it is suitable for the whole family. Not to be missed. (10/10)
