This recuperation of the heinous murders in Kansas in 1959, based on Capote's book, was starkly portrayed by Brooks and Black Hole cinematographer, giving her a documentary sense. There are good performances of Blake and Wilson like killers and Forsythe as a policeman chasing them. The scenes leading to the killings, which were filmed at the actual house where the crime took place, with a sound recording of the whistling winds, are very intense. Brooks draws with a lot of senses and uses many interesting transitions between the viewer. The only complaint is that they are a bit long, with some sermons being withdrawn and preaching somewhat.
