Conquered: buried alive leads us to a resort just opened, and soon closes. <br /> <br /> We start with a man in the drifting equipment, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. In a way, that makes no sense. In any case, it is about to blow one particularly large, when he notices that the resort is open. Despite his best efforts, the Supreme Authority tells him that his day is over. <br /> <br /> Soon, as everyone predicts, ice will collapse. <br /> <br /> Look, I will not reveal more. , All I can say is that this movie was B-designed for the family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that it has no commercials proving to be B). Anyway, it's a fairly good film, but it's partly unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Directly, when people are buried with snow and snow, they are buried. Not only followed by powder. Or what about a screwdriver CD? it's not possible. Finally, what I can not emphasize enough, is that the explosion can not stop the occurrence of an avalanche, the content. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is worth renting or watching television, but not owning it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie was rated PG, but maybe it should have gotten something stronger. A boy loses his foot almost in one of the lifts, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a man is roasted with electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, the dead lie down. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
