wonder. One of the best musicals ever. The three Busby Berkely numbers that ended the film are amazing, but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible incredible crackling and natural representation of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also pretty, although she may not be a fantastic actress). There is a novelty in the film that you do not see in today's clicks, much less in the triple films that are usually simplified, although the plot, which includes the preparation of an intro film, is quite dated.
