H.G. Wells Classic has many incarnations. Version 05 'Speilburg and 53 Classic' but this version remains quite true to the book. Nothing changed. Nothing removed. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour movie. The film was re-released to two hours of pure excellence. I've got chapter after chapter depicting the pages of novels that "Wales will be proud" of the story as everyone remembers. Martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of war-walking tripod machines. The people of the nineteenth century are not ready to repel strange forces and fight with guns and rifles whose shells were tied off their walkers. When humanity no longer is a universal force, they are rescued by the smallest living beings on Earth. <br /> <br /> The film is a great achievement for Timothy Heinz, who has great potential and has achieved this vision with a small budget of $ 5 million. B-Movies today have bigger budgets.
