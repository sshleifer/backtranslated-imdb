I had mixed feelings about "Les Valseuses" (1974), which was written and directed by Bertrand Beller when I started watching it but ended up. I would not call it vulgar ("stupid and fainting" vulgar, "the sweetest thing" is tacky and stupid alike); I would call it shocking and insulting. I can understand why many viewers, especially female or hate it, are not favored. It is an example of female hatred (or so it seems), and the way two superheroes treat each woman they meet is indescribable. But the more I think about it the more I realize that it somehow comes with a delightful little gem. I am intrigued how Bailer could escape punishment. The film is very enjoyable and very enjoyable: it is well written, and represented by all first class, sweet and sad music. In fact, when I think about it, two friends did something good for the women they met: They prepared a woman on the train (the beautiful and dotted blonde, Brigitte Fossey, who began her career in films with one of the most impressive games in Ren√© Clement's " 1952) at the age of 6 years to meet with her husband, whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who finally managed to get out of the way with Mary Ani (Miou-Miou.) They were enlightened and very young and very ready for Isabel Hubert (in one of her early appearances on the screen). Their confrontation with Jane Moro raises this comedy to a tragic level J. In short, I'm not sure of my desire to interview Jean Gere both Gerard Depardieu and Burke Dioar in Berrio in real life and invite them to dinner, but I spent a great time watching the movie and flew almost - was not it boring never two hours.
