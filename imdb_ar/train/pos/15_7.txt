I think if the film has magic, I do not need to be fluid or smooth. It can skip background information, move very quickly in some places, slow down elsewhere, and so on. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they do not detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem incomprehensible and more difficult to reform. All characters are intelligent. However, Stanley can not understand enough to work because he can not read; he can not read because he had a lot of adventure in his childhood. The iris, though well educated, did not have enough adventure, so she could not understand how she was going through her life. In both its imperfections and strengths, the characters complement each other. It may be quite simple to accept that Iris's work is finished year after year at a factory, or that Stanley has never hidden his illiteracy enough to work in construction or in another job with better pay. Although these "puzzles" are explained in the context of the story, they seem rather open. I assume that no one took the time to rethink the script. Still, it's a good movie? Just imagine what De Nero, Fonda and Plympton would have done on the screen if someone did!
