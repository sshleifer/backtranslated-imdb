I saw this movie on Comedy Central several times. This film was very good. It is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, his salary marriage to the King of Uttar, so that the United States can get an army base there to balance the power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also just love the theme of the end. He gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of every ten were my ratings for this film.
