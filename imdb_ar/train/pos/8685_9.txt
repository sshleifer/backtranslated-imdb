This was the first of Colombo films to be filmed regularly, but it was second only to Stephen Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder by the Book." It is also at the same time among one of the best! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a brilliant creative director! No wonder they later asked him to release three other films from Colombo. The film contains some real creative and creative footage, and the entire film is clearly made with elegance, passion and eye for more details. Each shot relates to why this movie is best, and it looks better for any other medium made for a TV movie. It is certainly one of Colombo's best-directed films. <br /> <br /> It is an original Colombo entry to take off two reasons. Murder is an accident and was a reckless act. So, this time the killer has no time to plan for "total murder" in advance and he has to clean up any traces afterwards and he has to get rid of the body. The murderer is treated in this film only as a man who committed the crime but also a man who helps Lieutenant Colombo to solve the murder. It also makes personality more interesting and classes, and also helps make Colombo's way of solving the whole crime seem more interesting also because of it. Of course, Colombo begins to question him very early, and as always, he finds a solution by making himself weak and seems more stupid than he is of course, and gaining the trust of the killer. Obviously this is not a spoiler because that's how every Colombo film is prepared. I liked the story of the film and how it was presented. <br /> <br /> It also helps the movie get such a wonderful movie. At the time of this film, Peter Falk had made the character of Colombo his own personality, and the character had already been developed in this film. Robert Culp is really great like Bremer's short temper. The interesting thing is that he will later join three different Colombo films again and the episode "Ms. Colombo", only in completely different roles. He even played the killer in some of these films as well. By the way, he was not the only actor who did this in subsequent Colombo films. As Ray Milland shows in this great film, as a victim's husband. <br /> <br /> All in all, Colombo is truly wonderful and one of the best in the long film series. . <br /> <br /> 9/10
