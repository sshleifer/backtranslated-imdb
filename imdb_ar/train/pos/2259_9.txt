I bought this cheap rental residue in our local store. It was almost mint, and I had never heard of it before. Obviously I had no one else. <br /> <br /> I can not believe my luck. Passing the whole world of emotions and trying to overcome a complex message - the immoral and immoral attitude of the Mandela party, no doubt. Despite its enormous length (I had to see it in two sessions) - it was like a book that one can not relax. The songs may not be memorable, but the spirit of the thing glows forever. I can not understand the comments that music (clearly designed for stage) is not realistic! I saw South Pacific and read the book too, and I can guarantee that the music is not realistic compared to the book. I treasure this little search until I wear it. One day, they will do it again with a better budget. <br /> <br />
