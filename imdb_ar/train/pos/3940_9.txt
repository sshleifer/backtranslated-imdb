Not only was this film one of John Ford's personal favorites, it was also directed by Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his most prominent fans. Ironically, I discovered this myself through the recent two-disc Criterion collection, which I missed in a few original language presentations on Italian television several years ago and again several times on television while in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The film marked the first of nine Ford collaborations with Henry Fonda, and is also an ideal example of the American vein of America. A piece of beautifully made and perfectly poetic work, the courtroom sequence (and ultimate revelation) in the second half still contains a wonderful collection of the game, apart from giving the eminent representative Donald Mick an unforgettable role as an advocate. <br /> <br /> Fonda, of course, is ideal as a timid, inexperienced but tough and humane lawyer who was to become president; Fonda will continue filming other delusional politicians on the film - most notably Franklin J.'s Best Man. Shavener (1964) and Vidney Lumette (1964) of Sydney Lumette - it is amazing now to learn that he was reluctant at that time to accept the role of Lincoln because, in his view, was "like playing God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford had already dealt with Abraham Lincoln (incidentally) at Shark Island Prison (1936), a wonderful but perhaps unknown gem, which has just been launched, fortunately as a disk A special DVD by the real Criterion in the UK, Mark "Masters Of Cinema" in Eureka. In addition, I also have two other Abraham Lincoln movies on the DVD set I have not seen yet, and by the way, DW Griffith - The BIRTH A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and I have not received a set of films that I did not see them before, I would gladly give them on the basis of my very interesting experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
