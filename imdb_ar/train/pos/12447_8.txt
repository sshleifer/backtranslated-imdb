There are plenty of comics from the Modesty Blaise comics and novels that will be fascinating in the film. Unfortunately, many attempts were made and failed in the great potential of personality. So, no, this is not the modesty you know from the comic strip (which has now been reprinted in nice versions of Titan Books). This is Modesty about 5 or 6 years ago from the first tape, and from what you can compile from its background story, it's accurate. <br /> <br /> Miramax got the film's rights to the character, with Quentin Tarantino acting as a lawyer and technical advisor. The Miramax drafts tried to adapt one of the best novels, but it always managed to leave some important elements. Tarantino was not happy with any of them, and offered to delete his name from the project so that they could continue. According to the studio, they wanted to keep him in the process, because they knew he "got" the character and world. With the near end of film rights, they decided to try a completely different way. The result was "My Name is Modesty", a small, direct video to personal video. <br /> <br /> Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald does not play. These characters are important to Belize's adventures in most published stories. What this film does is to show the power of the character itself. She never lost her composure and never doubted she was irresponsible even in a room full of gangsters with guns. Most of the film happens within the casino, which undoubtedly saves money on production. No matter the film does not come cheaply. Instead, provide a comprehensive and fairly comprehensive background story for the personality and show how far you think about the future. If Miramax adapts any of the stories or novels now, you have set the background of the character well and you will not have to spend too much time on its "origin." I understand that the words "Direct-to-Video" do not inspire confidence, but this film deserves to be seen.
