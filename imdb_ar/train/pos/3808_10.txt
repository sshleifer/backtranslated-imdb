I voted for this number 10 out of 10 because it was simply the best animated story I could see at some point. Amazing animation. The artwork behind all the landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting to non-standard fare of art. I was amazed. If we go beyond the beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a story that is both simultaneous and refreshing. The development of the personality is short, but the moments of the test are exactly what is required to realize the viewer in what and how and why and how the personality reached where it stands. I admire this whole issue and I think this is a must for the whole family.
