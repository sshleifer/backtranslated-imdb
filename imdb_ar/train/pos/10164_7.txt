This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch the flick and some how it ended up. I never heard of her or anyone inside her (excuse Mike from friends). <br /> <br /> But it's awesome! Eva, Lake and Paul offer amazing performances. The humor is dry and wonderful constantly. <br /> <br /> Paul Rod plays largely Mike's character from friends (who works wonderfully). Other characters are stereotypical templates and the plot is an equation (I mean we are not talking about "end of the world now" here) but the characters are interesting, the story is interesting, the soundtrack, the production and the direction all work well. <br /> <br /> In every wonderful movie he feels that he really deserves much more credit than he does. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I really do not understand the comments of one star on it.
