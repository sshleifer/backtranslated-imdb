This film reinforced my opinion in Errol Flynn. While Flynn is naturally famous for his unique festival and sprezzatura (for two European terms of high valutin!), This film gives him the chance to extend (albeit only a little) as an actor, because he plays a social climber shamelessly with the great ego and nervous feeling to match. Cast excellent support. Everyone seems to be well chosen for their role. <br /> <br /> The story moves quickly, but it is not particularly deep (it misses, perhaps deliberately, the opportunity to make a social comment about the unequal distribution of income greatly during that period). It certainly pleases and satisfies. From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is true to history. I also liked the great pictures of the 1980s in San Francisco. All in all, there's nothing you like about this movie ... it's worth a lot of time to watch it.
