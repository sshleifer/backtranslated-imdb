I started riding horses fairly recently, and as anyone knew kneeling at all, I fell in love with horses and their world. I hired Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life as full of horse-related material as possible, and I was surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a good Disneyesque film with talk about animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I got was a great movie, full of beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing story that has great potential to warm one's heart. <br /> <br /> Spirit is a wild Mustang in the Old West, where his entire world collapses around him when he discovers that humans have slowly controlled his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide range of characters, some of them humans and some animals, all well written and most enjoyable to watch on screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone with a good story, who has an appreciation of history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but I feel important, is that the animals in this movie do not speak. This was a really wonderful holiday from the Lady and The Tramp animated films that everyone is used to today.
