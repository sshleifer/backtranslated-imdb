Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) The portfolio of Canadis pockets (Jean Peters) containing an important microfiche aimed at the communist cause. Followed by two federations waiting for contractions once the microfiche is delivered to its contact point. However, Scip steals the wallet into the subway under everyone's noses, and thus begins to search for him by both the police and Joe (Richard Kelly) and Candy who want the microfiche back. Jumping can only be tracked through Moe (Thelma Ritter), who sells information about criminals. It is clear that skipping what has been stolen is important and that both sides want the film, but it intends to withstand a heavy price. This leads to Joy's hunting after him and the conflict between Joey and Jan, who fell in love with Scip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to the boss. <br /> <br /> It's a good acting movie and a good start makes you participate immediately. It is somewhat unrealistic how Jean Peters falls in love with Widmark immediately, but this point is necessary, otherwise why would he stick to Joey later. It's a good movie.
