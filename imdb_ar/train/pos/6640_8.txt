It can be said that this one-minute film is the first film ever made. Other inventors had previously done works - such as Edison's sneezing - but the Lumiere brothers had developed equipment that had advanced dramatically in the middle. At that time, of course, their "cinematic portrayal" should be anathema to their peers, including their subjects. In this first case, the brothers register the employees who leave their factory, and some struggle to hide their awareness of the camera. Lumieres tries to make the film more entertaining by offering animals and a bike, but La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere does not match the brilliance of their subsequent films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the choice of brothers for the rituals of the working class familiar as their theme. Their choice is the first evidence of their curiosity towards all the peoples of the world, a quality that makes watching their experiences very rewarding and wonderful today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
