It is a beautiful and really sweet film that the whole family can enjoy. It revolves around two dogs and a cat who are moved away to live with another person for a short time but the animals do not understand and run away and go to find the family on their own. The cat is named Sassi and lives on her behalf. Chances are a younger dog who knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is the oldest and most wise dog who senses things. Put these three on an adventure and make fun and fun. There are no special effects on moving the mouth so it is not at all cheese. It's the best animal film he's ever talked about. It's a really good movie for families.
