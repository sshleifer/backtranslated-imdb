"My Left Foot" An impressive film tells the story of Christie Brown, the artist who had cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only party in his body that he controlled. Daniel Day Lewis won the Oscars as the best actor for this film, which I'm not quite sure of his entitlement, but still worth noting. Day Lewis gives Brown a realistic and humorous touch almost at times. Brenda Frecker, Brown's dedicated mother, also won the Academy Award for her influential and influential role. My problem with this film is that it is a bit real at times. When Brown is in despair and must help someone and do it all with his left foot, it can be hard to watch the movie. This gives him a frustrating feeling that can often turn off some viewers for a while. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have other disabilities and difficulties to overcome. Those of us who do not get paralyzed and still consider ourselves to have problems inspired by this film, because if our situation is much worse than we can overcome its difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. Well presented, sometimes pleasant, but hard to watch. It may not be for everyone, but not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
