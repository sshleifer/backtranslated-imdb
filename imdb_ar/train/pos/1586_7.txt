Rosenstrasse is a more intimate film than a legendary film, which could have prevented many moviegoers looking for a plot similar to a pianist. Fortunately, von Trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist deal for a time largely illustrated on the outside of the exterior color, but analyzed very little in terms of intimacy and from an ordinary German-Aryan perspective rather than a Jewish point of view. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unknown burdens of people trapped under the historical circumstances in which they appear as victims. The pace of the film is introspection, impulsively slow, meditative. Besides, the characters are very vivid while transitions between generations and the passage of time have been brilliantly crafted. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative flaws are well identified. Another mistake lies in filthy cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the inner drama experienced by characters. However, this film is worth watching. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmare past, a trend that includes excellent films such as No Place in Africa and, more recently, A Controversial Fall. I recommend this movie to those who know how to read beyond the pictures.
