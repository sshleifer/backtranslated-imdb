"Beach Vacation" is mostly a Star Trek medium adventure. There is nothing wrong with this episode. I simply think that this is not the best representation of what the offer has made to the masses. It's light weight amusing, nothing more. However, I am pleased to see that a television show of this kind has a good enough feeling to take a break from intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew some time, and the landing party is directed to a planet that is ideal for a holiday. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some actions and tense moments, but most of the story is played for laughter. Good, but not exceptional.
