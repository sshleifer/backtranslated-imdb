14 years since the introduction of this presentation and still the best show ever. Writing was first class and production was second to none. This offer will never be made today and this is a shame. I wish I were thinking of finding this offer to see what you do. <br /> <br /> AG went out of the year I left high school while my free voice TV program was the x files that give you an idea of ​​why I first participated in this show. AG was a much better program with better writing but just got one reason? I know this is not the only program that gets only one season. Other examples that come to mind are being the only armed (x spinner) that was good writing and was fun but only got one season. Does not seem true! <br /> <br /> We also remember that this show was present before programs like "Twilight" appear in dark dark "wonderful", so I think this may also have left the exhibition heading down the hill. <br /> <br /> Watch and enjoy this program! 10 out of 10 for me.
