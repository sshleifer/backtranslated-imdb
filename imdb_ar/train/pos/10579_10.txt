The young active producer of theatrical dramas (those plays, which are usually musical, and which has often continued to film in the biggest cinemas of the past few days) must contend with twisted competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful fans, and amateur talents to fulfill his dream. Make its mark on the PARAD FOOTLIGHT. <br /> <br /> While quite similar to Warner's other musical scenes, especially the GOLDDIGGER movies, this film had a special appeal that none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. It is wonder, detailed, energetic, as agile as any cat - a creature that actually mimics several times during the film. Kani captures the viewers' attention and is never allowed to leave, giving more force to the fast and colorful dialogue through his charming and wonderful appeal. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also offers their best. Joan Blondell is ideal, like the blonde secretary of high taste, fascinated by Cagagni (Big Grace - why did not you get a music number?). Dick Powell and Robbie Keller again play lovers on stage. The fact that her singing and little acting ability on the lean side is compensated by her dance; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unusual position as a second male leader. <br /> <br /> Guy Kepey and Hugh Herbert enjoy a lot of fun as a pair of brothers, both of whom plan to fool Kani in different ways. Ruth Donnelly is registered as a wealthy wife of Kibbee, a woman who dedicated herself to her handsome citizens. Frank McHugh, the famous choreographer, is an apt foil to Kane's intelligence. Hermann Bing is hilarious in his little scene as a music organizer. Mavins will discover Billy Barty, Jimmy Connellin and possibly even John Garfield through musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a Berkeley Busby, a dance designer who is not prepared. His terpsichorean sweets, sprinkled throughout the 1930s, were a shining example of the cinematic escape that the depressed audience wanted to enjoy. Of course, the big joke about Berkeley creations was that they intended, as part of the plot, to be theatrical productions. But there is no theater that can carry these products of the master's imagination. It is an ideal illustration of the type of entertainment that can only be achieved by a film camera. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's musical performances generally follow one of two different approaches, either a story (often foreign) that is listed in songs and dancing; or other stunningly designed, eye-candy figures, , A public photographer and a romantic composer. In a wave of extravagance, Peet's FOOTLIGHT culminated with three major Berkeley works: "Honeymoon Hotel" and pre-production code that tells the couple's wedding night; `By the Waterfall '- dozens of inexperienced females, spraying, floating and snorkeling in perfect patterns and designs (Closely peer and you will see how the simultaneous effects were achieved); and finally, "Shanghai Night" - a fitting tribute to the talents of Kani and Berkeley.
