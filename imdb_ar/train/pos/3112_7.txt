I watched Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing this in the theater. I've been waiting for this since they started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The little spoilers below - <br /> <br /> In general, they were good, but they also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and sovereignty flow gracefully between the rush of adrenaline and the drama of independence. The film felt intermittent at times. The building plots were painted very little outside. This caused the next feeling of stress. <br /> <br /> Camera: When talking about overheating, the brand Greengrass shacam cam was very present and disturbing to me. I know there was talk / grumbling about the nausea on the message board, but that does not mean it is irrelevant. All martial arts training was wasted on the actors. The funny camera and most prominent camera cut the fighting in the film. It's a trick a cheap student outlet to make the film feel unstable. I expect that these techniques will be used in some of the panic attacks that are being done for high school children, but not in this stylish, old and moving series. Too much extreme close-up too. Do some framing. Get some interesting shots. The close-up image is similar to directing a zombie. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was very confusing at first. They are directing new names and faces to you from the beginning. Give me the feeling you get when you enter a late movie and know that you've missed some important information. I felt rushed or compressed for time reasons. After catching up but the story is very good. It's enjoyable yet threaded along with Bourne. However, I did not care about the entire final scene of supremacy (Landy / Bourne on the phone) being in the middle of something Ultimatum. It makes the film mainly half-brikwell. I thought it was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Actors / Characters: The movie star is the event. It is clear that there is only Aslan left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. It was a team of a strange kind to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to protect and trust. Unless I miss something completely, they will never tell you why they cooperate. The other killers in the film were very calm. This looked like Gilroy / Greengrass / who does not want to leave open ends. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marathon Csokas in excellence .. Those scenes were enormous. These killers are not as interested as Castell (the first Fela Bourne fights identity). Cast in general has deteriorated with the continuation of this series. Clive Owen was practically a later idea. This is a measure of strength for the first time. And second, basically trading Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... not quite equal. This one trading Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 reps will be renamed later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names that come to mind for this kind of serials. Apart from temporary stops that seemed long, the representation was correct. <br /> <br /> As a whole, it was successful. Feel like they want to get a series with more. If they cut or rearrange the slow parts, eliminate the entire Scott Glenn part, zoom in, and take the camera away from the victim, it would be perfect. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not see why they leave Bourne alive at the end. I understood that this is the conclusion. They clearly pointed to the beginning of the series with a silhouette floating motionless. I thought that would be. Type the whole circle of the end. I liked Nicky's reaction to the news report though. <br /> <br /> The final line from Bourne in the end is "Look at this ... Look at what this makes you give". Quoting the first murderer killed, I loved it. The last scene was fantastic. (Except that Vosen {Strathairn} was shot at Bourne Why would he do it Just for revenge If he was angry enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Landy after faxing him to his secret file?
