After "Empire" is back, "Return of the Jedi" is my second favorite film of the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the galaxy empire secretly builds a new space station, such as the former star of death. If this station remains fully built, it will be the end of the rebel alliance. Both Vedder and the Emperor are not running out of patience because of the new Star of Death delay, and they need to kill many of their leaders to make the project on time. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are located inside the Jabba Palace to send a message from Luke to Chiba, where Lukis pretends to negotiate Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Gaba as part of his plan. Juba does not accept negotiations, because he uses Han Solo as a piece of his palace decoration. (Han is still frozen in carbonate) Lando is disguised as a Jaba guard, and Chubuoka is given to Jaba by a reward hunter. When Hunter himself tries to save Han Solo and make him stay in human form again, we see that Princess Lea is actually disguised. The problem is that Jaba discovers Leah's plan and takes it as a slave to him, while Han is thrown into Chupaka's cell. <br /> <br /> Luke comes as a serious knight to save his friends. In his first attempt to kill Jaba, he falls into the brutal cell of Jaba (Panta), but kills her easily. Gaba remains angry and decides to throw Han, Shobaka and Locke to Sarlak, a great creature of the Sahara who remains 1,000 years old and is consumed by "food." Luke, Han and Choi managed to succeed again, and even Bubba Wit died when Han accidentally threw in Sarlak's mouth. Lea kills Jaba and stalks Han, Luke and Choi as well as C3PO and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decided to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a kid, as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is old and sick, because he already has 900 years, and before his death, Yoda tells Luke that he does not need more training, but in order to be really Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. Luke confirms that Vedder is the father of Luke, and that there is another Skywalker beside Luke. In his final moments, Yoda asked Luke to remember his advice on the temptation of the dark side, and to convey Luke's serious knowledge to other people. When Yoda died, Obi's spirit appears to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anken to become Darth Vader, and that he is also more of a man since Setha became. Still worried about his father's murder, he says he feels that his father is still gently enjoyed. Obi-Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leah, and says the reasons for the separation of Luke and Leah since the children. He offers a final advice to Luke that if he refuses to kill Vedder, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor tells Vedder that Luke should give him when he appears, since Luke is stronger than before, and both need to unite their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side. <br /> <br /> We will now face one of the best battles of the Star Wars series when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station, "Star of Death 2", will face Luke Vader and Emperor, and needs Lia, Han and Shui to close the energy field "Death Star 2" , With the help of EWOKS. (Small creatures that look like little bears) <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the most exciting Star Wars ever!
