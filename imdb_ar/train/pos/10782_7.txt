Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting sexual attitude toward sexual activity. He has no problem overcoming naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men, that's when he loses them. It is believed that when women actually practice sex, when they lose any feeling of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he walks around the Hollywood Hills chasing loving couples from afar, and eventually shoots dead men with a high-powered rifle. <br /> <br /> The main apparent reason for the existence of this film is the immersion in sex activity over and over again. The "story" comes more than just a later idea. Sure, this will make a lot of different males of different sex very happy because we have dealt with long scenes of nudity (the ladies here seem to have no wonderfully good clothes) and sex to serve as a big dose of tickle. Of course, seeing quite a bit of it through the scope raises the creeping factor to a great extent and explains the compulsion to gaze. (For one reason, Mike looks at the couples through the range for a few minutes each time before pulling the trigger finally.) All of this is emphasized through somewhat gruesome music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those who do have to enjoy this labyrinthine litter to enjoy this one way or another. So it involves a single lesbian experience confusing Mike and making him unsure * how * to respond. It unfolds at a very slow pace, but ends with an ironic pattern. It is a strange and twisted scarcity if nothing else will certainly keep some viewers adhering to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
