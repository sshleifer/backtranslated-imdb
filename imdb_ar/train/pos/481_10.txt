This is one of the unusual situations where the film and the novel on which both are based are wonderful. Perhaps this is because Boris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The end result is a view about Luzhin who honors him more than Nabokov. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the film that I do not like is the influence of Valentinov on the fate of Luzhin. I can not imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him a great influence on the argument of the novel.
