If you love mechanical warfare games, this is very good. Some are cheap but the robot battles are worth watching. I have enjoyed the field of mechanical warfare for some time, and this is the only film I have ever seen approaching this feeling of what would be the testing of one of those huge machines. If you like sex, the games you love are Mech Warrior Three and Four, and if you have Xbox and $ 350 to spare Steel Battalion. The movie is worth watching at least once. There must already be some movies on the same subject out there. Restores less and acts more original. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
