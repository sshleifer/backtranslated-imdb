As a child I thought this movie was wonderful. He had animals, he had beautiful music, and he had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for various reasons. They have well trained animals that are developed through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on the camera. It has beautifully written music that fits the viewer perfectly, with fast-paced melodies and the main theme that swallows the heart, still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. She has a favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> According to a book, this is the story of three domestic pets, an intelligent plant that enjoys extra confidence and is forever largely under the name of "Shadow," an ingenious but useless cat - with fear of water named Sasi and Bulldog Strangely ironic, a bit nervous, chans. The three are transferred to a friend's farm when their families disappear. Disappointed and worried, Pet explodes and plans to journey across the Sierra Mountains for her life journey. A truly incredible trip. What about it, maybe the house is above this mountain. But what if not? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound to those who like the three amazing actors who provide the voices of leading animal figures and anyone else ... Yes, everyone goes to see it.
