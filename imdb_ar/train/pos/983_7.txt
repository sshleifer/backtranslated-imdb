I think this film has a lot to recommend, especially the particularly evil performance of David Morse and more than acceptable performance by Mr. Fox which is always worth watching. Although there are plenty of holes in the plot and motivation is very difficult to follow in some cases, in general, it only makes fun in front of the tube.
