The main problem in the first film "Vampires" is that none of the characters were sympathetic. Carpenter learned of his mistake, and this time he used a popular vampire hunter and sucker sucker. The female vampire Una is definitely the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts such as slow-moving restaurant scenery (why Carpenter has not used more of this?), This film is not near quality. I was expecting to see powerful vampires at work and at least one sequential wrestling well-sequenced battles (for example within a city) and left somewhat disappointed. While Los Muertos is progressing faster than its predecessor, it still lasts a bit in some parts (although it is not in a bad place like "vampires"). Much like "vampires", the climax of this film near the end is not too severe. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may seem "Los Muertos" a bad film but it certainly is not. It is generally enjoyable and is ranked among the best entries for this genre. It is not a non-original Dracula edition (like almost all other vampire movies) nor is it a non-intelligent movement scene like Blade II. Perhaps he could have used more excitement. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see Carpenter's third installment, but maybe that will not happen. <br /> <br /> The spoiler's warning The end was a very predictable way. Ona had to escape would make the film unusual.
