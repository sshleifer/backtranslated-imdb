Well, the history of Star Trek was not a good talk. The next generation faded in its last few seasons, DS9 remained boldly where no one was left before, and Voyager started very poorly and did not live up to its promise. So, when they announced the new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. In the first episode, Broken Bow, encountered some problems. But, in general, Trek was solid and fun. <br /> <br /> I'll get the lice away first. The opening feature is boring and I do not look forward to sitting there regularly, but that's what remote controls do. What was really bad was the sight of the undue lotion scrub which drove my wife out of the room. They need to get rid of this nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and well developed. The characters look, though still new, well rounded and not always expected. Vulcans are clearly introduced very differently from before, with a somewhat ominous theme. I particularly liked the language, the first character of the Star Trek characters can not stand proud in the face of death, but it must deal with the phobia and fears. They seemed to stay right on Trip Trek, which was a big problem in the previous series, although they had plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through armor, the instant invention of technology that could fix anything, a lot of stories time travel. Does anyone want to start a pool about how long before Borg appears? <br /> <br /> In general, the string has tremendous potential. They see the universe with new eyes. We have a chance to see how things got the way they were in the next series. How did Klingsons move from mere insult to war? How did we meet the Romans? How the union formed and only the responsible of the land. Why is the main directive so important? If they handle these things instead of spitting out of travel rings over time, this will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran says "Where no one has gone before" (not "nobody")
