I saw this movie a few days ago. This movie is so wonderful that it makes me feel like if you want something really bad as long as you dream it - you can get it. This shows a great desire to realize the truth of happiness, sadness, despair and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can make things different and be happy.
