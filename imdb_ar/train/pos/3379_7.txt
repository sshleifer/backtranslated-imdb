In the 1970s, Charlton Heston starred in science fiction with varying quality. "Soylent Green" is one of its best. Plays the role of Robert Thorne, the investigator in 2022 New York. In this future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorne discovers the abhorrent truth of this product, he finds himself on the run. <br /> <br /> I think it is natural that this film seems to be dated to us at present. But still, it still raises interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture. He starred Lee Taylor Young, Chuck Connors, Brooke Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward J. Robinson (in his last role).
