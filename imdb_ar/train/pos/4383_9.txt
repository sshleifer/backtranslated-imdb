** Attention Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 1990s. It was a great achievement for everyone involved, especially Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones has painted a magnificent picture of the honor and shame that men can represent themselves. But unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> Consistently, unfairly compared to "Braveheart". These are two completely different worlds, which may be similar only in the fact that they are both Scottish Scots in historic Scotland. However, this comparison bothers me a lot because it seems almost assumed that "Braveheart" is a better film than "Rob Roy". I like Braveheart a lot, but the idea of ​​comparing it to Rob Roy is a little insult to me. Quite simply, I liked the "Braveheart", but it was so pale how "Rob Roy" loved it. Here are my reasons ... <br /> <br /> - Rob Roy is about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. It is a legend, a martyr, greater than the personality of life. Because of this photography, he is also a perfect person, never wrong, and basically shows his Scottish compatriots on the Promised Land. When it finally fails, this is not its fault. Like Jesus, is betrayed by the people I trust most. He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much. <br /> <br /> Wallace's portrayal is very good and effective. But it really does not inspire or interest me. I find human mystery more easily than human perfection. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is better than King of Kings, and that's one of the reasons why I think Rob Roy is better than Braveheart. Rob Roy may be heroic and brave, but far from perfect. He has committed many mistakes that have affected the lives of many of his loved ones. It is now certain that a false pretense against the Duke of Argyle was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also self-centered and self-centered. Let us not forget that the people who claimed to have been protected were displaced at the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did his best, and that was all you could ask of him. <br /> <br /> The wife of Rob Marie, is also a natural character. Let's start with it, how it looks in this film. Sure, she is beautiful, but she does not wear make-up and basically allows her natural beauty to appear. Compare this with two likes (or one, depending on your point of view) William Wallace in "Braveheart". Now these two women are alive, but hardly indicative of how women look at time (especially ordinary people). Perhaps not a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Rui's attempts at accuracy are more effective. <br /> <br /> Throughout Rob Roy, Mary must live with her evil rape by the treacherous body, Cunningham. She feels compelled to tell Rob about her struggle, but not because she knows Rob must seek revenge for her rape. Such revenge certainly means Rob's death, and Mary is not prepared for such sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains of Rob Roy are equal in urgency. Although the enemies of "Braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce, a brave man and coward, suffers from moral decisions that concern everyone in a fantasy world. Should he take his claim as the king of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace to ensure the safety of his family name? Bruce is the most mysterious character in "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Julius Ceasar" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II", these types of characters are hardly original. Longshanks, although the villain is convincing in itself, is a very dimensional one. It is a plague of evil, and its tyrannical methods directly contradict with Wallace's championship. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has three great villains in their art. First of all, let's start with Marcuse Montrose. He is a man obsessed with his own image, and he is willing to allow an innocent man to suffer because of it. "See that I am not a scorn" is his favorite words to "work". He is a man obsessed with power, displeased that a man of great nobility like the Duke of Argel can be considered more provocative. He is obsessed with himself, irritable and insecure. He is a wicked aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Clare are the conspirators at Rob Roy, who are also Roy's direct attackers. Callarn is so cunning in his cheese that he is almost comical. He will do anything to maintain the goodwill of the Marquis, which includes challenge and deception. Cunningham is a convincing figure in that he seems to have been brought up to do all he can to get the status and affection of the Marquis. He needs a father, does he know that the Marquis is his real father. So, when the opportunity comes to get the fortune of Callarn, it snaps it without even questioning it. It is very similar to the evil of contemporary man, focusing on himself and in vain and does not care about the consequences of his actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many people have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as being overrated. Hoojwash I say. It is clear that Cunningham is not only evil but also mentally unstable throughout the film. In a world where a man and his wife's son can circumvent the shooting of random people for entertainment, was Cunningham of an incredible nature? We live in a society where people seem to have underestimated the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that the conditions of this low value have changed only. It is a problem in the history of mankind that vanity in the human heart will not allow empathy. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope for good, but snakes will always be in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyle. He is a true gentleman, and he values ​​honesty and courtesy in direct contradiction to the Marquis. He appreciates the courage of Rob Roy and Mary, and he has a direct anger to Markis and his agent. It gives the world hope for the people of power. We hope that people like the Marquis are an exception rather than a rule. <br /> <br /> - The Final Fencing in "Rob Roy" is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> One thing I'm tired of is that people tell me that "Braveheart" is the best movie because of battle scenes. First of all, the scenes barely battle the original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has a long tradition of historical European battles scenes. "Braveheart" has some of the best scenes of battles that have been shown on the film, but it suffers from one important problem. These battle scenes have no context other than the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, the fenders are not authentic either. In fact, there may be 10 times as many movies with dueling as with battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is the beauty to be reckoned with. It is one of the greatest scenes in the film's history. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, describe the fighting style and carry the two letters in this fencing perfectly characters. Cunningham is effette and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses a fencing sword while using a folded robe. Cunningham fights with tough hard moves, while the fighting style in Roy is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The entire movie, from the first half deliberately slow to the exciting second half, leads to this moment. These are powerful things, and it is clear that Rob must destroy this evil that has afflicted the entire world. When Rob finally gets on the upper hand (literally and figuratively), it is one of the greatest moments in the film's history. Rob wins because he has a lot to live for, and his balcony is stronger than 10 Cunningham. Use chilling music in this scene. The prevailing good against real evil is stronger than seeing me dude being discarded just so he can yell "Freedom"! But hey, maybe this is just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I do not know that people in the aristocracy or Scots spoke like people in "Rob Roy", but I feel it is Obviously they try to capture their modern patterns. I feel that a lot of people are bored of "Rob Roy" just because they can not understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case, read some Shakespeare, or make a careful comment. Rob Roy is actually one of the greatest films written in the 1990s. Many of the dialogue in this film is clever, but you may have to watch the movie several times to understand it. <br /> <br /> By contrast, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is hardly interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is Australian? This legend, obviously there was no attempt to capture the discourse of the times. This film happens several centuries before the "Rob Roy", yet they speak like people today. So why so many people like it better. Today's audience is more lazy and does not want to take the time or the patience to understand complex things. So, as with many epic films, they expect to see the bad guys speak a recognizable English accent while the heroes speaking in the vernacular are not too far from our American language. Sure, Wallace is obviously Scottish, but unlike the sound like Scottie of Star Trek and the two "Ii" of recognition, the Scots in this film fall into the Hollywood tradition of how we think the Scots should look. So do these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better film than "Braveheart"? barely. But if that proves one thing, it shows that it's hard to know that "Braveheart" is a better film than Rob Roy. Simply put, "Rob Roy" is a film that contains very famous themes in today's world. "Braveheart" is a film about an inspiring but barely realistic myth. You can decide what you think is best ... <br /> <br /> Grade - A Score - 9
