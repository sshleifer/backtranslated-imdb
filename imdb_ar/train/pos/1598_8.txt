Either, or like to comment any equivalent plot in this movie. I have visited it several times and it is always there. It is a bit too fancy for some, but I imagine that any opera lover will like it. Norman Jayson, a Canadian colleague, takes great chances in his films and paints, and he always pays off in films outside the center and is rather tasty, as he is. I have often wondered about Cher's low roles in acting, whether she chooses to minimize this part of her life or does not get enough good roles to chew. I found her to be a wonderful actress that can retreat to a role, as in this particular role or to be as noisy, bold and fierce as in a "mask". I found occasional comic strokes sometimes (salon styling called "Cinderella") but this was the perfect goal for both writer and director. Nicholas Begg plays the angry opera, and all the grand gestures, at one point demanding a knife to slice his throat. Brooklyn scenes are charming, it's Brooklyn under the moonlight, romantic and romantic, just like the opera. All in all a very satisfactory film, not everyone's taste through a long shot, I loved the end, everyone gathered like a Greek choir, each part neatly and blending with others, the camera pulls down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 of 10.
