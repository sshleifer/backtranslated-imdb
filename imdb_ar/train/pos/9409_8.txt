A chemist develops a tissue that never gets dirty or worn, but is a threat to the survival of different industries. In this exhilarating comedy at Ealing Studios, Guinness is as wonderful as a light but hard chemist. Greenwood, with her sensual voice, plays the interest of love; Parker is her masterful father. Thesiger is amusing as patriarch of the textile industry. While telling an exciting story, the film also raises some interesting questions about science, economics and politics. He is skillfully directed by McKindrick, who will continue to make "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success" later in the 1950s.
