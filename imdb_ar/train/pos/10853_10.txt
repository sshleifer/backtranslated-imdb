This is a huge film to raise his morale. <br /> <br /> Every time I see him, I see and hear funny little things I've missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is unbelievable. Mike Jones (foreigner) and Chris Defeeze (Squeeze) made songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing in today's music scene. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a fantasy game completely washed from the 1960s to the 1970s that were never good, because of drug abuse and internal fighting. One wonders what may be, while listening to their fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Inspired by the drawing of The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> A member of the fruit is completely memorable. Steven Ree plays the role of Tony Costello, who was asked by one of the fans at the festival to reunite his band for a reunion, hoping to get financial benefits. Costello is approached by Karen Knowles of the former Rudy, whose role was played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him revive the flame of the last long dream. <br /> <br /> Juliet joins Jamie Neal Murr (Leigh Wickz), and misses David 'Beano' Baggot, and the brilliance of Ray Nighy. The slope of another previous game, Hippie Toki-Guixter Huey (Billy Connolly), never left the flame extinguished. <br /> <br /> While Juliet is looking for the latest member of her own Motley band, the elusive guitarist and songwriter Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Robinson, who was studying the conversation), members are fighting, just as in ancient times, They fight for rusty talents for each other. <br /> <br /> The band then gives the opportunity to do a small Dutch tour, to prepare for the festival. With Luke Chand (Hans Matheson), Hendrix's replacement of Lovelle, the crew takes the road. The sparks start as their memories swing forward, threatening to burn their incomplete goals ... <br /> <br /> Be ready to laugh, sing, cheer and cry, because these memorable characters are clinging to your hearts.
