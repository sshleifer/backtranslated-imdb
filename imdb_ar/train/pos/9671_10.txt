Paulie is a fantasy of a little girl, or perhaps she remembers her youth. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs flawlessly as Russian scientists who can not find decent work in America. He endorses an isolated parrot while performing malicious duties from a concierge at the Behavioral Sciences Laboratory. <br /> <br /> The chief doctor is a bitter man. Pauli, who can speak, understand and learn fully, embarrasses the doctor who later denies him to the lower levels of the building, where he is found by Tony S. <br /> <br /> Pauli is reviving his life with Mary and how they have lost each other. The quest to reunite Paulie begins with Marie, it has been over 20 years. <br /> <br /> The film ends, as some say predictably, with the reunification of Mikail Paulie with Marie. The story closes with the entry of Mary's three house, where you can make your final choice. <br /> <br /> A wonderful family movie!
