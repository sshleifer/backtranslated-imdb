If you're looking for UFO facts, this video is very important. "Meat" video is the comments made by Buzz Aldrin. It is without doubt one of the best in America. Trained to be objective, honest and realistic in his reports. Many astronauts from America of all ages reported on a type of communication, or surveillance of alien objects, and there are videos of some of those tasks. At least something has happened that requires further substantive investigation. I think that this testimony from Buzz Aldrin shows that other worlds may be interested in our progress. Like all documentary video supposed, this video may be tilted, but it contains more information and opinions than a skilled American hero. These do not come every day. So some people's lack of attention to detail should not prevent this video from being seen. If there is nothing else, it is interesting to advise you to watch with an open mind.
