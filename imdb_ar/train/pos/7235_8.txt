A Girl's Folly is a kind of half-comedy, half-sarcastic look at cinematic works in the mid-1910s. We get a glimpse of life in an early film studio, where we see a group of groups, passing through a scene, dealing with fanatics of the adored film, And even had lunch at the pool. We are also familiar with unknown film realities - for example, did you know that film actors often do not know the image plot in which they work? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is in essence the discovery of film star Kenneth Driscoll and the romance of a small emerging star he discovers while filming at a site in the country. I think the 30-minute version was short, and it was included in the same tape with the film "Cheating" by Cecile B. de Mille. It is a highly credible film - an easy clock with a wide range of plugins. As a bonus, it contains some of the best captions that I have seen accompanied by a silent film.
