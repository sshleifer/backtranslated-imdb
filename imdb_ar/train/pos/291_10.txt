"Zombie Chronicles" is not something to shout at. It's clearly not an award-winning film, but it's an entertainment film by Brad Sykes, who directed Camp Blood, another low-budget entertainer. The film is like a zombie version of tales from Crypt since we got two novels about zombie encounters in the jungle, the stories are fun And do not let you guess especially the first story. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some of the low-budget zombie movies out there, if you like low-budget B movies or cheap zombies, check out Zombie Chronicles.
