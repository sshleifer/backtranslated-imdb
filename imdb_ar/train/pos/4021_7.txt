A complex story developed on the background of the division of Bharat. An honest Muslim kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl, an educated Hindu who burns the harvest of a Muslim man - but in the end ends up admiring them. The story is strong, but the scenario and the flow are hesitant. The result is background music and wonderful songs. Comes after a memorable acting by veteran Ormila Matondkar. Photography captures time, violence, and the flavor of rural Punjab very well. Other actors either did not behave well, or did not get a chance to work. The trend is really the weakest link. Characters are not well developed. Not clear, unlike the "ground", where the mark leaves a five-line mark. The end is very interesting. This story can have several different ends - and they may all be just as good.
