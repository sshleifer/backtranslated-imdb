I'm of Irish origin, I loved this movie, was not hot and funny guy is also honest and honest. I loved the girl who fell in love too, and it was beautiful. They were like a nice couple. The end was very sad. I like this film! Although it is a little dirty, it does remember a British or Irish version of Prime. If you like this movie, you should watch the prime. The same line of story falls young for older women, and older women falls to the young for. Many paths intersect, in the end, the best decision is made or the task is completed. You do not have anything else to say, without destroying the entire film, although I thought the Frenchman was ugly and less attractive to me. Umm ... If you like Irish movies, I recommend "Circle of Friends", this movie is very good. A quick quote, you may not get it unless you see it "well, this is my ruined dinner". Haha
