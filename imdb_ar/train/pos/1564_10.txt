Chloe is mysteriously saved from Dr. Casselli, a corrupt physician in charge of transporting patients with the abilities of Billy Reeve to project 33.1, and arrives a fraction of Clarke later. I found that Bart Allan had returned to Smallville and that they met each other at Kent Ranch. When Barth was captured by Lex during the storming of a LuthorCorp facility, Clark discovers that Green Arrow has also hired Bart (a.k.a. Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to explore Project 33.1. Clark accepts joining the trio to save Bart and calls on Chloe to participate in their mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode yet of this sixth season. In this episode, the Association of Justice started its epic with the collaboration of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash (Implas), Akwaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is spectacular, complementing the organization needed for teamwork. In the end, Oliver separated from Lewis based on the importance of fighting against criminals and secret Liex laboratories around the world. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
