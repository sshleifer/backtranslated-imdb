In the light of bad reviews - or car accidents - I feel that I have the ability to enter the transmission and conduct the transmission to give merit at maturity, and to do the service. I'm not sure people have a license to say it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> SUSPENSE is rare. This film has kept the suspense long lasting, for me, despite any flaws that may be. How much film can say it? Not even a lot of them. Because of the simple premise, you do not know if people will come out of a life-threatening situation, which lasts the whole movie. Yes, the comment was narrow, and on some bumps, the shocks were working. It's not just a TV movie, but it's a full-motion film. There is no point where you stop, deviate, or become talkative. It will be difficult to make such a film, always on the road. The only duel, or speed, is that I mention. The best thing about them is constant stress. <br /> <br /> Acting is not bad: the judge is as good as he has always been and others are as well. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury knows whether it sometimes - or seems to - be a bit upset. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. Your first judgments are not always correct, but I think the main actor was right to be in this film. <br /> <br /> Thrilling games are mostly great, especially for a TV movie. Their only failure may be marked slow speed, and again. But we all know how GP cars can look deceptively slow. <br /> <br /> I liked the beginning she said "inspired by a true story". So you will not go how true it is? You only know the foundation is. It makes me habitual "based on a real story" that it should be mostly true. But maybe this is my fault. <br /> <br /> How to save them: A good idea for references is to suggest a tow truck to lift the rear wheels up. Only a few inches will do. The driver can stunt doing this at 100 mph. Curiously, they did not call a car expert - an electrician or a mechanic - to see if there was a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has reflected that this film is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And helped him to become a distant success. <br /> <br /> Pic quality is very soft for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: It was possible to have her story after he was a child, but strangely that the life-saving idea was cleverly handled in a joking conversation to fade away. I think we know why. End of the film. The infidel comment of the upper window went with the child.
