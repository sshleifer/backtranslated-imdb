This is a documentary I happened to encounter on UK TV More4 and I say I found it very interesting and thought-provoking. I will also look for the book that was the main source of this documentary. This is essentially the theory of Professor Jared Diamond about why certain parts of the earth's societies flourish and some do not. His argument was new to me and I debated about how the wealth of suitable crops and suitable animals that are sure to be domesticated is certainly an attractive one. As for the documentary itself, it has been well shot and well narrated with not seeing many re-created scenes that spoil many modern documentaries. Diamond also helps by not giving up and is a mistake for many intellectuals when trying to deliver a message to the masses. People have claimed that his theory is Marxism, but I do not buy it and see it more geologically socially. It was also refreshing to hear a theory about the development of a non-religion-based society. Viewing is highly recommended.
