I've been a Jennifer Connelly lover since Phenomenon, and after hearing about seven minutes in Heaven, I saw her as soon as possible. The film is not just a comedy If you think many of these things have been passed by most of us in childhood and are currently going through, the film was not only wonderful by the amazing Jennifer that caught my attention that this film was terribly written and acted as a good deal I loved it and watched it over and over again and for those of you who enjoy laughter or love Jennifer Connelly you can not afford to postpone seeing this movie !!!!
