It has been 16 years since its original operation, I wish now that some of the "marketing wizard" upgrades the direct actor version of this classic now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the science fiction network or network Animation of it. In fact, Galaxy Rangers had well-planned plots and even better scripts. The animation was higher than the average quality in a timely manner, and excellent compared to the modern Japanese animation slide show today. I've already tied the heavy toon ton game on the market, and this may have closed it too torment. I would willingly spend cash on a DVD of GR if it is available.
