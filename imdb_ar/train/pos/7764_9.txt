Another classic study of the effects of wealth on a southern family was brilliantly filmed in its writing on the wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has everything. Wealth, airplane, you name it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always made it difficult. Mitch finished college, got Kyle expelled. Mitch is not from a wealthy house. The Kyle family controls Hadley Oil in everything in the city. <br /> <br /> While in Kelly, Kyle meets the girl of his dreams, she played brilliantly with Bacal. After a strong love story, he marries her and takes her home. There she meets her husband's father, who warns her of Kyle's difficulty. Kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow. The Bacall character meets with Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a vagabond if she exists, Dorothy Malone played the best, she was selected as the best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays the role of Mitch, the devoted friend. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> A year of bliss for Kyle and his bride ends when he tells Kyle that he can not have children. When his wife reveals to him that she is already pregnant, Kyle, believing that the baby is Mitch, goes into a drunken madness and accidentally kills in an unforgettable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has long loved Mitch, but failed to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In an unforgettable scene in the courtroom, Malone took out all the stations in the final recognition that Kyle's death was a regrettable accident. Oscar was well worth it. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that Robert Stack, the illustrious Kyle Hadley, was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and lost in a surprise victory by Anthony Quinn, Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. Douglas Cirque was the master of soap operas in the 1950s. Written on the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
