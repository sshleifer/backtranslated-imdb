Was Al Pacino in a bad movie? His name seems to be imprimatur of first-class cinema. This performance is as good as presented. Pacino is an American olivier. This is a good political film as much as it gets. There are no good men or bad men. But the regime has a firm influence on people who believe they are running it. Pacino's performance is not only attractive, but a tribute to the funeral of the dead child is astonishingly powerful - the film has a fast and realistic reality, enhancing good performance without resorting to tricks. This outstanding image of the city's big policy also manages two hours of great movie watching without undue violence, frenzied sex or gutter language. There is a murder. There are bad people. But they encounter effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my reckless faith in Hollywood. I do not get many scores. This one is worth the rich!
