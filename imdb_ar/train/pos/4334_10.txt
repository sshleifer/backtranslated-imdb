Who among us does not want to go on a wild trip with Peter Falk? The right eye of this man has more personality than most actors today. This is the kind of funny movie texture that we all look for as a balance for all special effects slots. Women will love this despite the advice of romantic waking for men, and men will love it in order to study the father / son figure of the spot - a wonderful little scene after another. It has enough edge to be a real indie discovery. This is obviously hard work for Paul Reiser who understands what it's like to be a father and a son, as well as to laugh and cry while you are in life. The most fun part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You can say that each of his character has reached a new appreciation for his father and fellow actor who really enjoys the character of Peter Falk. Really delightful. Let's hope this movie turns into theaters all over the country soon so that everyone has the chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and people.
