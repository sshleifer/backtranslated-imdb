I first saw "Samurai Blood" at the premiere during the Hawaii International Film Festival. Wonderful! We have blown the blood away thanks to its sharp edge and paper and vitality and injustice and excitement and injustice and camps absolute and even more, and all in great fun! Especially for those of you who enjoy all the Japanese Sambora Samurai and Ninga movies, you will surely see the blood!
