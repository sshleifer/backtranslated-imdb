I saw this movie a bit of a coincidence, after I bought it as Side B on the DVD Omega Man. The Omega Man game was a little disappointing - except for the start, which was clearly inspired for 28 days later, and the rest was just TV movies. But Soylent Green in another league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film I have never seen before. Heston enters a show with "furniture" while discussing something else irrelevant! A whole crowd of people being gathered by a fleet of mechanical rigs! A priest takes confession and is called fire. Well, it may have been since then - but there are not many movies that are consistently authentic like this. What is happening between Heston and Edward J. Robinson? Is this gay couple the most likely, or what? Fortunately, I saw this film without knowing the end - which is rare. Then I saw him again, and I enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. Very nice script - and some great collections too. Only when you think you saw everything. . .
