This movie is a movie to watch for everyone. Congress must see this honest documentary from the soldier's point of view, as with everyone in America. This point has been completely erred by the former reviewer - the important point is to reveal the truth about educating our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists, but who live only in the land of "our enemy" and what soldiers do. We must support our forces by returning them to their homes immediately, before killing or injuring another person. This also reveals that the government does not help veterans, who are mentally injured, in post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with limb loss. Julie Roberts, Streamwood, IL
