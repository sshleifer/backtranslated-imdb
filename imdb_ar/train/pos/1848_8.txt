Several years ago, the Navy kept a well-thought-out distance from making Men of Honor, a film based on the experiences of the first scuba diver by a black president to overcome violent racism. Ever keen to support films showing the best side in our US Navy Nimitz Corporation and two helicopter carriers, supported by shore installations, were equipped to complete this thorny story of a young sailor battle with uncontrollable fury. Some of the film was filmed on board the US Belo Wood. <br /> <br /> Anton Fischer wrote the first screenplay for Denzel Washington, whose role as Navy psychologist treats Fischer, played effectively and deeply by Derek Locke. <br /> <br /> Fischer is clearly a bright man recruited for the United States Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a helicopter attack platform on the front line. Fischer does not seem to avoid launching his own attacks with the least provocation of his fellow recruits. When he is sent to the MD as part of a possible procedure before separation, Fischer slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing a terrible childhood of great neglect and horrific brutality. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to continue to interest in love, a registered sailor named Cheryl, played by amazingly beautiful Joe Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fischer reluctantly shares a long-term question with the doctor but soon realizes that he must seek answers, no matter how painful, to grow away from destructive behavior that seeks conflict. <br /> <br /> While all the main characters are black, this story outweighs race and undoubtedly shows the evil of excessive religiosity and associated hypocrisy in foster family environments. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of modern films, is a picture of deceptive corruption but is not compared to her foster mother, Ms. Tate (Novella Nelson), who will earn her in short scenes but burn - if any - Oscar for the savagery of gastrointestinal rupture. <br /> <br /> Films relating to patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all those things that move and transform), but Fisher's seriousness and his doctor / guide are realistically controlled. It's a good story. Period. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie "Antwone Fisher" in the Navy, it does not represent any real story like "Men of Honor", an excellent film dealing with overwhelming racism directed against a real person. Nor is it really a film about blacks. It is about surviving from terrible childhood experiences, and as Fisher says, be able to declare in adulthood that the victim is still "standing long". The oppressors shrink in size and importance, as the brave and strong young man claims his right to a dignified life with the help of a specialist doctor. <br /> <br /> The only boxer is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is taken up as a commander. With all the Navy personnel supporting the final credits, one should have told the manager Washington that his character, like all naval officers under the rank of commander, is treated as "Mister". No big criticism, right? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie plays in very few theaters. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Locke may get Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
