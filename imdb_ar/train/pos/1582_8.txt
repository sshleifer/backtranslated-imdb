Another small part of the wide-angle puzzle of the Holocaust appeared in this dramatic document about Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin, an event I did not know, which began in late February 1943. Details are given in an appendix to this review. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of this protest in another contemporary story that begins in New York City at the present time. Here, a disrespectful Jewish lady, whose husband has just died, shocked her children and others by insisting on the very Orthodox ritual of mourning. She went further, asking her fianc√©'s non-Jewish daughter to leave the house. <br /> <br /> The troubled daughter, Hannah (Maria Schroeder), learns for the first time from an older cousin during World War II in Berlin. Her eight-year-old mother was detained and protected by a Aryan woman. Hanna drops everything, goes to Berlin, and finds this woman, Lina Fisher, now 90 years old. Hannah easily persuades a woman to tell her story. It looks pretty good. <br /> <br /> After that, focusing on the memories of the long past, the film focuses mainly on the 1943 events surrounding the protest, in which the fictional central character is the same 33-year-old Ms. Fisher who played wonderfully By Katya Riemann), a baroness and pianoist married to Fabienne (Martin Feivel), a violinist for the Jewish party, one of the men held at the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> The narrative weaves briefly back to the present from time to time and also ends up in New York City again. Although the scenes are now saturated with color, the 1943 scenes are submerged and strong in shades of gray and blue. <br /> <br /> The quality of acting is very good in general, what we might expect from Germany's deep talent pool and the direction of Margaret von Trotta, the leading New York cinema maker, is a former actress. <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is simply listed. There is only one advantage that would have helped: Notes in the hard text finally indicate the end result of those people who were detained in Rosenstrasse, a result which, as the addendum below illustrates, is incredibly positive. <br /> <Rosenstrasse "was not performing well in the opinions of most film critics. For too long, a class unnecessarily, a supplier of gender stereotypes, manipulates music: so go to the usual rap music. It's too long. But I found in this film a strong, strong, spontaneous and convincing voice to protest against the women who kept the vigil outside in Rosenstrasse where their relatives were held captive by Jews and others. I did not find anything flashy or contemporary or manipulative in this photography. <br /> <br /> The absence of extreme violence (no one was shot or physically abused) has increased tension, which has increased as the film progresses. You are still waiting for some fierce attacks to begin at any minute. I stayed soft with me after that. I woke up often later in the night watching the film and my mind full of dark and sad images and chaotic feelings brought to the film. For me, this rarely happens. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (Viewed on 5/31/05).

But before the prisoners were deported in this case, the wives and other relatives felt the wind of what had happened and appeared in Rosenstrasse, first in the couple and the two, then in ever increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Up to 6,000 people may have participated in the protest, though not all at the same time. Women demanded that their husbands be returned day after day for a week. Were armed, unarmed and unorganized without leadership, the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, governor of Berlin (governor or district leader), longs for this city to be racially cleansed, and was also responsible for the general morale of the nation. In both cases, he was concerned about the potential consequences of women's actions. Instead of calling for a more open opposition to the shooting of women on the streets and fear of exposing the secrecy of the "final solution," Goebbels, with Hitler's consent, released the prisoners of Rosenstrasse and ordered even the return of twenty-five of them already sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was merely a postponement of what was inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all who were released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women won a stunning victory over the forces of destruction.
