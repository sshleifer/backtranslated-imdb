I also saw this when it was released in 56, and has since been shocked by its recent scene. If this is a response to "High Noon", it is an appropriate and appropriate response. The idea that "City meets", with the direction of this series, is a much stronger message than the single "High Noon". On this subject, "Concho" is a great introduction to one of my favorites at all, "The Magnificent Seven". Both Sinatra and Conrad offer impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from the bullying brother to the liberator of the city. I can only hope that at some point, all the friends and family who have been passionate about this film over the years will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.
