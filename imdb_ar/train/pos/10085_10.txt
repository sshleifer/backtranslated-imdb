I watched this movie today with my children (Jr., 10 and his daughter, 4.5) at the third annual Roger Ebert Film Festival. After the film, the children were allowed to attend to ask questions to the director, Tian Ming Wu. He has narrated (through an interpreter) several stories about his life and film making. <br /> <br /> Apart from all the phenomena, each of my children really enjoyed this film. Of course, I had to rephrase many of my daughter's translations, but much of the film is not visually clear. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything away, but the bottom line is that this movie is much better than 95% of Hollywood crap (especially children's movies) there. <br /> <br /> Cheers. <br /> <br /> ps There is a real / original Mask King who can / can do 12 masks once. The actor trained in the film and learned to do four masks simultaneously (then cut and changed to 4 new masks).
