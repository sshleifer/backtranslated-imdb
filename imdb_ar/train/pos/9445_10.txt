It is without doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. The first time I saw her I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started looking at a time before the rape scene. When I saw him I was really shocked to think "What film is a bit sick?" I saw him today from the very beginning and I really understood how wonderful it really is. It is exciting, frightening and shocking in this unique and worrisome way. But the best thing is the end when the audience shows that this experience will chase the characters for the rest of their lives. Their conscience will be tormented and they will be worried for the rest of their lives about the bodies found in this river. There's nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. This finish is one of the most unpleasant endings in the history of the film and is very intelligent, wonderful and terrifying. <br /> <br /> The acting is also wonderful, especially John Voight and Bert Reynolds. A wonderful representation in this film. All in all, John Burman created one of the best films in the history of the film based on Dick Cheney's novel. Must see for all movie lovers
