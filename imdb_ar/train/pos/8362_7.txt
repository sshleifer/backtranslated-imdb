An updated version of the story turned into a film in 1938 in England (Return of the Frog) about a police hunt for a major crime known as a frog due to a frog like waking up (puffy eyes, etc.). <br /> <br /> One of Wallace's goodies, which appeared in the 1960s, is a small, solid amusement. The frog was clearly affected (or did this effect) by re-playing Dr Mabuse movies, and Frog seems to be more vicious than the thief. Although it is not the best in Wallace films, it is worth watching. It will make an interesting double feature with an excellent previous film. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 of 10.
