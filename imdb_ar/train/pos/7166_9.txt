Holes, the novel, imposed on me in an educational course. I did not think I wanted a children's novel; in addition, the other two books that forced them to read in class were very bad. But, to my surprise, I absolutely love holes. It is really one of the most written novels I have ever read. I think he has the rare quality that attracts teenagers, teenagers and adults. I think everyone who reads it will stay away from a better person. Although I can not say exactly that for the film, I'm happy to say that they did it right. I do not think the film's viewers will abandon enrichment, but they will certainly be entertained, without any side effect because they are stupid when they sat down. It's a smart story, and it's well listed. I think it moves very quickly. The novel takes more time to develop characters. The flashback comes in quickly so it does not have much time to register. In the past, interracial romance is more cliched and smirkier than fiction. The end, which binds all the loose threads, looks very silly. It is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of absurdity that does not exist in the film. It works much better. I also do not like many pop songs. I wish that Disney did not feel it necessary to sell soundtracks. The cast has an excellent character, from young to old. John Voight is particularly great. I'm not quite sure why we need Catwoman and Fzone, though. 10/09.
