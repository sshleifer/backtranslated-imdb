Awesome ..... Maybe this was a bad attempt to reproduce Omen movie that was already re-created, but I definitely enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This last man who hung up is a fool, it was a nice movie, and The Music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith himself, was applauding this film. <br /> <br /> Fantastic recommendations from myself to watch this movie or buy it. <br /> <br /> I collect horror movies and soundtracks, so listen to what I have to say, not this other idiot. <br /> <br /> There's only one thing that does not fascinate me, the endings. <br /> <br /> According to prophecy, all of them are inaccurate, including the final conflict, and backwardness. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is ... there are great movies ... and you have to watch them, before the Great Depression falls on us, and before the Democrats take over as well. <br /> <br /> So signed up ... Jacob Eder ... farmer, with the mastermind.
