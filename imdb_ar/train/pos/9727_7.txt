Simon Big plays a rude and often out of control role, a famous journalist brought from England to work for a major American magazine. Of course his winning ways create all kinds of complications. An amusing comedy based on truth, starring Christine Dunst (Kebert), Danny Houston and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we love Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We fully understand why Christine Dunst continues to speak to him despite his many screw operations. I love the movie. It was not all, but it was over, but it was a great way to beat an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
