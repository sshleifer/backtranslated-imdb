This complex story begins simply as the English journalist accepts a bet from Edgar Allen Bo and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend a night at Blackwood Castle. As soon as he arrives, the writer walks around the dusty rooms and corridors, so that the music and the couple's gaze lead into an empty room. He sits in the guitar and starts to play the tone he heard, and is surprised to be exploited by the beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood on the shoulder. I told him in a mysterious / charming way that he had prepared his room on the top floor and that he was expected to be someone tonight ... the night of the dead. And so begins an amazing series of supernatural events that perplex the reporter all night. The spoiler forward: probably will not surprise a lot of viewers to find out that beautiful Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This does not prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but it makes things more complicated for them than for ordinary couples. It's a fun movie, containing everything completely: the ghosts, the scary castle, the recurring visions of past events, sex and violence (although both have been diluted in the version most Americans have seen over the years). Is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma unlike anyone else I've seen in movies. Recommended!
