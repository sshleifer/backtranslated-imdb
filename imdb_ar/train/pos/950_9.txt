The setup and the actors make this TV movie for me the best show of Dickens classic story. George C. Scott is as reasonable as the rest of the actors. His scoundrel gently explodes until the end of the film. Then his personality changes to a truly repentant person. The English city of the 19th century, which was chosen for the setting, creates a suitable atmosphere for Dickens and adds to the reasonableness of this film. It's a movie I watch at Christmas with the real Grinch movie and a wonderful life.
