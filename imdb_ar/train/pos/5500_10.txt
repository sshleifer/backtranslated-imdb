This documentary (now available free on Video.Google.Com) is a wonderful display of the ability of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone should see it. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected in a landslide election in 1998. His program was to transform the magnificent oil wealth from the middle class of 20% to 80% of the poor. And the prohibition of foreign drift-net fishing in Venezuelan waters. 10,000 Cuban doctors have been sent to slums to treat patients free of charge. He has eliminated illiteracy and created new free universities. <br /> <br /> But the 30% tax on the oil company's profits is what caused him a problem with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donacha O'Brien were interviewing Chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs, a CIA-backed coup was launched. With the rotation of the cameras, Chávez was arrested and taken out of the country. Announced on national television that he "resigned". <br /> <br /> But the Venezuelan poor did not believe the media. They went to the palace with their millions and demanded Chavez's return. In the face of these overwhelming numbers, the army turned on coup leaders and the conspirators fled to the United States. Chávez was saved by a military helicopter and returned to rejoicing.
