This is one of those movies you wish you had never seen before - so you can watch them again "for the first time." Van den's books still bring pleasure, but many call it overly exaggerated names. This film is by far the best adaptation film for his works. William Powell is William Powell - Say No More. The plot is complex. The story moves very quickly, because you want it to continue. Enjoy.
