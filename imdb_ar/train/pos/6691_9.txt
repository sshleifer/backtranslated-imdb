This movie is a lot of fun. What makes him especially wonderful is two things: the first is the explicit way that characters adopt stereotypes, discussing their fashion and the superpowers. There is a gracious seriousness to a very attractive parody; the second is the basic sweetness of characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a special note as a goal of Mr. Vorius's wishes. There is a boatload of talent here. I realize that some people with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this is a lot of fun, a kind of fun.
