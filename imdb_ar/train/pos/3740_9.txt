While filming at a National Guard location in Florida, Tigerland reminded me of Polk Fort, Los Angeles, firing ranges, maneuver areas, deep water and waist. The film was fairly original and characters similar to those in my 1974 AIT. The difference between Tigerland 1971 and 1974 is all the sergeant and trainers who knew they would not return to Vietnam. Training is very comfortable - not a challenge at all. It was an introduction to all our problems in the 1970s and 1980s, which I know about the fact that I stayed there until 2004. I never heard anybody mention Tigerland, but the army had realistic Vietnamese training villages in different bases all over the US. Vets that until 1972, Basic & AIT can be very rugged and rugged, because the coaches were there and they were assigned to train men associated with Vietnam on those skills to make them, although this was not always the case. When I became a trainer at the Fort Bliss basic training brigade, both Sergeant Polk and one of the Vietnamese Vietnamese officers told me that there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready, and only people had to discover and get to know themselves outside. This movie rates are high.
