I was a bit young for this purpose, but I had to see him. There is some excellent music, which many people have mentioned, but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance of "Angel", a band that has now been ignored but once was a popular music. Dressed in white clothing for their brand names, are moving through the "20th Century Foxes" and are all trying to appear in the field of camera vision. Greg Gevriera, a keyboard player, is still the most prominent difference, and it seems he did not get much hair cut, at all! Cherie Curry (a former singer-songwriter) begins a short, but memorable, career here alongside Judy Foster and the rest. (We kept her nude 3D scenes in the "parasite" and seeing her strange body, in the "wavelength" we all watched for a while). <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece, but it preserves part of its period, for all to see and wonder.
