Christmas came together before my time, but I grew up on John Denver and the songs of this special show were always Christmas music for my family. For years we had a cracking cassette made from a log which meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I finally managed to track a video of it on the Ebay website, so after listening to all the music for about 21 years, I watched John and Muppets act by myself. If you get this chance, there's a lot of fun - great music, warm heart and cheese. It is also interesting to watch the 1970s versions of Muppets and compare them with the latest versions today. I think Denver has had some heat in performing such a show - I think performers usually do not put their pictures at risk by doing long singing with the Muppets, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can not track the video, the soundtrack is well worth it. It has some favorite Muppified traditional, but also some original Denver tunes as well.
