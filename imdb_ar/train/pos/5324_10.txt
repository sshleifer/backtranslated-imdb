After I saw this movie again since 1998 and it was showing the VH-1, I had only to comment. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on television, it was around 1981, and I remember I stopped it. Of my mother betamax. The tape ended up black and white for some reason, which gave him a look back to the time she grew up. <br /> <br /> I remember very vividly the movie that begins with the song, "My Bonnie" camera taken on a scene from Liverpool. I also remember the opening scene in which Paul referred to some girls and said, "Look, talent!" So I was very angry when I appeared in my 1998 version and "remembered" that the movie started with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie." When you see how slow the camera is at the speed of the music, you can see that "she loves you" does not suit you. Also, in this "newer" version when Paul sees the girls, he says, "Look, girls!" .. And somehow remember the previous version, that the word was not also appropriate, too. Why they felt that they made this film to the American public is beyond my control. Personally, if I watch a film about a British band, I want all the British colloquialism, and that will be part of their speech, behavior, and so on. <br /> <br /> Another irritation was how "choppy" editing was for the TV. Immediately after sto hits, for example, the movie turns into a lot of commercials. Yes, I know that it depends on the network, but it actually destroys the effect of the film to divide it, as we all know. What some people may find unimportant about the dialogue (and therefore agree to the amendment) may actually go on to explain a particular action or scene. <br /> <br /> My point is, "the best", perhaps the release of this movie is the previous version I recorded in 1981, which happened to include the scene "Shake, Horser & Roll", which was not included in the 1998 version. There had to be two different versions of the TV, and I had a look at the "alternative versions" link for this film. The American version had some short and / or different scenes and / or dialogue is a great frustration for me and something worth mentioning if anyone cares about such things. Imo, your best bet is to try to get a European version of this movie, if possible, and (possibly less possible), unedited version. Unfortunately, I had to ignore the old version of the European betamax because I did not know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> Regardless, I found that this film is, perhaps, one of the best films regarding the story behind the Beatles' birth. Being well aware that artistic and creative licensing is often used in film and television when photographing events in history, I did not leave any differences that spoiled my enjoyment of the film. Sure, you see the Beatles playing songs in the cave, which made me wonder, "Did they write that at the time? I do not think so," but nevertheless, I thought it was a great movie and great shows. <br /> <br /> The real attitude for me, in fact, was the actor who played the role of John Stephen McKenna. I just fell in love with him. His looks, behavior, personality, and speaking voice seemed instantly apparent. It seemed to me as a young man for me to do a double action at the end of the film when you see the Beatles performing on Ed Sullivan for the first time. I found myself actually wondering whether the actual Beatle footage or not, so I saw other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a dead accurate date for the life of the Beatles beginnings, you can not get better than Beatles Picks, where they were "written" by the boys themselves. However, if you are looking for a fun shot of the days before the Beatlemania that preceded their arrival in America and left your critical anal evaluations at the door, you can not make a mistake in "The Birth of the Beatles" - Should any of the Beatles fans have "real" or informal .
