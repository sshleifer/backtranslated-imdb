I love this film, but the music in all the graduate gatherings is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But most of the music was played in dances, etc. dating back to the 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> After I just attended my 30th school reunion, I can assure you that the last music being played in a reunion or dance from the previous high school people is the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding relevant music in the 1970s - we all know what was a musically deserted time. But they were not completely abstract, and film producers had to be more interested. I found those dancing scenes very tense to comment on dissatisfaction in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> This was a bad decision for the director and / or producer.
