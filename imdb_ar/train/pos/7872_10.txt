The first review I saw on page 3 said, "What is Madhoor Bhandarkar finally wants to say?" You should say something very crucial. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing on page 3 is that it does not take sides. No publicity at all. This is a film that captures many corners of the issue (I do not know what I call "problem" here). However, no average film does not come up with a solution. I was very fascinated when I realized that the movie was almost finished in the same scenario just as it looked. <br /> <br /> The film identifies a large number of characters who have very different priorities and different ideologies, yet they are all part of the system that is more apathetic. I wish I could say more but there will be more spoilers in the future. So see page 3 if you want to see one of the most mature films lately.
