This beautiful story about the return of a great son to the house, learning love to be part of all those things left home to get away from, moving and moving. It shows a strange society for us in the Western world, with the feeling of the family we have lost. The story is beautiful and sad and sometimes funny and comic. He has a sense of realism that we do not seem to see anymore in our western films. <br /> <br /> The representation is unusual, since as the movie progresses, it gives almost the impression that it is not acting, but a documentary film of ordinary people. This is great at directing and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I like to see more movies for this director.
