I love this TV series so much. It contains animations that are interesting and beautiful. I can not believe they stopped playing the TV, and also I did not know if cybersix and data7 were dying or not, they seemed to have survived, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was the best TV show ever. I know it's too late to hope to start the series again, so I'm really happy to see it. I loved it so much about women in cybersix, they are not human. She goes along with Adrian Seldman, a high school teacher. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she masquerades only as a man in the day. By night, cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A person named Von reichter is the person who created cybersix, and once he is alive, he uses everything he can to capture it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it before, download it completely. It was the best television show in the world. Why did they cut it ???? Some people have problems. But I'm glad I saw the 13 episodes.
