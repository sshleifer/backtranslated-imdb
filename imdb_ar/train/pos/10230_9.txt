People forget that there have been many riots in King Kong - Congo, King Kong v. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all tear each other apart, but YETI stands on its own. They borrow only one element from King Kong, which is to attract animals with one female. <br /> <br /> The myth of YETI is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and the archaeologists were fascinated at the same time, but there is no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but worth watching. The first time I saw her was "Elvira's the Dark Shows" in the early 1980s. I sent chills in my head as a child, especially when YETI was hit by insanity. I saw her again, around 1:00 am on ABC Channel about 2 to 3 years ago. Her vision once again made me appreciate her more, having some good effects (in time) and the story includes a mute boy and his dog, and a wicked businessman who wants to kill YETI for his own purposes. The music is also wonderful, like YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and The Yetian create a great beast like the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The sound of 7 and a half out of 10.
