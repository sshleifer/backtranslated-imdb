Valuable production and powerful performances in this direct modification of Jane Austen's satirical comedy about the marriage game within and between seasons in the 18th century county in England. Both Northam and Paltrow are a useful combination as friends who must pass through jealousy and lies to discover they love each other. Good humor is a sustainable virtue that goes a long way toward clarifying access to the source of old material (which has been somewhat mitigated by its harsh skepticism). I liked the look of the film and how the footage was prepared, and I thought it did not depend much on the sequel of head shots like most other movies in the 1980s and 1990s. Very good results
