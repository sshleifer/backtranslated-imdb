I have seen the last half of this movie about a year ago and I was very happy to find it available on DVD. I have recently seen many of the PBS series on livestock raising, and so on. None of them came close to telling the story as this film does. Based on real reality, non-punches, bleak, happy, tragic and enlightening, this film should be presented to students or anyone interested in early life. As well as good representation by Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell to a good scenario. The inaugural credit states that despite the funds provided through the National Fund for Humanities. If this is the type of product taxes you can go to, I'll be happy to see more. I highly recommend it and encourage people to tell a friend if you've seen it and enjoyed the movie.
