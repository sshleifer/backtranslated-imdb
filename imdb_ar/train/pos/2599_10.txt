Having enjoyed the highly complex Joyce story, I was ready to be disappointed by the scenario of Joseph Streck and Fred Heinz, given the remarkable complexity of the original text. However, it has been shown that the film was very well done and accurately translated into the book's tone, nature and speed. <br /> <br /> It certainly helps to read the original before the movie is shown. I imagine that the latter seems disjointed, with very strange loops that seem to be randomly combined, without prereading the text to help understand the plot. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see how filthy "film" is, given that it was filmed in Dublin in 1967. Finally, censorship of Irish films was banned only for viewing by the general public in Ireland in late 2000 (Shown to the restricted audience at a private film club, the Irish Film Theater, in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not just natural and wonderful, it offers many "harmful" episodes. I do not mind that many of these idols were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - were still completely taboo when the film was produced in 1967. <br /> <br /> It is amazing and encouraging to watch the cream of Irish acting in the 1960s The last century, all respectable players, dare to pronounce and enact the text of Joyce's vastly divergent with such zeal. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
