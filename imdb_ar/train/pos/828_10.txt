I noticed that there is new hope and an empire coming back to the top ten, but this film is not even in the top 100 people. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are many reasons why you like this movie: <br /> <br /> -San Han Solo from Jaba: This official concludes Han Solo's plot A sub-debt was established when we first met the new character Amal. <br /> <br /> - The Emperor was re-annulled: Well, this may not work well after the Berkul became outside, but this is the first time we have seen the Emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Well, so this was a moment of special effects. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! <br /> <br /> - Part III of the Peak: 1) The Battle of Indore (Led by Han and Liya) 2) Luke confronts his father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Death of the Second Death Star (Lando Moment) > <br /> - Final celebration with our heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of waste because of Ewoks but I think it is nice that while the whole galaxy is celebrating the fall of the empire, our heroes are having their own party in the forest with each other. <br /> <br /> In the end it was all a wonderful final chapter for our heroes and an appropriate end to the story of Star Wars.
