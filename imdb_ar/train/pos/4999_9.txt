We got to this show late - I think it was the third and last episode, when I first saw it - and it was a social comment that American television has not seen since 'Everybody in the Family'. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that CBS operated this in the first place. <br /> <br /> This just means to say the last time CBS "has a set" - if you know what I mean - returned to the "All in the Family" day. The most controversial decision they are prepared to address today is the amount of makeup that should be put on Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to really work a group of people, you are really crazy - let them discover the truth about themselves. If you want them to be ready to pull strings, make calls and remove artwork, let them discover this fact by hearing their own words from their mouths. <br /> <br /> Always Aardman has always been watching the road before the curve. This exhibition is no different. Somehow they sneak down under the corporate / social / political / censorship radar in CBS to put it in the table (maybe the Big Copper never saw it until it was finally broadcast), but once you hear the good "ol ol merika" And they saw themselves - well, they could bet on the farm that would not last long, or would not write it. <br /> <br /> Now, if the "Lost Loops" are the only ones that can access Usenet or bit torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Belly Kalla Tallahassee Fla
