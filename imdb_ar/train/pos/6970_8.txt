This is one of those movies / pilots that if you know BattleStar Galactica, this is useful, but it is not necessary. What makes this story more believable than the BSG is that this is not something far in the future. This has such a great depth that it is amazing that it was not staged. Prospective clients can not be better selected in these experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is as wonderful as a father who will do something to reunite with his daughter no matter how real or not and will do so no matter what the cost. Paula Malcomson of fame "Deadwood" is as wonderful as his wife as well. You are not quite sure of his motives whether they are love or money or both, but that's what makes this pilot more interesting. I see a star in the Zoe industry performed by Alessandra Torisani and relatively unknown performance. Asai Morales is wonderful in his desire to see his loved ones again and how wrong he is to think of what he wants most of his moral objections. I did not think this would be a good idea when it was advertised but from the pilot alone I was thrilled to see how we got to the story of the BSG stage. It is wonderful to see Adama as a child affected and already affected by the various types of robots that have begun to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep up with the stories so we can learn more about how they get robots written by Humanoid. This pilot is almost perfect and I hope they can continue to tell wonderful stories. Even visual effects are better than most waste you see on the big screen. If you have not entered BSG, at least try to do so, I bet you will become a fan and you will want to see how the BSG story became.
