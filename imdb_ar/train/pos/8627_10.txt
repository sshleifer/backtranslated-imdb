my Lord ! The Buttgereit masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen. Closer to the films Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, this film is really disturbing but not as outrageous as Nekromantiks. All the little stories have a deep philosophical interest and the output is completely innovative, despite the lack of money (see drawing "Bridge"). strongly recommended!
