One of my favorite films so far begins as an adventure across the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living in the Cholawas River before turning into a lake comes from Louis Burt Reynold, whose children unconsciously sank into the worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film is like an action film, the second half carries the scenes in a completely different story, where our men have to decide that they "know" will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the film, everyone will have to deal with the scars of what should have been a weekend just on the river, but kidnapped in a battle to survive. The film (except for some very obvious idiots) is very well directed and beautifully photographed in the nature garden that steals your breath. Photography is excellent as well. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all excellent at showing how one event can destroy in different ways four different lives associated with just the same error.
