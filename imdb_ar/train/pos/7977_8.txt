Basically, the film may be one of the most flattering titles of any making of Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's make it straight, the movie deserves hype as one of the most exciting / exciting actors ever. <br /> <br /> When it comes to disgruntled heroes, Denzel makes Washington and Tony Scotts perfect. Both this movie and Deja Vu are the best thriller movies you can expect. Washington has become very comfortable in shaky cameras and all the scenes in the film. One can easily relate to his or her own feelings, so I have enjoyed all the murders on the road. They have succeeded in creating a dark Mexican city with many events. One can easily be persuaded by the extent of corruption in the film "Man on Fire". I do not know what the Mexicans will think when they see this ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's face it again. He is among the best types of Death Wish, but he also suffered a great deal of violence. It's a bit annoying that they justify the behavior of a guard by making the film very realistic and allow Denzel Washington to play the kind of "lost sheep" of the tragic hero. In the end, they even shot the hijacker in his swimming pool like a documentary. I would check IMDb if the film is based on real events ... so, if you find that the theme of the film is a bit fake. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hope no one will actually take this film. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for Technical Direction / Editing / Cinematography / Denzel Washington.
