This is what I call film growth. Each character is different and better in the end - it's all because one woman knows that the place he chose is "Love Basin". Josie Lawrence, famous for comedy, really shines as a woman bringing all these changes. Even men in this film move from self-centered to better men. The book remains very faithful to the novel, a plus in my book, because I am a librarian. A breathtaking sight and a true love message.
