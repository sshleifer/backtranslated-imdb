It is a strange story, but somewhat impressive, about love. Personally, I never do such a story in real life. But, I can be there. <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. But after seeing him, I did not feel this "sickness" that I would certainly feel about the rules of society. It's a beautiful thing in this film ... something impressive ... I can not contradict it using any moral or community rules. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mostly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins and develops and ends in the end. You feel the moment the blossoms of this love, the first whispers, touches. Feel the connection. Not a moment I am though this is immoral. So you hope it will not collapse in the end ... You can not break ... That's not true. You feel the pain of being broken in the end ... <br /> <br /> But I also need to add a negative spin on this comment ... I do not know if the story is not somehow * shown * to give the feeling that these relationships are only sick In shape, but not in content. You do not have the full story, but only fragments. When the film begins, the relationship between Keke and Sando was already there. Therefore, no idea about the nature of the relationship. Just feel the tension between them ... Fight between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line from Kiki to Sandu says: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you'll do what I ask you." <br /> <br /> This film is likely to raise some questions about what love is and what is moral ... and where is the limit between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love conquers everyone ... even social and moral standards" or "lovely love ... no matter how and where." But in my opinion, this film has already achieved success for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
