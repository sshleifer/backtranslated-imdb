When I was young, I saw a few films. My father in all their wisdom hired this one. I was very careful about what the film was about, in fact I was not allowed to watch it. I got my brother and sister of course and this made me very angry. So what did you do? Late at night, your VCR was shattered! I kicked the TV screen in and called the police and reported the vandals. I was arrested. Of course, I could not get my feet out of the television set before the police arrived. I have just received a stern interview and was sent to my house. My father, of course, founded me and made me pay for the debts of the television and VCR. I was torn by this, and the slave's work really sucked me, but I had to. Home business throughout the home. What happened in the end? We got a large screen TV, a DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did you get the money? Easy I made my own movies and sold them to Disney! Do you remember "Finding Nino"? Well I've written this movie and photographed golden fish in their fish tanks! They have, of course, rewritten the plot and done it in the CGI because they can not make it a real real picture like I did! In the end I did not watch The Head, which did not die, and my rating is my life rating! It's very good!
