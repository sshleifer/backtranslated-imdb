Although this was a disaster at the box office, it is my favorite film. It gives a strong message from the family. She has a lot of violence and has one song with a group of girls in bikinis. Compared to other Bollywood movies, the scenes in this film are more realistic. It is a wonderful combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather, Amitabh will portray it in this film. Do not read the views of the critic, they are only ignorant. This film contains a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially movement. So if you want to see a more realistic action from Main Hoon Na (a good movie yet), this is the movie.
