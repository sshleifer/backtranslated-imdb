I do not watch too much TV, except the office, weeds, soup E! I think I'm making this offer in a good company. <br /> <br /> I like the sharp review of pop culture offered by this show. Soup also helps me stay at the top of what people in the office are talking about when talking about Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Soup presents a breaker of the most important things. The presentations, which are usually the most exciting or controversial moments (come on, most people are linked to watching American Idol because of the strange performances that represent the tests), which is why most people claim to see it. This means that I do not have to suffer through 98% of brainstorming programs or "reality" programs, for one block of "funny" or "shocking". The only reason for not getting Soup on my 10 is that the graphics are not funny at times, and in a more rare occasion, the comment is not always equal. But they can not all be running the house too, if so, Soup will not be in the E! I enjoyed the laughter and crew comments outside the camera. Even when it is blatantly clear by making some laugh out of courtesy, it is fun because it is forced. It is obviously a paradox. This part makes this presentation funny.
