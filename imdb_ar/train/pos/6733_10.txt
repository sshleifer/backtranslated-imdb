There was a series of recent movies to surf which I seem to be displaying randomly without warning. I've caught this treasure on the digital cable this week and have been pleasantly surprised! The focus is on the 60-year-old Grand Knoll riders to the current Laird Hamilton, from the Bay of Weymouth to the Mavericks to Veky. Hell, I could watch a movie about Laird Hamilton - one of the great athletes of this generation - and so the rest is just gravy. There are plenty of good waves blended with interviews with past and present ski stars, in a nice, relaxed and simple style. Of all the surfing movies I have seen, the story of the Big Wave is best, and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
