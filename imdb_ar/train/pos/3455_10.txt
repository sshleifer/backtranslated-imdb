Steven Spielberg, 24, produced two wonderful episodes of the 1971 series "The Psychiatrist," starring Roy Theness. One episode was about a 12-year-old boy suffering from emotional disorders and the other was about a lifelong young man (Chloe Gallagher in his best performance) who died of cancer. Both cases were spectacular, visually unlike anything else on television, emotionally complex and adult. The creators of "Psychologist" are Richard Levinson and William Link, who created the film "Colombo" and also produced their first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on first place, and experienced film directors insisted on the first season of Colombo, such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smith. But Falk agreed to Spielberg after watching part of the episode of Chloe Gallagher of the "psychiatrist." <br /> <br /> Spielberg says in the DVD on "Duel" that he loved Steven Boshko's "Kill Through the Book" (based on the Levinson / Link story) and tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature, He has much less money to work with. <br /> <br /> This episode of "Columbo" is far more visually appealing and uses the soundtrack and background music better than any "Columbo" episode, although the series has always been used by the best directors. Spielberg is trying to keep both Falk and Cassidy away from being too much trouble, but both players are quite pleased. Spielberg also gets good support from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All offers have freshness and vitality about them. The only Colombo episode that was about to be well directed is "By Dawn's Early Light" with Patrick McGowan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" "This episode of" Columbo "indicates that Spielberg did not technically develop all that as a director. 1962 Albert Al-Salemi starring Robert Altman says the episode was as good as it got as a director.
