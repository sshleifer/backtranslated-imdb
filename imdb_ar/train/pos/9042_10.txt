I think I read this somewhere: Joe Johnston (the film director and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic to work in the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers or something that was raising their minds for the nickname was "Rocket Boys" I think) lacks something. <br /> <br /> One day they were traveling with a computer program that consisted of words from other words (i.e., you type a word or a string of words and it blends the letters up and forms other words) I think the technical term is "anagram" <br /> < Anyway, they've written in "Rocket Boys" and certainly enough is "October October". I was shocked at the very least. The title summed up everything in the film because the film revolves around Sputnik. At first Homer did not like the idea, but he used it after the appearance of the "novel film poster" and the castle.
