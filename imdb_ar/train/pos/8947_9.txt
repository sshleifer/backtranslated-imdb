Kim Novak is a witch on the deadly mistress Gus, and her choice of James Stewart. Broadway comedy comedy coloring, filmed by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and performed by a sterling crew. Ernie Kovacs is as wonderful as the writer Redlitch always blended. I love this movie, although few others. Kim alone makes him a winner in my book. Ha! My film # 5 of 1958.
