It is a very interesting project and can be very impressive. Collect 11 prominent international directors and assign each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and one frame to create a part of their choice; each briefly exploring the global echo of September 11th. Without using any spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach's piece is the jewel of the crown, and the story of Mira Nair ("India"), based on a true story, deserves to become a full feature film. One also realizes, while watching his story, why is Alejandro Gonz√°lez Inarrito one of the best directors in the world today? He is simply the master of the mediator, who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well. Youssef Chahine, in his piece "Egypt", assumes the Arab position of the collective guilt he caused, which is perhaps the most interesting piece. It failed miserably. The story of Shaheen is poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among the other superior chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I still give the film 7/10 of the concept, if not executable.
