If yes, you should enjoy this great movie. I just saw him two hours ago here in Paris (where the film is going on) and I still feel the shock I received in the back of my eyes ... what a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black-and-white picture and such a radical change in the way cartoon films have been. I strongly believe in the "Renaissance" before and after, as we have seen with Pixar films or the Akira and Gustine Schill experiments. This is a real achievement in the small animated film world, and I hope that this French initiative (a small French studio unknown to some young people who have had a dream called "Renaissance") will have the success and recognition it deserves. Long live France!
