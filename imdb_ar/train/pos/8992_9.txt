Really gorgeous flick. Must imitate any music. You do not really have to know the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the film, I only heard two songs from Dandy Warhols. The only thing you need is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the Brian Johnston massacre. Dandy Warhols plays a role in the film, as a "rival band", but he ranks second in the BJM. Dandy Warhols does not play a big role in the film as I thought at first, but again, they did not have the element of excitement and unpredictability BJM. And her very attractive man, Anton Newcomb. It is in itself a documentary film and a study about the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy it.
