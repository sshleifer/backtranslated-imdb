I thought Moxin had written beautifully. Not just for entertainment. There are tons of exact messages that I think Yasmin was trying to deliver. And yes, it may be confusing to some of you (especially if you do not see Sepet and / or Gubra for 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet how they noticed how to use characters from both films right? Its really ironic how you relate to characters. Like a domineering neighbor that is a whore of Gubra. It turns out that snooker chick is the religious and wife of religious man in the future. <br /> <br /> I really like the audio amounts. Raw so far awake fresh. Like, when they took a shot from Rumah Tumpangan Gamin's plate, Mukhsin's voice was suddenly saying "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (scene when the tree climbed). <br /> <br /> He has taken Malaysia's position (and moderately, breathing on how pathetic it is) in character. For example, even children can be sharp tongues (complete with a very annoying voice) and simply the bad mouth intends every long film. And how you can be such a busy person and talk about a ppl, when your life is not settled. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this film reached my expectation completely if it was not exceeded. <br /> <br /> He kept me attached to the screen, and I could not even keep my eyes away from her. Not even made in the cinema. Ha ha.
