I went to a "straight story" I expect a sad / happy genre with a nice direction and some good acting. These got. What I did not expect was symbolic of the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300-mile trip to weed and turn it into a miniature model of the human condition. <br /> <br /> If you do not notice it, see it again, paying attention to the ages of the two thousand people, the terrain he leads, the reactions people give him, the types of discussions he has conducted (one of which concerns pregnancy and children, Cemetery). The last way he walks down is particularly haunted in this context, where his fear and fanaticism are narrowing. The last mechanical failure can be considered a death, a miraculous rebirth of his engine for the afterlife, where he achieves the desired inclusion. <br /> <br /> I just hope that some people who have described it as slow-paced melodrama take the time to watch more thoroughly.
