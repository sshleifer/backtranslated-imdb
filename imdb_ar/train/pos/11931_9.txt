This film was first class with first class reps. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Joseph Gordon Levitt, especially Christopher Lloyd, have a wonderful role in this fascinating film about real-life angels who help the Angels baseball team. You never know, it can happen. Loved the role of Lloyd in it. It was hilarious. The story revolves around changing your life, where the child's belief in angels helped to change the direction of the angry, the crucifixion, and the director relieved Glover sees the best in people. The film was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching out to your dreams. It was funny, charming, moving, and sad, all very well. You will love (or love) it. I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
