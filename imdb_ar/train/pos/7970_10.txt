This movie is definitely on the top 10 favorites list. The sounds of the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox is as wonderful as wild cats and little bush who lacks experience, but the real lead is Don Amichi as an old Golden Retriever insured. This movie is a wonderful family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. Sense of humor and suspense, guaranteed to make all animal lovers cry! (Happy Tears!)
