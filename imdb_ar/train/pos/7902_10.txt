The film is exceptional in a gay icon and extends this beyond the aesthetics of music and actors. Throughout the film, there is a childlike wonder as shown through the eyes of the main character. Her enlightening on the world around us is comical and beautiful. Somehow it is a farce film for girls. Watch this is you fancy nighttime entertaining movie. Buy this if you love the difference in the world of media and love together (?).
