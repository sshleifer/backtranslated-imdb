"Lion King 1 1/2" is the most unusual version of Disney. I recently watched this film again after not seeing it for many years. I remember the first time I saw her and I had no expectations at all and was pleasantly surprised by this very enjoyable and enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" was not quite bad, it has suffered from some problems: lack of good text and bad descriptions, making the effect otherwise is fine. <br /> <br /> Anyway: it's good to see Timon and Pumba's characters thriving again in the way we liked it (or I'm sure) in this film; in Simba's Pride, they were quite annoying and did not like Timon's series and Pumbaa "as well. <br /> <br /> It could have been a stupid film easily, but fortunately the directors did not take a wrong turn and focused instead to make the film sometimes very hilarious. There are some jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. The result is very good. There are two new songs, two new entrants, Amy Timon, (expressed by Julie Cavner Marge Simpsons) and Uncle Max, and it's fun. The friendship between Timon and Bumba is portrayed. Emotional scenes are well integrated into the comedy story and do not feel misplaced, which they could easily do (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there something that distracts the attention of this image from 10 votes from me? Yes there. Although it fortunately does not affect much, I will mention it: 1. Many of the first movie scenes are used in this film. Personally, it was strange to see old scenes integrated with new scenes. <br /> <br /> 2. During the peak, some jokes become lame. <br /> <br /> 3. A story, this is Timon's story, and although filmmakers are trying to integrate his story with Simba, it makes the script feel a little rushed at times. <br /> <br /> But hey, these details do not affect this fun movie otherwise. It's the only truly accepted Disney sequel, which must be in every set of movies.
