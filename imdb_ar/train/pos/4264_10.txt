I have come across this movie twice or more and found it well! The Second World War ended recently and the so-called "Cold War" was about to begin. Thus, this film can be defined as one of the best "propaganda", national films that prepare Americans, and second, people from the "Western NATO bloc" that still have to be formed in countries to face the next danger. The film celebrates the power of the United States, over the centuries, while exposing itself to the current war that has just ended. Nice and funny is the way to describe Columbus to explore the American continent and the beautiful "ring" of New Amsterdam and buy Manhattan from a drunken local Indian .. You should see it (at least once, for the intriguing fashion of Time Advertising)! :)
