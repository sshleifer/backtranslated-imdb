I hired this film from a famous film ... I loved Alan Arkin and the cover was catching ... I read the back and I knew immediately that it would be the best or worst movie I've ever seen ... I think I'm lucky .. I laughed from start to finish .. Alan Arkin Brings great personality to this movie. I have since bought a used rental version of my own collection and watched it all the time. I have prepared this movie for many people and enjoyed it a lot as I did ... I see complaints about menus and DVDs functions .. but it does not take away from the movie .. It was written Disk for Exculsivley Blockbuster This is why they did not allow you to skip past previews .. Apart from that you should not let the DVD functions to prevent you from watching the excellent movie.
