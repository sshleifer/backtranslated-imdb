It's not the same as other movies about dancing. A few ordinary people found themselves out of dance. Unlike Hollywood dance films, the characters in this film are not young, handsome or warm. They are someone you may see every day in your office. They are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams of dancing. This touches me deeply.
