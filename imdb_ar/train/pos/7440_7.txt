Just watched the movie, and the scary thing was that the people who talked during the movie looked like actors. The film took its moments, but it was also delayed and was somewhat ill. It was supposed to be a farce, but once you see pathetic people's life in the movie, you think to yourself "people like them all around us". All attempts to get public sympathy fade away, with actors doing something stupid after another. On the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I'll wait for the video, but it was a good laugh. Warning - Jerry takes off his shirt during the film !! (Not a nice sight!)
