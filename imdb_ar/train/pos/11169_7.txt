When I saw the film at first I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all the terrible things started, it happened as if the church had died and it was brought back to life and also Gage and his mother died bringing them back to life even though he warns of warnings and ignores Jud.this is not Stephen's best king . I thought that his best work was shining. I do not think the people who watched this movie and the commentary on how horrible it was was wrong because all they thought was what they were thinking. As if this person could do a better job in the flick of terror. I mean make an evil gage and how to kill Jud is a genius. Making the most innocent character most unsuspecting to one of the murderers is wonderful. People who do not like the movie are stupid because everything is a scary movie and not everything. Do not expect anything from the film no. It was still in the general area was not so good. I still recommend people watching the movie
