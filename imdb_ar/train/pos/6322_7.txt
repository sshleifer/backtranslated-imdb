This movie has been recommended to me by a friend. I never saw an ad or a trailer, so I did not know Clooney was there and I was not bothered by the fact that his role was too small. I thought the whole crew was right, and found the film very enjoyable, in general. The opening scene, with a small band of bandits standing on the side of the road, looking at it with whip and irony, immediately caught my attention. She had a way to tell you, "Do not go away; this will not be boring," and not. I turned into an interesting and light hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat until the end, but when I finally arrived, I felt a little cheating .... a little bit. The events continue to increase so that you expect them to continue to build, but at a point I can not identify, it is a kind of level, making the end a little disappointing. I think I was expecting a big blast from the peak, but it turned out to be somewhat of a low key. If you watch a movie with that in mind and you can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this click very amusing and worth watching. Now I would like to see the original Big Deal in Madonna Street, but this is probably a rare discovery in the United States.
