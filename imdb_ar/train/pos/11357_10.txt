"Citizen X" is the real story that was told in a wonderful way about the search for one of the worst armed killers in history. What makes this story more persuasive is where and when: the Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Mild Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Victor Burakov (played brilliantly by Steven Ria) is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the Rostov Oblast Militia. Detects past and current murders, apparently by the same person. The murders have not been resolved because no one has ever been able to investigate the evidence correctly. He is driven to find and stop the murderer. His only tools are dedication, skill and honesty. Its obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet regime that does not encourage the search for truth. His naivete would have led to failure had it not been for his boss, Colonel Mikhail Vetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is an intelligent political cynic who realizes the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares the desire of Burakov to bring a murderer to justice, even if the party's official line is "There are no armed killers in the Soviet Union!" The cast is wonderful. Sites and groups are the perfect recreation for Soviet life on the last day. Randy Edelman's grade is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both severity and stalemate. This film was produced by HBO Films and has become a great source of films that have never been produced.
