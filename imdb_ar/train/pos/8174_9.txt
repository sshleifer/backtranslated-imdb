I like this film. As a child, this was one of the first films I saw that made me escape. Sure, the atmosphere is mild now, but the day was great. Dentists are one thing many people fear, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, and sometimes it's scary, but it's wonderful. I have always loved medical horror. Corbin Persen plays the role of Dr. Finston ideally, no one could do better. For a low budget horror film, the effects and such things are very good. I also love the music, it goes well with the film. Ken Furey (Dawn of the Dead) is also in this one plays a curious cop, and does a good job. There is a fair amount of blood, and some really wonderful torture / death scenes. Check this one out!
