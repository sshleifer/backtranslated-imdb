I sat this movie on my Tivo for several weeks before watching it. I'm afraid the flick about yuppie loosening about relationships went bad. I was wrong; it was an arduous journey in the novels of New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> The coordination is the same as the format of Max LaFonde, based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler, who got "inspired" credit. Begins from one person, a prostitute, standing on the corner of a street in Brooklyn. It was taken by the house contractor, who fucked her on the hood, but could not come. He refuses to pay it. When he stops urinating, he answers his cell phone and receives a message. She runs away with his keys. <br /> <br /> Then the story goes to the contractor, who pays a professional call to a bored woman in New York, plays with him until she gets angry, then pulls away. . I told him how desperate and unhappy she was; telling her how beautiful and lucky she was. While leaving, she wonders if he will have sex with her. She sits on top of him and bounces up and down. This time he comes, leaves. <br /> <br /> The wife and husband are having a dinner party for their modern friends. Hubby talks about his business, and Ellen is bored, the subject changes to sex, and the number of times men and women think about it. Switch the conversation switch to the desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to seduce Robert to have sex. Robert does not want anything from him, and puts a record of jazz. Ellen turns to the radio; Robert lifts the music. Ellen turns to television; Robert turns on another TV. Caused by cunning. Ellen rises to the surface and joins Robert. Ellen recognizes that she needs to experience more men, than men other than Robert. Robert says he also needs to experience men. <br /> <br /> Robert then goes on to visit our artist, Martin, played by Steve Bossemi. I hope Buscemi plays more roles like this, as he is a very sexy, intelligent and desirable man. Robert praises Martin's work, more than he deserves, preparing to come to a show. Martin excited, until it turned out that Robert was talking from his thigh, all this is mating dance. Robert tries to kiss Martin, on his lips, and Martin retreats, saying he is not gay. Robert asserts that he is not gay too, Martin mocks. Both admit that the artwork is bad. Robert is about to leave, when Martin allows Robert to accept him. They go out, and Robert comes down from Martin. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Martin, as he prepares for a show at the Manhattan Show. He is fond of receptionist, Anna, played by Rosario Dawson (I had to cut some of this review to keep him less than 1000 words) ... and they love each other. <br /> <br /> Later we follow Anna, who is sitting in the lunch stand. Her boyfriend Nick (Adrian Grenier) enters and holds flowers. She is cool towards him. Trying to find out why. He convinces the information that he has sex with someone while in San Francisco. I convinced him that he had stayed with his ex-wife while in San Francisco, and had sex with her. It turns out that the last revelation is a lie. The two of them make a luncheon, but decide they have to break up. Nick is sad. <br /> <br /> We follow Nick, who admits his problems to an elderly woman he meets on a lawn bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is a kind of weirdness and child, but he is a good audience for Nick, who needs a sympathetic ear. The two go to Connie Island at night, and look at the stars. Nick is under an aerial mantra, despite the age difference between them. They return to an air apartment, and Nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman. She is on his head, do not want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (By the way, Carol Kane's best role since she played the role of Latk's wife in a taxi). Joey's phone rings, a man who connects to the network of mental friends. , And Joy is a psycho friend. Although she still suffers from Nick, she gradually progresses in her mental power. The man in his office, late at night, wants to have sex with her. Although this is not an aerial affair, Joey is on his way and is persuading the man to come. She wants to keep talking, although the man wants to get out of the phone, and discovers he has siphoned off a lot of money from his company and will be discovered tomorrow. His life was destroyed. Joey realizes that the man will commit suicide, that she tries to make him think he is his friend, and that she cares about him. She cares about him. <br /> <br /> But the man puts a gun in his travel bag and starts looking for a prostitute on Brooklyn's waterfront, and back to the beginning, to the same bitch that started out of Rond. She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if she is killed. He tried to kill himself, but he could not do it. The prostitute does not want to do that, but he insists, holding her hand, holding the weapon in his mouth, and telling her where she wants. Eventually, the gun explodes, and we see the bitch walking down the street, up to the corner where she usually works. The contractor who did not pay her earlier in the film rises, rolling out the window. They look at each other. End.
