For a long time fans of Red Sox, I had to go watch the movie. It was great! Although there could not be enough live footage from the 2004 Red Sox miracle season, there were wonderful shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the movie is definitely a flick about the chick, it contains enough footage of baseball from the spectacular Red Sox 2004 return to make it one of the top 10 films of all time. I especially enjoyed Red Sox lovers who were part of the Ben Pispol family. The scene where Ben meets his comrades on the day of the contest to determine who will get seats in some games is fun! You should know if you are looking for a useful movie to watch with your spouse, your history or anything else important ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more especially if you love Red Sox !!!
