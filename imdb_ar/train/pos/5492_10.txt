I was touched by Chavez's position on globalization at some point now, but I did not realize what he really achieved until I saw the film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival. This film tells the story of a coup / conspiracy by the Venezuelan elite, oil companies and corrupt oil-loving Western governments, to remove the democratically elected President Chavez, and to bring Venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship. This film is necessary for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I commend the people of Venezuela for doing it with their hands and for saving their country, such as Halliburton and the Bush regime.
