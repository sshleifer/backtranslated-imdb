This film appears on the surface as if it revolves around J. Edgar Hoover, who gives himself a great chance to fight Klansmen, hunt down Indian killers, chase famous gangsters in the 1930s, fight Nazis in the United States and South America during World War 2 and Commies in New York during early 1950. Of course, in 1959, we did not know about Mr. Hoover's obsession to keep secret files on honest Americans, tapping people like Rev. Martin Luther King Jr, but worst of all, his secret love relationship with his deputy director Clyde Tulson if you want to know More on this subject, I suggest seeing a movie Citizen Citin universe. Hoover aside, this is a life story in the FBI as Jimmy Stewart has reported it makes for a decent, but dated film. Vera Miles as his sincere wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As far as Hoover is concerned with production and always making sure to watch the FBI without a mistake, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human aspect, which is a remarkable achievement because Hoover was always looking for his shoulder. The background score is also enjoyable. I have read recent online articles indicating that this film is forgotten. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show for a long time and I hope to show it again.
