This second part was excellent - the best since the series came back. Sure, parts of the story were planned from previous films, but what television programs are doing these days. What we got here was a good science fiction story. A great monster (really scary) imprisoned in the base of a deep hole, some of the great foreigners in The Ood - the best "new" aliens featured in the series, a group of mainly sympathetic and sympathetic human figures (with two " Star Trek), and some extensive philosophical topics (love, allegiance, faith, etc.), and some special effects with a higher staircase. <br /> <br /> I love every minute of this.
