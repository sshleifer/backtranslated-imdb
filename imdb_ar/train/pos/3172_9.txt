for the first time? Wow-Cross-Eyed is easily one of the most interesting indie movies I've seen in the past year, making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the first film by the author. I mean - you have logged in to IMDb to find more movies by this writer ... because Cross Eyed has this unique signature - you want to see what this author might say. These days, it is rare to see a well-written, well-directed, well-edited and well-represented film. For me - Cross Eyed intersects with what filmmaking should be - combining the best elements of the film to create a smart, artistic and moving story. More please.
