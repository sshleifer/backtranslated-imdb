I do not dare say that this film is better than the original, but it is very good in itself. The comedy in this film is as good as the original film, there are many scenes that make me laugh just thinking. <br /> <br /> The story in this film is even stranger than the original, but that's what makes it so big. Peter Hewitt is doing a great job directing this film with a wonderful song. The group of actors returns from the original film to their characters in this film and they all do great work with their roles. I do not care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a wonderful actor! I really enjoyed filming Ted in both films as I did with Alex Winter's Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin return to the role of Rufus, so wonderful! Hull London Junior, who plays Ted Logan's father, does a really good job. The scene in which Ted has the body of his parents and the London Hull starts acting like Ted is a wonderful sight, and he pulls it off impressively well. I can not forget William Sadler's death, he made the film entirely for me. The rest of the staff is also very good. <br /> <br /> If you like the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, I hope you will also wish this movie. But, do not expect to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
