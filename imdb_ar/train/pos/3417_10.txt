Before seeing this, I was touched by the subject, but this is not your usual victory over the story of adversity. Although this is technically related to the rise of blind Tibetan children to Mt. Everest, there is much more. This film features very powerful and often contradictory characters of two blind adults leading children, Eric and Sabri. Erik is a mountain climber / American blind athlete and Sabri German blind academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. Both are exceptional in their own way, but they differ on what can truly build confidence in children. Eric wants them to come to the top while Sabri wants them to enjoy Eric as a role model and are happy at the moment. The nuances are complex and no one is sure to be right or if climbing is all a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before finding their way to school. The most interesting story for me was the story of Tashi, a poor teenager who grew up in the streets after being abandoned by his parents. I was able to watch a full movie about his life and I was happy to learn that thanks to the school, he now runs a successful small company with some fellow students. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love this.
