Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, a South Street pick-up is a tough, brutal and well-made film about the young man (Richard Widmark) who unintentionally plans to make a highly secretive microfilm and become a target for spy agents. Jean Peters is also involved in a massive role played by her former lover Richard Kelly as a courier. It is the Noir film at its best and although the performances are very good, the great personal actress Tilma Ritter is the one who steals the movie. As a street vendor selling neckties (which also sells information), she is wonderful in her role, which brought her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Ms. Ritter has been nominated six times for the Academy Award and has never won. This should have been the role that he stopped for her!
