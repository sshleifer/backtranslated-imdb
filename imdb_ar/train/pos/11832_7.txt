It's time to brag, eh: I thought Spirit was great to see. However, there were some things that would prevent me from rating them higher than 6 or 7 (I'll be a little vine with seven). <br /> <br /> Point # 1: Matt Damon makes me mad. I was thinking, "What a cocky voice they have for the main character," when I first heard her tell - then realized that she had died Damon. The man was very annoying to me - his performance in the film "The Departures" was terrible and ruined the film for me (before the film had a chance to destroy itself, but this is another story for a while), as I did "spirit." The story is actually ... Thank God. <br /> <br /> Point No. 2: Brian Adams absorbs ... The whole result was awful ... The songs were non-native, generic, and poorly executed; I never found the music I was thinking that I would start hearing some national propaganda that slipped into my words. (I could not help but remember those awful national songs being played on the radio continuously after September 11.) In the light of the original American aspects of the film, they should have gone to the right music using the right tools, not the small insults they provoke Radios, teenagers and 14-year-old girls - I thought I was back in high school, I can not believe it could not be done - I refuse it. If that were not the case, the film would have been rated more with Disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (well, do not bother saying what I know some of you may think;). Too bad, it's a shame they were not able to hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I loved art and animation, except for some things here and there ... like sometimes the corners appear very sharp on the face and the lines are too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines are mainly near the finish). There were often times when I thought they were trying hard - emotion and facial expressions and failed to draw any real emotion. But there were also times of intense emotion. Anyway, many scenes were lazy and the classes were clear. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm sleeping here so I'll summarize it before I start feeling less ... <br /> <br /> Nice attempt on an epic film ... It turned out mediocre. Matt Damon, you suck!
