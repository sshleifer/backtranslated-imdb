Of all the break / hip hop films released between 1983 and 1986, Beat Street 1984 is undoubtedly the best. The story follows the story of DJ, his younger brother, the graffiti artist and promoter who wants to go to Chopis during the winter when they try to get out of the ghetto using their talents "in the streets." The representation is not always equal and the characters are not entirely drawn, but they are compensated more through direct dialogue, a sensible story, wonderful sequences of dance and an immortal hip hop track. The film was filmed in the hometown of the Break Dance ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!"), And features the likes of Break Dance, Rock Stade Crew and rapper Africa Pampata. Rock Steady Crew presents the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the 80's premiere club, Roxy. Must see for hip hop fans.
