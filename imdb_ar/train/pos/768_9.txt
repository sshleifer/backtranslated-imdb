Movie, this movie stinks. As well as doing a lot of acting. But I do not care. If there is a strong representation of what it was in the 1980s <br /> <br /> (for many of us in the injustice anyway) and what is hip hop, the Zulu nation <br /> <br />, and breaking the dance I really like. Fantastic, wonderful music <br /> <br /> Dance! It looks like a documentary about a time gone by when hip hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see Niu. <br /> <br /> York looks like the zero point of a nuclear attack. Some viewers may have been too small to remember that they were poor and were in town during the 1970s and 1980s. This is the best of all Hip Hop / Break movies <br /> <br /> Dance movies that have appeared in that period. Of course, the 80s are now a joke with all the bad TV shows and movies <br /> <br />, but those of us who lived will always remember <br /> it was fondly for a while Music, dance and writings were fresh, yo!
