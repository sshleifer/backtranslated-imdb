While the number 9 may seem unusually high for such a small film, compared to hundreds and hundreds of detective films from the 1930s and 1940s, this film is among the best, and is also very much compared to Powell's later Man "Now that does not mean that the movie is similar to Thin Man films, because The KenNel MURDER CASE is not a comedy but more than a classic film to reveal ambiguity. Now you think that the absence of Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional music friend (something in all Detective films in practice) for fun would be harmful, but I never missed them This is a very unusual film - it has a really interesting case as well as excellent performances in a uniform way by everyone. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a show of dogs and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, although Philo This vance actually spends little time showing dogs and dogs is not a very important part of the film, instead killing a man who is totally hated and left in a completely closed room - an idea that is repeated in quite a few detective films (such as CREST DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE) . However, how to explain all of this seems very credible and fits together very well - which kept me interested all the time. I wish that other detective films that day were cleverly written plots and an exceptional representation of this film. This is definitely a guard.
