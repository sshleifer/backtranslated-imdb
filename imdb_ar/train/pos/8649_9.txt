I bought this a while ago but was somehow neglected to watch it until last night. I love Juliette Lewis although I am indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this presentation, I must admit that he was a perfectly good actor - his character was quite reasonable, and I did not think Brad Pitt at all. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can not say the same to David Duchovny. I liked X-Files and I had to search twice to confirm the history of this movie, and I think it was manufactured a few years later. I love Duchovny but found his character with a little dimension here, except where he is over-sounding. This part was strong, looked at his character, well embodied, and so on. Otherwise I kept thinking about the Mulder worker, which is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why did not I notice it before? (I will look to see what other roles she has done and see those as soon as possible). I am a bit concerned about the stereotypes of Lewis, this film, and Natural Born Killers (a strong favorite company). It is interesting to see a disparity in personalities - in the NBK, she is a collaborating partner, while denouncing the violence and trying very hard not to recognize the dark side of Early until he is pushed in her face. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost without reservation. Apart from Duchovny's character that does not seem to be fully composed (and may have been "washed" somewhat by Pitt's), it has been perfect. I was also happy with the result - happy because the innocent heroes did not die, yet they suffered first. It was realistic, tense and disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you may like this movie, and vice versa.
