For those of you who have read the well-respected Rohinton Mistry, this film will certainly impress you, because of how well-honored it has been. With the exception of a secondary secondary sub-display, Sturla Gunnarson's debut show is almost full book recreation (down to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie may be a bit difficult. It certainly is not a great cinematic drama. Instead, it contains a strong element of realism, but I will not own it any other way. The best way to describe such a long journey to film lovers is to say that it is a small Hindu version of "Fiddler On The Roof". Instead of a Jewish / Russian Lebanese man, protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in Bombay in the 1970s during the Muslim-Indian war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unanticipated problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his eldest son and his distant friend who makes him get involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighbor. The end is neither happy nor sad, but that is what realism entails. <br /> <br /> This long journey is a great movie, but if you want to see it, you're lucky to find it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little version.
