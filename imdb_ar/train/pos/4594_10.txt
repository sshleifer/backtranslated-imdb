Best martial arts movie ever. This film is better than anything Bruce Lee has done. Classic with an amusing climax and absolutely brutal. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the real king of the kung fu. It is very unfortunate that while Bruce Lee was too exaggerated, Jackie Chan has always asked for popularity in Europe and America. Jackie Rules!
