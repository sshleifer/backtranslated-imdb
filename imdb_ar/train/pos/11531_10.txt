I remember that I was a child when I first saw this film and it was the first horror film (maybe that's why I still can remember some parts of it). I do not remember much about acting, naked scenes or other things, but I remember that a man blew his head with a grenade, a man was cut over a tree and a man ran away in the truck and was shot: (Todd Scheffer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McBarland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister burst from the deadly stomach to get the truck keys. It's a movie that gives you a ride and deserves a look. But where do I find her? How do I download it?
