This television series was one of the things I loved when I was a kid. Although I see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, I can still say that it was a wonderful show, very educational but still funny. I have not seen the original French version, just Swedish. I have no idea how good the dubbing is, it's been a long time to remember. <br /> <br /> The introduction to the presentation was to show how the body works. I swear that the school did not teach me half of what I know of this show. It is also linked to other things, such as what happens if you are eating unhealthy food and do not exercise, with nice examples inside the body. Who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know mini virus tanks can invade you? : D The cartoon looked very nice, very friendly to children, but it was done with caution. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling caricatures, and look very much like how you expect their shape in the moving body. <br /> <br /> This, and the series of history (especially the terrifying ecological end) was a major part of my childhood. I am very happy because I found them here.
