I did not approach "I'm still crazy" with no real anticipation. Just another rock'n'roll image, I figured ... good nostalgia for babies born. This film is partly so, but much more. Brian Gibson, the director, has previously led the biography of Tina Turner, who is very successful in his style. I suppose it would be appropriate for this to be his last film. <br /> <br /> The cast was well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as band leader. Actor Bruce Robinson, who turned into a director, is the band's guitarist. He does a great job, although he has not appeared in the film since the late 1970s. If you're looking for a moving and funny movie (with some great songs), I've found it. 7.4 out of 10
