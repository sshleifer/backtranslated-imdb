My wife is a teacher and is familiar with the story after reading many of her chapters. However, this was not interesting for me, and I bought a DVD that I thought would be a movie that would not actually get caught up in my tug. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie contains a lot of preparation and I found myself thinking that I was right. It starts very slowly and I have to admit that I felt a bit bored - but I am curious enough to stay with him. Boy, I'm glad I did it ended up being a very satisfactory and rewarding film. I will definitely watch this again! <br /> <br /> The casting process was very good. Since I have not read the book, I can not guarantee accuracy, but I must say that Jon Voight was really delighted. She loved the characters she was supposed to love, hated those characters she was supposed to hate, and laughed at the characters who were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I can see how some people may not like this movie. It's sometimes boring, especially at first. All memories of the past can be dispersed (although they are necessary for the story). Once the story begins in monotheism in the end, I think you will get the money paid for patience. When everything is said and done, I think this movie is very good - 8/10. <br /> <br />
