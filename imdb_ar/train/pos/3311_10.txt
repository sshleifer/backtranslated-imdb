A common scheme in the films consists of the main characters that left the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and find themselves in the tranquility of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we present two stories to individuals doing exactly that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean gardens in the mountains of Kangwon County. However, instead of epiphany moments, we have two personalities whose journey to nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The speed of this movie is slow and hopefully. Learn in the end what really brought them all to Kangwon County and learn how to contact them. For those who want Hollywood and film to give them a specific answer, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a film that makes them think, question and influence them years later, this film will outweigh that longing.
