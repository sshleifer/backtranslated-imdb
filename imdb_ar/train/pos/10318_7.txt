It has been said that both films and baseball prospered during the Great Depression. The dismal realities of the nation that followed this economic disaster seem to have created the need for occasional relief to the public. A temporary escape can be found in the ongoing soap opera which is a baseball game. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a two-hour or three-hour trek through the dark halls of the cinema. A radio presence was kept nearby, making the "Depression in America" ​​coincide with "World Events" and gave a lot of dramas and (especially) comedies to an interesting chapter on harsh reality. <br /> <br /> The literature of time also flourished at all levels. The habits of reading events helped create a comic book as we know it, with all the wonderful characters and the superlative adventures. But the comic book did not appear magically, it was fully developed with all four colored color pages, each individually. There were ways in which the grandparents had them. The Newspaper Comic Strip is clearly a parent, providing the visual / narrative way of storytelling. <br /> <br /> Another direct ancestor was Pulp magazine. The inexpensive prose storybook, which carries a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in the continuing, if not necessarily sequential, tales. The center of the pulp has existed for several decades and we have presented to TARZAN from Edgar Rice Burroughs and Johnston McCullough Zoro. The 1930s brought great crops, such as the likes of THE SHADOW, AVENGER, BATTES ACES of the G8, SPIDER and MASTER of MEN, all of which found their way to the news platforms, among other things. <br /> <br /> DOC SAVAGE, the super hero of the written story, was probably the only pulp of the hero. Doc has super power, super-senses and brilliant intellectual thought, and Doc was the first Super Hero model. <br /> <br /> He also rounded up 5 of his former army comrades in a small, free team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a particular field. So we got the highest rating: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist, archeologist, paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> The stories of Doc Savage were very common in the 1930s and 1940s and were published in the mid-1950s. Then they went to a stop for a good 12-15 years. Then came the brainstorming to reassemble old novels in a new "container", a paperback. A new look at the art of the cover was presented, featuring a series of high-quality paintings from a very muscular Duc, with a torn shirt. <br /> <br /> Re-submission has proven to be a great success, with its release from the title a month (for a while longer). Soon, there were rumors of Doc Savage! But when, by which product? Well, the respected Bronze Man returned to the news list for more than 10 years before any real project was assembled. He was a veteran Stop-Action Animator and producer of the best special effects films, Geoprge Pal, who made the film with Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE arrived, MAN OF BRONZE arrived at the cinemas, from a well-represented, albeit "no-name" cast as much as the audience. Through the former Tarzan TV program, Ron Ellie has performed almost in the foreground, the beauty and a beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the feminine and veteran personality Paul Wexler (as an evil object, Captain Seas); no other name will be recognized. This may have been largely added in this case. <br /> <br /> The story does a great job of getting to know the majority of the audience on the incredible group and at the same time getting a constant conspiracy. The use of narrative, by Paul Frees, and short film clips is the method used to convey the introduction to the main part of the story. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, there are hints that this story will go with the same kind of "Camp" humor manufactured as the Batman TV series. Some of the great early scenes that include Doc and the entire crew, whose individual specialties are directed towards humor, are listed by Paul Fries and unexpected unexpected results. (For example, the Doc's experiment with a mini-rocket / missile shows that it is part of a fishing method, a small one in it.) The whole story unfolds as such, hitting the scenes a little "camp" often, as we keep reminding us not to take it Seriously. We are also puzzled by the fact that Mr. George Ball is the last producer. It is well known as special effects, and it is certainly a factor that can be used well in a science fiction framework of a world of character characters. <br /> <br /> I can remember seeing him very clearly. Mrs. Ryan (Diana) was in the hospital, where she gave birth to our second child, Michelle (08/14/75). Our grand daughter, Jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after the hours of visiting the birth ward, she was directly to the old Marquette Theater, 63 and Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> Being a young man with good knowledge of Doc, I was lost because of the final product. I could have accepted a little of this Camp work, but I would not have objected if Mr.Pal had deemed it appropriate to allow all of them to climb and had some real dinosaurs and volcanoes to give more of the pulp / comic / stringed excitement. <br /> <br /> However, the actors, led by Mr. Eli and others, have made the entire film popular, if not popular. The groups and sites, as far as we can see, are very similar to those in the serial flick or adventure of the 1930s that would be fun for anyone. <br /> <br /> This is probably what they were trying with this SAVAGE DOC, a bronze man.
