I watch films for a living, and I choose them good enough to distribute them ... I put aside those that do not make pieces. I'm not saying I know more than anyone else based on that, I'm just driving you to how I came to see "Angel Lo" ... anyway ... a lot of bad movies landing on my desk and I actually sit through all of them. I do not watch "everything" in fact, I usually look at the TV from time to time while looking at the value of production, performance and the extent of story presentation. If something caught my eye it would take time to see it. "Lou" attracted me during the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and wheeled my chairs on the TV so I could tune in perfectly. Needless to say, I was enthusiastic throughout the entire film. The story is well documented, the characters either gracious or disgusting (depending of course on the actor's intention and director's character) and all played well. Sometimes, amateur mistakes are sometimes caught while the camera is working and edited, but the emotional nature of the story makes these mistakes easy to reject. I heard the comments of other people who say that sometimes the film brought tears to their eyes, sometimes the extreme elation ... I laughed for a minute and cried the next day and I was incredibly touched by this film. Unfortunately I could not get it because I was - as the saying goes - late for the week and a short dollar. This is the way it sometimes goes ... but at least it was a pleasure to see this and I can not wait to see what kind of response it gets. Good luck and good luck to you, Brett Carr (if you read this), you are undoubtedly a talent to watch.
