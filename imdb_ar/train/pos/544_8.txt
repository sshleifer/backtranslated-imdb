I love this film was almost like I (cabin on the lake), just instead of killing only women, it kills men too. The most interesting scenes, 2 of my favorite viewers first, when Stanley and Allison in the dance club is describing the last Kimberley moments before throwing it into the water; second, when Stanley is visiting Allison in his basement, before heading directly to the group, when he accepted him. Those scenes, to me, were very intense and fixed. The film was given a rating of 8/10, not because the film was bad, but because the shooting was bad, I mean, there were times when you did not notice something wrong, such as shooting the movie in the usual way shot, you would not see the "direct" camera shot, but then , You will notice imaging errors. what happened??
