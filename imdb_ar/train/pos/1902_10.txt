Let's start with the song that Christopher Cross sang. The song is "If signed between the moon and New York City." It is a wonderful idea and a wonderful song even after all these years, and never tired. It's really a great song about New York City too. In any case, the role of Dudley Moore (CBE Big) plays the role of a spoiled millionaire who is involved in the character of Gil Eichenberry in the film. Jill will later star on the LA Code. In any case, he is served by his brilliant British servant, Sir John Gilgod, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the film. Arthur is in love with the character Lisa Minelli who is ideal in this film alongside her performance in her Oscar-winning role in Cabaret. No, Lisa does not get to sing. She plays waitress dinner. However, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as head of the Bach family who decides the family fortune. In any case, she is fantastic and must have been nominated for the Academy Award herself as Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin known as Jerry's father on Seinfeld plays the role of Father Lisa. It's very cool. The film was well written and represented and delivered to the public who wanted more of it.
