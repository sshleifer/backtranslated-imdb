GBS wrote his own essay on the screen about the play of the Nobel Prize winner, but he did not live to see it produced (he won the Academy Award in 1938 for his superb adaptation of 1914 PYGMALION). When Otto Breminger produced and produced this production in 1957, seven years after Shaw's death, British author Graham Green observed adaptation and was a strong choice. <br /> <br /> Taking a reference from Shaw's script, Greene uses materials from the Epilogue stage to create a framing device to integrate the two dramas (one early and one in the Joan story) into a very unified and satisfying entity. Where the color of the tone is temporarily changed to the stage, and here also works with the return to the bedroom of King Charles Balua (where the man Joan on the throne dreams of the events that led to his current status), more material from Shaw's Epilogue - Introduction to John Gielgud's Warwick English Kings Maker). <br /> <br /> The majority of the language is solid GBS, and performances by prominent Shauvians (such as Felix Aymler's or Harry Andrews' Stogumber) for the relatively newcomers (the film that founded Jean Seiberg's career) are first class. Some, familiar only with Richard Widmark's many films, may see Duffin play weak and somewhat silly, but the performance - which is bizarrely higher - is professional, even if it's a mistake. The symbolic opening credits and choice of director to use visual vocabulary for black and white photography all serve Xu and the story well. Enjoy good entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
