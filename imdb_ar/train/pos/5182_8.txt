A quiet, sweet, nostalgic film about how to confront old friends and the surroundings of your youth with all those memories, problems and sorrows of those present with you. Film makes you feel comfortable. All ingredients are here: old Gilosi, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Harms, nightly night raids and all the other recreational things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters get a chance for a week to try it again as the old camp commander now retires and wants to interview the children from the golden years of the camp. They are all in their thirties and mid-career.
