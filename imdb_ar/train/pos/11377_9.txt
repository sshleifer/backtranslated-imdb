Citizen X tells the story of Andr√© Sciacatello, The Ripper of Rostov, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mostly women and children. Explains how the investigation was blocked by the Soviet bureaucracy and how difficult it is to investigate the crimes. She does it so well that she will not leave anyone untouched. At first, it may be a little slow, but it holds you just as the story unfolds. I can only say, next to Silent Lambs, it's the best film about the serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to determine the performance of the actor standing above the rest in this film. Steven Ria is truly wonderful as an inexperienced forensic expert and expensive to investigate. Donald Sutherland performed as a pessimistic boss, the only person in the Russian government wanting to help him, as wonderful as Reese's performance. And what do you say about Jeffrey Doman, playing serial killer? Domen created a wonderful personality that inspires compassion rather than hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad, oppressed and cynical figure by his wife, boss and co-workers ... He is tortured, ashamed and very brutal. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie to everyone interested in a well-made documentaries, where actors are still more important than special effects. It is worth at least 9/10 and maybe more if you ask me.
