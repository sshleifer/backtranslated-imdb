I enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought the plot was realistic and relevant to any period in American history. There is always that woman who does what she needs to do to climb the separation system. I feel that the night character has been properly photographed and can not be done better. What I most enjoyed was when I realized what love was really like. Throughout the film, all the men who fell in love with her, had given her everything, until they lost their careers. Until I met Cortland, she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness. The way she ended her life was far from her expectation. I recommend this movie to anyone from a mature audience so you can understand the content and meaning of the film and the plot
