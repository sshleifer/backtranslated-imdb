"Before Satan knows you are dead," is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Representation of the incredible excellent cast. Philippe Seymour Hoffman offers great performance and increases strength every time he appears on the screen. Ethan Hawk matches the scene scene and Albert Finney chews the screen. Marissa Tommy, though, is a little criminal use, but she looks stunning for 42 years. The script is excellent, the story line is non-linear but easy enough to follow. Sydney Lumette, although unknown to his famous films, has turned into a gem with this one!
