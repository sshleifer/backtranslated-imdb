Although I was born in the year that this film appeared and I never heard it until my junior high school (1996) when I saw it I became totally immersed in laughter, crying and feeling with the characters because I and my friends were them. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and despair in each position were very familiar! I remember thinking how real and how I wanted to make films like this. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie the next night after I was at a crazy party (no different from that in Jay's house), which crashed because of what we saw as the displaced losers who were stuck on the sidelines of our audience. BS'er is a world-class and personal type of "responsible" parent whom I immediately identified with Jenny (I was also the person who owned a car) even though I was suffering a bit of Madge's insecurities there. My best friend was Dider and her good friend since her childhood was Annie. <br /> <br /> I watched the scene when Jenny was at school or separated from her and her boyfriend and then told Madj afterwards I loved him as if I had talked the conversations and attitudes I had personally experienced. <br /> <br /> Now, at the age of 27, I saw the movie again and felt great emotions because it was like watching a piece of my youth (although none of my friends died). I think this is a must for all 13 girls and above.
