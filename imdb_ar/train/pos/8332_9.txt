The part visited by Meg Mechanic says: "Does the piston shoot?" (Which means the weak sexual energy of her fianc√©e) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as she has always been in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and very smart too. Her innocent angry expressions did you wish to be yours? The hero handles the garage mechanic for physical transformation well. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle tour in front of the press and the public was good. It is very disrespectful and deserves decorations and attempts at revival. He is losing one vote because of the inclusion of a highly improbable theory bought by the US government. I do not see why they do not appear in the best 20 romantic comedy of the century. Wonderful film, has a seal approval of the president it!
