I loved the way the earth was made. His photography is unbelievable, and editing must be an interesting challenge and the voice of Patrick Stewart is perfect. In addition to music and voice editing make the EARTH experience a deep experience you do not want to miss. You are really on a trip to a place where you will never end up. <br /> <br /> Although I was initially surprised by the public laughter when we saw animals in their daily fight to survive, I could not help laughing at myself sometimes. Nature simply looks so impressive that it can not be understood. But instead of laughing, I left the cinema with a deep question: "How can two hundred years of industrial revolution destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?" /> With this question in mind, you will understand how I felt bitter and somewhat helpless after seeing the earth. I felt the urgent need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to reverse the changes we have undergone over the past centuries, and to stop global warming at the same time (all this is not a non-governmental activist at all!). /> So I immediately visited the site at the end of the movie to see what I can do to save our wonderful planet (and polar bear) from its sad fate .. (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed because I could not find Direct answers to my questions there. However, it was very interesting to learn more about the film and the struggle that his crew experienced. <br /> <br /> I hope that my energy usage will stop. I do not know how to shorten the distance between polar bears and swimming to get to the ground before they drown or attack the animals they can not overcome in their debilitating condition ... <br /> <br /> It's an inspiring film, but I did not leave the cinema feeling very happy.
