This is really an incredible film. It documents not only the eternal struggle of the indigenous and the disadvantaged to obtain their rightful voice, but also the betrayal and disregard of the United States and its blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez appears as a courageous and very attractive leader struggling against what can only be described as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have scored a coup against anything we have seen before. <br /> <br /> In cross hair, we see the USA, once again pulling the strings and blurring all the sense of reality. It is sad to watch the early stages of the revolution and are well aware that the destruction of democracy we are seeing is a tool that successive US governments and their citizens seem to be in a state of weakness. The footage shows that this is not televised or public footage, but an active document of the people and government fighting for their future. Really an impressive experience for anyone with a conscience. Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We need to enshrine the idea that each country should be allowed to choose and develop its own government in ways that the majority deems appropriate. The first stage in this process is the need to know the facts of the situation, and this documentary does a great job in doing so.
