I wish I would laugh again as much as I saw this show for the first time. I have not done that since. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I find myself laughing a lot after watching the program again and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Eisard, an influential man, is planting a man from the world. He speaks skillfully about politics but does not feel the need to "engage" in political debate. He is above that. I would like to compare it to George Carlin, who uses comedy to try to convince people of his ideas, and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The strangest man on earth
