Radiofreccia is a film about us all, our dreams and friends, our worries, our addiction and our fears. It is a wonderful film where a group of friends like us all live in difficulties that arose in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The film does not take a happy or sad approach to things; it only tells us a story, which we can all experience. One of happiness, excitement, sadness and sadness. The strength of this story lies in the fact that we love to love the characters, one of those films you will see again and again, where you feel near the small town of Emilia-Romagna where you are going. I hope that one day you will be able to walk in the streets next to Frichia and his friends and listen to the music that changed the world through the intermittent sound of an old radio playing Raptes International and playing our dreams and dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry sometimes, it will shock you and relax you, it will give you and it will take you. Personally I think that I have played an important role in my life and my friends' life, and I suggest you all watch it and make it a part of your life.
