I remembered seeing this movie when I was a kid one day in Disney World. This film has been in my memory for more than 30 years and I am looking for it. I would say that among all the children's films I saw at that time, this movie stopped more than all of them and after seeing it only once, I really hoped to see it again. The story and pictures of this film were burned in my memory. To this day, I never saw him after that day in the seventies, in fact, I never remembered the title until I was spotted searching online earlier today. I loved him and wanted to see my children. Does anyone know where I can find it?
