Halloween is the story of a boy misunderstood as a child. He brings out his problems for his older sister, who killed her at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of things coming from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Blanc plays the role of a doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows there is something different from him, something mysterious. This evil will not be contained, and can not be stopped. <br /> <br /> After escaping from an institution, Myers follows his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the problems of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems ending his sister while others object. He is able to take them out while still looking for the girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There have been a lot of these horror films involving teenagers into pieces of a masked or hideous assassin. But this one all started, somewhat. If you think about it, most of the horror films we all remember are those of Freddy Krueger or Jason chasing about half of naked girls. Well, if it's not for Halloween, those characters will not chase our dreams when we're young. <br /> <br /> Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot of horror movies in the 1950s and collected everything he knew in a single film that scared hell of so many people in the late 1970s. These films were reinforced by her films as a director to watch them, and she began to jump in the footsteps of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the role of a girl who is pursued by a convincing killer. <br /> <br /> This movie may seem trite today, but then back there was not much like that. It has been copied and ripped, but Halloween will always be the perfect teen horror movie. It still gives you chills to listen to the sensational Carpenter music while we see another victim stalked by mysterious Michael Myers.
