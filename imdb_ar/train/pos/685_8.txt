Ghost Story, (The New House) is a wonderful horror story. This is taken from the series of circles of fear and the ghost story of the ghost in the early 1970s. Sebastian Cabot tells the beginning and end of each story. I remember him from the early family chain, Family Matters in the 1960s? This particular story was Barbara Parkins and David Bernie are the two main actors, and the main characters in the story. I've seen this recently, and I was so scared! If you are lonely, I would not recommend watching this article. Is wonderful, no words Gore or curse, but very scary. Barbara Barkens played the Little Bride. David Birney played her husband's role. The actors were very good in their parts. If you like the ghastly, terrifying ghosts of ghosts, this little jewel will fascinate you. This was given a high rating. I highly recommend this story.
