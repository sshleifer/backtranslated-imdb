"GI Samurai" sees Son Chiba and some other players being transported back to the feudal feudal civil war in Japan for no particular reason, and consequent much of the carnage. It is an article higher than the sword versus the machine guns that eventually lead to some interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot basically works along the rails that you might expect from the title; strange foreign fish ("What is this flying metal box?", etc., etc.), "Is not it better for us here" The end is a huge battle. The latter is evidence that the film does not take itself very seriously at all, and the carnage that dealt most of the second half while fighting the Samurai army Chiba tribe; one may not fully expect the title, but it is still able to overcome creativity and wastefulness. It is certainly one of the most distinctive battle chains of its time and is not pulled despite its long length. <br /> <br /> Chiba performs tough performances like Iba, initially a good leader but someone finally finds himself questioning his own morality as the situation slowly has an impact on him. This is definitely one of his best cars from his brilliant resume. Through the latter act, the two worlds have had a great influence on each other, you have to wonder if it's some nihilism on the part of the book, where they seem to be asking, "Were not we better off at the time?" But this may be often read in and can generally be described as largely entertaining for two hours of work (almost non-stop).
