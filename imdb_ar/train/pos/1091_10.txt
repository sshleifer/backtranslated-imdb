I loved this movie I first saw it when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I enjoyed it so much, I brought my own copy the next day. Comedy played well by all concerned. I always have to go back and see the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found the water at 6 feet in the area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for the father of Jason Robards who plays Mr. Rich. I ran the talent in that family.
