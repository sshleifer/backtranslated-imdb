The first official Ghibli films, similar to Laputa his predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was an epic SF, they are more than just an exciting comedy adventure with a somewhat weak SF hypothesis. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour of the movie I thought I would love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to conjure up a fantastical world in a beautiful and delicate perfection. The animations, although they still do not exist in subsequent Ghibli movies, are slightly better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> In my assessment of Nosica, I mentioned that one character in the film "Lupinesque" is the most poignant pencil. Here's a whole bunch of them: pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, although they need a comedian I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I thought it was better off for it. still. Having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is the most distinctive character in the film (even if she is a long-time John Silver female.) Do not be surprised if "Treasure Planet" is sometimes mentioned in a good voice by Clore Litchman in American dubbing. <br /> <br /> In English, the sound in the English language absolves itself for the most part. However, something pear-shaped for me started about halfway around this film. I think the best way I can describe is to swallow the characters through the broad scope of the story. I'll come back later. There's so much to admire about Laputa, obviously so many people love him, so much so that I almost feel that I only give her 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is "impressed". It was more impressive than the personal impact, and in just over two hours the clouds began. <br /> <br /> The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I did not care much about any of the characters. Disney was keen to develop the characters, making you really fall for them, rather than leaving them as two relatively two-dimensional pieces to navigate with them as they reviewed the amazing scenes in the film. Even if it was acceptable if there were some solid elements in the story to make up for it, except that it was basically a lot of gobledgeook around princesses and magical crystals. This is where I fall to Abuta as much as I am concerned, which hinders him from being a possible film of 10 films. Having said that, it must be recognized that Miyazaki was outperforming Disney in general in 1986, when he thought that his film of the same year was a terrible "mouse mouse". <br /> <br /> A good film in some respects is a stunning film, and you should definitely see it, but I feel it is overpriced. I am definitely the best "Nausicaa for the Valley of the Wind" earlier. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you can see it in chronological order, look for the fox squirrel from Nausicaa who appeared briefly in Laputa.
