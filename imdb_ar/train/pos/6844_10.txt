"Dressed to Kill" is the best film for Brian de Palma, an exciting journey of thrill, humor and elegance that is unmatched today. DePalma has rap music in Hollywood, where most people claim to have ripped Alfred Hitchcock. he did not do. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma showed in his impressive films. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original unpainted version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current version of Goodtimes is the story of Jack R from R Valentine. But some copies of the original DePalma pieces still exist. It's distributed by Warner Home Video, in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, or in a black clamshell box with a silver lining sticker. These are the things you can get, if you find a copy of them. I have a green one and it is among my precious possessions. <br /> <br /> Anyway, go back to the story. Dickinson plays the role of Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Kane) for her manic fantasies. While you were on a trip to the museum (a real trip to DePalma in terms of camera work and thrill), <br /> <br /> Miller was captured by a stranger. You can guess what happens to it to a large extent, since the ads and the art of funds give up the story. But there are some complications. A prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Peter Carter Peter's son (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. Dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message ... about a missing haircut ... <br /> <br /> I do not spoil the film at all for you because what I described above happens inside the half hour opening and the biggest surprises of DePalma are reserved for the last hour. This film is clear, but enough for Valenti (head MPAA) to ask for cuts in the film. What surprises me is what he wants cuts. Many cuts were made in the opening shower scene, a sloping landscape or two and some dialogue by Nancy Allen (Valenti wanted to change "cock" to "bulge"). This is a very violent and bloody film, but objections to sexual content. I would like to hear an explanation by Valenti about how seeing two women in a thin love scene in "Lost and Delirious" is somehow more urgent to a young man than Arnold Schwarzenegger as he lays people away with a chain gun. It is not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "wearing a killing" very good is that not only are the technical credits first class, but the performance is also very good. Michael Caen, who was in a state of strangeness at this time, presents one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, probably because she already has a strong role here. Nancy Allen adds this to a range of performances that have linked her as one of the most disdainful and ignored actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is as wonderful as a genius and I loved all those inventions for him. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has not received the recognition he deserves. The recent joke of the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what the thriller is. If they want to open their eyes for once, they will see that DePalma has bet on his career in excitement and is actually the best craftsman. This is better than "psychological." It is shameful that few know this already. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
