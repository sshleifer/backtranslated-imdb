It is worth noting that for players who support 'Young' Lincoln ', Ford casts lesser-known actors and other stars. This not only concentrates his focus on Lincoln's central character, it also gives the audience a refreshing look at Lincoln as a man in his place and time, a man involved, as with each of us, in issues and his time and his search for ways to solve them. It is not much of Lincoln's words and actions, but in the faces and reactions of the supporting players, Ford tells the story of how Lincoln's young look to the world, the sense of place in society and governance, and how people reacted to him. Whom they considered to have gained their respect and respect. <br /> <br /> Try this attempt: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, the next time you see "Young" Mr. Lincoln turns your focus to supporting characters - as I would expect, you will be rewarded with a much deeper appreciation for Lincoln And Ford. I would suspect that Ford's account of the reactions of the supporting characters of Lincoln Funda may have appealed to David Lynne when Omar Sharif was brought out in Dr. Zivago, which is the reaction of the supporting characters to Zivago, who is actually telling about Zivago.
