This film revolves primarily around human relations and interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who begins a journey to her past in the twilight of her life and analyzes how she lived her life. This trip was precipitated by the economic crisis of the children and their intentions to put them in a nursing home. It is an honest look at some of the issues we all ask at some point in life, and there are a lot of secondary ideas that should be discussed in this film, such as family inheritance, true love, marriage or destiny. Although this type of film is not new, it is useful to see it with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance by the actors and personalities are very believable, but because of time maybe some characters are not fully developed. I really recommend this movie on a quiet Saturday afternoon.
