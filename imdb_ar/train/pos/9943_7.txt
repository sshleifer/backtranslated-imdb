The film never claims to be as spectacular as many movies do. Movies props itself as a fun and entertaining time. That is exactly what it was. It is the Korean version of the male "bring days". <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you can feel the rest of the movie and how it will end but enjoy no sudden shifts and no way that the film is carbon copy of another. Instead, a trip is enjoyed how the remaining "thugs" become men in their own right. So, the film is fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The camera works, especially as the puppet moves have been well executed. The script, being a weak boy, was very interesting in the fact that the characters were not two-dimensional but were full of life and desire. This movie will not win any of the Oscars, nor any big sales of DVDs, but an enjoyable viewing and fun experience.
