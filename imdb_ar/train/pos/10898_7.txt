This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was fun and funny and I loved to be around the holiday season. He made me in a mood to shop for Christmas and listened to holiday music. When this movie appears on a DVD, the Christmas holiday will be replaced in my collection. It will be a film you will see every year after Thanksgiving to bring me the mood for the best time of the year. I heard Ben's character was a bit crazy but I think she adds to the film and why she's serious all the time. Take it as it is, a Christmas comedy with a twist of love. I enjoyed it. No, it is not Titanic and will not make your heart beat with enthusiasm, but it will bring laughter or two. So laugh and have a good time :)
