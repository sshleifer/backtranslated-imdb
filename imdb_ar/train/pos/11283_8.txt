Tarzan and his companion, Tarzan's second photo from MGM, takes place a year after Tarzan's events. Tarzan and Jane were happily living in the woods, and Harry Holt (one of the campaign's first filmmakers), this time with less-than-honorable Martin Arlington, is looking for ivory from the elephant cemetery. Of course, a variety of dangerous and exciting adventures occur along the way. <br /> <br /> The first film has a romantic character - jungle, adventure, romance itself, wild animals and even death. The second film still contains a great deal of romance and lots of wonderful sequences, but a more serious tone lies behind the film. The characters dare to ask questions like: What if something happened to Tarzan? What would Jane do if she was stranded in the middle of the forest and had to take care of herself? Although these are the questions that real people may pose in this situation, they create a certain amount of grief that is not always as enjoyable as the attitude of caution from the wind to the original. <br /> <br /> The growth we see in Tarzan and Jane's relationship is one of the most interesting aspects of this film. Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but he clearly learned some new words from his colleague. In addition, their love for each other has already flourished, and we feel like they have already spent a year together in the forest. <br /> <br /> Most people think that Tarzan and his colleague are better than the original Tarzan Monkey Man.I personally liked the first film a bit better.The main reason is that the relationship between Harry Holt and Martin Arlington is not as beloved as Holt's relationship With James Barker (father of Jane) of the original The character of Mr. Arlington could have worked as a great film villain, but he plays the role of hero for more than a film. Something far away, but in one scene that we must hate, Jane never knew about these events, so the end is not as satisfactory as Ka They can be.) However, all these critics are relatively small, and still a great film. <br /> <br /> Like the first film, Tarzan and his colleague have great animation scenes, fantastic wildlife scenes, and one of The screen of all time is the greatest romance.If you liked the first movie in the series, it is certainly a sequel to watch.
