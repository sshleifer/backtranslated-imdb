I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before I returned it to the store. Bill Paxton has hired some top-class talent to make an exciting film with some exciting transformations. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both perform well. The story is listed in an interesting way with both memories of the past 20 years back, then the sites at present, alternating back and forth. This style of storytelling makes good excitement can not be boring. Bill Paxton, please make more horror movies, you have a talent for it!
