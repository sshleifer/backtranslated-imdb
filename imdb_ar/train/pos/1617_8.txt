"Moonstruck" is a love story. There is not one love story, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the family itself. The Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Camarre (Danny Aylo). She does not like him, but he is a good and good man. When he leaves to visit his deceased mother in Italy, Loretta meets Ronnie's brother (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not spoken to each other for five years and Loretta wants to invite him to attend the wedding. Of course they immediately fall into each other. <br /> <br /> How this story develops and the love stories of Loretta's parents, uncle and aunt is something you simply have to see for yourself. All scenes are fun to watch, with Cher as a bright star in the middle of everything. She already won the Oscars that year. Cage is very good, and duped as well, and Olympia Dukakis as mother of Loretta and Vincenta Gardenia as her wonderful father. This movie is funny, charming and therefore very enjoyable.
