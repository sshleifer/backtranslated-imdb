The Last Hunt is one of the few Westerners who have ever dealt with Buffalo hunting, as a sport and trade as a way to win Indian wars in the plains. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains used to have herds of American Bison sized some of our largest cities. By the time the Last Hunt was set, buffalo was eliminated. The 20th century, thanks to the efforts of environmentalists, has seen a revival in the species census, but not as before. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger participate in a second film together. This one is much better than all the brothers were brave. Here Stuart Granger is a good man, a world-crazed buffalo hunter, and he has to return to a job he hates for financial reasons. <br /> <br /> The partner he has chosen to see is Robert Taylor. When I forget Taylor at the moment, I doubt that there was a more absurd spirit than Charlie Gelsen portrayed by Taylor. In Devil's Doorway, he was an American Indian fighting against the bias aroused by Lewis Calhren. In The Last Hunt, it is racist here. Kill both buffaloes and Indians for pure pleasure. One Indian family is killed when they steal his money and take the widow of a prisoner. Like some barbarian invaders, he expects the pleasure of sexual pleasure for Debra Paget. It's really crazy when Paget does not see it this way. <br /> <br /> No matter how often they point to Russ Tamplin as half-massive, I was never convinced he was part of India. It's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, brought by the Thaler and Glenger, the nice old buffalo buff was wonderful. Nolan steals every scene he has with actors. <br /> <br /> For those who like real Westerners, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor on an unprecedented screen, and who do not like cheap tournaments, The Last Hunt is the perfect catch.
