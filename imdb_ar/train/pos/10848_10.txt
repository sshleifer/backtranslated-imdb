... Heads, hands, feet - a band of the past, just like Strange Fruit. The triple strike is there. Those who have declared their dislike of this film are heartless or less than 40 years old, and have no experience in the real thing. Sad for them. This is a small, well-watched picture which is an excellent way to pass an hour or two, and probably will not fade much in the second show. Steven Ray, Timothy Spall, the chubby drummer (in some ways the most cheerful character), and Bill Nyei - a new name for me - the nervous singer and the front man all play great roles, and Juliette Aubrey has a great performance playing with some behavior Sharp like Karen, who tries to connect the band with stunning self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The echoes of Mr. Barrett / Brian Wilson are loud and clear, the death of Hobel's death before each one in their silly inflated, the scenario is never dark for more than a minute. Do not compare it to Spinal Tap, The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair to all of them. The closest comparison is the commitments, and this is not bad. Any film can evoke the memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I never remember, but the name continues - well, it shows that someone in the team knows what is going on around it. <br /> <br /> A small joy, thank you for the memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... I've got one other - Stiff Little Fingers; one and what about STEELEYE SPAN ... scary tooth ... ten inch nail anyone? (You have to see the movie or you're on the way)
