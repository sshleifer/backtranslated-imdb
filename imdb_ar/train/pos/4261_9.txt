I admire this movie. Not only because I am a fan of Murtitz Blipto, though in all the German films that are practically counted. But also because he is not the main actor. Barnaby published the lead, which was the only reason to see Julietta in 2001, which really carries this film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> A family from Italy moved to Germany in search of a "German dream" (this is my own invention and irony ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industries. However, they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the film takes to this point on its own is very poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point on, the story that is recounted is basically the story of two brothers from this family, Giancarlo (Palliprio) and Gigi (leaflets). Gigi dreamed of becoming a director threatening to compete with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. Here's a wonderful look - and completely neutral - on what life can be shaped by the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film does not make life better (Gigi's or Giancarlo) more complete or more interesting. It gives us only a rewarding glimpse of what the search for identity should be when it comes to two countries and legacies. This is not a bitterness or contempt for either country, making it a great film for any country dealing with immigration tensions. The fact that the director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the seventies of the last century confers on this film a great deal of credibility and emotional accuracy. Decorating on the cake is a great show by the entire staff, especially Metschurat - and that's what I really need - the little boy who plays Gigi. This child's performance will be hard to follow anyone! Fantastic movie, go to see it.
