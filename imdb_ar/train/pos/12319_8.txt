First things first, that female leadership is extremely fascinating and should not be missed. Now actress Wang Zouxian, who played Xiao Qian in the film, is now 42 and has a good age. It's always good to review these glorious times when watching HongKong's productions at the old school like this. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles of the 1980s. Artistic ornaments and other aesthetic aspects are all charming. More importantly, the film had a collection of black humor. It sounds like a horror film, but in the end it's not scary, but it's just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of Chinese Gotst Story, and I thought the script was a good book. However, when I watched the movie, I was initially disappointed to see the movie different from the script, as in a smaller scale and includes more comedic roles. However, it has been shown that it was performed better in terms of being amusing. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Lord of the Rings, you'll notice the similarities in this movie with LOTR. The peak looks like miranda auto mirror fighting with a charming ring. She certainly laughed loudly. Bravo!
