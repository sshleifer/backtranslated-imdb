I have always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes contains dull spots, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "River flowing through it" is the perfect name for this film (Norman McLean's novel). Life recedes and flows like a river, and has difficult areas, but it is a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford offers much of the film. His novel has a friendly feeling that fits the picture perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, picking up some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for acting, Craig Scheffer and Brad Pitt are suddenly working with the brothers. I do not know exactly how to describe the performance of Tom Skeret and Brenda Blythin, but they feel the real reality. "River passes through" is a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
