Streetfight (also known as Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by the pioneer of animation Ralph Beckshi. It's weird in the cinema, and it's worth watching. It's a lively movement mixed with animation, and it seems to be influenced by the legendary Southern Disney song, as if it were in response to this. Philippe Michael Thomas, who will later become an outspoken friend of Don Johnson in the Miami team and the most famous of his roles in The Shining in Kubrick, are the fugitives. Charles Gordon and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are friends of Thomas and plan to help him escape from jail. They are stuck at a police checkpoint, and Krause tells a story about the black rabbit, the bear, and the fox, who moves from the south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated and provides a lot of wonderful things to see. Like all Bakshi films, most of them will be upset and hate animations. Real animators will forgive their screams and love them for creativity. The film is very violent, very sexy, and is mostly about inter-race battles. For a long time, I thought I was watching something very important, but after a while, especially after I finished watching it, it started to seem like a flick through the black mill, like Superfly. It's very dirty and does not say anything really. Besides, is not white Bakshi? Whatever the answer, the Coonskin / Streetfight program is still worth watching for animators and fans of the movies. 10/07.
