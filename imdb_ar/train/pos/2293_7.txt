This is a cartoon Bugs Bunny very early. As a result, the personality is still in a transitional period - it was not devised as it was later and his voice was not entirely true. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is some poor sap who buy bugs from a pet store - there is no weapon or desire on his part to blow the rabbit to a blacksmith! However, despite this, this film is still very enjoyable. The early bugs were certainly more rude and cruel than his incarnation later on. In subsequent films, messed with Elmer and Yosimite Sam and others because they started it - they messed with the rabbit. But in this film, much like Duffy Duck in the late 1930s and early 1940s - a jerk that loves others irritating !! "Anarchist" is real instead of the subsequent cartoon hero. Although this is not among the best cartoons of Bug Bunny, it is interesting to see and interesting to see how it has changed over the years.
