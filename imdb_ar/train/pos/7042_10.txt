First, someone here said that since it was released in a limited amount, it means it must be bad ... This is exactly what the Big 5 Hollywood studios want everyone to think about so they can "succeed" or "ignore" "Undesirable features, without losing a face or imagining through direct censorship." To some extent, this production has been released "limited" because it is considered "unnational" by some individuals. <br /> <br /> Now I liked this The advantage is the best; I find it better, then Charlie Wilson's War, even if it is a fictional novel of something that never happens, but it's always fun. "Turkey and the Emerald City are trying to compare Iraq and Baghdad, just as Tamerlane does in Haliburton (with Vice President Dan Ackroyd playing) Quiet moments in fact where the film is dead serious, not even sarcastic anymore (the main example will be how John Kozak's character deals with depression, but not only). <br /> <br /> I found that All characters can be linked to something / someone or specific templates. Now word advice. If you are not politically active, especially towards the "globalization" aspects, you will probably not enjoy this feature much because most of its content and "jokes" target certain "invisible" characters to the public on a daily basis ... Hilary Duff, who plays popular pop star, I need to say name (s)?). In its CORE feature is the gig anti-globalization, this period. The message is delivered unequivocally with comic revenge. Joan has a line at one point like this: "And here we have a book you wrote, you know who, about how I conquered the world and solved problems with my parents." <br /> <br /> Sister and Cusack play a good role as always , As in the film "Grosse PointeBlank", I say "slightly more mature". Marissa Tomier does not show her butt and breasts to "impress us" (as she did recently in "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"), but instead, it has a very serious role, and you can pull it well. <br /> <br /> Many critics do not get it (they can not do it), or do not want to). This is not a "normal" film but more than a comedy film. This feature aims to deliver a message, not to get the Oscars or get "images" to attract viewers to buy the latest HDTV "HDTV" ... I've even noticed in local newspapers that this movie has become bad - since it is not " While the pro-war films get good creations for being "balanced" and "attractive." One wonders why all the major media in the world are concentrated in the hands of a group of players. .. <br /> <br /> I bet that this feature will prove far more successful abroad in North America. As I mentioned earlier, all this satire about US foreign policy and how it was hijacked by "special interests" groups ... The presence of a "regular" US soldier wearing the Tamerlane logo on his combat dress is a great insult but effective in showing reality as it is, Or will soon be as things go so far. <br /> <br /> Some great shots: "At Liberation", the country gets commercials that have invaded; a hilarious scene about how journalists in the future will gather "news" ("Anything better than an Xbox bull"). ); Soldiers who deal with their "frustration"; <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this to "conservatives" or "hardcore" patriots of one kind or another. This feature is not made to reach the "minds of souls" of people (as advertising tries and mainstream business interests always do so). The message contains a well-defined message of realism, and toward some ideological goals that seem to be "always" lacking in cognition.
