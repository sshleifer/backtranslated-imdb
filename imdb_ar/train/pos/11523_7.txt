This is one of the most extreme films I have ever seen. I've seen it on a DVD, and the CD has no special features, or even a list, but that's not necessarily what I care about. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge movies on a case-by-case basis, depending, inter alia, on whether to produce a large studio or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I want to forgive small things. However, I think it contains one of the most innovative and original sequence sequences that I have seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed playing all the major players. I particularly enjoyed Tal Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has more than the extremes of lines. Claire Forelani's character may seem unreal to some people, but I personally have known real people with emotional problems who easily view life's decisions as her character does. This helped me capture the nuances that can be hurt by the cortex of humor. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is not a film for children, but it does not participate in sex and nudity at no charge. There is a lot of adult language, but it may be funny at times. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkin, who can not even swear correctly.) <br /> <br /> Also see the votes of well-known actors.
