I just want to make it clear that this may be biased, because I am a film producer. However, I will maintain some sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, performs as great as Jeff Grinderlin, hypochondriac nebbish who spends more time worrying than living. It gives a certain touch to his character that allows the audience to communicate with him, by expressing his opinion often and with a sense of harsh comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is a solid support beam, without which, will collapse on himself. His friends also lend a helping hand to Geoff's life, and often make choices instead of allowing him to use his free will ... which he often neglects anyway. <br /> <br /> The writing is great, and the conversations flow like scenes from Kevin Smith's film, with half of Ben Affleck boo-hoo festivals. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is a bit lousy at some points, the sound can also be used as a boost, but the performance outside the brilliance of the details is simple. It is also supported by beautiful music with local talent and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> In general, this was fun. Jewel is rare, among many jewelry.
