I've always been a lover of Saibel Shepherd, since I saw her in the series a few years ago !! This movie definitely shows her in her best light yet! The film was beautifully cast and played! Every now and then the lines fall a little amusing, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen !! Everyone really does not themselves !! Especially Robert Downey Jr. and Sibyl Shepard, have made the film a reality !! I also liked a little where Mavis loses her wig and almost dies when she falls to the ground !! This is a movie at its best !!
