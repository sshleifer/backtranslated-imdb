Pecker is another John Waters film that was made on "My Mom". Pecker's character is a hobby to take pictures of anything he sees. It does not matter if it is dirty or shock when it captures images. He quickly uses his photographs and displays them in his work. Baker lives in a semi-natural, middle-class family. His father works in a drinking bar with a clutch machine, but he does not earn enough money through an ice-cream stripper across the street. His mother runs a modest shop and loves poor clothes. His older sister Tina works in a gay bar where she specializes in commerce. The youngest of him, Lecce Crissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar, and nothing other than sugary food. His grandmother, Miyama, has a statue of the Virgin Mary and plays with him. He also has 2 friends. He died among his friends, a chronic shopper, and his girlfriend, Shelly, ran a laundry rug as if she were a dictator. Soon, a tourist from New York buys a photo and presents it in an art gallery. With the picture comes fame, but the images reveal the unusual lifestyle of his friends and the simple life of the family. For an R movie, Pecker is more certain than most previous Waters movies and even Pink Flamingos. Last 10 out of 10!
