House Games is a wonderful movie on multiple levels. It is a wonderful and exciting puzzle. Enjoying the outstanding performance of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong set of supporting players, it offers Ricky Jay, a very impressive card, skilled and dated magic. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is discussed as if it were in a play of literature and the film (which is often his subject under discussion) gives an extra dimension of unrealism. <br /> <br /> On his face, House of Games is a convincing look at the world of cheating and deception unknown, which is quite different from The Sting, which was played only for magic and yok. At this level, this works admirably. <br /> <br /> However, you can not escape the exam on a deeper level than the woman Odyssey from professional competence to complacency to amazing power and self-realization. The only film I know that deals with the issue of the appearance of personal power in women as worthy of the way is the soldier Benjamin underestimated him. Unfortunately, this very interesting film spreads its focus, moves among many themes and takes advantage of the good performance of a haunting monster after some easy laughter. The Games House adheres to its work. As Bo once said about a good short story, he relentlessly leads to its end. <br /> <br /> Another series of films about women, embodied by Thelma and Louise, a big budget commercial money maker with a despicable theme that women are doomed, whether they realize their inner strength or not. What a trip. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should really watch this movie in the cinema. It should be normal for film festivals. Nominate someone close to you if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. It's better to see it on TV than it is at all.
