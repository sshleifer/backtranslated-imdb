The film is a lyrical and Romanian diary narrated by the eyes of an 11-year-old boy living in a Cuban rural town in the year of Castro's revolution. It is a work that clearly deserves love. <br /> <br /> The names of CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are just attempts to market this mistake as a movie film. Julia's dreams are more logical. More involved in European cinema than Rambo, the revolution is just a nuisance to people's daily lives and their observations. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most of the works dealing with this period of time in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the audio narrator further undermines the story, but the film unwittingly compensates for clips from Hollywood movies that say much more visually than the narrator can do. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and fair play just as the wax film does in the movies, but there is fundamental pain in the loss of lifestyle that loses lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like Julie's, never seems to end.
