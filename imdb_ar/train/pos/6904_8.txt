This is one of the few films that I can watch over and over again. If you have never seen him, give him a chance. Richard Dreyfus and Raul Julia are both wonderful. Although the film is a lot of fun, it reminds me of Julia's early death. It is a good opportunity to sit and laugh at the many international conspiracies with us in a time of terror and fear.
