Well, this movie is as good as I said but you definitely need to watch it as worth watching. It's about boys like Mac and Sam, great friends who work as fashion photographers and start laughing when Mac (Akshay Kumar) begins to get acquainted with three flight attendants at the same time, leaving his wife suspicious. Sam achieved a fortune and almost forgot his friend but not quite. But Mac thinks so and so starts dating with flight attendants. There is garam masala in every step of the film, rock songs but lacking somethings. Comedian does not reach the mark and deserves a prize. Nice but not all that excellent. Some people even laughed at the pain of their stomachs but did not deserve much laughter. But of course everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to watch the movie, you're welcome to do so.
