I now assume that JEDI is a chronological order of the "last sequence" in the folk epic, which is very good, as was the case in many of these articles. I liked the extent to which this sequel took off immediately after the return of the strike, and the ability of Luke Skywalker as a character (as well as Mark Hamil, as an actor) matured. After hearing a lot of negative things about the Ewoks, they were not too bad. I enjoyed an exciting chase inside the forest, and I felt that there was a lot of emotion I realized well with this chapter. The end (with some new additions, I suppose?) All six seasons are successfully woven into a fantastic fairy tale. I know that many of the real Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he made to the original films, but being a relatively early beginner in these films, I do not miss what I did not really know. I think he made these six films work perfectly as a whole. Oh, and, err - Carrie Fisher looked very delicious in her dress outfit.
