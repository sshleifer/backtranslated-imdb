This film seems to attract us. Either love or hate. I loved her. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (comments) that he said, you just have to feel "this". <br /> <br /> Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting by Monet - an impressionist painter. The Monet method is small stone painting, so the painting looks close to chaos, but from afar, you can figure out what the subject is. Cruise mentions that her painting is "vanilla fish". I think this is a tip to a moviegoer. This film is similar to that impressionist painting. It's an impressionist industry! It is no coincidence that the title of the film refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical linear plot. Requires more thinking. There is a token and there are no wandering sights, you will not always be sure of what is happening. But in the end, everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You will need to focus on this film, but I think people make the mistake of focusing in a very difficult way. After it ends is when you should think about it. If you try to discover them as they unfold, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let her talk ... "Go" with her ... Keep your mind open. Remember what you see and save the analysis later. <br /> <br /> I found all the presentations first class and I thought it was very unique and very creative and breezy. <br /> <br /> But I will not criticize the intelligence of those who did not enjoy it. It appeals to a particular taste. If you like existential, narcotic, philosophical, thought-provoking and difficult spiritual films and visions, do so. If you prefer something a little lighter, skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what you're describing, you'll definitely enjoy it.
