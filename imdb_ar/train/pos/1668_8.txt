Artimisia was late last night. At first I did not think I liked it, but I saw that I did not feel sleep yet, and I did not follow it, I continued watching and felt myself fascinated by Artimisia, a virgin, pure and emotional. Her emotional relationship with older Tassi has raised her feelings. Although the film depends on a very romantic level and not on reality, I only liked it much more than the usual biographies or fashion drama. Fantastic play, great cameras, great music and texts. I love it and I want more from it! :-)
