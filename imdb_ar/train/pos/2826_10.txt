I had the opportunity to watch 1926 in a beautifully restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount series of vaudeville homes. This Paramount has a device "The mighty Wurlitzer"? It was also beautifully restored - used to accompany silent films of the day. <br /> <br /> We were fortunate enough to have Denis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent films in Mighty Wurlitzer, playing appropriate music and objective adaptations to work on the film. The print was a nearly complete digital version of the rapidly decomposing nitrate nitrate, and the whole experience was a once in a lifetime opportunity to watch a silent film where it was supposed to be seen. <br /> <br /> This was the first American film Greta Garbo. She was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her group. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about the opera star; although Mighty Wurlitzer has added a lot to the scene, it was necessary to leave a lot of imagination. <br /> <br /> The modern audience, most often, does not understand silent films? The acting was different at the time, with wide gestures and wide facial expressions. So the audience laughs at inappropriate times? Representation is seen as "Hammy" and too extreme to do? But it was simply the style of the period. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with her precision, did a lot to enter the new representation era: she could say more with half-closed eyes and the volumes could be read at a downward glance or ignored simply. It embodies the truism that "the picture is worth a thousand words." <br /> <br /> Although this is Garbo's first American film, it is clear that the studio knew what they had on their hands: this film was produced by MGM at its best. The collections and costumes were fantastic. Special effects ?? Which according to today's standards are very weak? It was still funny and amazing. <br /> <br /> It seems that the script written by Vicente Plasco Ibanez (from the novel of Entre Naranjos) is specially designed for Garbo; it displays its strengths, magnifies its origins, and there is no disturbing linguistic problem to deal with: a Swedish actress can play Spanish singer without Suspension of our non-ratification. <br /> <br /> Co-star MGM was the answer to Rudolf Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and does something that was only a few romantic stars ever in a movie: Let himself look unattractive, look foolish and grow up inappropriately. <br /> <br /> There are some goodies to some extent. Personal parts that acted more than enough? Especially when you think of the power that Garbo had. Notably Lucian Littlefield as Copido and Martha Matox as Donna Bernarda Bruhl. "<br /> <br /> When the extraordinary cinematographer, William H. Daniels, met with Garbo, they continued to produce 20 films together (he was a cinematographer in 157 films and his profession lasted five decades!) he was able to capture her beauty "The Divine Garbo" was the title of the title that you became known for: The Divine Garbo If you had the opportunity, do not miss it. .
