It is a pleasure to see this interesting project. Very refreshing and education. Not only for a film director, can know what can be achieved within 5 minutes of screen time, but also as listeners, who may not be too ready for this love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 All short love movies in Paris are unique, but some, as expected, stand out. I thought that Tom Tykwer's slice (Natalie Portman) was the best, although the plays made me smile inside the same thing. <br /> <br /> I have clicked on the "spoilers" option for this review bus unfortunately ... what reading is spoiler enough. Just watch it. Do not read what I write, but watch the film instead. <br /> <br /> He smiled.
