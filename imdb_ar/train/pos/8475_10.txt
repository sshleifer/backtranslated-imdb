This is a fictional film for children based on the Buggy Creek Legend game, although I do not know why they called it "Back to Buggy Creek" as if it was a sequel. This film has nothing to do with the documentary and his fairy tale. Play Dawn Wells The role of a mother of three children gets lost in the swamp around Boggy Swamp with two other men and the monster comes to help them. Yes it's very silly and the plot is poor but this kind of movies is perfect for the 8-12 year / year group you targeted. It's harmless to the classified child in class G and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your kids alone while watching it. Strictly for a group of 8-12 years, older children will feel bored and I think it is lame.
