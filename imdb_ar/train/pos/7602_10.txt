The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​them adapting to the island, while the puzzles being explored (and seen) were just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. I mean, I like the whole idea just to get used to the island. Then the first thing I saw a smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. Since then, I was hooked. The second season was on par with the first season and was a little better. I totally loved the idea of ​​gates and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and the series of the second season were mysterious, frightening and exciting. I loved all the excitement that surrounds others on the island, but the Dharma story made the second season amazing. <br /> <br /> The third season was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but nevertheless, it was fantastic. I loved seeing the background stories of others, seeing their camp, and seeing more puzzles. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, although not good, it was still wonderful and enjoyable, but most of all it was exciting! Now, season four. I had hopes this season, the first couple of episodes is good, but then it started to become boring and uninteresting. I mean, I really despised new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot became old after the first and second episodes ... and most of them .... The fourth season was stripped of something that made the LOST series perfect: mystery, suspense, comedy mixed (Charlie went) and overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.
