This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life. To put it in perspective, Gay was the word used for homosexuality, not just Gay as a class. Or is it still used that way today? I think most of the film comes from about 1968 to 1989. It was introduced in 1993, so it existed. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the documentary, which expresses the love of one man for more than 20 strange people during the year. Love expressed in true love ways can only be. There are many scenes of incredible sympathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of homosexuality and gay life. The film itself was a loving work, and I think it will be Massa. <br /> <br /> At least one film will come out to understand the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write this, I think early in this film it seems to me that it has been set. Progress in the medical, political, social and cultural sciences that have taken place since the film's introduction (about 15 years) is spectacular. However, it is clear that, in the case of AIDS itself, it has not yet ended. I think we have not worked on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a very good documentary. I would encourage anyone who feels that he does not understand gay life, gay issues, or the destruction of AIDS to watch this film.
