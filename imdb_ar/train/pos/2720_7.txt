COLD BLOOD should be classified as first-rate movies, even if the subject is as bleak as in the world of faith, but Noir's fans should find this piece of work because it is based on a real crime spree. <br /> <br /> It opens with Quincy Jones under the credits and dramatic dramas of a highway bus heading to Kansas City, providing an effective mood for the film even before the credits expire. Conrad Hall's B & W photography works great from the start. <br /> <br /> Also clear from the start: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are natural representatives. They do a great job of photographing energetic friends looking for the next thrill. "Have you ever seen a millionaire fried in electric hair? Hell no, there are two rules in this world, one for the rich and the other for the poor," Wilson says. > <br /> Both methods were identified for the farm family and no mercy was shown and no witnesses were left. <br /> <br /> Blake, remembering the movies, is thinking about looking for gold in Mexico, as he says: "Remember Bogart in the Sierra Madre Treasure?" (A cynical moment, because Blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets). "I've linked you to a natural killer," Wilson told Blake. <br /> <br /> John Forsyth is one of the main investigators in the case, and discovered that all four members of the family were bound, and were wounded in the head. One was cutting the throat. "Do not people close the doors here?" Paul asks Stuart. "They will do tonight," this is the brief reply. <br /> <br /> After the killings, the killers discovered that there was no "big fat safe in the wall," as the prison informant told them. So, in the end, it was really a stupid stupid crime. The question is: Why did they do that? This is something that the second half of the film explores deeply. The film takes an hour and a half before interrogators kill the killers and begin questioning. <br /> <br /> These final scenes are the most condemnable and most interesting when telling the kids that they have made many mistakes and left a living witness. Actual events are saved until the kill including the end. "No sense," Blake tells Forsythe. "Mr. Cutter was a very nice man, I thought so well until he cut his throat." The scenario of Richard Brooks is somewhat concise - and so is his direction. <br /> <br /> Summarizing: A wonderful portrayal of two guys aimlessly on a crime spree that was not feasible at the time or now for just $ 43. Relax.
