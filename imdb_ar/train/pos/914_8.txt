Vivah is by no means a classic. But on hard working days, special leading effects and complex passages (none of which Bollywood has mastered yet), it's very refreshing to watch a simple film like Vivah. The story as we all know is the journey from the first meeting of the couple to their wedding in the end after some shy moments and test times. No more, no less. Music is not exactly in the same league as the MPK or HAHK but does not excite your senses either. Two songs stood for me - Mojhi Haq Hai & Anjan. While Milan Abhi and Hamari Shady were buzzing. A martyr leads faithfully and shows a lot of potential. It's good to see him play something else but the "gentle dude" usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a small-minded girl in the city. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are fantastic pillars and the rest of the staff do a reasonable job. Surge direction is simple but effective. The main drawback in the film is the slow speed that may test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all a good family film, clean and decent.
