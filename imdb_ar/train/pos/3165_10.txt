This was one of the greatest and most comical plays that hit national television. It is unfortunate that the show has not been put between the big sitcom where it really belongs. The actors did a great job and the seasons were six through the show at its height. Although the seventh season was not fantastic compared to the previous six, it was still funny. The eighth season was the real problem that arose. Without allowing Topher or Ashton Kutcher, the show simply collapsed. Also, the other actors were not wonderful if two main characters, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderrama, Kurtwood Smith, Debra Joe Robb, Mela Kunis and Laura Prybon (Don Starks and Tommy Chung were very cool), showed that it would have the same effect. The inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) also did not help because he was not well received by the show's fans. I think if the show is over a year ago, it's sure to go down in history as a great sitcom. The eighth season was a bit boring but the finish was excellent. I will be out of the program, I hope to wake up one day to find the show has returned because the show of the eighties with the same actor because I will miss the hell.
