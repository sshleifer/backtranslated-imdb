I was surprised that The Secret Fury was a good and enjoyable film ... maybe because I did not have any expectations for this movie ..... although the film contains holes in the plot ..... I would say that you can not guess who was behind The entire chart, until the end of the film ..... At first, I thought it was Robert Ryan, using the same way, like "Gaslight", where the husband tries to drive his wife crazy, but I was wrong ... ... the main problem, with the film , Is driving in a completely different direction, which did not provide any evidence at first. ..... I thought that Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert carried their parts well ...... In addition to Vivian Vance, a high-profile actress, steals the scenes in this film ... ... those who love movies, which keep you guessing, You will like this ......
