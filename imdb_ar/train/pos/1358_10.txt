Season after season, it seems that the players or characters in this show are people who hate them completely. Is this offer forged or selected for itself? Each episode deforms one person specifically and ends up killing. You enjoy seeing it cracking though it is completely wrong and satisfactory. You enjoy watching them deceive others, fool themselves, play dirty, recover and finally escape from Trump. The amount of tears seems to be increasing by this season. <br /> <br /> Rewards that try to compensate for humiliation and suffering have also shrunk dramatically in the past. In the newer chapters, such as "You can recognize the xyx that will bring you around the UV" .. Like who cares? The characters are hateful, collective and individual, so much so that you wonder if the actors are paid? The only wise person gets to win. <br /> <br /> Watch carefully and keep your conscience. These are your fellow human beings in the line of fire.
