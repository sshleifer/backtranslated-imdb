Here is the real eccentric for you. It starts with another launch on the PSYCHO shower scene, on campus, and then gets madder when several students and their old friends go south for the spring break. The problem begins when they lead the car to a renegade county ruled by Sheriff Dean. One of the college cuties wandering around in the forest, witnesses a murder at the hands of a sheriff, and her head blown open. After that, it allows you to run the MACONY LINE line, where the brigadier stalks and picks up and slaughters witnesses who do not realize one thing after another. Tony Marsh on goal as the happy bad Dean. The overall film tone is really annoying. The end is very sudden, and you think the director ran out of film; it's also a study of despair. GRAVE GRAVE must be a bad thing for the wrong eyes and the envy of women and the nihilists around the world.
