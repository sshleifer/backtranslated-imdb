An excellent explanation of Jim Thompson's novel, this new thriller contains all the elements required - the abandoned former boxer who has become a wanderer, the alcoholic widow of evil desires, the former cop turned into a little time crook, and a death-plot plot. However, the film never crosses the vulgar country, but it remains refreshing and intriguing. All the performances are wonderful, especially the role of Bruce Dern as a wicked weapon, Uncle Bud. There is a state of extreme uncertainty about the motion of the film which, intentionally or not, adds to the gloomy actions. Highly recommended.
