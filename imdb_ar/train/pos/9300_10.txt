I do not know much about Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed to be full of myself. So when I call this one of my dear ones, it has nothing to do with the mentality of the tribute band. As another critic says, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism and not realism. It is kafkaesque (it is unfortunate that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest among the very strong crowd, when he was as good as Joseph K), he is classy and knowledgeable, irony and tile. Jeff Goldblum walks around in a variety of characters, trying not to shoot and act skillfully instead of blurry, trying to stay informed of what he knows and others do not, who can sneak into him and those who can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfus (his best performer) have a ball, and the support team gives immediate support. The icons and settings (the individual outdoor movement with Sir Jeff Gold Bloom in really strange steps after much of the Lizard Lounge), and dialogue (style, not practicality, is the order of the day), all about the characters that interact, are not really gangsters. Fun to watch, it must be fun to do. What critics have been reaching is really a mystery ...
