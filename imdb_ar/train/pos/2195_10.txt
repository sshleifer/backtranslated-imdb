loved it! Fred McMurray is as wonderful as Skid Johnson, who is somewhat cocky and proud at the same time of a very weak saxophone player who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always with him. They meet in Panama after Maggie arrives in a ship and ends up in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony pierces her nose after insulting Maggie by thinking that she is a loose woman - all because she has taken off her hat in public places. Big fight and Maggie ends up stuck in Panama. romantic. Carol and Arthur are wonderful together. Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her. Urging him to go to New York where (see the movie well and discover it). They have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while playing saxophone. Definitely recommend it.
