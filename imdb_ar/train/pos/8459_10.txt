I'm not a fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam suite lacks all the typical melodrama you might think of when you think of the anime, as the number of jokes released within the 17 hours will only be in the double digits, where Gundam Wing comes to work. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is as much a political thriller as a series of movies. The big parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of the war, not just the battles. Although the animation of the battle lacks maximum detail in cases where it may be merely pain to move it, individual gendarmes are almost artistic in view of the moving use of complex mechanics and fast movements. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, this 49 series of films was selected in addition to a series of films in 2000, also called professionals. Dubbing is simply flawless. Not only does each word match, but sounds are really used to make characters more believable. Many believe it is best to watch anime with submarines in English, but simply do not have the resolve to do so. <br /> <br /> Sounds are not only good, but the result used in the series is very impressive. I will just say that she left me wandering around in the net to find a clip. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what will really carry viewers, and you do not like some dramas such as Lost that were just for your installation. Explain the plot deeply will lead to many spoilers, because many characters do not even have so many names of episodes in the series. The cruel idea of ​​this series is that the Earth and its independent space colonies now have difficulty maintaining peace. Thus began the war, resulting in military coups and complex diplomatic positions. I feel that any further details will begin to give up information, which is critical to the plot. <br /> <br /> I will conclude here by saying that this series is fantastic for anyone who likes anime, anyone who thinks that every anime is stupid (they have good reason to think about it) and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it.
