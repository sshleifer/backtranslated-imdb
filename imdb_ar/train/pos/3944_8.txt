This little film has long been on the list of "guard". Do people realize how women with severe abortion and menopause (as well as mentally retarded) were treated by the medical profession at the end of the century ?? !! All the Christian attitudes that were then perfect were deadly to explore TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace sick souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) that Walt Whitman wrote that he had been banned because he admitted that women had feelings and such emotional reactions as a man? think about it! Still the sensitivity of this film makes me take credit for the director to catch it through his eyes.
