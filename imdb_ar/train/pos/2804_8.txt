The title of this film almost drove me out of sight. I was not a fan of Manchester United, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit slow, but I put my biases back and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from the film, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie accelerated with me looking at my watch, I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you love the East is the East you will love this movie. Well, the new narrative is not new, and the classic narrative is contained in the film, but it's all very enjoyable, and in the same fresh air. The movie moves very quickly and maintains an entertainment experience. Sometimes the funny moments are a good chuckle, not a bad attempt at humor, and best of all, it's a good British comedy.
