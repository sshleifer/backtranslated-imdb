In one of her first films, she starred as a young Queen Victoria from Britain, suddenly becoming the throne at the age of eighteen, learning to rule despite the machinations of politicians, and eventually marry romances and married Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (though surprisingly true to real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Seeing this film about the British royal family spoken in German adds to its fascinating charm. On this front, one wonders why an Austrian film about an English queen was produced; but then one remembers that in 1954, Austria was still under occupation by Allied forces, including British troops. This may have been one of the reasons for this film.
