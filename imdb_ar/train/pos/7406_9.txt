Very different subject treated in this film. A clear and simple description of the local Chinese customs, by looking at the daily operation of the public bath, run by the old owner and his backward son, when the eldest son returns home, mistakenly believing that his father died. How every man in the city visits his everyday to chat, play games, discuss personal matters and get honest advice, along with the usual spa-like treatments. When an old man dies, strong and loyal family relationships make the eldest son bear responsibility, and thus the public bathing process is not disrupted. Finally, the update arrives to finish this way to spend comfortable and relaxing hours. The public bathroom must be demolished, allowing the establishment of a commercial complex.
