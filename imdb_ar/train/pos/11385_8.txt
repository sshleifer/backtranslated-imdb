This is your joyful and colorful MGM music since the early 1950s and it's definitely better to watch there. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly in Lead Lead. They both made some films together in those days, and it is likely that this film is their most famous film. <br /> <br /> The film itself actually won the Oscar for the best picture of the year, meaning it won films such as "Place in the Sun," "Streetcar named Desire," "African Queen" , "The Blue Veil," "The Death of a Seller" that year, a real achievement of course, but at the same time, there is a great deal of credit for this wonderful, bright and delightful film. When you see this movie, you will certainly enjoy it all, and it is also thanks to the film's beautiful color and many beautiful characters in this film. A great surprise when you have people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> <br /> But in fact, it was not possible to do everything that was told in this film in less than half an hour or so? , We already know where the film is heading, but it can still extend it for as long as possible, not because it makes the film pull in any part, but it makes it long, and it could have been produced with a few musical numbers. <br /> <br /> One of the best musical performances of MGM, which is flawless. <br /> <br /> 8/10
