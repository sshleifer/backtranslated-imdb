What can I say about this? It's another Hollywood film with a very high budget ($ 80 million). It is not scary at all, it gives us a few excitations and a real crawling of the skeleton in the fireplace. Special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones Beautiful As always, Lily Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture at Hill House is amazing, all these monuments, statues and furniture ... delicious! However I did not like the finish because she was very babe. Check out this one and shape your opinion on it. I gave this picture 7 out of 10.
