The film is recently shown on cable TV with disclaimer of any collaboration between real people; this in itself is an eye catcher. However, the script and representation of the main characters are wonderful and I found myself engaged all the time. A simple dialogue does not mean clear, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film revolves around a one-day encounter between real "legends" of music. It was previously written together and then separated. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that provides an explanation of the initial "division." The impressive thing is that the actors seem to present such realistic images of the characters they play, their mistakes, and all of them, so much so that at least this scene has left me thinking that I was witnessing a real event in almost every detail. The great skill of this play is that through the skillful writing and good representation of the film, which basically speaks of "two of us" can make an excellent picture. Worth at least 8 out of 10.
