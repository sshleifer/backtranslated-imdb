The 370-minute film was broadcast by Italian public television in the early 1970s. It tells you the legend attributed to Homer on a journey to Odysseus after the Trojan War. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Meissenian civilizations, listed 500 years after these events, circa 1100 BC. You will find that the sound is mono only and there is no language other than Italian, so that the caption is a document in Italian. Pity. Many people will enjoy this masterpiece if they have English translations. But if this is not a problem for you, I highly recommend watching this movie.
