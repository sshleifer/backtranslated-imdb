This film is another horror choir. It is fairly good, but it can be used a bit more. Compare it to "Dr. Horror House of Horror", although the title fits this topic. It has four floors all fairly connected to the house. The first story revolves around the transition writer and his wife. He creates a murderer for his latest novel, then begins to see the killer walking around his house. This type is predictable, but it casts some transformations in the end. The next story is somewhat unpredictable, and you really do not know where to go. This one features Peter Cushing and probably my favorite of a handful. This man buys the house, but it is not the home that is at the forefront, but it is a somewhat waxy museum. The third story begins fairly well characterized by Christopher Lee. This one has him as a somewhat strange father who seems to be an awful safeguard from his daughter. The problem is that once you know what's going on in the story does not end soon. It lasts a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion. Then the latest story relates to an actor buying a mantle from a strange little shop. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a little story about an officer who was seen all along trying to figure out what happened to this actor and then explaining why these things happened. Although I was not satisfied with the explanation because I do not think he explained the story of Cushing so much at all. I think they needed a little more background story for that story. All in all though it was an interesting collection of stories.
