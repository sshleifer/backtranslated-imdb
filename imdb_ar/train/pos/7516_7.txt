The first two thirds of this biography of the Betty Page model are very interesting. Betty stands out, as Gritchen Mall portrayed with great sincerity, as a kind of neighbor girl, did not see anything wrong with what she did (and certainly there was nothing "wrong" about it). Director Mary Haroon, who also created "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", is reestablishing Betty's America by blending old black and white stock footage with new, deteriorating black and white footage. Once Betty arrives in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, the color is introduced. Betty's reputation was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Claw (Lilly Taylor, in a superb performance, Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which Aaron recreates my home photography sessions are superb and brilliantly executed. The early financiers of fetish material are not portrayed too intensely, and we feel that these people were part of a "tightly knit" society. My home was not suffering from a notorious problem, although we had the impression that its reputation prevented it from gaining legitimacy in the world of direct acting. Since the third film does not really exist, we have the impression that we are watching a documentary film running on Betty Page instead of organized drama. Aside from the flaws, it is a film worth seeing and represents another wonderful feather in the hood of the product Christine Fashion.
