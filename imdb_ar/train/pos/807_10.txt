Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between the rebellion and the empire. The second star of death is nearing completion, and when it is completed, it will destroy the rebel coalition. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, who is now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agreed to lead the attack on Shield on the Moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian was driving the Star of Death. They only know that a great trap has been laid for them and that the emperor Balpatine himself personally supervises the construction of the second star of death. <br /> <br /> Gidi's return is my favorite in the original trilogy. I've got the excitement, drama, romance, wonderful battles, wonderful acting, amazing fighting scenes and great music for John Williams. Mark Hamel has just matured in Knight Gedi, and he is the naive farm boy and in his place Gidi was calm and comfortable, determined to save the galaxy. Lea is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie play their roles in Game T while James Earl Jones is still the greatest villain in the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian MacDarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutal Palpatine Emperor. The action series of this amazingly amazing film and sword battles are serious and bold. John Williams's score is still cool and the film is promoted at several levels. <br /> <br /> The Constant DVD Collector was signed
