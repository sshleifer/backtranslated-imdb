I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I love this film about Dan, a columnist who advises, who goes to his parents' house to stay with his kids and ends up loving his brother's friend. It's a story Roy narrated before, but not like that. There are simply a lot of small bits that make the movie too good. The cast is wonderful, and even if Karel is not a cup of tea, he is as good as a widower who is supposed to know everything but finds that knowledge is different from feeling and that life sometimes surprises you. Sometimes witty and wise in the way they can be by the annoying holmark card, the film still explains how it grows on you and becomes something more than a movie stream. Worth a look see
