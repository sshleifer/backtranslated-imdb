How I got into it: When I started watching this series on the Cartoon Network, I have to say I have never seen anything like it before, and it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS, and years later on the DVD part of the Anime Legends collections in Bandai. It was amazing, and really worth watching. He had a lot of explosive work that will blow you out of your seat. Of course, the best songs were "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions. <br /> <br /> Characters, and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin, Zechs. My favorite Gundams at the show, which I like most are Wing Zero, Epyon, Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> The meaning of the show: What this series tells us is that in real life wars are very difficult and we can win them Or sometimes lose, but it may be difficult to get peace, and I think the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing, trying to get world peace. <br /> <br /> However, this offer is really the best, so at the end of this To review, after watching this show, watched a movie "Endless Waltz".
