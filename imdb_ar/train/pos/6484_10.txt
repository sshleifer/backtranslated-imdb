I remember seeing this in the 1970s - and recently I used a few episodes of our public library. <br /> <br /> With a pause of about 30 years, I came to another conclusion. Most of the presidents interviewed in this series - some in power such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary) and Karl Doenitz (head of the German Navy), Anthony Eden (UK) - are long gone but their direct calculations will continue. From the generals, the admiral to the sergeant, the Russian civilians and the survivors from the concentration camps, are all registered here. <br /> <br /> I can remember the meeting of Lord Mount Patten (who was killed in the 1970s). <br /> <br /> It is really a jewel and I think Queen Elizabeth was active in this series. - Well worth it. <br /> <br /> Seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the collection. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" figure I've given any review but I've discovered such a wonderful bottle of wine, which is appreciated with little time ...
