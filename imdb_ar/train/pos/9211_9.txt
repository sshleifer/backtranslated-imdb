Action, Horror, Sci-fi, Director of Exploitation Fred Olin Rai shows that he has some talent as a director. Personal character William Smith is one of the best bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting acting in his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives me the best impression of Van Cleef. It's not bad in the film. Smith and Travis make the film. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stands. Ray has done a great job directing this shot, and Smith and Travis were good, and this Western B was given a scale of one to ten (best ten) seven.
