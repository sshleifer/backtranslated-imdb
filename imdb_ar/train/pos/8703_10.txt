I went to this movie after I read that it was a drama about a man who had a supernatural gift, which turned into a monster by the community. Suffice it to say that I expected something quite different from what I got. But it was a happy surprise. I and a friend thought that the film was very romantic (the fact that male lead is not bad when looking at help certainly), and there was enough plot development, work and even humor (the fact that it took up to the third part of the film so far the name of each other was laughing An entire film) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. In short: Not what I expected, but a very good surprise already. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
