The film was filmed at a location in Liverpool's Gerrard Gardens and was the UK's response to films such as "Blackboard Jungle". The film stands the test of time well, as all moral stories (or even more) are still relevant today. The film features some good performances from some prominent British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heewood. Baker plays the role of a Liverpool cop who has been assigned to call-up duties, with the assumption that if children are arrested at an early age, they will end up becoming responsible adults. Fred Fowl) and Malvin Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Shen and Michael Zhao play the role of brother and sister (two brothers and two brothers in real life), have signed into a deliberate network. Tsai Shin is still acting and can be seen in Nicole Kidman's latest film "The Interpreter". <br /> <br /> Violent Playground has an arms embargo in a school, so it's unlikely to be shown on TV following similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerrard Gardens where the film was filmed (although it was not born at the time), and I have wonderful memories of the area. She has recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens, including excerpts from "The Playground of Violence," and a small film "Coast to Coast" by British directors Lenny Henry and Pitt Postloit. The houses were demolished in 1987 and the films go a long way in preserving the vivid memory. <br /> <br /> There were some complaints from the population when the movie was shown, where the film area filmed in a bad light. Help time heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A small gem of a movie, I recommend that you look for this
