This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known dEUS group, will not be favored by everyone. For a simple reason is the lack of a clear story or even plot. This film is shown only 24 hours in "City" (here Antwerp) and allows you to see dialogues, output and humor (Dario !, osteopath Bruno! ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul) Garcin characters, ...). <br /> <br /> There are many memorable scenes: Windman on the beach, the dance party in the end, the KISS fan, Windman visiting the orthopedic doctor, ... <br /> <br /> It is clear that some viewers Others did not understand what was beautiful and fun in this film. They complain that this film has no story, etc., but the atmosphere that makes you watch it and will draw you to it. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is quite unusual like Tom Barman and his group dEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©." (do not tell any one)
