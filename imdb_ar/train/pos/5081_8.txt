This film was wonderful, and even with its less convincing ending, it is still worth watching. The film begins with Claudette Colbert approaching Robert Ryan's marriage. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, the man jumps and announces that Colbert can not get married because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they discover that "peace justice" and many others remember her wedding and even a signed wedding license! I hope, it becomes clear that Claudette's mind is falling back and that people around her are seriously complaining in her mind. Then, when the presumed first husband is killed, all the evidence and suspicion falls on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is an exciting mystery thriller, as what it has described so far is only the first half of the film. . The following is stunningly clever and captivating. Unfortunately, the conclusion, though, is a kind of regression, showing that the guiding force behind all this comes "out of the left field" - which is puzzling because it was very unpredictable and impossible to base on the information provided to the viewer. However, despite this, the film was very good, so I can excuse the end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as a "breach of the knuckle", although the other performances were also excellent.
