In fact, the effect of the video camera is just that, it's a very good effect. (You do not know much about making a movie?) It's fun to watch it, it's made for television, and it does not need to follow any rules. I have trouble seeing figure 1 because of the way the first annoying girl kills. All the time we go to Good Nelson to get away from him, we viewers are on his side. I hope to see one day a third cabin next to the lake but I doubt it. When you watch this movie, you can understand how to produce real movies, because this is somewhat like a movie inside a movie. Judd is one of the most feared villains, and he is more realistic. He does not cut people off their minds as he does in other atrocities.
