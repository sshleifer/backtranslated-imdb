I was delighted to see amazing stories in the first season on DVD. I have just forgotten what a wonderful group of actors and directors have done in this series. For the longest time, the only way to get to know this great series was with the VHS 2 or 3 rings groups or when Sci-Fi restarts the episodes. However, when Sci-Fi hosts reboot operations, they generally adhere to the same loops. There were a few notable episodes in season one like The Mission did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long the series ran? She says 1985 to 1987 at the top here in IMDb but I thought it lasted for longer than two years. If you like the Twilight Zone, the Night Show and the Outer Limits, you will love this series and will not be disappointed when you buy.
