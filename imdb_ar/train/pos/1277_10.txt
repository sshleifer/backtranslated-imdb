I consider this film the best film about Mike Hammer, with the performance of Elliott's Beef Ellie for the ultimate Mike Hummer. Harry Essex's text is excellent and contains many improvements to Mickey Spielan's novel. Its direction is strong and creative, and it uses good light and shade. The camera by John Alton is first class, as is the result by Franz Waxman. The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Biggie Castle in its unforgettable performance such as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the finest private eye films ever produced. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex have had more opportunities. I have always loved this film.
