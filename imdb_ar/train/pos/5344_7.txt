It's a very good Spanish film, but I worry that many people will be lost because many people from all over the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was or when it was fought. Being a history teacher, I got a big advantage but I could easily see how the film could be confusing until you've assembled all the pieces. I doubt that this is a major concern in Spain where this film was produced, but for other audiences they may be puzzled to later in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with 12-year-old Carroll and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. Years have passed and you are coming to Spain from New York City. Curiously, though, Carroll speaks in Spanish well, and much of the film revolves around how to adapt. The reason she and her mother are alone will be poured into those who do not enjoy the fact that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the Republicans (who eventually lost in this bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The movie gets exceptional marks for great camera work and music. The rather slow pace is not bad, provided you are someone who can accept movies this way. I have seen many other Spanish films about this war and this compares them well - not better or worse - just a decent slice of life film about those who left behind in addition to a nice fit of age. <br /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which side, the Republicans were mostly Socialists and was supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the USA). The nationalists led by Franco were assisted by Portugal and fascist states in Germany and Italy.
