It's been some time since I saw this LOTR. I'm currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is quite real in original work. The visuals are embossed and sometimes hurt. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the film is confusing or confusing. There are once or twice where the story line slows down to crawl. But, in general - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
