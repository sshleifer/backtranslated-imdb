Located in the middle-class neighborhood of Willard's fictional city in the 1950s, this dark comedy with light touches with American obsession such as mania with guns, violence and materialism, keeping up with Jones, fear of others, slavery, golf and getting rid of the dead. Yes, everything looks a bit heavy, but trust me in this, it is as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> The zombie is featured prominently among characters. Critical questions arise, such as: Who will become a coma (90% of Willard people choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns the number of zombies who bid like robots (has become a sign of social status)? What is the range of possible relationships that can be reached between the living and the dying type of incarnation? <br /> <br /> In a way, director Andrew Corrie, who also co-wrote the live script (with Robert Chomayak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this unlikely article leaking for an hour and a half without faltering once because of a lack of desire for a good laugh . Among the distinguished actors: Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Cherney, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonya Bennett, are the principal directors, with the help of young Kison Ray in Timmy's role, a innocent child with a good heart. . (After seeing her only in "Memento" and "Matrix", I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such wonderful comedies.) The production and music design of the 1950s is superb. Maybe this is not for everyone. Surely it will be a hard film to win by the annual Bizarro Award. But smart comics that remain funny from start to finish are among the most accomplished in filmmaking. For me anyway, "Fido" is shouted! My grades: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (viewed on 01/30/07)
