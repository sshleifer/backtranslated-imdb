The only other film alongside Soylent Green, which has an atmosphere of despair, is On The Beach. Both films deal with the consequences of species and planets resulting from human disasters. On the beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with environmental poisoning of the planet. <br /> <br /> There may be reason for some optimism because as of 2007 we did not get to any of the worlds described in those films we were supposed to be now. New York City has about 8 million people and not 22 million by the turn of the millennium as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always describe this film as emerging as a result of global warming. For me, it also shows the right ethic of life. It is clear that there is no family organization in this world as well. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a New York police investigator staying with his roommate Edward J. Robinson is old enough to remember the land before the disaster. A murder was committed, and Joseph Koten, executive director of Soylent Corporation, a multinational concern with a food product, is a kind of multi-colored chip to feed the world's population. It is the latest product of Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> The investigation reveals that Charlton Heston gets his leg, but it also leads to some terrifying facts about Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. While Heiston finally screams that Soylent Green is made of people, and that we have become a cannibal race, the awful thing is that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance of Edward J. Robinson In his memoirs, Heston spoke of Robinson impressively despite her different political views. . A few weeks after Robinson concluded this final scene from the demise of his agreed euthanasia screen, he died in real life. Many did not, but Histon knew that Robinson was fickle and there was no role in this final scene of death between the two. <br /> <br /> Although the schedule was closed, this does not mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not come. We hope not only have intelligence, but a sense of shared responsibility to prevent it from happening.
