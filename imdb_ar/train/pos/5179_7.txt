Indian Summer is a warm, multi-character film that will make a great afternoon film (with little editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past with a group of children showing Moose, who sets the tune just before going into the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp are invited back for a few weeks holiday by the president Camp, Uncle Lu. The film allows the viewer to spend time with these characters while remembering their time in the camp and creating new memories in their latest stay. <br /> <br /> The film works in a brilliant way that brings together its characters in this wonderful setting, allowing them space to evolve without worrying about the developments of the Earth. Watching these people reminds us, and their relationship with each other is what the film is about and why it works well. This does not go beyond the upper and melodramatic, while always maintaining warmth, magic and realism. I have never seen a film in which nostalgia is filmed well, and I found myself joining even though I did not go to one of these camps as a child myself. <br /> <br /> For a warm and nostalgic character film I sincerely recommend.
