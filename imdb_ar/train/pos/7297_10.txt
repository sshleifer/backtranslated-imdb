I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was awesome as was the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is known for. The only part of this flick was that I would change. The death of the creature was so terrible for the science fiction channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this film. It is clear that Jeff Combs played a Christian character and that the creature (or shark if you prefer) represents an anti-Chirst. There were some particularly scary scenes that were felt at the end of the world. I noticed this only after my third accidental feature of this classic creature. I know that many people will not get references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you'll get them.
