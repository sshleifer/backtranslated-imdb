Based on the idea of ​​Gackt, Moon Child signed in a poor country called Mallepa. In a future time frame, the story follows the lives of two main characters, Kelly (HYDE) and Shaw (Gakt) and their friends grow up together. <br /> <br /> Although some work may be excessive or even humorous, I strongly thought that this was a film about friendship. Even among all the difficulties between each character, in the end, each wanted to have someone beside them, to be their friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, a vampire hates the idea of ​​having to kill for life. Friendship vampire found in the hands of a small boy, Xu who is not afraid of Kei. No matter what some may think, I see Kei as a paternal figure of Shu. It was there that during Shaw's earlier life, I took care of him, and learned to live in a world where power reigns between gangs in their lives. On the other hand, Shaw, who may be seen as an innocent young man, has grown up to be a man who realizes that life is not about fun and games, that death exists and is capable of getting his loved ones out. . <br /> <br /> I loved the part where Lee Hom, the actor who played Sun, appeared for the first time on the screen. The way they met was really fantastic. Son also has a big role in this film, since he is of a different race, a Taiwanese, had a great influence on the subject of friendship within the film. The way in which friendships were developed despite the differences in the background was best portrayed in this film. <br /> <br /> I thought each actor did a great job since it was the first time that this big-screen movie had been shown. Both HYDE and Gackt were able to act well and create very reasonable characters. Unlike the movies that turned musicians into actors and filled the film with songs, they performed great acting roles! Moon Child has made a real impact for me. Friends have given new meaning and consideration, and we must appreciate all the friendship in our lives. The film shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad things that happen in their lives, but there is always hope. Life can be harsh, and hope seems to no longer exist. There is also a very strong sense of friendship between each other. Even when Sun became the enemy, Shu had a kind of fun in his last fight. Each of them wants peace in the end, no matter how far they have become. The end scene showed us.
