Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 1980s. It is a film that breathes through stunning acting and a very enjoyable directing touch. In Jacknife, European and American film lovers can find things about them. Scenario is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris offers one of the greatest performances to date. He depicts his alcoholic hero, making us feel his broken heart every line, every step. Robert De Niro makes us think of him again as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest and most realistic performances of his career. Jacknife never feels bored because she shows her heroes clearly in any typical Hollywood character elements. After the war there is no hero. Everyone is a loser, and this film revolves around this simple truth. No one can fix his boycott after the war, just like the heroes of this film. Jacknife revolves around the diseases of the soul created by war. Simply a great movie.
