He also made a television movie, this film was good. I was acting in it and the plot was very big. This was one of the only movies I saw that I felt distorted in my mind because after seeing him I was afraid of Reaper's arrival to kill me on the computer screen. There were some minor things wrong in this film, but it looked very easy. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabapato Jr. played an excellent role in this film along with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This film has a lot of suspense and made me want more because I never thought a low budget movie could be very powerful. After watching this, I read the novel on which this film was based (four times) and his kick was too big. If you see this movie appear on TV, I will see it. The effects in this film were good, and frankly I do not know what the slick person will look like but with the way the FX team did this movie I was impressed and all that shows is that all these bad things were made for TV movies there with low budgets should not suck badly Too. <br /> <br /> Watch it. It's really good, not really, it is!
