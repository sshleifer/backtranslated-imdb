The spoilers <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are considered classic cartoons, with an impeccable idea, and almost every one is a gem. Although I must say that this is definitely a shabby shorts compared to other Tom and Jerry classic shorts, there is no way you can hate this cartoon. Sure, it's understandable to say that this is one of the worst Tom and Jerry episodes first, and I can say that I agree, but the fact of the matter is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are wonderful, but some are just better than others. Well, this would suit the "others". <br /> <br /> Here's a Frydee Cat plot. Tom listens to a scary old radio, and is easily afraid. Jerry notices his fear, and tries to intimidate him more than he actually does. Creates terrifying dilemmas for Tom, and Tom fears his intelligence, and his life. Jerry then puts a paper over a vacuum cleaner and controls it, making it look like a ghost. Tom discovered that Jerry did all this, and chased him. Tom then bites the house maid by mistake. However, in the end Jerry ends up becoming a frightened person after seeing his reflection in a delicate cup. <br /> <br /> In general, this is far from the best Tom and Jerry abroad, but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time. Makes me wish there would be more cartoons like this. The puzzles and accents that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as they were in this short time, but she felt like something was missing in this. I felt slower than most Tom and Jerry pants. Anyway, this short is well and does not amount to some of the other caricatures of Tom and Jerry, but it is still nice. <br /> <br /> 7/10
