For the first time ever, this film has some exciting moments. In the best horror movie, your stomach stifles every moment during this movie. The finish is great. It is clear that the makers of Blaire Witch watched this film which ended and was not the end, but the beginning of the end. It is a wonderful film and only a large piece of Japan as much as the fear factor is the perfect result that makes you think and afraid of your mind.
