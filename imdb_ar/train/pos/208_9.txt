The Sunshine Boys is a wonderful comedy about former vodvils who reluctantly meet to get a private TV show despite the fact that they are paired with each other. <br /> <br /> A comic genius for two people at work, George Burns and Walter Matau astral! Some of the best scenes are when the duo fights over silly little trivial things! The materials are fast-paced and attractive in nature, appealing to all ages. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILER ALERT: There are some mild sad moments near the end of the film that deal indirectly with the effects of aging that give the film a soft, sincerity, tenderness that shows that what the husband really needs to succeed is the other. <br /> <br /> If anyone likes The Odd Couple, you will love this movie. Excellent movie!
