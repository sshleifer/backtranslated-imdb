Edit the book "Finding the Fish". This story revolves around a troubled young sailor Anton Fisher (Derek Locke) who tells a painful story of his past to psychologist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Great performance debut for Derek Locke and always stunning performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was great on many levels and I was disappointed because it did not win the Oscars, and I think it was because it was released at a bad time for that reason it was ignored. I highly recommend this film to everyone and will be influenced by his story, which really makes the audience sympathize with this young man who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like the real inspirational stories, then watch Anton Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
