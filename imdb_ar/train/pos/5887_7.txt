Even Mary and Roda have gone too far - who did not? I was a teenager when Mary was introduced for the first time and an "adult" when she left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Roo together, and yes, maybe the film did not keep the original comedy series, but there were enough moments remembered the spirit of the series to make this a proper honor. Example: The product that marries Mary then dictates the idea of ​​a new series about "Seniors." Is not this typical of Hollywood's current mentality and "Bean Counters?" This may not be the best MARY TYLER MOORE show - but a good look back at one of our best shows in the 1970s.
