Who has no unresolved problems with parents? Which of the parents have no unresolved problems with each other? <br /> <br /> I know this sounds heavy. But this is played in order to laugh in the film, making both comedy better and drama better. I've always loved Paul Reiser and Peter Faulk, and although I was a little worried that the qualities of their stars might be too great for a small film, I was fascinated by the first scene. <br /> <br /> Especially entertaining were the discoveries made by the son about his father as a person. Peter Peter's monologue was about being a hard worker, sacrificing father and husband an ideal balance point. Without acting this scene well, the film seemed much less accurate, and the character less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
