I recently watched the film at the Boston Film Festival. It was a very enjoyable film, something I believe in the world, and Black America is ready to see it. She has comedy, drama, and fantastic soundtracks. It's a good movie. The characters were well developed, and the film had a wide range of prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember Titans, Fully Paid), Brian White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and Drumline (Pirates of the Caribbean). The film deals with many related topics in today's society in a short period of time, and does so with class and grace. This is not just a story about hospital life, but a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are or who they will be.
