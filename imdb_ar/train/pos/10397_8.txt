The Thief Of Bagdad is a story in itself is almost as fascinating a story as it was in this film. Alexander Korda almost broke the industry of this film. <br /> <br /> According to the film series The Great Britain of Films, the son of the United Kingdom adopted by Alexander Korda adopted this film early in 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But World War II, unfortunately, captured Korda and the rising costs of filming a great scene. <br /> <br /> Budget costs also occur in American films, where Cecil B. Demel was the only one who had free access to Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But Demille or any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while filming. Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transferred the entire company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as a jackpot in our Grand Canyon. It certainly would not get a scene like this in the UK. Korda also finished Hollywood's interior designs, all in time for the Christmas Day release in 1940. <br /> <br /> A scene from The Thief Of Bagdad nominations received four Oscars and three Academy Awards for Best Color Cinematography, The best art and adjust the direction of the color film, the best special effects. The only result of the musical Micaos Rosa did not receive an award in the candidate category. Korda must be really happy to shoot at the Grand Canyon because it's impossible to get bad color photos from that place. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects do not overwhelm the simple story of good victory over evil. The good guys are John Justin and John Dobriz and the evil is Conrad Ved as the magician who tries to steal both the kingdom and the heart, which belong to Dobriz. This was the role of Vid career until Casablanca where he played the role of captain of the Luftwaffe team. <br /> <br /> Of course, the good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Born beggar Sabo Sabo, who was perhaps one of the few who were able to name himself at that time an international film star. He literally grew up in poverty and worked as the stable elephant boy of Maharaja Mysore, and was discovered by Alexander Korda who needed local leadership for one of his jungle features. Sabo captures all the innocence and harm of young people and fulfills the imagination of the Arab nights of the child who overthrew the tyrant. Not a bad message to be sent in 1940 in it. <br /> <br /> The "Baghdad thief" is holding up very well today. It is an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in any order you want.
