I just passed by watching this version of "Samhain", and although I still love it, it does not look like the "coarse" version I own. If you check the message board, you'll see an apology from the director about this short version, 79 minutes, and says it has nothing to do with this R-rated adjustment with a completely new twist. In fact, Christians do not need to be so important, because the essential elements remain, although severely reduced. This is a disgrace, because it was probably one of the most beautiful and best films in years. He still has porn stars, friends, and some of the extreme Gore can at least partially see. I'm just glad I got this "hard cuts", because to me, it's the jewel of any jeweler's library. Christianville certainly has the skill and vision to deliver the goods, and we hope that his next project will be produced better. The classic idiots were in their hands, so screwed it all up. Samhain may have been one of the most controversial and ill-conceived horror films ever, and poor poor people could not see what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just so you know what you missed, this is my assessment based on "work print" of SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> The film runs for more than 90 minutes and does not stop. There is no soundtrack at all, and some scenes have no sound in the dialog box, because I think it should be repeated later. However, most of the movie contains a sound with sound effect, when there is an effect or a scene is missing, a message appears as a guide for insertion when the movie is complete. It's exactly as he says, "Rough Cut", but the only unrestricted version of "Samhain" you're likely to see. The reason, because of a very large fee, is more than the NC-17 version allows. Yes, there are a few porn stars, but they exist just to kill, add a little sugar and spices. The story is very ordinary, American tourists on holiday in Ireland and end up staying in a house in the middle of the forest. A heavy area on folklore, including the old priests and the celebration of the name, or as we call it Halloween. (Spooky) <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a large dose of Gore, where a couple is attacked by a local fungus. This is a wonderful scene, where the man finds his girl hanging from the cliff, crying for help. All he sees is her head, arms and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he lifts them, she was completely cut into two parts. That's what I can call EXTREME GORE, with my bosom, blood, and limbs cut all over. We are in the land of Herschel Gordon Lewis here people, but the effects seem much more realistic. I will just skip the story, because it is a standard and falling conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The next body scene is something to watch, as her boyfriend is taken from the first murder to a site-like cave (TCM-2 objects) and is attached to the table. This geek then separates all the limbs (from the camera, with a signal to insert a scene), then sees his trunk on the barbecue pit, slowly turns over the fire, and hits the trunk strongly (if you can believe it). Yes, taste is very bad, gross, heinous, you'll find the right word, and maybe it will be appropriate as well. <br /> <br /> Then later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, was cut from the neck to the crotch, all her guts are pulled into the graphic glee, and her blood drains into the bowl. Delicious, real turn on huh? <br /> <br /> But the best gore scene happens inside the house and I must admit, this is one of the best gore sights I've seen. This guy (no matter who) had been caught from behind by a maniac, and opened up at the ass hole. The geek then puts his hands and destroys all the men, intestines, and what the hell is there, straight from the asshole. This continues forever, as the man screams, more and more crowds are pulled from his position on the floor of the bathroom. This is very extreme, even at the top, I found myself laughing at hell. Obviously, you will never see this scene on a suitable DVD, IMO, along with most other really extreme scenes. <br /> <br /> So, what do you think of all this. Well, first and foremost, although I doubt that this film will be shown in this never-sliced ​​presentation, it makes "Rough Cut" a rare gem of wounds. Yes, it is a bit difficult at first, with no soundtrack, and there are still some scenes still to be included, credits that lack names everywhere. But that makes it unique, and I will not sell it for now. Extreme Gore, Yes Yes, Extremely Extreme Gore. This makes the "tension stress" look like a Disney movie.
