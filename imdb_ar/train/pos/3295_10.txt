A film of beauty is hard to describe. Perhaps it is the absence of unnecessary dialogue, or perhaps stellar soundtrack, or perhaps the feet of Mina Mumari only, but it is happy to watch this movie again and again. I have never seen another Indian film approaching him, and few countries compete for perfection.
