UC 0079, the war ended almost one year. A neutral colony of Side 6 was targeted by Cyclops, a task force of Zeon. Their goal, the new Gundam is built exclusively on the Newtypes (presumably supposed to be a Murray Ray of the original Gundam epic) from the inside. When the little boy, Azurouha, a fan of Zeon MS, confronts Zacko after the battle breaks out in the colony, he approves MS-new pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two became close friends, treating each as an honorary member of the giant team. Through the show, Bernie works as a father figure for Al (who is always his real father) and appears to have been escorted by Unionist Christina McKenzie, but in the end they must meet ... in battle. He will soon learn that war is not a child's game, and Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For just 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a good show. Mobile phone suits are designed very well, and the animation may look old but already show the feelings in the characters. If you like 0083 and check it out, or if you're new to Gundam, this is a good offer to start with. If you are looking for a show to develop drama and characters, this is the right offer for you, it focuses more on the battle of the mobile suit. I would like to make it a drama rather than a movement. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
