He ran from 1959-1973. It has more longevity that says a lot about this series. He also survived changes in fashion and taste of 50, psychedelic 60 and remained popular in 70. <br /> <br /> I remember repeating this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements of stories, actors and poems that made it exceptional. Lauren Green was his character in this series. It was attractive across generations. The whole family can enjoy this. She balanced ethics with violence and humor seriously. A series of animations was produced as an accidental solution to this effect as a result of its effect. Shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its importance.
