Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neil) received a new girl, Azaria. As Seventh Day Seventh Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day, and soon devote themselves to God in their church, with two older people. Michael gets a holiday and the family decides to head to Ayer's Rock, one of Australia's most impressive attractions. Do not be wealthy, family camps near the site. After the first wonderful day, Lindy puts her baby Azaria to sleep in a tent. Suddenly you hear Azaria crying. As Lindy dashes into the tent, a dog emerges from the dingo and shakes his head. The child disappeared soon, as well as the dingo. Although the whole camp is looking for a child, it has not been found. In conclusion, she died and the Dingo set off with their beloved child, Chamberlains struggling to accept God's decision and go on with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets dramatic coverage in the media and soon the story is spread that Lindy killed the child. She was later arrested and brought to trial. How can this happen? This is a wonderful illustration of the real events that show how "mob rule" is not fantasy. The whole country turns against Chamberlain, in part because they are strange. Streep offers her best performance at all as she works Lindy's complex, whose strong will acts against her every step of the way. Neil, likewise, does a wonderful job like Michael hesitant and confusing. The cast is one of the greatest actors ever, with people throughout the country portraying their work in the Lindy case. Fashion, scene, scenario, direction and production are all in the foreground. If you have not seen this movie before or heard about it, you should address it immediately. It is not far from reality to say that this "cry" must be seen by all who care about the film and the power abused in the media.
