I have seen this movie many times and I tell you, I enjoyed it every time. This is a Belushi film at the height of my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are very lovable and can be identified with ordinary men so you can not help but engage as soon as you start watching. The film has an impressive array of stars, some of them already large, others just beginning. Tagged as a good movie, that's exactly what it is. This film teaches you that life is not always too bad. Sometimes, you just have to look at things from a different perspective to estimate what you already have. When you're done watching, you'll appreciate much more stuff and you'll also be smiling. You can not ask for more film in my opinion, not to mention that it is a hilarious movie and will never lose interest. Not very disrespectful people here. <br /> <br /> Rating from me: 10 I'm out!
