Emma is a true love story. If you like silly things, loaded with intelligence and folly, you'll love this movie! This is true for the novel, which is very important, with some added twists and turns for fun. Gwen is not one of my favorite actors but she does justice to the role that requires everything she has to offer in the Bastogne. It lights up in a role that I think there is no other representative that can achieve the right justice. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northham, as a hero. How shocked you? I have never seen him as an openly handsome but heck! What the right role can do for you! He looks as good as Mr. K, so wise, that I look at him literally in a new light. He makes excellent romantic driving. The magic and personality he brings to his role is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Saatchi brings the rest. Good cast. New Movie. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie, along with pride and prejudice - and more importantly, buy books. It enhances the film to extraordinary heights
