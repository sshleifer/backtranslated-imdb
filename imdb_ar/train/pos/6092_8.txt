Cult classics are almost impossible to predict. Who can guess that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: A Space Oddysey, the films that both critics and audiences have captured when they are released, will become enormously popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike the majority of those who hate Envy (as shown by the dismal 4.4 rating), Envy has been found to be one of the most entertaining movies of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The movie plot is silly. The dialogue is not smart, and the viewer has little continuity, and the script seems to be written in the fourth row. But that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious. As you can see, in order to appreciate the genius of the occasional Envy, you should enjoy the film from a separate point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I like Envy? Because the film is so bad it becomes good. This recipe for the word cult classic, envy certainly fits the bill.
