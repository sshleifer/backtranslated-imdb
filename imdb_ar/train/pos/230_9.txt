When I first saw this movie on the cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I am a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duval. The film paints an accurate picture of the South and racist attitudes. Most of the positions came from Seoul, an old farmhouse that used convicts at work. Soll is what makes the move, giving us ridiculous jibes about the way the South was at that time. I assume that if Sol lives today, Alzheimer's disease will be diagnosed. However, his attitudes towards a young boy come to work for him and the convicts are lost. While he has racist views, he has grown to trust some black convicts. The most convicted of them are Jackson (Mill Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). Ben-Sol talks are the best in the film, they contain real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mile Winkler both have fantastic performances as well as Haas. <br /> <br /> This movie was supposed to be more famous. However, it is on a DVD and is worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
