The daughter's words are poetry: "I can not spend another year. "I lost my blue scarf in a sea of ​​leaves." "The marble animals are moving ... We have given us a washing machine, this is the deal." "I crushed this last thing." ".. dogs and cats become a little boring for a very long time." ".. no small rat nest, mouse hole I like better." There is wisdom in the mother's words: "... Yes pleasure is all I have." "This little book will keep me straight and straight like a pig." "Always one has to do everything correctly." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me the little radio I have to get some professional music." "I'm your mother." The relationship between mother / daughter is drawn in this wonderful film. This is a Mother's Day movie.
