We, as a family, were very happy with "The Last of the Blonde Bombshells", we bought a copy of our home video library. <br /> <br /> Representation is A1 and the actors have many favorite actors and singers. The subject is unusual and the script is well written. Music / songs are good for all times and bring us back to the days of our youth when we sang songs at the top of our voices. The spotlight on the story here would spoil the "plot" because it is really good to sit and enjoy the story when it unfolds. <br /> <br /> The full marks of this production are most enjoyable and uplifting, and we highly recommend anyone looking for belly laughter and lots of music.
