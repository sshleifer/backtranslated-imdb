"Bruce Almighty" seems incredibly stupid, especially from trailers. However, I found a deeper message that made me love this movie more. Bruce (Jim Carrie) is angry with God and gave him divine powers to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man who is symbolized here as God, and although he is not one of his usual films or one of his best roles, he has mastered what he has to work with. Although sometimes the movie is sometimes harsh, it laughs a lot at Bruce, who separates his soup into two halves like the Red Sea and the customer's reaction to him, as well as the cute and full-fledged Freeman. Overly exaggerated sometimes, there is some raw humor, but overall it can be fairly funny. There is a decent support team, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Karel, which always helps. Prove the end of the film that it is very romantic and shaking tear, the message is clear, we must do what God called us to do and "be a miracle." The film is far from perfect, but it is still fun, much better than I expected and probably many people, especially if we see the deeper message of the film. <br /> <br /> *** From ** **
