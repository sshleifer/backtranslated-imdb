This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say that you should start from the start but I must say that I was a bit confused from the start! <br /> <br /> Clark is struck by a blow to the head and wakes up on the grounds of Fairview Mountain Foundation and ridicules the belief that he is a supernatural hero. Clark was told that the life he knew was in his head. Phantom. He also found some unusual things: Martha married to Lionel. Lex is connected to wheelchairs with broken limbs after his accident on the bridge; I am dedicated to Clark. But he finds one knowledge. Another person dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that the mental patient also belongs to the well-known world of Smallville. The doctor is a fugitive from the Phantom area. <br /> <br /> Remember this episode by going straight back to the Buffy episode "Normal Again", where Buffy starts daydreaming about a mental refuge. The doctor tried to convince her that everything I knew was part of her imagination and that she was really crazy. Her parents were still married, still living in Los Angeles, her friends were not there, her boyfriend's gospel was never, and she had no sister named Don. Demons and vampires also did not exist. Both cases are a little sad because doctors not only tell the characters that they are all a fantasy of their imagination but tell us what it really is: imagination, and bring us back to reality. It is nice to have a sense of reality from time to time, but we see these offers to escape from reality. It is nice again because the characters must overcome the new challenges.
