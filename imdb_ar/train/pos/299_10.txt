Peter Bogdonavic has designed a bunch of really wonderful films, and they laugh at his best films. The crew can not be better equipped to operate this light but the spiral comedy is a little sweet. Interestingly, Bogdonavic's touch-and-intelligence game, which employs effortlessly, gives the film a somewhat disturbing emotional core. Fresh and immediate, the film begins with no explanation at all. There is no soundtrack to teach us. We meet the characters at work, and as Bogdonavitch slides down the streets of New York, the film unfolds without bother. The Robby Muller camera is simply a little under-valued and seemingly unintentional, but it certainly is not. The cast is wonderful. In all, classic.
