After you see Vertigo, then watch Bell, Book and Candle, which is created within months of each other. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's second film, with Picnic, comes in third. <br /> <br /> All three shows are great, Vertigo, being the best, all of them. <br /> <br /> They came to my country anywhere in Kansas Prairie, near Salina, in Kansas in the 1950s, to photograph, Picnic. <br /> <br /> I think Bill is a book and a musical one from Alex North. Perfect for this part of the comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, have made this comedy, it's fun to notice the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It is worth your time, if you love Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
