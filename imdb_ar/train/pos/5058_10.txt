There should be more films about Native Americans. I think in particular that the use of genuine Native Americans will be the right thing. I know that Archie Bellani, played by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job of filming that character, because he was an Englishman. But my proposal for Hollywood is to put more American Indians in roles and not to use anyone else. Sioux Nation has put on the back burner a long time. Their poverty is a disgrace to our country. I firmly believe that our country must return the Black Hills to Sioux. We ask Israel to return their land to the Arabs, but we make no effort to do the same, we must be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
