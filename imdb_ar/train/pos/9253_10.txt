Well, the film is not quite "funny". <br /> <br /> Well, I admit, there are some fun lines, but certainly there is nothing very funny. For example: before a sexy sexual scene between Eliniac and one of her male designers, Sh is tied to the base of the bed and can not remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he told her, "Well, do not go anywhere." <br /> <br /> See, humorous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> Plot and representation is very good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Ilniak certainly steals the show. It is hot and exciting, and there is a scene saturated with steam can only rewind and re-seen. <br /> <br /> There are also some other exciting scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines. <br /> <br /> In general, 5 stars. I will give him only three if not for Erika Ilniak.
