Who was imagining - Hal Hartley creates a natural result of the film Syriana while maintaining his distinctive style. Fusion is very fun. <br /> <br /> After watching Hull Hartley for about a decade, I treated this with caution. His impressive production of the 1990s has impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialogue. The director's previous films screened colorful characters and offered close observations of life - often in Long Island, New York or New York City itself - that were bizarre and insightful. <br /> <br /> My initial caution stems from the description of this film as a "spy film". To my delight, Hartley has been able to combine his firm style and focus to produce a very original drama of international intrigue. It works in many ways you imagine. Hartley's film retains dialogue and personal focus, which is his trademark, along with a unique cinematic style. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is very appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that the dark elements have taken care of in all aspects. Hartley brought all his skills into something new - a political film worth mentioning in the same movie as Syriana. He really is coming to his country. The team does a good job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see them with their full neglect here, and they are still more mature and wonderful with us than before.
