Exaggeration in Representation by Leslie Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and the love scenes in the clothing warehouse are second to none. Corn on a classic face, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. Taking on the bar is also fantastic. After being accused of entertaining, the boss sells, and loses lawyer Pepto Bolt ignores "I am a lawyer" says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambour, the favorite candidate for the subsequent Larry Sanders program, is also wonderful here as a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the Jewish Quarter. His personality is more hateful than usual. The scene of the hospital, and the scene where the displaced invade a demolition site, are classic throughout the ages. Look for the sight of the legs and the two large battleships fighting (one bleeding). This film improves every time I see it (often).
