Nice to do. A lot of anxiety. Friendship may not bear everything, but in the end everything matters, or so you learn a group of friends. I've seen it over and over again. The music is amazing as well. When Kei lost his only friend, he surrendered until he met Sho, the orphan boy who was not repelled by his true nature. In the lawless streets of Mallepa, struggling for their own place in a melting pot of Asian racing, and learning that sometimes being at the top can cost you more than you're willing to pay. Surprise ending in control of the entire movie. I could not get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde are doing great acting, proving that they are more than just beautiful children singing.
