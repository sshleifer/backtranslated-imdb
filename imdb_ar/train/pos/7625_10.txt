Although Kurt Russell was probably the closest person who looked like Elvis in a business show, many things were wrong in this film. First of all, the filmmakers claimed that Elvis opened his famous live show in 1969 after nine years in filmmaking by wearing a white jumpsuit made in 1972. They also claimed that he sang "Burning Love," which first appeared in 1972 And "Ijbek", which he first recorded in 1970. They also claim he got his first guitar on Christmas when all Elvis fans knew he got it on his birthday. I know that all past-based movies have something wrong but these things are very clear to people who love Elvis.
