I may have liked this movie a lot because I was comfortable in the dumps and it's a fantastic little fantasy story. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Wonderful story, clever, beautiful effects, excellent representation (especially De Niro, which is wonderful). This movie has made me happier than I have been for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and intelligent movie. The constant humor of the Kingdom's history of the Prince's brutality and beyond, and the way in which you indulge in magic affect the witch and dozens of small smart touches all kept me charming. This is a lot of making it good; it's a fine film full of special effects with a story more than most fiction films, yet there's incredible interest in small things. <br /> <br /> I feel like going forward and watching it again.
