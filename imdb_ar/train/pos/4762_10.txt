I thought "The River of the Souls" was a very good Babel 5 film, with some special performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Skogens and Ian MacShane. If this episode of the series (without humor) will probably be one of my favorite independent stories of this series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I always prefer to have Scugens on Christian, although I have been granted not written by JMS also in much of the series and had to bear the Byron / Telepath plot. If you get out of the bad humor about the brothel and the "poorest" actors in those scenes, this film will be powerful. Probably my third favorite of the four films, but by no means bad at all.
