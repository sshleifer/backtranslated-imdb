I have read humility Belize for several years now, collecting numbers from the tape. After the failure film that was produced several years ago based on the first book Modesty Blaise, I was surprised by the result that I got well. <br /> <br /> What I got was a film that was not based on action or violence. The director has focused on history and psychology. How humility was created based on the story and the parts of her life that were affected by her infancy. I think these ideas will give a better understanding of the next film (I hope). I simply liked the old fashioned movies. <br /> <br /> However, not everything was good, but the gambling was not good. Almost boring and unrealistic. Representation can also be improved. I do not think that the bad person in this film felt the reality, and the only reason for his existence was that humility could be someone who tells his story. They could also expand the movie, and show more about the time of building the "grid", but I think this film follows. <br /> <br /> Please forgive me for my bad English.
