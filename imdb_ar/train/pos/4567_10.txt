My left foot is a wonderful epic film explaining the life and times of Christie Brown, who suffered from cerebral palsy, severe disability and used only his left foot, but was defiant, and managed to become an artist and writer against all odds <br /> <br /> I saw This film many times and every time I see it, I find it wonderful every time. I wonder how this amazing film did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture, it's a shame of academic awards. For me, Jim Shirdan is one of the greatest directors in the world. Scenario music, music and anything else excellent in this movie. As the movie progresses, you will almost feel that you are in a brown house where everything happens. Ray McNally and Brenda Fricker are both as fathers of Christis and Fiona Shaw as masterful as Dr. Ellen Cole, who helps Christie in his battle for challenge. <br /> <br /> The Irish film industry was referring to its name before my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in the Irish film. Extremely powerful and wonderful movies like Field, Crying Game, Father's Name and Michael Collins, followed my left foot. These Irish films were highly acclaimed throughout the world and were nominated for multiple Oscars and won each other, a wonderful Irish film period. My left foot is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day Lewis plays the well-worn role of Christie Brown, and the same applies to Hugh O'Connor, who plays young Christie. These two shows are one of the best film shows ever, especially the performance of Daniel Day Lewis, whom I consider Anthony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel Day Lewis has proved in his career that he is a wonderful actor. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent masterpiece in the film, watch it!
