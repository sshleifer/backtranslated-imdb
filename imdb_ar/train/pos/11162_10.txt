Raoul Walsh The High-Power Classic Since 1933, The Bowery, the owner and owner of the Wallace Beery, has been fighting against his bitter rival, Dandy George Raft, with adopted street child Jackie Cooper and Faye Wray. It is not entirely clear what competition is about, but everyone follows it in the daily papers. Lots of anecdotes at first, but the characters enjoy the progress of the film. Apart from that, there is a great abundance of scenes in the Perry Salon. The various characters, the sexy chorus line, a lot of drinking, the perfect creation of the religion of iniquity are not greatly inhibited by the so-called preset code restrictions, and then come the Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation itself. All this creates a very vivid picture of a long-gone life. I do not like comparing ages, but this film is completely different from anything one sees today. The film has a lot of heart and innocence lost for a long time which is a must see.
