I have no doubt that Victor McLaughlin won the Oscar for best actor for this film because of a tripartite split between "Motney on the Bounty" by Clark Gable and Charles Logton and Franceshot Tun who all participated in the same race. But the detective is still a great film because John Ford would not have been awarded the Best Director for Oscar if not. There is no split in his prize. <br /> <br /> The film and story by Liam Oflherty, based on the simple simplicity of a man named Ghibo Nolan, was formerly a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was dismissed from the fund because of some imaginary trick he had withdrawn and wanted to return to. He got to the latter and if he could not come back, he wanted enough to go to America. There is a 20-pound reward for the information that led to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhelep played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness, he goes to Black and Tan and tells McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is keen to find out who has cleared McPhillip out and they are sure he was McLaglen. He did not have the wit to cover his own paths. Makes a weak effort to involve another man, Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Mick. He also chose a comprehensive relationship played by J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The entire Informer event takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about 6 pm to early morning. It is necessary to shoot it in the dark and shadows, making it perhaps the first impressive film. If this were done after World War II, the detective would have been classified as a great classic of lights, such as Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which is very unlike him. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this great world. He took some time during the rebellion and was in Ireland at that time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name was Sean Overnan, his brother before he materialized. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays Irish Republican Party leader Dan Gallagher. In Gallagher's book he is the toughest man and less than his Foster here. I think John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic figure to give film fans some solid attention. Explains that Foster must get rid of the detective because Black and Tans will pick him up and get out of him a bit more and put the whole organization at risk. <br /> <br /> The IRA trial scene is a highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Mick whether he recognizes the power of their court, Mick is not in a position to say no. The King's justice does not work and is written here. This is illustrated by a statement at that stage, despite the occupation of the army and staff, the British have already lost their grip on the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, the detective story is somewhat bleak and John Ford's touches, but less than what you'd expect. Although McLaglen spends his money at drunken intervals, the IRA always remains in the shadows watching him and counting everything away. <br /> <br /> The Informer is a good story about Ireland in a dark and gloomy time.
