This film was excellent, a bit scary, but excellent in it. For those of you who have heard about Columbine and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. In the back of your mind you know that people think about these things, but you never realize how damaging they are, and this film makes you realize that. It's serious just fine. It also makes you think twice before making fun of a certain person. I read a book about the Colombian massacre and made me think, this film makes me worried and scares me to death. On the downside looks like how to kill a person's guide to serial killers. I received a threat recently, and I blew it up and did not think about anything, but after this film, I think you should take everything seriously. Some people feel crazy and you do not really know what they are, so take it seriously and do not appreciate someone.
