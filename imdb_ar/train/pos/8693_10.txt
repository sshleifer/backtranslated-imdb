I was very young when this appeared in the United States, but I recorded it from the TV and watched it over and over until I kept everything. To this day, I still catch myself. The show itself was a joy and had many famous personalities, from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone to Mr. T. The dolls were also well, though a little creepy. I was surprised when I discovered recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Daref, a show that I enjoy too much. As someone else wrote in a previous comment, I was also stolen from this wonderful show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I certainly wish there would be enough demand on this offer to justify the DVD version, but I do not think enough people have heard of it. Well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
