She is not Michael Jordan. <br /> <br /> Think of all the wonderful NBA players who light their career without good reason except the timing of their birth. Their names may easily pass from audience lips like Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, and Wilt; the list goes on; but the volume is slightly rejected, for Stockton, Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other big players who have always lost headlines For Michael. <br /> <br /> I have seen that it is written that Gretchen Mol's career is inflamed in the wake of the cover essay in Vanity Fair in 1998 that predicted the inevitable superstars of Ms. Mall. It was later said that it had been breached. disagree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that for some time after seeing "Devil's Advocate" in '97 or '98, I would be confused about the actress who played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mall or Theron? Oh ya! Charlize Theron was one of "Days in the Valley", "Mighty Joe Young" and "Gretchen Mol" at Donnie Brasco, "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> I've seen "Thirteen Floor" (Mall) and "Sweet November" (Theron), but I've fixed it to a great extent, but I still put it in the same drawer of mind files. They were both very talented and had sweet faces, similar body types, short blond hair, and so on. <br /> <br /> However, Theron offered him more work. Loved by the Daver Crusher and as an alternative to Invergordon, her beauty was quite frightening. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the movie "Monster" was released and since then until the Oscars were handed over, all the films have been known as "Best Actress." And Theron and Laurenus were the only way to get an understanding. More precisely, the real Aileen Wuornos mark is a digital video rewind of the Selby head in one way or another, and the great talent to make itself physically unattractive is unheard of! <br /> <br /> Then in 2005, My home is notorious. "Mall's performance was unusual, perhaps she was standing under Ms. Theron, like the Hall of Celebration with the victory over the losing presidential candidate, Htm One was seen as a continuation of the old tale, once a promising actress with a declining career playing Nudity in the movie "B." It's hum! No No No! Wrong! Regardless of what you think of the film (and I enjoy movies about the 1950s) If you go through this movie, you'll miss one of the best shows of the year: Ms. Mottie Bettie was as much as Ms. Theron Aileen Unfortunately, for the film audience, Elaine is the most sympathetic figure. For any reason, moral social murder is less embarrassing than a na√Øve, undeveloped and unthinkable girl. Most of the death sentences were to live her life with full trust and full exposure. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the 1950s. Her photos and movies were never sexual, nor pornographic at all, but they provided a cartoon image close to everything strange. There was no sense of realism, only a parody. Ms. Mall captured the essence of character. She earned 20 pounds to add some pomegranate to her thin personality, and when she was shown to different photographers in the film, her body was Betty. Her complete lack of inhibitors fits neatly into everything that has been published about Bettie. Nudity Film usually depicts sex or sexual excitement. In this film is all about innocence. Gretchen / Bettie's naked look did not make me want to jump to her but she was infused with a desire to protect her from all the atrocities that some could inflict on each other. If you pass this movie, you'll miss one of the best shows in recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA to give this rating R
