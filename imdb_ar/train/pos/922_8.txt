At least for half an hour a week. I have not been interested in anything on the Big Three networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All blacks are interesting, although Larry may be annoying at times. I really liked the characters in the middle ground they bring with Hunter. Most other characters are interesting as well. The side view of Siegfried and Roy is also amusing sometimes. The animations are top notch, and certainly the best CG has been done on a weekly TV show. They usually use big names to mark them as stars in a view, and they try to hide weak text or characters. This is not quite true in this show. There are some characters who were weak and improved through vocal representation, but generally the characters stand alone. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for 16 and above. There is nothing here that most children have never heard of before, and most jokes probably fly straight over their heads. It is certainly not as raw and sharp as South Park, but it brings the same sense of "Bash everyone". For example, he makes fun of both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand in one episode. <br /> <br /> Pride's father and other Dreamworks products such as Shrek also feel like spiritual elites of Animaniacs, Pinky, The Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of humor. It may not be as brilliant as the classic television series for Spielberg, but it is still good. <br /> <br /> I hope this season will end well and be renewed in the coming seasons. Otherwise I may not find a reason to watch the Big Three again.
