You've never heard of The Man in the Moon until you watched it last night on this HDTV channel. Look, my taste like any others, eclectic. Favorites from Blue Velvet are turned on to Dr. Strangelove to The Ghost and Ms. Muir through Wizard Oz, The Loved One, Eraserhead, repo man and The Spy Inside. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is a wonderful, heart-rending, joyful and tragic film, beautifully filmed, a movie in which actors are truly living rather than working. This sweet tale will soon be in our own library. This beautiful story of life in a much finer era in Louisiana countryside literally takes you to its pastoral location. <br /> <br /> It's hard to stay calm during the final moments of the film, especially when the girl is young. The heart of her sister who dreams of a special pain and forgives everyone. <br /> <br /> Instead of spoiling your pleasure or pregnancy to inhalation of my boring prose, I will now end this suggestion from someone who enjoys watching movies that speak from our heart to our heart. . <br /> <br /> If you do not buy any other movie, please buy the man in the moon. This touching story is a story you will enjoy again and again. It is a joy and a jewel, a very rare film in this world of cruel hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues that appear in the movie "Man in the Moon" are a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> 05 April, 2009
