It is a great and ironic horror film that captures the essence of mid-late mania to the late 1980s about how it was supposed to be evil metal music. I can remember that I was stunned by teenagers when I was a kid. It does not help me to find a tomb in the cemetery of my hometown when I was ten years old. It turns out that this strange metal child has dug some old objects and used their bones in some strange sacrifice to the devil. So things like minerals might prevent me from a moment, but I love her now, when I was 24 years old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for $ 6 and I expected to suck it because of the lame cover, but to my surprise, I ruled. All about the utmost diabolical power of metals. She likes to watch a scene where the guitar shoots at lasers and steals guards in crowds. This is a great movie. If you like the 80s and the bad movies, this movie suits you. 9/10!
