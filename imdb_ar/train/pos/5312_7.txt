Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and show it with their unique appeal in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the movie "Alternative" or "Indie" model with a plot containing a rare position suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take pictures of the exotic dwellings of the small town where he lives. Suddenly, an alternative artist takes notice of his work and rents it in order to expose his work at some important festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life is changing dramatically as it now seems that luck and fame are irritating to the town's inhabitants who are Pecker's main inspiration. Even his erotic girlfriend gets angry because now she does not pay her "adequate" attention. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie from Indie Films has an advantage but not for everyone. It may seem boring or annoying to some people, but I still think it's worth seeing just because it offers something "different" from Hollywood's typical standards. <br /> <br /> To describe a few words: These are the model Christina Richie and John Waters movie. That's it. <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention that "full grace" lines are really annoying. Geez.
