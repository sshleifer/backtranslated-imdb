My brother and I have a 4Ever Pokemon on DVD. We saw it a few times and it was the best. Too bad and the new Pokemon did not speak this time. I'll get used to it. <br /> <br /> The very convincing iron thief meant when he took Selby with his dark card. A good thing of Ash and Sam was able to pick him out of his will. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the final credits called Cele-BRATE by Russell Velasquez. <br /> <br /> You've been successful since the last three movies and people will always love this movie.
