Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is a complex and creative film, although it requires a bit of belief and a lot of focus, but it's a very enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), an enjoyable stay home pair with an arrogant wife, decides to add a little spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at the high-tech company Digi Corp. His job is to travel to conferences all over the country (under the assumed identity of Jack Thosby) and broadcast speeches secretly given to his superiors through a small, elegant electronic gadget. <br /> <br /> However, speeches are actually a cover for more ferocious activities. Morgan, along with colleagues present at the conference, is brainwashed. The drinking water they drink puts them in a temporary coma, asking them to forget their past and adopt their new identities permanently. Once they are fully convinced that they are someone else, they are asked to apply for jobs with competing companies, where they can indulge in corporate espionage without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Digi Corp's plans have been shelved by the suspicious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) employment, which opens Morgan's eyes to what is already happening. It gives Morgan a sense of mind that changes drugs so he can resist brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects he does not fully believe he is Jack Thursday, he will be "eliminated." Morgan plays on an equal footing and applies for a job at Sunway's Trading Competition. <br /> <br /> However, upon arrival at his new workplace, he is tested on a lie detector and immediately detected as a spy. Fortunately, Sunways executives see this as an ideal opportunity to supply Digi Corp with the wrong data and Morgan becomes a double agent. <br /> <br /> From here, things get complicated: twists and turns and poor old Morgan end up being unable to trust anyone. In an exciting conclusion, everything becomes clear in the end (but only if you follow events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Natalie deals with the proceedings confidently and has a great ability to produce an elegant film looking for a relatively low budget. He managed to get some great performances from his talented crew; Jeremy Northam, in particular, is awesome? His portrayal of Morgan is somewhat nervous and is played fairly well. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another wonderful film director who wants to take advantage of the opportunities and I look forward to his next projects, High Rise and Nicobar.
