I'm not a fan of Tim Matheson, but I have to admit I loved this movie. It was dark and a bit annoying with some slightly edgy scenes, and I do not know to classify this movie in a little SF and a little horror stun slash. I saw this at about 2:00 am or so on my local channel there was nothing else so I decided to watch it. If you do not see this movie ID, I recommend it not too bad, the characters are interesting enough but not really explored with all their potential that could have made this film better. I do not know if this movie went to the cinema but I felt it was produced for television or was going directly to the video, I would buy this if so, on DVD, it is quite suitable for my movie type and contains a small part of the X- FILES attached to it. Government pledges or smart companies involved in ambiguous transactions dodgy.
