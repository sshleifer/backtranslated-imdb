I must start by apologizing because I thought that 75-80% of this film was a joy. It's mostly because of Brad Pitt's performance. Spot. <br /> <br /> The acting by all involved was very good but Brad stole the film. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I'm not a fan of the Giant House, but it must be one of his best roles at all. <br /> <br /> Savage, Sadiq and Griti. All the good words to describe this film. <br /> <br /> I was reading a previous review and the person said the reason for the early violence is not explained. This is illustrated, but fortunately, they do not have to go into the details of the drawings to illustrate their point of view. <br /> <br /> In general, this number 9 was given because each scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think humor in the first half or so is perfect for this film. Disrespect.
