It is a pleasure to see a wonderful piece of art that has been transformed without distortion or competition. I had no speculations about how to reproduce this extraordinary piece of literature as a movie worth seeing. If you like the book of Bulgakov, you will be afraid, it is understandable, to see some of the misleading interpretations that have been made for a film project rather than to give the meaning of the story deeper to the screen. There are some examples with Master and Margarita. Although the story is complex and complex, the film leaves nothing. It seems as though the director has read the works of Bulgakov in the same way that the orchestra conductor reads the result - with no missing note. Why do not we find this talent here in the United States? So far my favorite book and film has the same title.
