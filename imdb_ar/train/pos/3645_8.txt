A good story about following your dreams and actually getting to do something about them when you hit the opportunity. It was not easy for Morris, he had a family, job or job for work, mortgage, or the like - it was not as if he could drop what he was doing and eagerly jump on the greyhound to play AAA for four months. It took courage. I'm glad they showed their hesitation, so he got the call to the big companies. <br /> <br /> I can remember seeing his pitch against Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Crock or Mills Watson than Quaid, that's fine. <br /> <br /> Quid does a very good job of playing the role of man, teacher, trainer and "senior rookie" .... As someone in the same age group, I can certainly recognize his ordeal. You're not too old to do what you dreamed of as a kid, but it's up there. You have to do it sooner than lator. <br /> <br /> Tell me reasonably, well adjusted, and the amount of pace, behaved, it is good to see the familiar faces of the departure of Royce Ablegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work everywhere, happy to see it. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... Who would have thought that Tampa would have been Revise Reyes was the subject of such a kind of early film good?
