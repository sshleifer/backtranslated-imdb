I was able to watch this entire film, and I was deeply impressed by it. I was not sure whether it was a comedy or a drama really - it had elements of the two. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper looked wonderful - our image has changed for older women 60 years old since Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, and sexy! The only drawback of this film is that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in the MTM or Rhoda shows of the 1970s. I've thought that since she was appointed in New York City (where Roda was appointed) she at least mentioned a little to her sister Brenda or that Julie Cavner would have appeared, assuming of course in Big Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope that ABC will make this series and re-emerge the guest of all the old denominations of these performances. By the way, what's wrong with CBS doing this reunion, or a final series? Was not that network that carried "MTM" and "Rhoda" offers?
