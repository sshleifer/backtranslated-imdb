The only part that lacks this film is the role of Shue as the daughter who wishes to follow the footsteps of her "aunt" as a day soap star. Otherwise it would be perfect 10. <br /> <br /> Each actor seems to enjoy his parts and excessive performance to achieve his enjoyment as well as the text - I must wonder if there are a few ads that were not "made in pieces. Good and there are some classic lines that will stay with you. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie that everyone should see at least once ... I would recommend not to drink anything that would blow your nose out. <br /> <br /> Of course, you'll want to watch the last scene closely, Nurse Nana has a little secret she would prefer not to share with you. <br /> <br /> If you like or despise daytime soap, Fun in all the right places.
