In an seemingly endless endeavor to find horror movies to behave well, it is very rare to find a film approaching far from reaching the mark. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across "Burned at the Stake" on the American cable network while flipping channels. The hypothesis is reasonably simple. In 1692, Anne Putnam (Swift) was the most outspoken witness against the so-called magicians, with unfounded accusations against anyone she deplored. Manipulating them to achieve his own purposes is Rev. Paris (Peters) who also serves as a guide to the court in matters relating to magic and satanism. Things get complicated when Anne begins to accuse the Goode family of witchcraft. Salem (from 1980 or so), Lauren Graham (also played with Swift) began to gain unusual insights shortly before her visit to the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in a dress from the seventeenth century tries to carry her there and the building. Continues to be pursued as alien phenomena begin to be more and more involved. Soon, it seems to have become owned by the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, the additional description is somewhat involved and will save a lot. Although the film is not action-oriented and is likely to be of little interest to many viewers, the good performances and 17th-century dialogue used in many of the past memories of the film seem persuasive. Production values ​​are solid with the possible exception of some special effects. In a side note, he was technical advisor to the film Laurie Cabot, the official Salem witch. Viewers who appreciate a horror film made in the atmosphere may appreciate but are less appreciative. Bert Gordon has had a long career in horror films and science fiction. He has been famous for his work on "Big Mistakes" and similar works years ago.
