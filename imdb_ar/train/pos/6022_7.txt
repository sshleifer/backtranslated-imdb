Often misunderstood is Zabriskie Point, Anthony's political film, American Antonioni. Stylistically, it follows the same method after "Blow-Up", which means that the pace is faster than the previous ones, although it is certainly not less exciting for privacy. <br /> <br /> The common mistake is that the movie glorifies the Hippie generation. not like that. <br /> <br /> Comes from two completely different environments. Mark of the young "rebels", Daria of a real estate agency company. But in the real Antononian way, both are isolated, both trying to escape from his surroundings. Mark left a meeting of the rebellious students and Black Panthers frustrated by the long empty speech, while Darya was still raging in her car. <br /> <br /> Antonioni, the principal director, filmed for rebellious youth and shallow, then moves to the city. An environment saturated with companies, advertising billboards, meaningless, which must continue to expand to accommodate the similar expansion of the population, making a profit at the same time. This is the environment from which nullity escapes, although it often seems not coincidental. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Darya stops near a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment is completely suffocated, people like the lost cases, the best example of it by the old boxing champion, now turning to the shadow itself, sitting around Drinking, smoking and talking nonsense. The staggering sequence of grief, became more powerful with the inclusion of about half of the wild children living around them, brought by some "benefactors" but "destroying a genuine piece of American history." In a non-ambiguous symbolism, there is Anthony's view of the hippies. Just a positive half glimpse into the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> Then there is the desert, the landscape used for destructive effect, through turns pure and terrifying, primitive, wild and dead. The sequence in which the idols make love, "joined" in the imagination by the generation of "Venus" reflects the similar sequence in the Red Desert, where Julianna tells her son a story. It is a colorful break in a colorless landscape. Half of my imagination is full of vitality in a grueling reality. <br /> <br /> The end may belong to a group of great endings in the cinema, and Western civilization blooming into pieces. The venting, the expulsion of evil spirits. <br /> <br /> Both the American "Blow-Up" and "Zabriskie Point" are less than the previous masterpieces, but this is largely due to a faster pace and inevitably incoherent settings (London swings, America Flower Power). But when it comes to it, it is clear that he has not lost the edge.
