This movie contains some of the best comedy dialogues and memorable quotations that have been assembled in one movie! The plot is somewhat lacking, but tasty pranks are enough to make up for the difference. It is an immortal film for all ages that is sure to please him. As a cinematic art form it is very entertaining. And with big stars like Carrie Grant, Merna Lowe and Melvin Douglas ... How can you make a mistake? <br /> <br /> The value of dialogue and comedian time has not been underestimated, and it is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this in 1986 is the knockout of this film: The Money Pit, with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film was pulled and received bad comments and viewer comments. Realistic comic dialogue is an art.
