Gender Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> Man or woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turned out to be "command" alike. <br /> <br /> Sleep in the mud <br /> <br /> Then they all went <br /> in one of their alien objects. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great episode of the first season. I enjoy this story because the story is the kind that you are never sure about what will happen next. It is completely original. The humor is very enjoyable with eye-catching and reflective disco lights. I really need to learn the thumb trick done by the sexes. I really loved the atmosphere in the small Kindred village and Mulder and Scully sneak in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my first season favorite episodes indeed. I think the thing I like most is how they eventually become foreigners and leave the crop circles. Many people see this as a strange episode unrelated to legends such as "The Unnatural" or "Space" but I think it can easily be considered mythical. Gender may have been like an exotic reward hunter and may sound like one. Hey? Anyway, I give Episode 9 out of 10.
