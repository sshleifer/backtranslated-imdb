Seriously, can you imagine such a proliferation of talent in one film without a huge budget: Daniel Day Lewis, Ray McNally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Connor, and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards; but it was perfectly logical to have won the O'Conor (Young Christie) Award and My Place: Clich√© is right here: they do not play roles, they inhabit them. The performance of Day-Lewis is a tour of power - such a stunning transformation, but it was already a sign of academic brilliance. Along with this performance, they also honored the beautifully restricted work of Brenda Fricker, which continues to frustrate the heart. As Christie's mother. By the way, if you do not see this wonderful actress in "Swann", this is another film worthy of verification of her contribution (and Sammy Miranda Richardson).
