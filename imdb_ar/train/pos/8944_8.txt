Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958, featuring James Stewart, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. And Ernie Kovacs. James Stewart and Kim Novak got their second film on the screen (after Alfred Hitchcock's classic spin-off released earlier that year). This was Stuart's last film as a romantic lead because he was over 50 years old and no longer plays such a role. The film revolves around the charm of Kim Novak, who is drawn to the death of James Stewart. She put a mantra on him and fell upside down in her love. I enjoyed the movie and cast it. The film was a moderate success and was nominated for the Golden Globe for best comedy. GimmeClassics
