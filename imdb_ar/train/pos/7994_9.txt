I liked this movie so much that it was dark, it was not running away from bullets, chasing the car movie of your mind. Many characters' backgrounds and motives are somewhat ambiguous, leaving the viewer to reach their own conclusions. It is good to see a film where the director allows the viewer to shape their minds. <br /> <br /> In the end, motivated by love or revenge, or the desire to repent - do what he feels "right". "Does God ever forgive us what we did?" - It is not a question a person can answer - so he does what he feels he should do, what is good in it, and what he has been trained to do. You can not think of one bad movie he did - and he has a wonderful support crew. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
