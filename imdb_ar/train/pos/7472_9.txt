I really liked this movie. I have read some other comments, and although I pity those who did not understand them, I agree with some criticism. Which makes me like this movie in a strange way. I agree that they have a great team to reproduce a smart movie for the general public, but it has many levels and it's still wonderful to watch. I also like films, such as this film which raises a lot of discussions, theories, potential endings and hidden subtext. Congratulations to Mr. Crow, and certainly in the top ten list. <br /> <br /> P.S. I saw this when I went out for the first time when I was carrying backpacks in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to my hotel and I had a great trip in paranoia! Where does the dream end and the real begins?
