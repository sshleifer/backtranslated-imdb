How can the film be controversial and nice? This one does it with a semi-perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be mathematicians. Obviously most cultures do not want their daughters to be small breasts, too. Here we see a group of wonderful actors that we have never heard before, portraying people from different cultures who live a fairly mild life so that their children want to become professional footballers and have the ability to do so. The structure around the parallels between the two cultures is superb. No waiver. All cultures are modern and valid. (And yes, both are ridiculous, too). One drawback: a Hindu wedding ceremony appeared to include hundreds of relatives and not a single child among them.
