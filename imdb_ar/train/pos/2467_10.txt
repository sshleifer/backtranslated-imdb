Why did not this take a bag full of Oscar? It is an amazing interpretation of a piece that was often filmed. The videos are dazzling (especially in the widescreen ... Kill sections and really scan movies and movies for this wonderful movie). Each frame is a painting. just awesome. The play is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion is evident from the opening titles. No Zefferelli here, just listed a wonderful story the way he can only film, but rarely does it. Jacobi is just as perfect as Hamlet's deadly uncle: he does not play his role as a wicked but charming politician, allowing us to see the only reason Hamlet is suspected of playing wrong. Branagh also checks the line between the fake Hamlet / real madness and the vengeance burning inside. A lot of useful characters come well, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardieu and Charlton Heston, unobtrusive if you're absorbed in seeing Branagh the way you were. Charming piece.
