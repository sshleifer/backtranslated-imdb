This film is a gem because it moves with a soft but firm precision. <br /> <br /> Beware of viewers that, despite being described as "corporate spy" and that Ms. Liu is there, he moves very accurately. Speed. It is not about explosions, car chases or flying bullets. You should be patient and instead, note the details here. He is self-righteous because this is the main character. The viewer has to watch and think when this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers - because that destroys the point of view. The plot is what I have read from other publications: an average white-collar man, seeking change and adventure, signs a corporate spy job. Just go somewhere and secretly record and transfer the data inside. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a surreal tour - with a background of disappointment from the companies that associate themselves with underlying essential insanity. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> Working on all parts is wonderful - and yes, some works are cartoon characters. But they are all fit, and they enjoy. The light piano rhyme in the background is just as perfect as the sinister soft key: Everything is not right at first. <br /> <br /> In the end: all is not as it seems. <br /> <br /> Get rest and turn off the lights to watch it - and raise the sound: this movie wants to listen to you.
