Not since Spongebob Squarepants I've seen a bigger cartoon on TV. Fantastic colors, sounds can not be better, characters are very original, great cartoon great. We hope Nikolodian will continue to develop this cartoon. I hope DVD season comes out soon !!! I like such cartoons and I hope that more people will hear these wonderful cartoons. Season DVD is very difficult to find, so if someone finds a store that sells it, please let us know. The only Catscratch merchandise available at the Shop Shop is a great looking shirt, but it is very expensive !!! If you love SpongeBob; You will also love Catscratch!
