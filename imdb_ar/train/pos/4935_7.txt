In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels nauseous and leaves poker while winning the Black Jack Palance crime. He was pursued by Blackie and his men, Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), who were killed by Blackie and dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, Lieutenant Commander Clinton Reid (Richard Widmark) of the US Department of Public Health found that the deceased man had a pulmonary plague caused by mice and that he needed to know who had any contact with the man during the 40s. Eight hours to avoid the epidemic. Mayor Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) is tasked with helping Dr. Clint find and vaccinate the killers. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the streets" reveals a simple story, but it is still effective and with the great evil.

Jack Palance does a nasty trick on his first appearance, and the camera still works while trying to escape with Zero Mostel, which is very moving. Seven voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "PÃ¢nico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the streets")
