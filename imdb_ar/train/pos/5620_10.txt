Roman Polanski is one of the most important directors of our time, as the mind behind classics like Rosemary Baby and Chinatown. Perhaps what makes Polanski cinema so interesting is the fact that, despite its ability to produce commercially attractive films like the above-mentioned masterpieces, it is also fond of making lower-quality films of a more personal nature. "Le Locataire", or "The Tenant", is one of those films; a horror / suspense story about paranoia and obsession is among his best works and perhaps among the best horror films ever made. <br /> <br /> Polanski plays himself Tilkowski, a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds her, he discovers that it is empty because the former tenant, Simon Chul, tried to kill herself by jumping out the window. After Simon's death from injuries, Telkovsky begins to become obsessed with her, to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building. <br /> <br /> While sharing the same feeling of fear of focusing his other films "The Character of the Flat" (Repulsion & "Rosemary's Baby"); on this strange plot film that may or may not be entirely in the head of Trelkovsky, I have paranoia on his mind, and the strange obsession has been portrayed by Polanski completely with the former tenant. <br /> <br /> Polanski depicts a complete descent into darkness. I have acted in this way; as a simple, almost lifeless man, he catches himself in this crazy subworld, which happens to be inhabited by a group of strange people. Very important to the success of the film. <br /> <br /> Polanski's beautiful cinema also helps to increase the sense of isolation, and gives life to the beautiful building used as Treklovski's cages. The painful images Polanski uses to express a sense of confusion and insanity are of extraordinary beauty that make them both frightening and attractive. <br /> <br /> If a defect is found in the movie, it is certainly a bit slow at first. This may seem like a stop, but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics Trelkowski's tedious life and gradually introduces a world into a world. In addition, the complex story is certainly not easy to understand due to many complex layers. However, more than a flaw, it is a pleasure to face such an intriguing plot. <br /> <br /> While "Tenant" may not be for everyone, interested in psychological horror and surreal storylines we will be happy to experience. "Le Locataire" is already one of Roman Polanci masterpieces. 10/10
