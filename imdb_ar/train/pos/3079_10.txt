While listening to an audio book, Cambbell Scott is the reader. I was very excited to hear his voice and disappointed me to cancel the Six Degrees. It does not seem to keep good performances on air long enough to capture an audience that can communicate with the story of performances. What a disgrace, shame on the network for not giving this exhibition a full chance chapters. This was a great show to see with a wonderful team. The "Men in Trees" network gave a second chance witch is also a fantastic show, but they brought out the "Invasion" and this was also something quite different to watch, not the same old old themes. Why can not networks understand them correctly?
