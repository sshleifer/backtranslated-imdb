Fantastic movie bands. Men Mendes directed this beautiful film, which shows another photographer of his father's father. A wonderful star with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) managed to do a great job. Also represented by Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. The custing is very good. The plot is very good. You will enjoy the movie. A great cinematography of the 1930's. Set in the 1930s, this will certainly feature like the climax of all gangster films of that era. The sound recording is very good and is suitable for the film. The big flick in the whole shows what the father does to protect his son. Reduce its importance to Trojee. Completely worth 10.
