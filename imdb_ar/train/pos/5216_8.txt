Erroll works in the Public Safety Department and his job is to investigate sex offenders. Sometimes he pays the line in his job and outperforms sex offenders. I do not blame him but his boss is ready for retirement so Alison comes. Errol is now training her to do her job, which is like job shading. Allison is somewhat naive about the job at first, but she does not realize how much risk she really represents and all this is wrong with Erroll. Begins to go away with his obsession by finding a missing girl when his job is not a police officer. <br /> <br /> It's a fairly decent film about a crazy man pushing the boundaries and working out his "practice scope". Erroll did a good job but for Allison's safety. She has some good mystery to her too, and when I found out, there was more of them.
