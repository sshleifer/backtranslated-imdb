What a master piece. To move the Cold War conflict and move it into the future. This film is satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, Dr. Strangelove excels. <br /> <br /> The smart label of the superpowers, on behalf of the Union and the market. Cons being commies and market, West! Excellence. The use of the General Joxs was clever, before its time. Only really see the risks of genetic engineering. The joxs were dealt with the issue in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this film revolves around the companionship of the humble man and how he can overcome the wishes of the government. These films scream do not do it you fool will kill us all. <br /> <br /> Excellent 10/10
