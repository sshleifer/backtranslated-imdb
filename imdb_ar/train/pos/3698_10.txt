I had no idea what this film was about until I read about it in L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews at La Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this movie. The stars of Molly Parker (my favorite TV show Deadwood) and Lucas Haas - who I think we'll see more in the near future. The film is funny and exciting, characterized by wonderful photography and beautiful photography. I do not know whether the film has a distribution or not, but I hope it happens - or will do it soon. This is destined to be a real indie gem. They even have music by my favorite Jewish silver band! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not there in the examination. Even without her there ... it was the best film I saw at the festival.
