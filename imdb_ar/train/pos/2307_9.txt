I must say that this film is truly stunning and intimate. Reese Witherspoon is very charming and Jason London is not too bad! It's so sweet watching Danny fall in love and he breaks my heart and yet my heart heats up at the same time watching the fall of the court in love with Maureen. However it is even sweeter watching how much Danny cares. I must confess though I did some kind of wanting him to fall to Danny in the end. She was just too cute watching her fall for him I did not want her to break her heart so badly. But the biggest tragedy I have ever seen occurred in this film. Watching him die makes me cry for a whole day. I just can not believe it. Yet there was no more loving relationship in the film then Maureen and Danny. They really can make it through anything. I give this movie number 9 because I did not want to die Kurt, but it was still one of the most watched movies ever.
