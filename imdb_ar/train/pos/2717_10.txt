I can not remember much about the program, but I remember how passionate I was about it and how I was determined not to miss an episode. Unfortunately at that time we did not have any VCR, so I have not seen the series before. However, I can remember vividly what I felt during watching it and how happy I was every time I spoke. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and is still one of my favorite actors to date, mostly because of his appearance in the series. I will gladly buy / steal / download this series, I think I will do my best to see it again and revise the long-gone childhood period ... Any ideas? Does anyone know a dedicated site for the series or have episodes on a tape from their first broadcast?
