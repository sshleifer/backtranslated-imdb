Mother one night of my favorite novels will see this I was expecting great disappointment. Instead, I got a film that depicts irony, humor, chastity, and above all the overwhelming grief of the Vonigut novel. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best Nolte performance yet. He captures the defeat of Howard Campbell Jr. and persists on it constantly from the subtle intonations of his speech to the tears hanging behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is very hilarious like George Kraft. Cheryl Lee is haunted by her separation from reality as a small lover of Campbell. John Goodman is less than his effectiveness and more than "Campbell's great Blue Ferry." <br /> <br /> This Campbell-inspired story, which tries to be an ideal hero and inadvertently become the perfect tragic villain, is a mature and mature view of what we are as people. Apart from that, it is one of the deepest romantic films I've ever encountered. Cambell is an embodiment of both stupid and wise love. At the startling, painful conclusion of ideas, he finally learns what it means to be a real child while the godfather of Blue Verei gives him his wish. He realizes that ... well, watch the movie and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Mother Mother is undoubtedly one of the best films ever produced. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deeply into our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
