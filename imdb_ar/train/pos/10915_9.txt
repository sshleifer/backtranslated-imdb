RKO Studios have decided to borrow William Powell of MGM and Jean Arthur of Columbia for one of their huge budget efforts to capitalize on The Thin Man's popularity. They have succeeded to some extent. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that in addition to Nick Charles and before him, Bill Powell also played in the few films of Philo Vance in the title role. So this time he was well placed in this role. Doctor Bradford does not do a lot of liquid lunches like Nick Charles, but Nick Blaz is still there. One variation is that while Nick married Charles of the heir, Bradford's doctor works for a living as a doctor. This helps in the appointment of the detective and in fact does in this film. <br /> <br /> He got two murders to solve. The knight falls out of a horse and comes out of a big racing ground and dies for no apparent reason. The coach is suspected of something happening, but he is shocked by the traditional conventional method of the bullet. This is after he came to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Mirna Lowe had a more consistent influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays his role as a state more than Louie did. But she works here and she and Paul have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> James Gleason, who is always reliable, is the police inspector for Sam Levine / Nat Pendleton. All they needed here was Asta and maybe Eric Blur where Powell's butler was describing this part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur are signed in this studio, we have seen a great selection of Bradford movies.
