Fantastic movie. You were held in the grip of death once you let yourself participate in the story. The successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), suffers from a life-threatening crisis between his career and his family. Notes his former college colleague Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. Finds that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the Sept. 11 attack on America, is no longer in touch with reality ... where he chose to involve him in his favorite past music and video games. The former roommates revived their friendship and strengthened previous ties. Johnson has his friend Angela Ockorts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to get Charlie out of his grief ... but it is Alan who succeeds in making his friend come out of his deep darkness. Jada plays Benkit Smith, Johnson's wife. The writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of lawyer / guardian Charlie. Also in the cast: Safron Burroughs, Donald Sutherland, Adele Mudel and Robert Klein. Fantastic soundtrack featuring Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Bear Jam and The Brothers. <br /> <br /> Note: I was not Sandler fans at all; but I found him distinctive in this role. In some scenes, I thought aloud ... why he was never contacted to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in his autobiography.
