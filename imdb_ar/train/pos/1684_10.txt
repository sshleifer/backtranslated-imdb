Say what you want about Andy Miligan - but if his family is less than 10 per cent of the people who misled this film, I think it could have turned out to be worse. Unfortunately, the video version of this film contains inserts of the sex scene originally filmed by the distributor to enhance the attractiveness of the box office. Several times during the filming of the melancholy miligan film and the silent movie music abruptly ends, suddenly the good positions of Miligan's family representatives appear and do so for rock music in the 60th guitar amp. It is very easy to progress quickly if you are trying to draw attention to the original Milligan film, which, unfortunately, misses many of the actions taken to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains, however, remains convincing. I do not think I've ever seen or hated any film before.
