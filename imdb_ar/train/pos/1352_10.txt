You have never seen this movie and considered it a great classic with great old actors. In the period in which this film was produced, people in America were different, there was no television or all the modern things we have today, except for the radio and start producing fantastic films in Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories of young romance between a young girl or a young man were seen differently from what it is today. Ann Shirley, 44, played the role of an orphaned girl called the Upper Islands because of her red hair and found herself transported to the home of two older people who were like wise bumens and saw them around Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone, and if anything happened, the entire town was discovered about them within minutes. It's a movie on the ground with respectable and nice people trying to help each other in a very simple way to live. Today, the ball looks very corn and stupid, but believe me, this was the way people were in America during the 1920's. & 30's were a great generation who loved good family movies.
