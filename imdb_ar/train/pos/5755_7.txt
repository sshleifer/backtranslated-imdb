This is a very strange film. The film can be exploited with violent acts and unrealistic situations, but it is unusual to be built around rural characters in war with each other, rather than invading the "other". <br /> <br /> The film is an exaggerated stereotype of veterans in Vietnam, in a long series of films portraying veterinarians in that war as a serious heart patient. The last line of Chris Christoferson is "I have not lost the war yet," where he meets his demise after spending a long period of killing and destruction, including the town's police chief and his girlfriend in his brother's chilling scene. However, Christoferson is a good enough actor, and attractive enough, to carry this villain with amazing depth. Vincent is clearly a golden boy, but with enough intensity to outperform his good counterpart. The film resembles some plots with Winchester 73 where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The film includes a B movie classification, although Christopherson, Vincent, and Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters each give her a set of classes. <br /> <br /> Give it 7 because it is a long-lost view of the American psyche of post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan meditation, paranoia, confusion, and the film industry that were willing to tackle such topics at the time. <br /> <br /> Seen on this channel, a great network continues to run a lot of old movies from the seventies to the nineties, regardless of political bending.
