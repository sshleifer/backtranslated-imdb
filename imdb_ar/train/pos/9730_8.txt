The reviews of UK newspapers seem to have focused on the fact that reviewers tend to know Toby Young, the journalist whose film is based on his real experiences. The keyword here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fantasy love story. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins the prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he begins making gaffe after gaffe before Getting It Right and Make it. This involves selling it, and the film has some serious points that it can make about journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main article continues to be a comedy centered around Sydney's fallacies. The program contains his cake and eats it because Sydney is a good-selling spoil at the same time as a clever and somewhat obnoxious writer. This paradox is not a big problem at all, because Simon Big (like Sydney) expresses a very good probability. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, editor of Sydney, is very effective, and Kirsten Dunst is somewhat unknown as the ultimate object of Sidney's emotions. As for Majan Fox (who plays the outdoor pembo), I can only say this : Say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, I sell all my belongings, and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place beside you as your leader. Of course, since I am a 56-year-old overweight accountant, you may not find my offer very tempting, but it is on the table anyway. Given how long she has spent her career so far, one may think it is a little premature that Megan Fox play a role that mercilessly beats the kind of actress she might think she will become; however, she does so in a nice way, with some skill, and very sex . This girl will go away. <br /> <br /> There is strong support from a variety of experienced artists - Mary Margolis, Bill Patterson of the United Kingdom, Gillian Anderson and Danny Houston of the United States. <br /> <br /> There are many laughing moments out loud, and I smiled most of the time. As always, the word F appears when you do not need it, although at least some of it is very funny.
