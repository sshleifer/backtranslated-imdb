John Waterers ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've ever seen. It gives the viewer a surrealistic picture of life in Baltimore (I live in Washington DC), with Warhol-like use of colors, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker becomes bigger than his city's ability to deal with him, and separates him from his loved ones (including sexy Richie) by his lovable artistic director. The picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth - like ice cream with fresh strawberries on a hot summer day - and although this taste was flat and fairly simple, it made it all deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to take up arms ... and everything else that this country represents. Joan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
