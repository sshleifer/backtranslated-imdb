As an older rocker, this movie is reminiscent of Heep and Quo - my favorite band at all - but with the amazing cast (everyone) - and the wonderful story - I love this piece of creative genius. I can not recommend it any more - and Mick Jones has added a lot (foreign lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I've seen this wonderful work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - Ma Sound - Jimmy Nail - Talent falling from every pore - then Astrid .... And Karen ..... More can be asked by the elderly rock! 10/10 - Fantastic bloody. Alistair, Perth, Western Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
