I have heard people who say that this film is dull boring. I do not think they were watching the right movie. This is not the typical acting film, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about the rookie and his teacher who just happens to kill people. This way he works very well, with wonderful performances by Bringer and Zane (who does not walk through the film as if he were in other roles - he seems to be actually acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the movement towards the end - many of which did not make much sense and was unsatisfactory given the accumulation of the rest of the film. But he watched Zain's face and felt panic alone, while Beringer did the dirty work.
