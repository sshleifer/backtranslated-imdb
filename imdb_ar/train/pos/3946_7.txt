I found the only comment about this film not entirely informative and very harsh, so I decided to write my own book. I saw this movie for the first time when it was shown and caught it several times since then. First of all, let me say, overall, the things that this movie gets are what makes it worthwhile. It does not matter that it has some low budget quirks and other mistakes. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​making a film about Walt Whitman's visit to a narrow, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian society in southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a wonderful idea in a wrong scene. The film revolves around the kind of human motivation that Whitman has inspired in people. In this sense, it is absolutely accurate. Representation - especially by Reeborn (Whitman) and Colm Fiori as a doctor - is very good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay due attention to the norms and reflections of the time. In general, what do not you like? In addition, name another movie where Whitman is clearly featured?
