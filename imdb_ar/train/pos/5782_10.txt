This Internet database lists this as a TV show. And yes, the series on MTV was shown in the "Anomaly" program, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly. But the version you saw this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes that run together in a movie without disturbing the balances between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have the story of The Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a wonderful hero or pom, Julie is a social worker or a tiger queen, Sarah's girl should listen to less than The Smiths and Mr. Gone man does not seem to continue his head. Then there are other weird creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun tries to discover parts of the real story and what dreams. Maybe they're all real or dreams. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Perhaps there is only one and the dreams of others. You'll have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I got comic books before the program was shown, and was one of my favorites. The artwork was amazing and the story was original - unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman. Will bend your mind, and has strong tones for adults without being obscene or offensive. The show basically used the same fine artwork (now just moving) and the same story ... which ensures that the beauty of the comedy is reproduced honestly. This was the best program to appear on the "anomalies", shrink it. <br /> <br /> If you like cartoons of a gloomy nature or you need a good mind trip, this is an offer to register. It's Donnie Darko before there's such a thing. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing is that this has never become a movie or another television series, but I do not say this disappointed. By keeping it simple, they closed the film of gold and kept it free of defects resulting from successive failures.
