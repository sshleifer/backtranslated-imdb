I must say, that Clive Barker Undying is the best horror game ever made. Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Evil Dead and Castlevania played, but none of them could overcome the sheer joy with which the game dealt with its horrific elements. Parker is good at what he does, who hangs terror on our world, and shows that his hand is evident everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice in the game as one of the main characters. Filled with lush effects and a sufficient ambience to displace the stick, the Undying is a game that must be overcome in my books as the best horror title. I just hope that this has come to the console system, but unfortunately, weak PC sales were wasting it in its infancy.
