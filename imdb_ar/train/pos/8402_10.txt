VAN is a simple teen image specially made for the drive that comes out of the way to make you feel comfortable and provides many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny DeVito plays a small and abundant role as a car wash manager and almost steals the show! All yarns are good disposition, complex characters and quite competent guidance for this kind of pictures. Crown International Version.
