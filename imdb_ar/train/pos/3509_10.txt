I've seen this movie for a while and is still at the top of the Favorite Films list. It is amazingly placed and what makes the film really is the detailed bits (such as the coffee box "Bostello Cafe" reused as a cup to wash her grandson's hair) that people do not see because you will not understand this film unless you are human. This is just one of those culturally specific films in particular. Please do not hit this movie if you do not have prior knowledge of any basis. I see exactly what the writer / director was walking on, and hit the target completely! This film deserves a better appreciation.
