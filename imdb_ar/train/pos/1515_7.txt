Amicus made nearly half a dozen of these horror selections in the 1970s, and this, from the author of the pioneer horror novelist Robert Bloch, is one of their best efforts. There are four stories, all of which deserve attention, but there are two stories - "sweets for the sweet" and "killing method" - that are characterized as extremely effective trips to fear. <br /> <br /> In "Desserts," Christopher Lee plays the role of an impatient widower, his beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) is resentful of his neglect and wild fanaticism, so she cries for the voodoo doll, which expresses its displeasure with his methods. Franks is a beautiful character of evil and mischievous, and offers one of the greatest child performances in the horror film since Martin Stevens in "Innocent." This batch is directed with great accuracy and final anger, which happens outside the screen, is the moment of purest horror. <br /> <br /> The "Method of Murder" revolves around a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creations, and Dominic the fearsome. This episode is remarkable for its simplicity and blatant terrorism. Dominique may or may not be real, so director Deauville has a fun time playing our expectations. The short shots of Dominique reflected in the pond or seen as a passing fantasy in a meadow are really painful. <br /> <br /> The art of the original poster, characterized by a structural resemblance to a tray with a straight head cut to Peter Cushing, was the rich lure of a constant cross on fear.
