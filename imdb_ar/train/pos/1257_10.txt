I have read a number of reviews about this film and I have to say "What's wrong with you people?!?!" This was an excellent movie! I thought this film was wonderful from start to finish, and the story was very good. I am convinced that people who did not like this film did not pay much attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes which, if not taken care of, will be confused and that the following scenes may not make sense. I urge anyone who does not like this film to see it again and watch it on its own so you can really pay attention. The story was perfectly logical for me and as I said, it was well told. Every scene in the film has a point and everything suits everyone at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a great job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Lawrence Fishburne was as great as Tani Brown, and played a very exciting character. The kabshu kit was a nice touch too and looked great. Blair Underwood was pleasantly surprised, I did not expect anything great from him, but he did a great job. Ed Harris was a real jewel in the film. It plays a really sick person and makes you see how disturbing his personality is. Watch his eyes watching, just gorgeous! Also, there is a very small Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of her first roles ... not a bad place to start. Excellent actors in this film! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes any team member or likes thriller only. It's a great movie and you have to watch it. Do not listen to all the opinions of these other people, go to the movie and reach your own conclusions. I hope you see the movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy it. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
