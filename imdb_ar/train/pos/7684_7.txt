Read all the comments are very interesting. But can anyone tell me the name of the real artist who drew the pictures for good broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to jj. As an artist in the family, but there was a real family that has a real artist, and has not got any balance in this scene yet. So if you do not mind someone saying the name of the real artist, I would also like to tell him "Done well". I know that this sight is for GOOD TIMES, but do not agree that it also touched all of our hearts. I want to know if he still paints a mother who is still alive or not. I want to show some of his work in my house.
