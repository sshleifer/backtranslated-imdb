20 out of 10 This is a really wonderful story about a person who was evacuated in wartime and Nagar Nagami Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beach) is surrounded by Tom, and it is immediately apparent that he has serious problems when he wet his bed the first night. William is illiterate and afraid but somehow finds the two solace in the other unit. It is clear that William has talent as an artist and we see that Tom's talent is the leader of the band in the armed surrender of Jerusalem. Friendship with William by Zakaria and Rinch, a young Jew from London and also with Tom and Zakaria, finally learns to read and write and feel part of this small, interconnected society. Just as he is settling down, William is summoned back to London by his mother, and here we see why he is so tight. It is clear that his mother is mentally ill and when Tom does not hear of William, he travels to London to look for him. Finally he found him carrying his dead sister where he was tied in a cellar. After a while in the hospital, Tom realizes that he should kidnap him and take him home with him. Culminating in a bitter end when he told William that he would be adopted by Tom, while learning that his best friend Zakaria had been killed in an air strike in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom was talking to an official from the Interior Ministry. <br /> <br /> I love "I", because it's worth it, and I think he loves me too. "<br /> <br /> Just does not improve to do that?
