Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller, a dissident filmmaker, has an amazing opening that is a double complication. The subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) collided with pickpocket Scip McCoy (Richard Widmark smothered by cold Sinatra) she did not know she was carrying microfilm value. McCoy is unaware of his fraud. Both are unaware of being monitored by two federal clients. So the grift puts in motion a degree of knowledge. The two candies were monitored twice (skipping and police) and thus a double naivety; skipping, the excessively insignificant thief in confidence, unknowingly unaware, left behind by federal agents; federalists, all know, powerless. They can not stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
