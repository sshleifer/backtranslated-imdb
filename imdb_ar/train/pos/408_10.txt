I can not tell you all how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say this step is "very confusing" or "like swimming in concrete drying". I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who likes fiction, this movie is for you. If you love playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this is your own movie, (especially if you have entered the Eastern Adventures), I'm sorry I did not get to watch this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentives to get my big TV screen :-)
