"Things to Come" is an early science fiction film featuring a fantasy world, or "Everytown" in 100 years. You can split them into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film runs from 1940 to 2036, and deals mainly with how this ruler or "boss" wanted to get the ability to fly in planes again, after the bombing of each city and the outbreak of war. <br /> <br /> This movie only contains about 3 errors: Muddy Audio The video contains some quirks, the characters are not deep at all, and the general plot is not quite solid. The plot lacks something I can not put on my finger ... it seems a little "thin". But if you love science fiction and care about what Wales Wells could do next year, that's a must. We should only see what everyone fears: a long and protracted war, because they were about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things to come are a very good movie that most people need to see once.
