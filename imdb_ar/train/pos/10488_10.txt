After her Oscar nomination for "The Secrets and Lies", Brenda Blythin starred in the wonderful "Saving Grace". Let me tell you, this is not the kind of film you find every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband committed suicide, Grace Trevethin (Brenda Blythin) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with huge debts. Fortunately, they find a way to meet ends: marijuana. That's right, Grace begins to develop it. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this movie has been played to a great extent; there is no dull moment anywhere. I certainly have not seen this final scene coming! But anyway, you should see this movie. You may feel more than just festive after seeing it. If there is nothing else, it may be a good lesson to learn about a person's financial resources. But of course, there is a lot of it!
