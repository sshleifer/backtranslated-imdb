Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites him to watch a show with him. You agree not to exchange any information about each other - not even names. Sometimes these are the best types of dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team await him. Scott's wife was killed. His excuse is the mysterious woman, but no one can remember seeing her, and as a result, Scott was sentenced to death for killing his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ela Renz) is not convinced of his guilt and is starting to find a woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% too late for Kansas's attempts to get to the truth. We follow her through some memorable scenes, for example, chasing the Mac waiter (Andrew Tompis) at night and the suffocating place, where Clive drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) takes her to hang around and drink and dance while he is crowded with his friends. This is a stark depiction of sexual desire to the point that it is a distinct part of the film where everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically throughout the scene. Ela Renz is good at female leadership and Thomas Gomez is a popular cop. Alan Curtis began well as a confused man, but as soon as he was arrested, he took his turn in the left direction, where he was quite unhappy to Kansas for no reason. God knows why she is stuck with him. <br /> <br /> The film does not keep you guessing who the killer is as we know from the middle of the film, but that does not matter. In fact, it adds to the dramatic tension and sophistication of the story, where we're going to explore what's going on and then get the hell out! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Junior has an unforgettable role, I never liked it in anything I see in it .... Someone ties me with a tie .....
