Make sure it was well shot and made well! But the story was very weak. Lincoln's portrayal was weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was only a color. Did you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a smart, cracked wisdom without respect for the law or the court. I mean who the hell was it supposed to be? Vinnie's cousin? I mean come on, "I'll only call you Jackass then" ??? I understand that Ford was going for a great funny hero but I did not like this man at all. He cheats on sports and speaks like a simple, sweet person who does not seem to be sitting in the courtroom. How was I supposed to take this seriously. <br /> <br /> The torsion was weaker. I mean Come! This was just stupid. The whole story looked like I had thought about 5 years ago in his dreams. If I said I liked it enough, it was very amusing and made me laugh on several occasions, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact I have to say that I must say that it is good enough, nothing makes me happy and makes me laugh can be bad but this story is so lively and silly that I can not understand how anyone can be considered a great person. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how historical this film is, but if any of it is true, I will have to shake my head.
