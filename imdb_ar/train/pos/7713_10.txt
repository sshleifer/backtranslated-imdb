Science fiction films today resemble Rambo in outer space with special monster effects (often as ironic as the sounds of explosions in a space vacuum). Although tamed by today's standards, the special effects of "Forbidden Planet" were absolutely amazing for their time. Even today, they still have credibility. However, perhaps the best part of the film is why the excitement of the radio continues to attract appeal. Much of what was happening was left to the public imagination. (How did Creil's creatures look?) By owning a large part of the story frame that was not only revealed or revealed in the end, the tension and pessimism that went on throughout the film. The end was also thought-provoking and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still one of the best science fiction movies (if not the best).
