Now, for all movie buffs, this movie may not occupy a high place in the list of things you see. But if you know anything about the evolution of the plot, the deep truth, and the intentions of this film, you understand my point of view. The details of the film are presentations of the writer who is not expected to know what will happen. End. But the film is accurate in the Bible and frightens viewers justifiably thinking of what may be. I am a Christian, not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. A film and probability that something similar to the circumstances described in it can frighten a person significantly to think about his actions and decisions. It's not a cheap attempt to scare people out of faith in God, but it is a way to attract your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know that I will not be left behind. Thanks to films like this, I can look beyond the surface of entertainment, acting and budgeting to appreciate the depth of the film. It's a movie that you should not only see, but feel with your heart and soul.
