This film was produced by one of the most ridiculous humorists in Canada, Yves B. Pellet. I was shocked for a second because he made a romantic comedy, but knowing that it was a heavy cinemale, seen at every local festival and in local cinema, I had a positive feeling about this film. <br /> <br /> Hell, you're right. Scenario scenario (written by Pele himself) away from the bat, a kind of twisted and difficult to follow, but, according to the style of Billelet, it is one of its kind in 90 minutes of the box. <br /> <br /> The highly inspirational "Les Aimants", often converted to Langerous Liaisons (by Lallos), refers to a twisted game of writing notes on the refrigerator. Throughout the film, you'll get a chance to see who is and who is writing to from on this flaming fridge .... which pops up in an interesting love relationship. <br /> <br /> A wonderful story and wonderful photography, great quotations from other films. Should we ask for more for the first film?
