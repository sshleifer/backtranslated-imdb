I watch romantic comedy with some hesitation, because the romantic comedy films are characterized by the old clich√©s that make the film uninteresting. Usually in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and a man, both fall in love, then get into trouble, then spoil the problems of marriage or anything else. But this is a different story, quite different from the romantic comedy films I have seen recently. <br /> <br /> There's a widowed man (Dan), there's a girl (Mary). Dan meets Marie in a library and talks for a while, after Mary has to leave sometime. Dan develops something for her, and when this thing begins to shift into meaning, we get evolved. Mary is his brother's friend. Regardless of the circumstances, Dan marries and realizes he loves her, and even Mary loves him, but their love will not be possible. How it is possible forms the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell's performance is good, and Pinochet Juliet is as good as Marie. All other things are done well. It's a good movie, watch it.
