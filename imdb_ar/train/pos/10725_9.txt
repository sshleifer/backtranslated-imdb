Space Camp is a very decent film. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, decent special effects in time. <br /> <br /> This film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster, which really hinders its popularity. <br /> <br /> The scene where the doors of the shuttle are open in space is simply stunning ... on the big screen, ie ... on TV ... seems moderate. I remember this scene in the theater. I made you feel like you were really there. <br /> <br /> This will be a good IMAX movie, but I'm sure it will never happen.
