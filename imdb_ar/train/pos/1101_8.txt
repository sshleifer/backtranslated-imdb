Although prices have risen a lot and some details have become old, any homeowner suffering from home ownership problems should get a lot of loud laugh out of this movie. I know I did it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, an executive in New York, is moving his family to the outskirts of Connecticut and building a beautiful home there. In hilarious jam one by one, from mortgages to lawsuits gets to construction difficulties, as the costs and construction schedule spiral out of control. I thought the most interesting scene was where Blandings hired a contractor to dig a well. They dig hundreds of feet, but they never find water. However, just a short distance, after a few days, the basement will flood his home! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy offer reliable performances as a couple of hard blandings are overwhelmed by unimaginable problems, and Melvin Douglas is better than Blanding's lawyer and family friend. <br /> <br /> The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Ms. Blandings is portrayed as a kind of gentle naivety that I have no idea what additional problem she is causing, and there is a black maid (horrors!). So do not watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it even more. <br /> <br />
