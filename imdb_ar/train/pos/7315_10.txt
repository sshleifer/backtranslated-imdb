A classic film with a very low budget effect that set a horror icon and launched careers for both Carpenter and Star Curtis. <br /> <br /> It seems that the unstoppable killer is fleeing a mental institution and returning to his hometown chasing a local babysitter on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that never fails to rise to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! The frightening Carpenter story and the intelligent direction of this film give a good chilling life, so you really have to see it! The trend is often composed of simple elements, shadows, dark streets, and arched doors, making the everyday environment of a small town really creepy. Carpenter has managed to make his suspenseful time and shock to make it even more surprising, and this in itself is a few horror filmmakers who managed it! In addition, he is wise enough to give us some really lovely young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension more intense. The highest scores also go to the Carpenter Music score, but are frighteningly alarming. In a sense, Halloween is a great example of an ideal horror film! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis plays a very nice role, like Laurie Strode, so good that she will continue a number of other horror movies before breaking into bigger films. The wonderful Donald Pleasant is doing a perfect job as Meyer's doctor, desperate to arrest him again. The support of Loomis, Soles, Castle and others is very good. <br /> <br /> So, like the villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. It is essential for all sex lovers! <br /> <br /> **** of ****
