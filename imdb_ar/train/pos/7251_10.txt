I've only seen this movie once in about 25 years, and to this day I've always told people that it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Given the absence of verbal dialogue and intellectual dialogue only, I found that the film seductive and I found myself breathing so I do not hear a voice. I would highly recommend this movie and wish it to be available on DVD.
