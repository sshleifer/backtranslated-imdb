I love Korean movies because they have the ability to (really frighteningly calm) to capture real life. I tend to watch Korean movies for this reason alone. I've seen this other film directors before. The film that is closest to the feelings I got from this is Oasis and another wonderful film called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my title summary is supposed to be from a Chrstian perspective so I'll just start doing this instead of just showering with praise. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, director Zhang Dung Lee took a real and almost unbiased image of the modern Protestant Church (regardless of doctrine) and all warts. I have always been waiting for a Christian film that truly depicts the darkest periods of rest in the life of the Church. Because Christian films tend to speak a language other than those they wish to share their faith in. Many religious-tone movies, although well motivated, tend to have a Disney movie resonance or after a private school. They need to show life as it is. The real people are a curse, real people lust, the fall of real people. Although Christians believe salvation is available to those who seek it, we still face the daily challenges of terror for this life. The character of Do-yeon Jeon is a fairly brutal image of a woman found by God, but because of the bitter realities of life, she lost the love she once enjoyed. It does not deny the existence of God. It is only she who refuses to accept coexistence with the idea that he is a loving and tolerant God. <br /> <br /> In her decent country on the edge of morality and madness, her personality asks questions to consider each person, religiously or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is love, why do such terrible things happen?" This film does not answer that, right. I think that the last ten minutes of the film, while open to interpretation, leave us optimistic future for our main character and bring the idea of ​​a "secret sun" full circle. <br /> <br /> I do not believe for a second that this movie tried to be religious or tried in any way to be so. There lies the reason why they worked more. This is true, it is true. For this reason, it is the best summary of a true Christian life I saw in the film.
