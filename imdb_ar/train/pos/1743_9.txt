After seeing a lot of Greek films, I feel suspicious towards most of them. But after watching this I felt surprised. Fantastic movies without a big try. You can not claim that the script is too cool or that photography is perfect or something technical. It is a true story and it occurs in Greek rural areas in places forgotten by God. The film is like a punch in the stomach and I really hope it is not. He speaks clearly about the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) for anything different. The problem of this man is not that he was convicted before. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and does not want them (which is why all the good things he does turn into him). He also talks about the indifference of people, because there are some people who oppose the king's hunting, but they do not dare to say their opinion. In the end you can clearly see that society hypocrisy is religious and tries to act as God says, but at the same time acts unfairly towards the king. This shows how easily people can rationalize their feelings or beliefs in accordance with the established system. In the end, you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means that you can not understand this community and be a part of it unless you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even on your own, you are lost (this is not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is real and must be a prey for everyone. No comment on the main actor because he already got an award and I think his game was fantastic. A little comment on Hatzisavvas. He's like dinosaurs. He has played a lot of roles and I'm sure this role for him was very easy but he plays so much that you can not deprive him of a great bravo. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a good Greek film.
