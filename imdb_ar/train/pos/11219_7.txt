/ * minor spoilers * / <br /> <br /> On the way back, before the Evangelion industry, before Hideaki Anno was a beloved and family name for many anime fans, and before Gainax came to fanfavorite mode, Gunbuster was made. With only the Wonders of Honneamise of the Gainax at the time, plus the famous Otakon shorts or of course, Gunbuster had some hard work to follow. He did not make it easier on himself by choosing the type he had already done countless times before, Space Opera. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Gainax decided to put it as a six-part OAV (straight to video) series. This allows the series to have a greater scope than would have been possible had it been converted into a movie. This also prevents them from becoming too dull and too long, with lots of irrational battles and padding along the way. Besides, they made some effort to keep their health from the experimental space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space opera. <br /> <br /> For one, the shows start with beautiful lighting, with Noriko at Okinawa High School for michelting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship captain who died in battle, when she was still a little girl. This makes her life in the academy very difficult, as some of her classmates begin to doubt that Noriko is preferable to the professors. The first episode is largely a comedy drama, with a strong focus on character and school preparation. Things change quickly when the threat of foreign invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl in the class) are selected to help the combined fleet. <br /> <br /> The central part of Gunbuster leaves our women in space, focusing on both personal drama and movement. More characters are presented, and parts of the past are pulled from Noriko again. Besides, foreign threat becomes more imminent every minute, Gunbuster, the last hope of mankind is presented. As clever as the writer Okada, he incorporated the principles of stretch time, to seasoning things a bit. In short, moving time is slower for those traveling light speed. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. The tragic aspect of this is also highlighted when Noriko sees her friends again when she returns to al-Qaeda, who are far older than her age. Science may not be perfect, but it is presented in a very reasonable way, even with some short films for the SD theater between the episodes, where Noriko and Kazumi and their instructor give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series. <br /> <br /> Animation, for a series made in the 1980s, is definitely good. The designs date back to the 1980s, but are charming. The animation is sufficiently fluent and the characters designs are nice, although the fashion betrayal <br /> <br /> Gainax will later exploit it to the fullest. Mekas all over the shows are very cool, with Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, powerful and spacious. The last episode was performed in black and white. Although it is generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budgetary reasons, it provides a completely different atmosphere for the series, which is quite appropriate for the latter part. <br /> <br /> The music is a very typical exposition of the Opera. Very bombarded in places, very general, definitely not worth buying. It fits the chain for the most part, but it can become very annoying at times. Tanaka is not a very famous composer, and the other respected series he worked on is Dragon Half. If you think that the music of the eighties of the last century, you will know what you expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the focus shifts slowly from drama to space opera to epic battle, but this way the viewer barely notices. Step by step drama will be reduced, will take the front row battles. No side was left at all completely. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and the crew are fighting for more human existence, and with the last battle on the horizon, some questions are being asked to the public regarding the status of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to ensure self-preservation. Although not answered later, they still offer some thought-provoking foods. The last episode is very epic, with a nice ending, but quite predictable, although all endings should not contain many of the strange transitions of course. Again, it fits the chain. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster may seem an average amphibious opera opera at first, with alien invasions, massive battles and some personal drama, and most of it is. But is very well done for change. Instead of going for a steady mix of the previous elements, six long episodes, Gunbuster offers us a change from a small-scale drama to a massive epic tournament. Along the way we meet with some interesting and stylized personalities, whose mutual relationships change dramatically because of the time-widening phenomenon. The display is very tightly written, although it tends to slide at some points. It was possible to avoid excessive tragic events and very mica attacks. Overall, the Gunbuster flight takes you on a very comfortable, sometimes sad, and sometimes heroic journey. He may not have broken the boundaries and boundaries of the space opera genre, but at least he discourages them a bit. Classic anime is very fun, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
