I saw an advanced presentation of this film tonight. I absolutely loved it. The film kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Celian Murphy is very creepy as a villain. For those of you who saw the beginning of Batman, his character was even more terrifying in this film. His character played very well. The most terrifying "bad guy", I've seen in a moment. Rachel McAdams was wonderful. The whole audience laughed and chanted and chanted at the same time, as if we were ready. Thrill is held through the exit of the film. The startling part is that the end was not anti-climate. I was not disappointed at the end. I felt good. Trailer does not do justice film. The film is much better than the trailer referred to. Do not wait for this movie to appear on your video. Go see it. Although I did not have to pay to watch this film, I would gladly have given it 10.75 to see. Enjoy!
