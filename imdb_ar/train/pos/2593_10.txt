It comes out of the left field, which is really not what you expect. But I love it. Most memorable film experiences come from a sense of surprise, if you ask me. If you are not informed of the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers very strange ... you are in a place to receive treatment. <br /> <br /> The cast is wonderful, but it does not stretch much, it's clear. The special effects do not come from anywhere (seriously, they resemble exotic dark romantic comics so do - then wow) and they are fantastic. Comprehensive cinematography is easy on the eyes, editing and sound quality is very good, and the twisted story unfolds without cliches. While none of these aspects make him solo, "What the hell?" The only factor that makes it a treasure of the film. <br /> <br /> People who hit this movie are meaningless. It is one of the nineties that has never been overlooked, and which she has never heard of, or loves very much when she jumps to mention her address. <br /> <br /> I'm in the last group.
