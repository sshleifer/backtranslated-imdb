I've seen a preview of Freebird in Isle of Man as you've heard about in two mugs of motorcycles. Although I had basically finished the race, the temptation to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle film (yes, like Quadrophenia like anyone else) proved enough to keep me away from beer and parties. finally! I did it! We Britons have actually made a great movie for motorcycles (not like Torque). This is with the best British comedy. In my words, this is the best performance for the screen of Phil Daniels. As for Bill's Jeeps, there is a new British legend that makes his name feel. I loved Gary Stretch in the wonderful Dead Man shoes from Shan Meadows, and here he delivers a great performance that he can proudly add to his growing reputation in the film. This film is not only our bikers, but I think everyone (so that my girlfriend liked it). I hope to get the same wonderful response on the mainland as it did in Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes of this movie, (watch out from the store), as it will spoil the fun, but I say, go, watch, enjoy, get one of the best nights in the cinema I have been through for some time. I really think this can be classy. As they say in TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
