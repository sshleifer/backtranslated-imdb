The "Bell Book and Candle" has recently been shown on cable. For not seeing him for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on James Van Drotten's Broadway song, which was composed of Rex Harrison and Lilly Palmer in the early 1950s, Daniel Tarach adjusted the film on screen. The film was directed by Richard Quinn, who turned the play into a cheerful comedy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, based on some of the comments made by IMDb, it seems that the big issue is the pairing of the two stars, who collaborated on "Vertigo", released the same year. Cinema fans did not think about the age difference when the movie was released. In fact, most of the older male stars of that period were always involved with younger women. <br /> <br /> The movie, which was shown in Manhattan during Christmas, is an exhilarating comedy that attracted viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty because the camera obviously adored her no matter what she was playing. As a charming human being, her charming Gillian. James Stewart, who plays publisher Shep Henderson, also appears at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedian explaining why he was at the top. <br /> <br /> In supporting the roles, the wonderful Elsa Lancaster, who plays Queenie, is a welcome addition to any film, as shown here. Jack Nimmond of Jack Lemon, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen by writer Sidney Radic. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home with the "Bell Book and Candle".
