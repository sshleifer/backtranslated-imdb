The first time I saw this film in the theater at a foreign film festival, I thought it was interesting and wonderful and the artist had a dual sexual sensibility. Very European, very Dutch! I recently hired him for the second show, and I can barely keep laughing at the stressful subject of the mad writer who suffers from religious and sexual persecution. Take control of yourself! This man is an independent who lives outside society. I think the real reason for having these fantasy nightmares about Spider Woman is that his guilt complex started to ignore a year later when the mother's advice about getting into cars (and bed) with strangers was ignored! Not only does he make horrendous amounts of looting (probably tax) to spread stories (the journey of lying with guilt), but he is very cheap in paying for a hair cut, and so he troubles the owner of the beauty salon. Then he has the nerve to complain of the invoice! But I also doubt that the world has changed much since the production of this film. In a serious note, it was interesting to see some of the works of Jean de Pont and one of Paul Verheven's previous films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed much after all?
