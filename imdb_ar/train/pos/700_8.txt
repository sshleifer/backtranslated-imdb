Insomniac's Nightmare was an amazingly interesting film. I loved the way he threw you into the subconscious mind of the main character without noticing the scenes ... he was acting first class - frankly, I was watching Dominic Monaghan reading the phone book! - But everyone, especially the little girl, was fantastic. I was very impressed by the look of the film as well. Independent Films usually have a good look at my camcorder, but this director knows what to do. Lighting, cinema ... quality work. I am looking forward to the long work of Tess Nanavati!
