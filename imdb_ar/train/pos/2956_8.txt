There are very few artists who can keep me in every full movie as soon as they attend. One of those few is Judy Davis, who built a successful career by creating strong personalities in a position but very weak in heart. She plays roles that most other artists treat in a melodramatic way and adds intense intensity and attention away from anything else on the screen. <br /> <br /> Her skills are well presented in "High Tide", making her fit for the second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis her first big success with "My Wonderful Life". In this film, Davis played the role of a young woman who was determined to make her in the world, despite the choking she felt from her community and her upbringing. However, in "High Tide," Davis's character, Lilly, is almost the opposite: she abandoned any hope for her future when she was small, having given birth to a child, evading her responsibilities and leading life without direction or meaning. When she finally met her daughter years later, the idea of ​​caring for her child was scary. She knows that this is her chance to atone for her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still be respected? <br /> <br /> Gillian Armstrong's films often relate to stories about the characters she wants to communicate with. Some, however, face the obstacles set by their personal habits and addiction. Oscar and Lucinda, for example, were about a man and a woman who desperately needed to love each other but were always out of touch with a desire to get a chance to be addicted to gambling. Here, we are immersed in a family world torn by the mother's inability to commit to a stable life and struggle to recover herself despite her conviction that it is too late to change for the better. This is not just a film with a great performance at its center, but it is also a rare achievement: a completely convincing story of redemption.
