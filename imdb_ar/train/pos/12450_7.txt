Chartered and watched this short work (<90 minutes). It is the best treatment modesty has received in the film - and its creator Peter O'Donnell agrees to participate as "creative consultant". The personal, we who love it, are treated with respect. The direction of Spiegel is the best he has done so far and the casting process has been very good. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original Jim Holdoway forms of humility. Fantastic discovery by the cast! Raymond Cruz in the role of young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope that Tarantino & Co. Will continue to win more in the series - I am particularly interested in knowing who will choose to be Willy Garvin the incomparable!
