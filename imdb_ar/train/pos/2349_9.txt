It is a pleasure to see such creativity on TV again. This fair is a poetic, artistic and good fun. The characters are well connected and the writing is not bad (I think they will get better when they get their legs). Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Girls are stealing the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable as it is olive. The aunts are a joy. I sincerely hope to write them into larger parts because they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, this is all the right news to print. Go make yourself a big plate of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old way. This is like Dr. Suss for adults.
