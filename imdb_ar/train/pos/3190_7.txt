This is a standard musical comedy of the 1930s, with a great addition that includes well-known actors in the 1930s in a small, fun atmosphere. <br /> <br /> There is not much of the story, and the film is all about fun and "not worrying" in general of the atmosphere, with a traditional comedy touch from Hal Roach. Appereantly is the "Cinderella Story" but I certainly did not think of it this way while watching the movie. The story unfolds in storytelling, which includes many different characters and also the appearance of a small veil, when the main characters arrive at the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the highlight of the film is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some routine. It's like watching a movie and getting a short film for Laurel and Hardy for free. As Walter Long of Lorel and Hardy in Routine and James Finlayson (without Sharp this time) shows as a short story director. <br /> <br /> Certainly, all successful and sub-characters distract their attention from the main plot line and personality, but in this case there is no problem, as it is very interesting and interesting than the main drawing line and the typical shallow main character. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely not worse than any other kind of movies of the same time period, although the rating here indicates otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
