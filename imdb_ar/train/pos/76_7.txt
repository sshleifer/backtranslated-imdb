Follow the Vincent Price film for HOUSE OF WAX (1953), a film that has enhanced its reputation as a horror icon, revolves around bitter? Though the trick? Man review. Although there is a new edition, the previous image (a snapshot in technicolor) is still a distinct effort; however, regardless of some of the resistive comic satisfaction, forced resort to cheap gimmick (was a three-dimensional presentation) No matter what happened to the missing bag that appeared in some police stations with a broken head?), This provides more than enough excitement of the Grand Guignol type and the total value of the camp (price hampers it in a variety of disguises as the inventor of delusions that represent star figures " Missing "benefited from genius) feet. By the way, the involvement of director Bram here proves that it is not just a coincidence ?? Since the narration contains elements of two books of horror (both starring Laird Cregar), he has taken command of LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young roles are played by Mary Murphy (as a staunch assistant at Price) and Patrick O'Neill as a friend in the police detective? It is strange that he himself takes the lead in a similar piece, the horror film [1966] acquired in time to serve as an impression for this one). An important aspect here is the recent adoption of a new detection technology, fingerprint, which is important in bringing down Price (at a predictable but somewhat embarrassing fire peak)? Although the constant snoop of his novels about amateur crime has at least a lot to do about it in the long run! Watching the star in a proportionate role, the film appears as a great fun ?? Especially in 73 minutes compact.
