I must admit - the only reason I have to buy this movie is that I am a big fan of Gackt and a huge fan of Hyde. I was expecting a good film that contained a lot of footage that was, as we say, pleasing to the female eye but a little cheesy story. I mean, the conclusion seems to be true. Now that I've just finished watching it - I feel the need to tell the world its brilliance! Both Hyde and Gackt performed painfully, and my eyes remained hot with tears that continued throughout the last half of the film. You get full of the story, and really feel the characters by the end. The vampire element - which I love, but it is very easy to overtake or sabotage with a movie - is skillfully mixed in the context of the story to make it just a weird, ordinary thing in this setting, instead of adding unnecessary randomness to the story. I rated it 9 out of 10 at the beginning ... Then I came back and tried to think why I was not giving this last point. He came up with nothing. So ten out of ten is it. After all - I'm not a critic - the fact that I bother writing a review at all means either that I really hate the film or really love it. You can see the side I'm having with Moon Child.
