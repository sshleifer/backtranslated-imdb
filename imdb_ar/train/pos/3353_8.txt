This film offers a strong commentary on the Italian people at the time. Use mirrors to enhance the revelation of beautiful characters and I can not recall the beauty and splendor of Sophia Lorraine and Mastroiani. I love them both. Their interaction is so beautiful and natural that you can wonder if the camera is actually there or not. In his short role, the husband is portrayed as an excellent Italian fascist who commands his wife and children, but in his own way, a loving father. The scenes start with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all the incredible Italians and the film is truly historical. I loved the film and I also agree that it is funny that it is no more famous.
