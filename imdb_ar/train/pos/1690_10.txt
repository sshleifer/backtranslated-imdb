I found memorable quotes looking for videos; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old Man 1: As you know, I remember the first time they played this thing. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: You remember the winged crawler. <br /> <br /> Old Man 1: And I can remember you fell for that, a hook and a cover. <br /> <br /> Old Man 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> The old lady: I ​​did. I put a big bucket on your head and the army boys took off with them to fight Mars. <br /> <br /> The 2 year old: Do not you die yet?
