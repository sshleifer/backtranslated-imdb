I caught the last half of this movie on the cable one night and was amazed by how sick he was. Even when one of the victims is at its worst, the camera continues. Long shots of his body, which was revealed and his personality in the concentration camps, is compressed in a bag of moving body and depression. Do not watch this movie if you already have depression. Then again do not see it if you feel really well.
