Along with airplanes, trains, cars and Uncle Buck, this film is John Smith's movie. When a hypnotist gets a card (like a Manshurian candidate) and becomes a horny man who does not know what to say, he offers two memorable quotes (both dealing with male anatomy). You should see a scene of love that includes groceries, and can not be described. <br /> <br />
