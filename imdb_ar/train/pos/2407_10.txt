The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (a believer in the Bible). I am not in line with the crowd of Yemeni believers. I came out of this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me in their attempts to control our government, they are doing what Judas tried to do. I call it Jude syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not Judah, although Jesus said that his kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly showed some of that. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoyed a simple joy in playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> Jesus was also wonderful. <br /> <br /> It's too much control film. <br /> <br /> Very satisfactory.
