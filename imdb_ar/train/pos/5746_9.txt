Words are not serious enough to convey the emotional power of this film; it is one of the most troubles you may ever see, but the end is one of the most loving, tender and emotional things you can hope for. Each actor in each role is wonderful, especially Jimmy Lee Curtis the wise and the few, and the severe injury and frustration of Ray Leota, a strong twist of Tom Holsey was supposed to be enjoyed for every prize in the book. (It's the first choice for the best actor of 1988 in Danny Perry's "Alternative Oscars.") The last half-hour on melodrama, but the film earns each of its tears - and unless they are made of stone, there will be many of them.
