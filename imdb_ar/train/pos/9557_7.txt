I love this anime! I laugh at my head with all the jokes and violence (mostly "fiancee" Akani Ranma hesitant but the short mood) is very slapy but Ranma deserves it but he does his best to fix ... main character Ranma go to China for training only to fall in the spring Jusenkkyo cursed and turn into Girl when sprayed with cold water. Since then, it has been pure chaos one by one. Among the most prominent contestants, the mixed brother and sister of Kono and Kodachi, the exciting shampoo, and the Habosai deviant all cause problems for our hero / heroine. However, Ranma's selfish father Jenma is the one who concludes being the culprit behind this mess most of the time. If anyone wants anime this is funny, this is one. It's cute and best with Japanese Descriptions.
