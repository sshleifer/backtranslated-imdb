When I think about this film, all the qualities that come to mind relate in some way to the material appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, so I think this film should be judged in terms of. Watch rich golden tones surrounding the sleeping love next to the fireplace, or the thick Turkish bath, and let it fill your senses with views of spices, coarse cloth, soft skin, scented oils, coarse flame and satin silk. Do not just watch and listen, but suck it, and let the voice of the narrator of the wits impress you.
