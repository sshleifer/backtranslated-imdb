Welcome to Collingwood offers some of the most joyful dialogue in modern memory. We remember watching this comedy by the brothers Antony and Joe Russo, perhaps with another film we saw in the past, but since we lost the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of was the 1958 film "Big Deal on Madonna Street" , Directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Rosso brothers have assembled a wonderful team to film all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Messi, Louis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, can not be bad. Since this is part of the group, all characters get a chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The movie offers us a collection of unsafe, safe crackers from Hell. No one can believe that these men can do a job like the one they do. Everything that can happen, and more, is what they succeed in doing. George Clooney shows a small appearance as the main safety cracker, also seen as the impersonation of a rabbi, where he is confused with the pastor by gang members leaving Cossimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, allowing all these little time scammers to do their job. Let their funny lines make you laugh, where anyone can see this gang sentenced from start to finish!
