I saw a lady with Red Her again when she appeared, and I did not remember her as something to cherish. The truth is that despite her base in a real story, her acting on the screen is ridiculous and unbelievable. The true merit of the image is cast. A group of the best supporting players of the 1930s and 1940s is a background to the always sensitive and intelligent work of Maryam Hopkins, and the amazing and spectacular performance of Claude Raines, which is usually the best thing to do. What a representative! He has never won an Oscar, but he is at the top of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Lady with Red Hair may contain his best film work. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
