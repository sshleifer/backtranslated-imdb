I watched this presentation on a television program in the United States when it was originally broadcast in 1988 (?). Assuming that the thumbnails were available on DVD, I purchased the first editions of all three books last year. Since then, I've been looking for serial on internet movie sites. I found this site today. I will give up searching. <br /> <br /> I also want to buy this full series - 26 episodes - mini clips. After buying a DVD, you read each book, then watch the episodes for this book. That's what I did with the Carla trio of John Lecar and Larry McMurray's trio of the Texas Rangers. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for books or a series of great books that have become very good TV series - or movie series - now available on DVD?
