Fatal error is a really wonderful movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schumping, Malcolm Stuart, and David Lewis are in the film. The film's representatives acted really well. Robert Wagner played a good role. Relationship between Saboto Jr. The Turner was nice. There may be a difference in age but they are a unique couple. Actors really worked together well. The music in the film is really good by Ron Ramin and fits well. There's a bunch of things happening in the film that do not know what's going on and what's going to happen next. This film keeps you going from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., and Janine Turner, then watch this great movie!
