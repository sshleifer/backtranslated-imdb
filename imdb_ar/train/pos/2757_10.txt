If you want to see a movie of a different kind, if you feel love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this film makes you think. Although George is mentally handicapped, you can see ultimate intelligence in the end, when love gives you directions rather than the brain. I'm not emotionally, but this film makes you feel human. The film is as good as Forrest Gump I think. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough ads to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" ("The Color of God") by Majid Majeed is another example of these foreign films, with an almost similar taste.
