This is a very funny comedy about Ealing about a community in central London discovered, through an unusual set of circumstances, that they are not English, but they are attached to the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> The film features comedian Stanley Holloway (known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as a group of other classic comic actors of the period. <br /> <br /> It appears that the story was based on news at the time, when the Canadian government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting European member of the Kings. The idea actually reminded me of the actual situation of the Hut River County in Western Australia, where the landowner had been "separated" from the Australian government because of a dispute over the wool quota. (Not recognized by the governments of Western Australia or Australia). <br /> <br /> This wonderful text plays with a lot of political and economic issues, such as the TV show "Yes Minister"; as well as being a great eccentric piece of character as well.
