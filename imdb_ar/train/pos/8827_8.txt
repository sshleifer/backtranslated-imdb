Thanks to a limited budget, running time of up to eight minutes, and a great deal of imagination, Nacho Vegalondo achieved one of the shortest films I have ever seen. The screen resolution is really great, as it does not prevent the end until the last moment. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you what the shortcut is, because you will be able to enjoy it much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the year's discovery of his individual program: The output, writing and acting in this massive short film is the most outstanding effort I've seen in years. Also pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, her incredible reaction footage. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
