We start with all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have watched about 100 films a year over the last 15 years. We have recently been honored to receive life-long movie permits for any movie at any time at no cost! So we can see what we want whenever we want. The aim is that cash is calculated from zero. Local critics or national critics like Ebert are no different from you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the film and are forced to see hundreds of films whether they want it or not. So, we think that if you get your money worth two hours of fun it's good enough for us! We never listen or read critics. We care only about our friends and those we know like the things we love. Good enough about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. Not only good but very good. Critics are a bunch of idiots. Just because there is nudity and the language they hate. It was worth the price of the ticket and that is all you can ask for. Is not this right? Not every film can be a candidate for an Academy Award. Sharon's stone is wonderful and he does a wonderful job in the film, and it puzzles me with what critics want in hell
