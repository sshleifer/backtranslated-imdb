I saw this flick on ENCW Nate past for the third or fourth time. Enjoy a much requested DVD. This is really the fore and of course the first pairing of Man Stewart. Here is more than usual, although it is not as strong as The Searchers. Many clear symbols about masculinity are achieved, but mainly represented by Stewart and his partner Millard Mitchell and Shelley Winters and Waco Johnny Dean Dan Doria. Steve Miller (not the Joker) is interesting because he is handsome and will be the hero interested in Blola but very yellow. Such as Stuart in "The Man Who Killed Liberty," has practically become a apron and the coffee of his enemies. Decaffeinated without a doubt. Tony Curtis from the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson acting like any Indian I have seen on screen have two interesting successes. <br /> <br /> John McIntyre's special offers as very lucky card / arms dealers abroad are a very low Western version of Rick's American Cafe. No one wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens is outside a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some wonderful sights with Stewart before reaching the Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Gear like White Earb and the Indian leader who takes Walter Brennan's teeth from him in the Red River are fun sights. This is the Western type that only Stuart, Wayne and Scott could not withdraw from. Worth the shot, repeat. :-)
