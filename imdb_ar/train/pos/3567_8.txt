The world of Damon Ronnion in Times Square, New York, before Disneycraft, is the foundation of this music. Joseph L. Mankowitz, a man who knew about films, drew this tribute to the "crossroads of the world" that show us that the lower side of New York is in the past. Frank Lawer's music looks wonderful. We see a wonderful collection of characters that were typical in the area. People tend to edge the community towards this area because of the lights, work, and possibilities of this part of the city. This lower part of the city made its living outside the street life and was very intense. <br /> <br /> Some songs from the original production are not included in the movie. We do not know if this makes sense, but it is not strange for Hollywood to change and change what happened on stage. This original actor included Vivienne Blaine and Stubby Kaye are wonderful, and wonder about the decision not to allow Robert Aldo, Sam Levine, and Isabel Bigley to repeat their original roles. These were outstanding representatives who could make a remarkable contribution. <br /> <br /> The movie is superbly visual. The look closely follows the fashions of the times. As far as Marlon Brando, who was not known for his musical abilities, is concerned, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons are working in the film. Sky Masterson is, however, a man who will look like a character if he makes a different appearance. Frank Sinatra is as good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does a great job portraying a woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment of the same kind of man she is trying to save. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Blaine is delighted. Never stopped amazed like Miss Adelaide, a woman with a heart of gold love the attention of Nathan Detroit. Mrs. Blaine has a wonderful impression as a girl offering a wiser than allowing her to be. Stubby Kaye does a great job by reviving Nicely Nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> The impressive production owes much to the talented Abe Burrows burrows that adapted to the screen. The fashion developed by Irene Sharaf caught the right tone.
