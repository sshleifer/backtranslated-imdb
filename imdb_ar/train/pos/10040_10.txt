For me personally, this film falls in the top four positions at all. No exceptions. James Cameron has repeatedly proved himself to be the storyteller. Through films such as "The Alien", "The Abyss" and "Both", he was clearly a wonderful director and friend in terms of movement and science fiction. See Story Adds Strange Quality to the Movie. But Titanic is very different from other strokes of his brilliance. The film moves exceptionally and offers room for surprises, plot development and interesting personal developments in a story everyone knows. The story of the famous trip that sank on her first journey is a legend story, so the challenge was to portray Cameron as a real, enjoyable and enjoyable film. The acting is great as Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose overnight with the release of the film. In most films, I am disturbed when the supporting characters are not given much to do but in this film is more purposeful. (Gloria Stewart) her story, obviously the story of Rose and Jack alone, and no one else. Emotionally, it is quite satisfactory and can not leave a dry eye in the theater or home. Music became iconic and mythical. He is the best music composer James Horner ever and raises a lot of film and audience. The song after a long time became annoying but I still appreciate it on this phenomenon, this film. Only one problem, James Cameron's usual problem, is the dialogue that is unforgettable but in a bad way as in his cheese at points but all that aside. James Cameron presented a masterpiece and romantic epic that sweeps you away in a lifetime journey. My heart will not continue from this.
