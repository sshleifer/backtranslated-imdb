I love this movie very much. The animation was well done and the romance was nice. I liked most of Bryan Adams's songs and Hans Zimmer's result was excellent. What many people do not realize is how closely it relates to the features of the dark heart / end of the world now (what happens when the so-called "civilization" invades someone to the house, what it means to be "civilized", etc.). The opening scene and music were very exciting. The film is pitiful to America which was a beautiful day.
