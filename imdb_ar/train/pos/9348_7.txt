What we have here is the attitude. A man is found in distress and people want to help him - in contradictory ways. In the end they are forced to leave. You can not fix people. Though different in Hollywood's Reign Over Me, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> This story is not related to Charlie Veneman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters on 9/11 aircraft that has gone into a state of mind almost from PTSS since. It is about what Charlie meets with Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his classmate in the dental school and knew about his tragedy, monitoring him in the street and calling back. Charlie rides on a small motorized toy bike - a fantastic and refreshing way to negotiate around traffic in Manhattan - with big headphones on a block of unruly hair. The hair is the main Sandler prop to show it is muddled. The use of music must be returned to the house with every subway rider who uses the iPod. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but ironically that Alan, stuck with a dominant wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him. Charlie lives as a teenager full of a huge credit fund (the insurance money from the tragedy) and begins pulling Alan to "hang around" or "eat Chinese" or buy records or watch the Mel Brooks marathon at the home of the actors. Charlie lives in a nice large apartment that is protected by a middle ground property, returns the kitchen again and again, and collects an old Venella from Springsteen, Who, etc., and plays a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant empty living room screen. <br /> <br /> Charlie's brother-in-law is deeply concerned about him, but they are also resentful, as we learn later. Alan has a new patient to suggest. Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan. Trying to help Charlie Partly let Alan escape from his stifling facts, but in part makes him more aware of them. <br /> <br /> Chedle and Sandler make a strange couple, but that does not matter, because they are convinced they may need each other. Charlie desperate of a friend who never knew his family, because to escape his loss, pretends to be unprecedented. What if Charlie, asleep in the room, slept naked and slept and had a terrible musical taste (La Motown)? Alan wants to escape his elegant and lively life. He is under thumb not only for his wife but for his dental partners, who have taken control of him even though he has done the practice. It's white, by the way, it's black. <br /> <br /> There's also a lukewarm patient from hell, stuffing things seriously in the dental offices, but he starts to appear differently when Charlie comes and notices that she's a babe. The sexual instinct seems to be latent ready to revive at any moment. He has also attracted to my breasts Liv Tyler, a psychologist in the same building as dentists who start trying to treat Charlie when he admits he may need help. <br /> <br /> Crazy Sandler plays a little play, as with a lot of drawing devices (actually this movie looks like a play in more than one point), but it has many monologues where it expresses its sadness in very impressive ways. <br /> <br /> Charley is not only phantom and sad, but serious and violent, all these efforts to help him start backfire. The film is impressive in the way it conveys a sense that people can not be made right. It is an interesting film - sometimes an influential film - and this is the first time that the events of September 11 are dealt with in terms of survivors' suffering. But there is an element of comedy that sometimes looks tasteless, and a lot of people are painted very extensively, and Hollywood's luxurious interior decorates are horrible; only the streets of Manhattan look real. There is a scene in the courtroom is a fake, and Donald Sutherland is a very good judge so it is not true. The Alan family problem was solved very easily by a phone call. However, this is worth pursuing for representation - the control and accuracy of Cheadle, and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as the role he played in P.T. Anderson's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, although it's obviously the best film, but it's actually much better.
