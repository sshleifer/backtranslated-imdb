A bad cast, an awesome scenario filled with holes, a blonde eaten alive, a wicked world has a very bad mustache, one man takes on a platoon of armed trainers and the victor emerges, and terrible special effects, they fix the problem by ... . The only thing missing is an unnecessary sexual scene during one of the killings. Haha. Good fun fun filled with predictable twists and funny commuters. I enjoyed this movie very much, but before watching it, make sure you laugh well. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and do not take it seriously. I can not, in my opinion, believe that this film has been made to take people seriously. However, if you can watch it and just sit back and enjoy it, I really think you can enjoy this movie the way you were supposed to enjoy it. So simply get some popcorn and a couple beer and spend an enjoyable night with some friends and this movie. I brought some joy in my life.
