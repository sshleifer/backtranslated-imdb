Everything started with True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse to deliver the club safely. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and takes them to see True Heart Bear. Later, the Care Index dropped more and verified True Heart and Noble Heart Horse to see if Dark Dark could not go unless the club asked for care so they asked Dawn & John to take care of the club. After the return of True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse returned, they sent Dawn & John to the camp. Bears grew from a cousin and cousin to prepare to fight Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart kidnaps all care homes and the children (Dawn & John) must tell Christy that Dark Heart is evil. From working together to save the bears care. Later, the True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse discovered that it was a Dark Heart Shadow game and return to the Land of Care to find it had disappeared. Children come in (Dawn, John, and Christy) but were not strong enough to stop Dark Heart. True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse comes to help Dawn, John and Christy liberate the other bears, but Christie stumbles into the dark Heart. Than Dark Heart saw that Christie was beaten and stopped fighting the Bear Care to help her, but he could not because Dark Heart (himself) did not have the power to save Christie. Take care of the bears and the children help the dark heart save Christie. Now Dark Dark began to pay attention and became a real boy in love with Christie. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helped Christie to work in the camp. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic step and the best movie by Care Bears. <br /> <br /> I'm like all the movies I care about, and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who was impressed with this film?
