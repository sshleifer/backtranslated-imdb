The emotional impact of this film defies words. It's elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled in two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures in his ability to act, the whole set of him. Who knows? I have seen "the pursuit of happiness and thought", this should be a coincidence for actor Smith. His performance in both films portrays another dimension entirely to Smith, improving talent, selective scripts, not sure, but I see him now in a different way. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence, you have to suspend your faith. Do not see it for the plot, see it for the fragile state of the human heart, literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love and sacrifice.
