Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I do not usually go for military films / war, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was dangerous, but he was also fascinated. Bieringer's character proved to be heroic and honest. It does not matter, you know he got your back. <br /> <br /> Zane's character was developed throughout the film. It was not just a suit, it certainly proved that he could be a hero and handle the gun. <br /> <br /> I ended up a bit. It was not fun all over the movie, but I'm glad I saw it, though. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking.
