The sequel hardly lives up to the original. This certainly proves true in this case. However, if you are a fan of the original version, it is sure to give this watch. Although the camera's work does not exist, Brian Krauss's personality is annoying, and the plot is a clique, it's more entertaining than the first, and that's what I find amusing. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film. Frankly, it's a bit different. Instead of sitting in his script writing about the cabin, Stanley stands in Hollywood in an attempt to guide his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This film has a completely different look, but it's still wonderful to see Stanley at work. <br /> <br /> I give the film 6 out of 10.
