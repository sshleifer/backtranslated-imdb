If I could come back, even if I was an adult and took back the summer days I spent in the camp ... I would be there very quickly. The campsites I went to were not great. They were in Texas where mosquitoes already carry people, but we had horses and fishing. The cinematography was spectacular, funny characters and particularly credible Perkins, Pollack and Erkin. The character of Sam Reemi and the sub-narrator was invaluable. So, who thought this film was lame ... I feel very sorry because they can not suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine the life of the camp again as an adult or they never went as children. The bottom line is that these people have had the opportunity to retreat and become events again, as well as they did at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was fun, smart, beautifully written, beautifully prepared and artistic, so I want to see it again and again for the scene only. Good movies but wildlife has become a character like actors. Rented, watched, bought, and watched over and over again ... you do not get old. ; 0)
