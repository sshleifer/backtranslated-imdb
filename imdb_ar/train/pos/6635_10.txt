What can I say about the first film ever? <br /> <br /> You can not evaluate this, because it is not supposed to be amusing. But if you have to evaluate it, you should give it a number 10. It is amazing to see the animated images of 1895. This was one of the most important films in history. I wonder how it was to be someone who saw the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
