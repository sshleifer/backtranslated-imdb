I thought this film was wonderful. It was hilarious. Kinda reminded me of the spongy tap. This is a must for anyone who loves rock 70. (I hope not to be my friends and friends like this for twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy performs well because the leading singer outside the game tries to restore this old spirit, br /> <br /> Stephen Re fits the film perfectly because the glue tries to tie the tape together, but does not work well. <br /> <br /> If you love music and have always been in a band, this movie is definitely right for you. You will not regret seeing this movie. I know I do not. Even my family found it funny, and that's something to say.
