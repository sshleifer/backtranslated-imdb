I would like to know why John Amos left the show, how did he die from the show again? I could not relate to everything, but sometimes they hit the house with the problems they faced. By the way, did they leave the ghetto? I think the episode with Black Jesus was my favorite. We got to experience them several times well. Something they did not have often. I hope they will return the offer. During the day so people can actually stay awake to watch them. I do not think a new film or show will work. Especially without the original cast. They really made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you so much!!
