As part of our vocabulary in the late 1950s, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, and so on. In this wonderful show "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> It was Saturday night and everybody was stuck on the TV. This was a real show of family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that brought everyone together. <br /> <br /> Loren Green was the dominant patriarch of the family. His words depict wisdom. We often wonder that Ben Cartwright, a widower, should be the best husband of his poor wife who died. He raised wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Naturally, we all wondered why Bernell Roberts left the show. The exhibition was a gold mine and Roberts gave up a lot of money when he left. He never started his career because he was associated as the son of Cartwright. I had to try to go back to the chain. He certainly lost a profit by leaking out.
