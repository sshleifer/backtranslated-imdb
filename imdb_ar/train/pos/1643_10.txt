This is a movie that everyone should watch if you want to see a great representation. Mr. Torn and Ms. Farrell are doing a wonderful job. I think it should be shown on TV again so that a new audience can enjoy it. Great deals. <br /> <br /> It gives you a real sense of what the pioneers had to pass through physically and emotionally. Great unheard of film. <br /> <br /> That was when Mrs. Farrell was very small. I've always thought of her as a comedian, but this is definitely not a comedy and it's just fantastic. There are few dialogues, but this makes it seem more realistic. Mr. Rip as always is a great presence and only his breath has a great feeling. I must see the film.
