This adapts great and the miniseries are great in themselves. The plot's fans may be disappointed by the plot (but in fact the modern readers who read Bleak House without seeing an initial version of the film? Know only a little). <br /> <br /> I think it is very shocking to see critical reviews of the series written by people who have no clue about the story - have you seen this series already or did you just get the BBC production because Gillian Anderson was in the latest version? <br /> <br /> The series embodies mood, speed, characters and charters (dispelling the undue prosperity in Dickensian and detracting from films like Turveydrop's story, dynamic Smallweed family and extra lawyers - tangle, etc. wholes are very broken). The only omission I would have liked to have kept was the Gillespie incident, but since the first episode was really slow (after the first episode the pace was perfect) I could see that I had to go. <br /> <br /> My only other criticism is that Joe's death could have been done with more sincerity. I can see that it was possible to actually close Woodcourt and keep a little more human because of the lack of this scene, but I really think Joe's death is one of the most influential points in the book and I missed it even though it always makes me cry. Have you ever seen theowinthrop series? How was it thought that Esther was raised by her aunt and uncle ?? Who is this uncle? I suppose someone could make a mistake in naming DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond, not really an English art resource (film or literature). <br /> <br /> I also think he is wrong about the law. Yes, the law is very poorly placed at Bleak House. It is a failure of the descendants of Jarndyce whose precious inheritance is eaten due to litigation costs, as it fails to kill Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all those who have confidence in the lawsuit. Miss Fleet failed. In a sense, it also fails Captain Haudon who pays for his death because of the monotony of the legal copier's work. Yes it feeds the Vholes and Tangle garbage. But this makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to transcend their status in life. Although he was not pleasant with the climbers of social status, it was clear that Dickens preferred that they were not required to fall in the station where they were born (in contrast to the atmosphere and families of the cricketers to climb poverty by Charlie Nickett). <br /> <br /> Also, the law, misused by Tulkinghorn and Chancery Eagles, is actually the source of security for Ada and Richard's court henna, and Esther who is simply Jarndyce's wing. Their security was guaranteed by the law that handed them over to Garendez. <br /> <br /> I can not see how anyone can have trouble tracking the story - remember that you are not supposed to realize that Ester is the daughter of Lady Didlock at first. Do not assume that you "get" all communications immediately. There is no instant gratification in the Dickens. <br /> <br /> As for "seeing clearly" through fog, Gillian Anderson got such a huge adjustment that I found it impossible to follow him and I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> Diana Rigg has found a very fantastic (do not overdo the writing and drama about Lady Dedlock is good, but if you think they are trying out Gillian Anderson version). <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick does not "Kate"! You get everything you need from the Rouncewell sub-schema.
