James J. Corbett, world heavyweight champion from 1892 to 1897, was Errol Flynn's favorite. Maybe because he did not have to use a sword or be in a western. He was tired of transgender people and said in his autobiography that he felt he was wrong in Westerners and could not understand why people liked him. It's a fun movie, but it hardly tells the true story of James Corbett. <br /> <br /> As if Corbett was the first boxer to win the heavyweight section, a man used brains and faster than brute force to win. John L. Sullivan lost to Bob Fitzsimons crown heavyweight. He was also a compulsive male minister and in that he was very much like the man he pictured. Of course it did not appear on the screen. The character played by Alexis Smith, the daughter of the banker in front of him, has no basis in reality. Corbett was actually married twice and was grossly unfaithful to each of his wife. <br /> <br /> Even after losing his title and after the events of this film, he has suffered a great personal tragedy. His father in a moment of depression, probably because of the financial resources because he lost a bet on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimons, and then shot his mother and turned the gun on himself. Murder / Suicide is hardly a square with a happy clan headed by Alan Hill. <br /> <br /> There's one thing I liked about Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond took on the role of his career in John L.'s play. Sullivan. Director Raul Walsh received a superb performance from Bond as a defeated but beloved Sullivan. Even if we take into account some of the bad points of Sullivan that do not hit the screen like rabid racism, Bond's portrayal is the idealism of John L. The best thing about Jim's gentleman. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one thing should have been said was the fact that Sullivan while the hero refused on race grounds to meet Peter Jackson who was black and from Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time. I say probably because when Corbett met his opponent and fought him for a 61 round draw. That battle more than any other country has created a demand for the title game Sullivan Corbett. Of course, when Corbett was a hero, he refused to give Jackson the title. Maybe he did not want another 61-minute marathon with someone who might have been better that very day. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim is not the story of Jim Corbett, it's a film by Errol Flynn playing James J Corbett. But Corbett was alive in 1942, no doubt he would have liked the film and loved filming his life. He would like to be remembered.
