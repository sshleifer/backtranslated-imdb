Having worked in midtown Manhattan and often ate my dinner during the summer days in the garden near the town hall, I saw the mayor come and go. It was great to be able to walk past the doors of the city hall and see how it was shaped in the lobby and through the entire building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", 03, performed brilliantly across the entire picture, especially when he gave a speech at an African-American church about a young boy killed. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Harbin Jury", 03, was a faithful servant of the mayor, and his servant in everything he tried to accomplish. Marybeth Cogan begins with love with Kevin Calhoun and gives her a very supportive role. Last but not least, Danny Aylo (Frank Anselmo), "Play Key", played 01, the role of mob leader who had some very difficult choices at the end of the picture! Fantastic movie with great photography and wonderful photography in New York City!
