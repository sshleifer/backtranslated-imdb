If the motion and adventure you want in a movie, it is best to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie that goes along with that mood, examine the "straight story." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth presents a remarkable performance as a noble gentleman Alvin, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his separated brother who had a stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role, where he travels a long winding road, making friends from strangers, and directing a lot of grandfather's advice about the family along the way. The story goes slowly like a riding mower, but somehow he can watch the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson to be presented by Alvin. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which is rated 7/10 in my book.
