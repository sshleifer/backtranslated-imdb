"An album of very old songs everyone thinks is new." This film contains a difficult mix of speed and mood that characterizes some of the films about the opening moments. why not? High-pitched talent of Mrs. Judith Dench as a widow playing saxophone with street musician to help him get the songs right, to Olympia Dukakis as a cheerful widow living in a Scottish castle at the expense of many of her marriages, to Ian Holm who loved all members of World War II All Girls (More or less) alternative band. But wait there more. Leslie Caron was added to the bus, and Clai Lin was unmatched in the vocals, and finally, Blonde Bombels is the hottest band in England since the Beatles. Well, well, not really, but this movie is the winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dinesch) spends the entire film trying to reunite the movie "Blonde Bomb" to play in her dance in her school granddaughter. Before you close your eyes, imagine how difficult and courageous a group of women in sex may face on the stage in front of a Britney Spears generation in the wake of a work called "Open Wound." <br /> <br /> Once the careers are over by the age of 30, the second album of most bands is a great collection of songs, and the music that is more than a month old has no chance of broadcasting. A really good movie, from nowhere else, comes from the BBC. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, and I know I will see it many times and enjoy it more every time.
