I saw this film in 1959 when I was 11 years old at a car driving theater with my family. <br /> <br /> At that time, I thought it was very fun. . . Although I was smaller than that I understand 90% making this movie such a delight! I saw him again this morning on Turner South. As I watched it, I was totally upset with laughter! "Mating Game" is a unique classic game of the past era. If you are too young to experience the fascinating period in history that produced this film, I am very sorry for you. There's no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) offer this wonderful slice of sky to "old timers" like me. <br /> <br /> Having said that, all I can do is respectfully ask that young people refrain from commenting on movies like "mating game." <br /> <br /> Movies like this have been produced for the generation that preceded the current group of people. As such, these films speak in a language quite different from what any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words? If you do not understand the issues the film addresses, please do not embarrass yourself by making comments that are ?? Honestly ?? illogical.
