I saw this series when I was a kid and loved the details I went to and I never forgot. I bought a DVD set and finally how I remembered. This is how Doku should be, unbiased and realistic. Incredible movie clips and wonderful interviews. The only other series I found equal to it is Die Deutschen Panzer. <br /> <br /> I just wish Hollywood would sit and watch this series, then they might make some great war movies. <br /> <br /> Note. Brothers, Save the Soldier Ryan, Messages from Io Jima, Flags of Our Fathers When the trumpets fade they are some I recommend
