I saw this movie in 1976, my first year in New York. I continued to live there for 26 years, but I did not see anything sensitive and beautiful again like this little TV movie. It was part of the PBS series as I remember, and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> There are no sexual scenes to speak of moments that are unusually touching, sensitive and moving, full of tension and excitement, all located in a conservative environment in Boston (I think) in World War I where women played the role of sincere wife waiting for the return Husband of war, did not seek a career and financial independence. Francis Lee McCain is wonderful as a career photographer and I spent the next thirty years looking for her in equally difficult roles to no avail. <br /> <br /> Is there a video for this movie? Surely you should have a DVD but surely at least a video?
