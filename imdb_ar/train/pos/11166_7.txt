George Raft As Steve Brody, the dancer, the dancer who can never resist any audacity, incites against Chuck Connors (emotional passion), the soft touch of each ejector, Connors adopts the theft of breeds and chains. "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with cats!) And displaced Lucy Calhoun, outside the city with innocent ambitions to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, communication is often done in the form of violence (one sees why it is Martin Scorsese's Boerie). Explosion cigars provide a runoff. In the Chinatown neighborhood, "stabbing" was a stone-thrower on one of the occasions when the fire was set on fire. (Simultaneous arrival of Brodie's and Beery volunteer firefighters leads to a brawl, in which the building burns). Beery accidentally overdoses a troublesome girl, and unites anyone who does not agree with him, including Brodie, who defeats him, in a night-fighting battle on a decked ship, to regain control of his salon, has bet that Prodi will not have the courage to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. (Prodi makes a leap, but only because of the failure of the puppet trick at the last minute.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with detail, explaining the flavor of daily life to the baby; singing in waiters, thugs and thugs, Being inside the black Maria, the collar tailors run hapless Hicks off the street and force them to buy suits they do not want. A simple but impressive small movie.
