This film is a simple simplistic work. Pleasing from start to finish, it is sad but at the same time rising. The presentations from Miranda Otto (Oh, how worth a lot of appreciation!) And George Del Hoya are pretty yet almost painful to watch, because the tortured souls understand each other. The staff at the Dead Letter Office are wonderful parts of them, as is the case with her long-suffering friend Alice, whom I could only feel very sorry for. There is one scene that I can see again and again (my son!). It is shameful that films like this do not get recognition, so they make them closer to the public eye for more people to enjoy. I cried, laughed and sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
