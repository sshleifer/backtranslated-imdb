This must be a unique development of two types. Giant Monster Movie Type with Mummy Movie Type Live. This unique combination makes a unique and attractive story. These templates are great, including BOSLEY TOM I never knew in a horror film before. The impressive effects and idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a wonderful idea. My only complaint is, I wish we had seen more giant mummies, but I think the others did a great job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The acting was wonderful. This should be the best film coming out of the science fiction channel. Hear me, the best movie coming out of the science fiction channel. I give the fall 9 out of 10.
