The Black Blackmailer, based on the short story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", is the first story along the story of Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Britt that I have seen. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a sad but somewhat sad feeling, but it is very fun (with some particularly funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * The spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are trying to reveal the identity of an imaginary person. The extortionist who destroyed some of England's most prominent families by publishing private messages that ruin their lives in one way or another. They finally discovered that Charles Augustus Milverton, "the art dealer", had few tragic consequences for the victims who could not afford to pay. Our heroes must help Ms. Eva Blackwell, who must pay more than she can or her next marriage will be canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson rattled Milferton's house is intense. Although the film has a basically happy ending, the melody is sad and sad. <br /> <br /> A wonderful performance by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick (as usual) and Robert Hardy as the infamous villain (most of the audience may recognize him today Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Eva Blackwell, Norma West. The role of Lady Sweenstead and Sophie Thompson in the role of Agatha (the scenes that she and Holmes shared were riots). Give it *** 1/2 of *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Inspector Lestrade. (I hope they have added to the scene at the end of the short story where he presents a description of the robbers, one of which corresponds to Watson.)
