"Pecker" is an unknown young photographer from Baltimore and becomes a big star in the public, the media and the local art scene where his filthy reality shows life all day just like dirty underwear or human feces. It is a typical theme for an independent comedy by Baltimore-based John Waters to show the bizarre aspects of the American way of life between correct political fashion and conservative reactions by exploring the background of the middle-class community in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong of Terminator 2, plays Becker, with the support of Christina Ricci, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary actress Patricia Hearst and long actress Manek Stoll. Although the speed of the plot becomes a big flaw at times and can not compete with the fast-paced, angry attacks of the wonderful "Serial Mom" ​​of Water, it still has some good laughs and some memorable scenes like a former drug addict Become a vegetarian by inhaling peas from a vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a wonderful comedy about the arrogance of the artistic scene, media tones, middle class sex concerns and exotic ways of becoming a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
