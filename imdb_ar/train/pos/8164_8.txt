This movie was very fun, although you will only like it if: - You hate to go to the dentist but you do not fear the film where someone goes by - you love horror movies <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the fact that it was Give some caution to explain the brutal actions of the main character. The fact that he is totally obsessed with cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then holds his wives and gives some oral pleasure to the man covered with mud is a very reasonable reason to go. <br /> <br /> He impressed him. Give it 8.
