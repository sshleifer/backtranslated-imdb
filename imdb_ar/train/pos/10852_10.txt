Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still mad. It was just another film I saw partly on TV. Then I had to get the video to finally see how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed the first signs of decomposition after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to put my hand on the soundtrack. Then on several film posters and movie text. At the moment, it's getting worse that I'm trying to get others to addicted to my website and the Still Crazy concerts. <br /> <br /> How can this happen? What prompted me to addicted? <br /> <br /> Well, it's one of those sad comics and the sad ones just like the British who can produce them. <br /> <br /> Well, the film in different worlds is different from things like 'This Is Spinal Tap', because of characters, which are not very childish or wonderful, but real. This is a story about men getting older, too. A story about getting men along with each other. Firstly. It contains some of the best possible actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rhea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Neal. And Bill Nighe. Bill Nighy presents one of the best shows I have ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is incredible. Foreign Books Mick Jones Songs of the Fantasy Band Strange Fruit. Jamie Nail, who plays guitarist Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, plays the selfish singer but singer Ray Simms really sings. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you only hear Bill Nigie's song "Love Actually", you'll have no idea how strong his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will withstand every scene to come for the tenth time, especially those musical scenes. I was dying to be able to stand really in the dance crowd when Strange Fruit performed "All Over the World", singing at the top of your lungs. You yearn to cry and celebrate with thousands of people rebirth of real exotic fruit at the Wisbech Festival stage. <br /> <br /> It's hard but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I am addicted to a strange fruit. If there is a world in which this band really exists, I would like to go there. <br /> <br /> I got still crazy ... anyone?
