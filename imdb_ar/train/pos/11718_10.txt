Those who like Elfra as she did late at night, will love the duties of the host in the film this film - it's absolutely wonderful - her car is wonderful, part of Transylvania Dolly Barton - she's innocent and sometimes naive - and exciting all the time - plus more than just A touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> These groups were well prepared, and comedies were wonderful, with Eddie McClureg at its best - as well as Sally Kellerman as Patty Ho Farhan. At any time I have to dig something great in it, I'll think about how Elvira breaks potato chips - this film will be seen again and again - just for fun. Now I have to get a sequel to it, the hills of Elvira the world, and see if they live up to this one ----
