I picked this up in the "Danger After Dark" box set, and only watched it because of my interest in Hyde and Gackt. I was expecting a tacky horror film that was a huge festival and a very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what would have happened had it been made in America. Instead, I found myself fascinated by the good development of the characters, and the way Sho (Gackt) develops through the film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were amazingly good, since they were not professional actors, and the director did a great job with all that, putting him in the future minus the flying cars and holograms. <br /> <br /> In a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film I have seen is Battle Royale, where he plays Shugu Kawada, and in this film it seems to be the opposite of Shoujo. Toshi is bright, full of vitality and hyperbole, and serves as a kind of comic satisfaction with his instincts. Shogo was the strong strong man on the island who was killed without thinking about anything. So, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised. <br /> <br /> But do not be surprised at the summary at the back of the box. , Because this is not really a vampire film. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. The character of Hyde is a vampire is almost the background fact with what actually happens in the foreground, players will love the last scene. It's a really impressive picture at some points. It is certainly something you should pick up next time you are in Blockbuster.
