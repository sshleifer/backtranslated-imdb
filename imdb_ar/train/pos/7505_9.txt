If there is one type I did not like, it is a CV. Bias are always misguided and full of misinformation and excessive scenes of scams and scams everywhere. Even in the hands of really talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (the pilot) and Ron Howard (Beautiful Mind), they often inflict great harm on people trying to capture them on screen. Doubts replace the hype with the majority of vital materials that make their way to the big screen and have not been a reputable home page is different. Some critics and film critics objected to Gretchen Mol because of the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer famous and did not have the pieces for the part. I never suspected that Mall had been able to deal with this part since then, but I never expected to understand its performance as I did when watching the movie hours ago. Mol offers Oscar-worthy performance as a special character in the 1950s, which after an early life of abuse (imagining accuracy and taste, something that a few directors might do) inadvertently become one of the most talked about models All the time. The picture covers a lot of land during its 90-minute run, but although there are at least three sub-charts, there is still a sense that there may be a small missing part of the story. Director / co-writer Mary Haroon and the wonderful text of Gwenivier Turner caught it just as abrupt and unclear as it should end. However, the two women should be credited with creating a virtually flawless biography that would enable them to pay homage to their subject matter and the contract they emulated brilliantly. Come to Oscar Time, Mall, Turner, and Aaron must receive nominations. No doubt this will happen, although there are certainly three women who deserve it. 9/10
