The Running Man is one of those films that, if watched, will become boring and even bleak. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of friends and some drinks. In today's climate of the control of the television media and the capitalist situation in society, it really works as a social commentary after the boom of the eighties. Forget this though! There are other wonderful and best reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger in his best form like The Richter's "The Butcher of the Bakersfield" and the inclusion of one Bond lines was quite inspired. The end is really brilliant (with Killian jamming on camera, main highlight). <br /> <br /> The design of the American trackers is genuine and reflects the features seen on the TV show "Gladiators" for PC and WWE as well. The dreadful ending of Buzz-saw will calm any viewer to the core (as a footnote, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what appears to be an optimistic actor with a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven the First Thursen They are awesome as a supporting muscle (and they are Arnes Buds in real life), and they even got Mick Fleetwood! What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend running if you're looking for a fantastic piece of action, complete with gloss and some great characters. Do not just expect to get education from it (at least in terms of surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really like it bloody. You will also do this only if you are a servant. 10/07
