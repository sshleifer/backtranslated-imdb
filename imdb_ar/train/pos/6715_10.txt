I loved watching "Sabrina, the teen witch" on Friday nights on ABC TGIF. I think this was one of the best deals on TGIF. My friends and I were meeting every Friday just to watch this show and we did not miss any episodes. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is Salem. It was fantastic and very funny. I loved Harvey, a friend of Sabrina. It was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a good teenager witch too. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Glass View" and "Hilda and Zelda: The Teenage Years". Those were fantastic episodes. <br /> <br /> In general, I really miss this offer. I hope ABC will someday bring them back with new episodes. I give this show a 10/10 stars.
