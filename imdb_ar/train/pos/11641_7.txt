I just caught an episode of Brad, a cocaine addict who turned into a drug addicted street after he started his cycling career in ruin as soon as. I must say that the story of his career in cycling was more exciting than the heart of his addiction to drugs. This is the young man who wins the left and right bike races. He is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks. Upon arrival, he humiliates Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes ever, who is generally harsh and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, soon asked to leave. Most of the show revolves around his struggle with addiction and how he regained his life, but what I wanted to know was the mistake he had in the first place to make his behavior such an ass? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was puzzled by how he put the show together, because Brad shows up at the peak of his addiction. See his footage of the pan and sleep in gutters, trenches and even smoking Crack cocaine. I did not know it was legal for the show, but why did the camera crew follow it and picture it? Do they do so in the hope that this person turns his life and gives him some material for a good television episode? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a enlightening program, because it shows the effects of various addiction and total control that they can control people's lives. Sometimes it is difficult to watch because you really see how much families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I must admit that in the end it seems very simple. There are times during which events occur where terrible things seem to be lost, but still, and perhaps you should beware of the spoilers here, everything has a lot of lasting happiness in the end, and I have a feeling that this is a very common occurrence in real life. But it's a show about people trying to help others, and you can never complain about something like that?
