This movie is awesome and I would recommend it to kids and adults alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; much better than anything American studios were producing at the time. However, there are some caveats to this statement. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli catalog and then moved to his butcher. My main point is that Disney renamed the movie, although the original English version was very impressive. New actors with Van Der Beek et al destroyed and removed many of the characters' attractions, for example Pazu and Sheeta moved from adventurous companions to young teenagers. The original music score is also much better than the Disney Remix. The question is why Disney made such changes? It seems to me that after Van Der Beek et al is selected, Disney can make more money, which is fair enough, but in the meantime they filmed them. It is still a beautiful film and I still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney ruined a movie from childhood that I loved and still love. I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese importer using the original English dubbing that I will protect now!
