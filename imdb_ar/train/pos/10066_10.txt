"King of Masks" (Lian's statement in China) is a beautiful and shocking film. Winning 16 awards from all over the world, based on a real story, is based on Wang Pianian, a street performer in China in the 1930s who is growing older but has no heir to transfer the art of facial expression. He has a unique talent in changing masks quickly in performance, and no one knows how to do it. He has a longing desire to have a grandson, because his art is a family heritage that can only be transferred to a male heir. Then we go to the streets and see that people sell their children because they can not afford to care for them; some even beg to take their daughters for free, because girls do not deserve much in this society. The story of Wang Bianlian continues from there. <br /> <br /> The film was surprisingly good, the acting was great, the issues were large and the handling was good. There is gender inequality and the sad truth that at this time and place, no one wants a little girl. It is interesting to note that the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the live Bodhisattva is a man dressed as a woman. While he is famous and highly respected, he considers himself a lowly thing and half women. As we go further in the film, we face the issues of the human slave trade and its demand and hence the lack of a possible solution to it, the brutality and corruption of the army and police, the helplessness and lack of power of any individual caused by unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen, and Xu Zou, the actor who plays Wang Panian, presents another beautiful show.
