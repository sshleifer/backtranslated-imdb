"The Sentinel" is one of the best horror movies that have already been produced in the film industry! I think it is very scary because very few movies actually. Allison Parker is a model with some fame. She meets a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and has her best friend, another model named Jennifer. Everything was wonderful in her life, so she decided to live alone for a while and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is her neighbors, and they are very strange. Allison suddenly began to suffer from health problems and fear of repetition; she also remembers some painful facts about her past that make her suffer from nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and it's about the new house you live in. <br /> <br /> Personally, I find The Sentinel a very creepy film, and with The Exorcist it's one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen. When we discover that Allison's house is occupied only by the priest and freezes my blood! It is also horrific to see that they need to become blind at the end of the film until they are the new guard to keep the monsters away from our world.
