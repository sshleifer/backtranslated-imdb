If this film proves just one thing, it is that Keaton has been and will always be a comedy in the heart, even when you avoid bullets, go to the electric chair and reach the wrong end of the information line in prison. <br /> <br /> But Johnny Gravity continues to prove more. In the 1980s, the children of ZAZ (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the world's sexiest parody. But there were several vows on the throne. This time, Heckerling's "Fast Times at Ridgement High" tries to reach out, with an amazing amount of TV book behind the script (go and check). <br /> <br /> This is a cynical parody of the hilarious piracy and "hoop" in 1930 that evokes almost every film of clich√©s of a ring and adds some cliches that do not yet exist. <br /> <br /> Not always Keaton is at hand like Johnny's title, but also funny players and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and almost every other Hollywood actor Happened to walk in the immediate vicinity. You'll be amazed at the number of faces you'll recognize. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The jokes? Well, when they start, they come to you quickly and furiously, like a machine gun. There are a lot of things that can be relied upon at the beginning, and they are produced by a crazy song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to watch when reloading. They have to reload a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everyone tries, they seem to enjoy and I have been laughing a lot of time. In the end, though, there was plenty of time to think about how some of the scenes could be more entertaining - and not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night when there is nothing good on the TV, listen to Johnny and be prepared for some serious "serious" laugh. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerous" ... do not be "bastidge".
