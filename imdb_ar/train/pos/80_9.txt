I really enjoyed the reunion too much! I would classify him as 10 if they got "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was no mention of where they were today or why they did not participate in the reunion. They were very famous personalities and I think it was wrong not to provide an explanation of their non-appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was happy because TNN was running the serial again! I've been looking for episodes for years and it's a pleasure to be able to record a whole series (maybe I missed some episodes). Jenny Hannahan
