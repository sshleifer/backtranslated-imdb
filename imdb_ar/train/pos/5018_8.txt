If you are like me, you will love this wonderful movie of a teenager. I think it is up to the harm / Love Book / High School USA / Scream / Girl Calendar / crybaby / All the great movies that were shown in the '50s & early' 60s and have a great soundtrack. There are not as many songs as in some of these kind of movies but still wonderful. It is very funny sometimes and has a great love interest. All the young actors are wonderful. I wish there were more kinds of these wonderful movies. My favorite film of all time is back in the future when Marty McFly came back to 1955 well in these great films that were left in the 1950s (the early 1960s) and there are some films of this genre better than this but not many.
