When I first saw her, I was very impressed. The director made this ambiguous atmosphere, especially in the end. Through the whole story, spectators expect that Richard will actually kill Thomas or that he will do so first. But the main point was not a conflict but ... friendship! Life is amazing. Every time I watch it I enjoy it! Of course, it's as violent as any action film but I think it's acceptable. Thank you very much Luis Leosa and Tom Bringer! Wonderful movie! I would recommend everyone to see it. I'm sure people will not regret it and will spend a good time.
