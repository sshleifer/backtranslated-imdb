This film is as unique as it is ignored ... A completely different story, it shows the need to survive or preserve it, and one can find the ability to love if you have an open heart and an open mind. I first saw this on the cable in the late 1970s and really portrayed the limitations of the gay community at the time. I think this film was before his time filming a small slice of a mysterious way of life. It is truly a classic meaning that it was the prelude to what is now portrayed as the extended family. This movie should be available on DVD / VHS so that the extra performance of Meg Foster & Perry King can not only be recognized, but to show how far we have come and still need to go where relationships are concerned.
