Among the first five episodes of Hammer's short-lived Hammer House of Horror series, the fifth episode titled "The House that Bled to Death" is the most horrific. As a great fan of Hamic Studios' Gothic Horror movies for many years, I wonder what took me a long time to finally start watching the series recently. So far, I've only seen the first five episodes, and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the entertaining remains entertaining as in the first five episodes, I will be satisfied. While the second and third episodes were fascinating to watch their obsessed and dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is definitely one of the first five that provides the most authentic horror. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his wife with unknown motives. Years later, William (Nicholas Paul) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davis) moved to the house with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). But soon after moving home, the family has to discover that there is a serious mistake in the house, which seems to be haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Meghahi is much better than his previous average entry, "Growing Pains" (Episode 4 ), And somewhat unknown actors performing well. The film is well made in terms of effects, cinematography and result. "House to Bled to Death" is a solid episode that presents elements that my fellow Hammers would like to see in a short horror story. The film offers a creepy atmosphere, moments of real intimidation and subtle change, and is very impressive and enjoyable from start to finish. Overall, this is highly recommended for hammer lovers.
