DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michelle Serail, a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals patients in occupied France, even if they can not compensate. However, it preyed on the weakest among the masses. Images and cinematography are wonderful, and add to this extraordinarily painful story. It is mentally dysfunctional. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and killing. A certain film can not be forgotten by the viewer. Glory to Mr. Serrault, to portray it chilling.
