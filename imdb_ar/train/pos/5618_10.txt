This is one creepy movie. More creepy than anything David Lynch, this shows what the great director Polansky because this is not his usual kind of work, which is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Everything begins with Trelkovski moving to the block of residence in Paris. He soon learned that the former tenant, a young woman, had committed suicide and believed that the rest of the people living there had driven her. They also believe they are trying to do the same for him. What results is an amazing and frightening look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> The entire production contains a classic horror written in all of this: from pictures to music the viewer can feel Tralkovsky's horror increase. <br /> <br /> Are they all to kill him? Or maybe just drive him crazy? There is a difference? Find out for yourself. 10/10
