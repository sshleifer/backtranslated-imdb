I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I must admit that the tension in this film has never been seen in most other FN era films. I loved how one chip would be quiet and then violence the next. It was classic. Ah yes ladies, bad guys, cigars and thugs thugs! She has it all. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I particularly liked the way communism was mixed up in the conspiracy, very common in this age of cinema. Also very bold since blacklisting was popular in those days. I appreciate this movie as one of the best films I have seen in this genre of movies!
