What's the reason? Is there a kind of revenge against this amazing show or someone involved? Why is the best offer I've seen in years? I am addicted. I saw this show randomly last fall, I loved it right away and watched it every week. Then I went away and tried Tivo, but it was not broadcast. I forgot it for a while, so I found the episodes on ABC. Now I want more. I agree with everyone - with the rest of the spam on TV today, it was refreshing to see something that is being well developed and developed as such. I watch Boston Legal for eccentric repair, and House to fix the opacity of my mind. My wife Grazy loves Anatomy because of "realism" and I love / hate the show, but can not be further from reality to me. Way too much drama. Everything that can happen is wrong, it does. But for once, there is a really real drama. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes such as the transformation of former gangs into a good state, a girl working from mobs, etc., but these people (especially in New York City) are already there, and I call every one of them. I can not get enough. I just hope ABC will come out of their heads with the butts counting the beans and continue this show. Get some respect for having a quality drama there. This can be one of the best performances of all time. If someone will let it.
