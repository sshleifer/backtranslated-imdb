In this truly stunning dark film, a poor young student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money. In contrast, the devil takes his mirror image (brilliantly done in the film and spooked when the Baldwin student early dances in front of the mirror) About "a man at war with himself" who is conveying his near future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves can not be achieved (he has made an agreement with the devil, he is forever isolated from love and other spiritual fortunes) you can love him or you can replace your soul for money, you can not get both. Some of the scenes are unbelievable, and the feeling of destruction when the devil disappears with the image of the Balduin mirror is amazing, as is the sense that his charter has been cut off forever from human society (the scene in which he escapes.) Balduin is haunted by his wife From his multiplication and ending up in the "barren land" on the edge of the city, is no longer completely human (he lost his soul) It is like an animal that catches out of human society There are many other things that can be said about this amazing film: Paul Figner was a great actor and director, He is my cultural hero and will help if you know a bit p Just remember, it's a very early film, it's a bit clumsy at times, but considering what you have to say it is a tragic ending, it is a very early film. One of the best movies ever (yes, it is!)
