First, I'm not Justin Timberlake's obsessed lovers by making him look good, in fact I'm not a huge Justin fan, but I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm working in a video store and when I saw this movie with a huge cast I did not even hear of having to see what it was. I did not find that Justin was acting so badly. It was clearly the worst of the group, but it was a very impressive group, with Carrie Elwes and Diane McDermott both names not even put on the first credit list. The story is basic, a journalist reveals corrupt police, but I found it so well. L L Cool J was clearly in conflict, but frankly I did not know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman As always, he is a wise character who does well, and as much as Kevin Spacey liked, there was something. The personality of the HIs did not have much substance, but Kevin Spacey, could not do any wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott made the best performance as a kill cop. It is really reasonable and truly personal, it has exhausted me many times. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a lot of cheese to be honest. Terrible phrases, unwarranted sequences of action and things like that, but they were surprisingly good and I could not find anything like that. Every shooting point, not a clich√©head, was really very strong. <br /> <br /> In general, the amazing, nice story that kept me interested and practical enough to force me to jump. I do not know why they did not show up in the theaters, I've had better than some litter that I've seen on the big screen. I would say it is worth watching.
