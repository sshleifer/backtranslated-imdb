Carmen is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's hard to say that the best performance is: Antonio Gaddis, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are fantastic. It is a beautiful story of no separation between life and myth. Myth penetrates everyday life. Dance becomes life and the whole life is danced. Real people live at the same time as their own lives and become someone else, acting in parts of the elderly lovers. Magic is constant.
