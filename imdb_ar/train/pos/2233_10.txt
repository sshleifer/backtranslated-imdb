I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s, and now in 2006, this movie is still one of the best movies I have ever seen! I would recommend anyone to consider this film. You will not be sorry. I've been doing very well, and it has never been a dull moment. The acting is great and the location makes the movie look like you are there. From start to finish, this movie is the kind that makes you lose your attention. The actress is doing an excellent job of photographing the girl who survived this horrific crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to stay in the Amazon alone. It is unreasonable for anyone to survive under these conditions. That is why this film is very attractive. The fact that this real story makes the film more interesting, and the belief that a little girl can survive this ordeal is overwhelming. I find this film one I can see over and over and a film I never got tired of. This is actually a compliment because I have hundreds of movies! I would say that this is probably my favorite film and the best I've ever seen!
