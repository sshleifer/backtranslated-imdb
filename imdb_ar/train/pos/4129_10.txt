It is an American cooking competition. The Japanese version will not be. <br /> <br /> The presentation is great. I did not care much about cooking, but this show is just amusing to watch ... of the intensity that the chef put in the dishes to the head of the idiot. Really a good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show to attend guests like Mark Eko as a judge ... but ... mh. It's entertaining enough to watch and generally deserves a prize winner. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah I'm bitterness, John Pich is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Alaa's Kitchen!
