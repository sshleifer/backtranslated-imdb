More TV movies should be made like this one. I saw it in 1993 when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Stephen Weber were fantastic, making very brave and realistic presentations. Weber was particularly good, as he performed exceptionally creepy and sluggish as a child killer / killer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was quite opposite and somewhat exciting. But the direction in both these works has the same glamorous and simple realism. If you like television movies that are unpredictable and over-filled, check them out if possible. The side-story about Hunt's relationship with Fahmy is also attractive without detracting from the main story.
