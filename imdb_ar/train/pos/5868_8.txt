I love this rare film to get a glimpse of postnatal Vietnam, and have done so cinematic combat scenes, stun grenades and shooting. I had no idea I would be affected by it. What a spectacular look at how alien vets feel. It was hard to see, quite frankly. We all understand fighting and type the Apocalypse now of drama, but this is very different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can not. This has made me aware of a large group of men around them in America. Unable to link, can not sleep, can not have a love relationship, can not cope with the "natural community." They feel completely separate. This is a huge tragedy, an insufficient tragedy. Yes, we have changed our position from Vietnam veterinarians, we love them now, but what about it? They did not seem to make any difference to them. it's too late? It was a great film, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticisms.
