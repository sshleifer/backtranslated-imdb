If he ever asks me to remember a song from a movie years ago, it must be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning, the way in which Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd sang it. Ravi, the lyrics of how Bhopalie, not to mention cinematography when the sailboat comes out in front of the black background and bright stars must be the other "Chalte Chalte". She was the last film by Minna Kumari before her death, and the amount of time she spent on the screen can be seen. In both songs, the young look but then did not appear. But one of the actors who did not change in appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her feet especially, after he accidentally went into the train compartment and when they saw him, he left a note describing how beautiful she was. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story, if possible it should be seen on the big screen just for photography and movie songs. The film stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar, Ashok Kumar and directed by Kamal Amrouhi. <br /> <br /> The grandson of Kamal Amrouhi is now reviving his father's studio by producing a comedy film.
