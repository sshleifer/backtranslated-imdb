Quite a little intimate film and not just for kids. John's melting is as wonderful as always (without any hint from the inspector Morse about it). The boy playing William did a good job, although I did not find him convincing in every scene. I loved the full sense of the small village and the slow pace of life in those times. I also felt the sights in London where it was historically accurate, as far as I can tell you. <br /> <br /> He reminded me of the Scandinavian film I saw two years ago called "The Mother of Mine". The film was distinguished by a boy who was evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The wife of the family asked him to take him a girl because she (as it turns out) lost her daughter. Getting a boy instead completely ignores him. The fact that the Finnish speaking boy complicates things even more. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Good Tomight. Here, he has the same feeling towards him.
