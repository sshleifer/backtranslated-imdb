This film came and went in the theaters. Given the nature of this, you can see why it is not well received. It was moved unfairly because of its theme more than the actual film itself. Higher education is not amazing, but it was a good film tried to talk about the subject of fear in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Plot / Story: Higher education is mostly centered around Malik (played by Omar Ebs), a naive star who must deal with not fasting well enough, and a stern professor (played by Lawrence Fishburne). He endorses Fudge (Ice Cube) as well as a wonderful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later they eventually had to deal with some skinheads on the campus. Remy (a play by Michael Rapaport) is a confused child and ends up making friends with some local heads on campus. Once they impose their opinions on him, he becomes racist as he is. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Higher education is not without its drawbacks: poor personal development, good performance by Omar Ebs and Terra Banks and the leader of skinheads (whose name has been forgotten), Busta Rhymes does not fit this movie at all. In addition, women who became gay after being abused by men were "clich√©" before this film, so you know I did not like this part of the film with Christie Swanson. Otherwise, this was not a bad film. Lawrence Fishburne was as good as Professor Phipps (although I can do without him), Fudge was the best performer for Ice Cube and Michael Rappaport was as good as the rickety Remy. In general, it was one of John Singleton's best films, which is one of the reasons that led me to the trash he puts now. Cinema needs more movies such as higher education, Mississippi Burning, American History X and less movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and a new edition of Shaft that is useless.
