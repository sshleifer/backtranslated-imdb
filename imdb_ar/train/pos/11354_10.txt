CitizenX (1995) is the response of the developing world to the silence of lambs. Where "silence" terrified peace of mind, "citizen" tired us and saddened instead. This dramatic representation of the Chicatello affair translates well, thanks to the Western friendship between two policemen in Rostov who have become equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX may also argue against (!) the death penalty is much better than the life of Kevin Spacey. The Life of David Gale (2002). <br /> <br /> Humans are Machiavellian mammals, under their motor brains (the lizard logic). Why did two children, who knew better, die of a small child who kidnapped him? Why do bloodthirsty women cry "li-lilililililii" in acts of terrorism OBSCENE? - The special term for this is "party domination", we urge the orchid logic to control the "enemy". If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in vocabulary, you are easily able to "party domination". <br /> <br /> In Rostov, devastated by World War II in the 1980s (located at the mouth of the Don River near the Black Sea), nothing has suppressed Andrei Chicatello's desire for "sad domination" to overcome the strata of civilization. The victims of the poor Checatello (Jeffrey Dimon) were poor, usually children, riding the suburban train for fun, because they could not afford anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the exorbitant Soviet exile cost the bureaucracy the lives of 52 of these "lambs". The serial killer in Rostov was free for about 7 years after police arrested him and allowed him to leave. <br /> <br /> politicizing the fight against crime is harmful to police forces everywhere. Although police work routinely suffers from corruption around the world, grabbing politicians in the West can create chronic inter-agency rivalries, hampering a more coordinated response to the crime. In the Soviet Union of citizens, the murderer Victor Burakov (Stephen Ria) suffered from a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Dimon plays Chikatilo's role psychologically enough with a power-free error - the full mystery point. In real life too, Chicatello had a lifetime experience in mixing and infiltrating. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, chasing his pursuer as a strange bird, is given to non-dominant seminars. Perhaps through the design, Stephen Ria performs a strange performance as the head of the Forensic Medicine of Brakov. Russian RIA tone is impenetrable. The incompetent and irrational Bukakov is against everyone. <br /> <br /> So it is Donald Sutherland who walks in the picture. Kulster Vetisov, of Sutherland, the head of the Burakov, and his only supporter at first, is a militarily bound militarist, carrying his gracious campaign testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His waking up as a policeman is driven by logic, but still emotionally, idealism becomes the cornerstone of the film. <br /> <br /> Jos Ackeland plays another role as a ferocious writer, communist communist minister Bondarchuk, who oversees the investigation. Of course, the most common suspect, a communist, was arrested in 1984, a man carrying a rope and knife in his bag, supposedly going home: Andr√© Chicatello. <br /> <br /> Soon, Borakov was replaced by another investigator in Moscow, Investigator Gorbonov (John Wood), insisting that the investigation now focuses on "well-known homosexuals." The sadest scene of this sad sad film comes during the institutional harassment of Bundarchuk and Gorbunov: a stupid policeman was told earnestly, "As I thought, Comrade, it is my weight." I made some drawings - a cue with a loud laugh. <br /> <br /> 5 years after The bodies began to accumulate, in 1987, the police finally tried to seek criminal features, and the only Soviet collaborator was Dr. Alexander Bukhanovsky (Max von Sido), who was later called "the citizen." You are making a great person. "We agree. <br /> <br /> The long speed, which has spread over a decade , Fully embodying the institutional stalemate of Glasnost - "openness" - were not ... The contradiction with Perestroika - "Restructuring" - could not be greater for this issue.Although Chicatello was still touring the railway stations, the police plans were Is about to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> Colonel Vitisov was quickly promoted to the General, and his rival Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene, allowing the investigation to proceed without political interference. All were available. In just one night of the phone call, Vetisov managed to reach his depressed forensic chief at the FBI's serial killing squad in Quantico, where Vitisov discovered that staff regularly took care of serial killings to avoid such psychological damage. Her investigators. /> <br /> Vetisov, a newly promoted forensic chief, now Col. Borakov, advises all these changes in an avalanche of recognition, which has become a powerful dividing point for the film. Fetisov's is the most apologetic of the tenderness I have ever seen in the film: "In particular, I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife." I hope you will forgive me one day for my ignorance, "he whispers. <br /> <br /> From HBO, CitizenX is a top-notch movie. The outward appearance is not only of an inherently dark appearance (exclusively filmed in the most dilapidated parts of Budapest, otherwise), but Randy Edelman's mounting soundtrack is overwhelming - and our only respite is often the darkest brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will know many Hungarian dialects and credits. <br /> <br /> The actual murders of Chicatello are described as a dark and evil behavior resulting from flaws in personality and ignorance in an equally gloomy world. This makes the killings not quite out of place - but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, "We all cherish the future of our children." <br /> <br /> CitizenX continues to exist, although murder is more horrific and brutal than any retaliation might suggest. Raping rapists for control; killing serial killers for control. So do some soldiers. Such "sad domination" makes people poor. <br /> <br /> Warning - spoiler: ----------------------------- --------- --------- Andre Cecatello was the most deadly serial killer in the world. He was convicted, executed in 1992 along the lines of all death sentences issued by the Soviet Union: one shot, in the back of the head. It is stupid that these methods destroy any possibility of studying the deviant brain after death. <br /> <br /> Summary: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best results are always preventing murder, not prosecuting them. The executions only ensure that society fails to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we send even unconfirmed evidence of how they died. The killers do not learn to regret if they have died. <br /> <br /> Revenge does not hide the victims. The challenge to the murderer's blood is no better than counter-domination - as soon as it is too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge on behalf of grief is not fair to the deceased - it is appeasement of the living.
