This film could be one of the most bland films in Bollywood history. This popular film in 1994 was all good performances, music and direction. I remember being in Allahabad when this movie was working and was somewhere in March at the time of Holly, there were people playing their song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers with the loudest voice. If someone sees Some Like It Hot and drools on Marilyn Monroe, he should watch this movie. Thumbs Up to Govinda. How many of you know that this film was filmed in South India and after Sholay could be one of the very few blockbuter films to hit the silver screen. With movies like this Indian comedy can not be dead.
