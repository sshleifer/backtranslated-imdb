Surreal Sooner was released shortly after the "real" classics of the Maltese falcon, The Double Post, and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wales films should not be evaluated against others. He was playing with different rules. In fact, he was playing. This starts when the other fatale films stop the female, so that the mysterious (but interesting) whodunit is decorated with a view of the Wellesian scenes (the typical rapid fire style), dialogue (much of the "hard boiled" philosophy) Deliberately one-dimensional). To Welles, the "genre" might mean "formula" but he seemed to like using "secrets" as the "entertainment" background.
