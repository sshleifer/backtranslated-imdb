I'm a bit confused about this. The presentation is fantastic on the one hand, the representation is terrible (even when we get real actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Mosley in one episode), the moral dialogue and the premise / moral for each episode feels like they have been extracted from the short 50s educational. There is no way to fear any moment of any of these episodes, and Robert Robert Englund is short, pointless and smelling in a kind of Bob Sagitt on a fun way of American home video. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the funniest things on TV. In the 1980s, Focus makes actors look like The View group at all times, and buildings give more material to self-parody rather than fear, so we leave with a loop where a high school kid fears if he fails to give up (His husband plays Brad Pitt), the other fears that all parents in the world will league against him when he runs away from home, and another fear that she will be confused with The twins are socially retarded, and another is afraid if their mother and father do not break up Step he will get killed because of a party at his home. The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Since these are dreams, I suppose you can go beyond ridiculous plot points and devices, but they are out of the left so there is no chance for the book to really intimidate the public. You have characters dressed like some of the nightmare of the 1980s wandering around making a bad dialogue in a highly volatile fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose than to move the story to the next strange plot point (usually seen as a marginal character) Our main character stares with shock and shock so do not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something that scares you to get away. If you're looking, on the other hand, for one of the nicest things that will come out of the eighties at all. Watch it. <br /> <br /> He was shown on Chiller TV recently (almost every day) and I was watching him early out of obsessed curiosity, and now just so I could laugh well every day. With Arrested Development and Extras away from the air, this is the most entertaining thing on TV now.
