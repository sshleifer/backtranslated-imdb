Contrary to many other films, which are irritated by either their manic Bites Dog or their massive violence (most of the Peckinpah films), it shocks the delivery because of its credibility. Sure, the prospect is very clear and direct in his dislike, but the film's effect is much more derived from its slow accumulation and a tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four heads, before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when boats pass under the child on the bridge, which does not even recognize the men who have played music with him, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is one of the most evil events in the modern film. The tension grows steadily during the boat trip, and continues even after the final appropriations - making the end of the plight of the characters truly horrifying. The credibility of the film is greatly enhanced by role-playing, especially Ned Betty and John Voight as the victim and alternating hero respectively. Bert Reynolds, too, has never been better. The cultural impact of the film is evident in the number of people who will understand the reference to the "Banjo lands" - perhaps Get Carter is the only one who has done such an effective job in the tourism industry in the region. I can only think of a few of the films that put me into such a severe depression after the end - Se7en's repressive atmosphere is the best I can think of. Although many are excellent in themselves, delivery is classic above all because there are not enough points to compare it - it's unique.
