The GOODNIGHT MR TOM plot on paper makes us seem to be in a great dose of intense emotional emotion. But the talented director Jack Gold is an expert in touching feelings in the right way, and instead shows up as a compelling force, a dramatic drama in wartime with excellent production and outstanding performance. One of the best, if not the best television movies in the nineties that would have been more successful had it been released in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Evacuation of children to rural towns and villages in World War II was of course a common practice, but in the case of the little boy here it was doubly important because of the miserable home life in the UK capital. The horrors of the war on the home front did not drift though, and even building the film ends the throat, its foggy end leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what happened before. It is almost (but not quite) worth comparing with the finale of a wonderful life (1946) all that, modern classics.
