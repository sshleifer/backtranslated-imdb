I never heard of this film until I happened to come across it by accident when IMDB reviewed it. I've seen that it has got many awful reviews that contain very colorful curses on how much stunk it is. Of course that means I have to see him. I was pleasantly surprised because Whipped is actually a good movie. I saw it with a group of friends and laughed more than we did in many of Hollywood's most popular comedy films. This is an independent film and this picture depicts his subject (sex and acquaintance) without the usual Hollywood fakes. I think clearly that the opinion of the people in this film depends to a large extent on their experience in life. If you do not have a lot of history or participation, you will not get this movie because you will not meet people like these characters. If you have, you will recognize many of the situations portrayed here in a comic way. The end was also good, because they did not portray women as non-reality romances, miracles and reels unlike many Hollywood films.
