I saw this at the Mel Valley Film Festival. It's hard to believe that this is Mrs. Blom's first appearance at the directing, he is walking at a nice pace and performing. A large collection of characters from Anne Tyler's novel, that is, full of background stories and potential futures, can not be misinterpreted, and sudden bursts of humor amidst self-generated anxiety and very real, if not shattered, dilemmas. If you see "the best of young people," you will recognize the extent to which characters are embodied in small moments, even when the story moves quickly. I really hope this distribution gets in the USA. I live in a fairly sophisticated film market, yet we rarely get Swedish films of any kind.
