I just wish that the return of Jedi, by someone else, I mean, there are a lot of EOK scenes, is absolutely unnecessary. Besides this time, our heroes seem to be different people: Princess Lea no longer fights with Sulu, Luke looks boring, and Darth Vader is no longer as evil as before, and Yoda dies only. <br /> <br /> But there are so many special things happening in this episode that I can not hate. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers 1 - Cottage meal 2 - Barge attack sequence. 3 - The emperor (now is evil) 4 - chasing speeders in the forest endor. 5. The last battle. 6 - Scene seduction dark side. 7. Back to the good side of power. 8. The last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes are cut off and another output is set, this will be as perfect as Episode 4 and 5, but it is still unusual. 9 out of 10.
