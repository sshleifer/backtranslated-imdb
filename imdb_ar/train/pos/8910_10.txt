Most of the atomic age monsters that I saw on television as a child, some of them, including BLOB, faint of daylight. Films such as INVADERS from MARS have shown us all "little fry" that children could not be trusted when it came to things like Homeworld invading things; repeat and repeat this fact. I remember, fondly, that late evenings I spent on the ground and waited while sneaking into captives, marauders, invaders and Blobs into an unquestionable society. There was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) staged a classic show of the atomic age at the end of each week. These were 16mm films, mostly black and white (the projector was loud), and the "colored" printing of the BLOB faded with a pale pink color, but the man was fun. My mother was with her, and I enjoyed her as much as I enjoyed her. I've been there, in this science museum, I've already fallen in love with the BLOB game. The director's intention was, of course, to make money, but it was all the actors involved, from directors to "talent," that made me fall in love with this film. corny? She defies. cheesy? They do not get any cheesier. But man, what a movie!
