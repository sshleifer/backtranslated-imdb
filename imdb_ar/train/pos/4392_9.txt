I enjoyed this movie a lot. Tobey Maguire offers great performance, like Jake. He must be one of the best actors I have ever seen. I was surprised by the many lines of humor throughout the film. I have been very good at this too although I have never seen him make a phonetic line before. The film makes you engaged in characters and makes you really wonder what will become of them all. I did not know what to expect from the jewel's performance, but I think it was fine. Lots of exciting scenes. A perfectly good trip. I am a fan of Maguire. Check out the rules of apple cider house. One of the best time ever.
