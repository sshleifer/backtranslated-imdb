"Pet Sematary" succeed in two major cases. First, it's a scary horror film. Those that do not just produce these days. Second, it is a generally intelligent emotional film. So, if you're looking for chills, fears, crawling, visually stunning settings, great representation, calls, and horrific effects; this is the movie you're looking for. Classic now and really must see for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, better adapted to any of King's novels. The events are a little rushed in comparison to the novel, but this does not mean that this scorned film is not a complete achievement of horror / drama. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely known for being extremely emotional and hideous at the same time. The film captures the same feeling mainly because there is a great development of personality and you can feel the loving relationship between its members. Then, when everything seems to be happy (technically happy, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not offer you comfort)! A tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, and now it becomes dark. The film has a wicked feeling since the credits opened, but after Gage's death the film becomes sad, gray and creepy. Dealing with the loss of a baby is something that can ruin the entire family life, and "Pet Sematary" proves dramatically. <br /> <br /> The myth behind half a pet is more than a myth nobody wants to try, but sadness and despair lead an emotionally destructive father to give a chance. Unfortunately, the real legend comes back and little Gage returns from the dead. It turned out that the previous encounter with the tragic pet myth was a tragedy but this time something much worse. What will happen with the life of our American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What are surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Watch "Pet Sematary" to watch one of the most emotional and emotional horror films of late. You will not regret. The acting is very good although I did not dig the actor who filmed the father. He did not seem upset enough when the positions demanded despair. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby performed superbly and worked perfectly as a noble and generous mother. Baby Gage was amazing even on its scary parts. * Chilling *. In general, this is a wonderful classic of all time and a disturbing film that touches the deepest fears of people ... and the loss of someone you love and return to life and despair. <br /> <br /> There's definitely something ... I do not want to bury, in half a pet pet!
