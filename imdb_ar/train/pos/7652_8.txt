Representation - wonderful. The story is amazing. The script is awesome. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and mostly talking, but the whole story about their lives and how they are listed with past memories thrown at home and abroad make you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this painful and tragic story. I personally read the book on which the film is based and have shown me more light in this story and answer some questions left unanswered in the film. I will also read the song Exectioner, which represents the other half of Gilmore's story. This film made me think a lot about the phrase "looking at the other side of the glass". You hear a song in the movie Gary Gilmore's Eyes, a punk band that wrote a song about what it would be like to be my eyes Gary Gilmore (one of the things Gary gave as a transplant at his death) and you listen to it, You look at the entire situation in a slightly different way if you are just going to do the same song here. This film opened my eyes this way and in many others. I recommend this film (and the book) very much.
