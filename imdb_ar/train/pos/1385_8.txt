I saw him at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after his first public show in Paris. A very beautiful film about three teenagers aged 15 years, all in the same psychological stages. Many scenes allow us to return to adolescence and our first feelings about sexual relations. It is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong feelings of girls about lesbianism, but even in this case does not spoil the probability of the story. You can find the film slow at times but this is what creates this intimate atmosphere. I fund the young actress of talent, with a special reference to Florian and Mary, very convincing. There are many small details, but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming: impressive!
