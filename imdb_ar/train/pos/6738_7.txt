Sidewalk Ends is a drama with the crime of a good film Nuer and well shot in black and white on the site as well. <br /> <br /> The copper accidentally kills a suspected murderer and protects himself covering it and blaming him for someone who does not like a lot of crimes in the past. But in the end, he owns himself but not before he falls in love with a woman she meets and is the lover of the person who was killed ... <br /> <br /> Actor Dana Andrews (as the city sleeps, Satan's curse), Jane Turney (Laura, The Gustav and Moyer), Gary Merrill (the mysterious island), Karl Malden (the streets of San Francisco, behind the Poseidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Death Mantis). Good parts of everyone. <br /> <br /> Where the pavement ends deserve verification if you have the opportunity. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
