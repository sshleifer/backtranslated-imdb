In "Street Scare", Richard Widmark plays the role of a US marine doctor who brazenly interrupted his week with a corpse containing a plague. Police officer Paul Douglas correctly points out that the man died of two bullets in the chest. This is not the problem here. The two have become unwilling partners in an attempt to find the killers and anyone else who has the disease. <br /> <br /> As any number of people pointed out, for some reason a manager did not cost Elijah Kazan to throw the small parts with anyone who looked like Louisiana. After I went to New Orleans where the story takes place, I can testify personally. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bill Gedis can excuse him because he can be appointed as a marine doctor, but for those who are indigenous, he does not work. <br /> <br /> But with the plague there and the news being covert, New Orleans PD begins a network of the underworld in the city. The dead man came from a ship from Europe and had contacts with the other world. A wise man from New Orleans played by Jack Palance jumps into a whole set of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing the cousin of the dead man who is beginning to show signs of plague. Palance got funny ratings in the first film where he received a notification. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite film is Zero Mostel. This happened immediately before Mostel was listed on the blacklist, and at the time he had made a specialty in playing would be young kids who are really kids. He plays the same role in the film Humphrey Bogart, the performer. Unfortunately, I can deal with Mostel in the latest chase scene, where he is chased by Widmark, Douglas and half the New Orleans police. Seeing the weight of the Zero Challenge in an attempt to keep pace with Palance was another thing because I was kind of a Zero League now in the heavy section. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the events in a good section, there is very little time down in this movie. If there is any less Indiana Jones movie will be. Panic In The Streets won the Oscar for best original script that year. <br /> <br /> Kazan also benefited from the New Orleans Waterfront and the French Quarter. Some of the same shots are used later on On the Waterfront. In fact, street panic revolves around not crushing people when they should actually achieve their own interest. Very similar back to On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Panic in the streets is proud to be associated with it. Now why Elijah Kazan could not get new sounds from New Orleans in small roles.
