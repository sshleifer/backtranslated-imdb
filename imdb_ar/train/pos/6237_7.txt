My friend, from the description of the box, I thought it would be crazy like "two days in the valley" or "Hugo Paul". Ulrich Siedl has to be a very strong man. Most, after directing this, could have been expelled from the cliff or at least committed a mass murder. I only admit to seeing the first half hour (now). Read all the comments here, I have a lot to look forward to. Professional reviews often mention Swedish film "Songs from the 2nd floor" as parallel but characterized by humor and imagination and this is not softening in reality. What is the Marshall Plan and the European Union you created? Seeing this in the theater with anyone I know will only lead to forced departure after a few minutes less than I got on a DVD.

The soulless suburb that I thought existed only in Arizona and Florida thriving in Lower Austria. No no! I thought that sex clubs no longer existed even in New York and San Francisco, and here in suburban shopping malls? Was Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western civilization, "Why may this be a beautiful idea"? If the world is really like this film, and with this black hole, we are ready.
