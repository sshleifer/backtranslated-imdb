What I like about this show is that it follows the life of modern witches and it's an experience to experience their daily love, humor and adventure. Magic literature is very varied, depicting the ideas of classical, medieval and modern witches, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the Teenage Witch, this offer is fun and unique because it allows us to experience a lot of this modern magic, which deserves seven seasons! This show has many wonderful qualities and I am honored to watch Sabrina live her daily life in the world of the dead and "the other". I recommend this to any family because the TV series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!
