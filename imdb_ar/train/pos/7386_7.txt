Well, the Oscars seem to be on the verge of it every year. I was rooting for Gosford Park (come on, Robert Altman deserves the Oscars for years!). However, I think it is time for an African American to win the Best Actress Award. Unlike previous reviewers, Halle Berry's role in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than that of Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I never thought of nominating the latter for anything, especially in the year of "Mulholland Doctor". <br /> <br /> Among the things I was predicting were the things related to the September 11 attacks; I knew they would say something about freedom. Yes Yes. Robert Redford should know better. But unlike the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the former hosts Bob Hope, whom I dislike); I really liked John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> So, although I did not give "Best Mind" the best picture, the "74th Annual Academy Awards" still makes me happy (I have to admit, I enjoy Oscar more than my birthday). The next day, while my mother and I were walking around houses in Bandalier, New Mexico - it was the spring break - I was thinking that when Jim Broadbent won an Oscar, most of the people who watched her were asking "Jim Who?" I wonder if Woody Allen Will attend the Oscars again.
