For those who say that this film deserves anything less than the undying grace it has shown, I disagree. This is an amazing documentary about a traumatic day. <br /> <br /> IMDB is asking us to rate this movie. I beg you to think about the fact that the documentary was made. The courage required by this film is most prominent. We find that the two brothers are divided when that moment occurred. They continued to document the courage of the brave without knowing about their safety and safety. Judging whether it is better to shoot a video of this tragedy or to save lives, as the amazing firefighters did, I do not answer. I only know that within 30 years, a classroom full of children will not know one another. <br /> <br /> I'm really honest 10. That's why the art of photography was created! To capture the natural feelings offered by real life. You can keep your kung fu junk. Nice romance. Work will never reach this level. This film, 9/11, will be immortal in that he did not glorify himself. Did not have a sneak peek. He did not have all of the blatant vanity that lion share of many movies on many glow screens. She had a class, composure, material, and had a record today that changed the face of modern America and even the world. I talked about the inevitable things of the camera's eye. Please consider this film, as it declares itself, a strong greeting to all who have fallen because of the beautiful free name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you offer anything less for a film that displays, rather than embellishes, the natural courage of real people acting in unrealistic times. I love "Godfather" but "9/11" forever is a different kind of film because this is now a different kind of world. It is art without question or questions. <br /> <br /> jf
