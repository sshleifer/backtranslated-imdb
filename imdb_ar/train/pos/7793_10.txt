My brother brought this film to the house of the rental shop and I remember that he expected this to be a cavity. I think the title put me in particular. I never remember starting a film with such low expectations and being totally won. I watched the movie twice before I let my brother bring it back to the store. It is very rare to talk to me about a movie like this one. She is completely suspended in Ruby's position as she tries to make her way through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end quickly. I could have seen hours. The other downside is that I have not been satisfied with everything Ashley Jood has done since then. It's very perfect in this film. This film is easily the favorite of the top ten of all time.
