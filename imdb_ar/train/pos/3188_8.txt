I was having the worst day of my life. Then I found this nice film and watched it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss the street lamp. <br /> <br /> I must admit, I've only seen it for two reasons: LEGS VERA-ELLEN'S. But it is really much more. The plot is actually very smart and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespeare comedy with all the delicious misunderstanding. And of course there are also ... VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version you purchased (Mill Creek Entertainment's 100 Family Classics group) did not get the best video quality, and I heard the same thing about Alpha. Brightness and contrast are a bit high, so it looks like a lot of bleached scenes especially when Vera dances in a white dress. But I assume that you can control your televisions to make up for them. I can not help but imagine how it looked on the big screen in 51. Theatrical collections, costumes and colors are dazzling and dazzling in a cheerful way - of some sort in Dr. Caligari's Closet. <br /> <br /> As far as romance goes, it's perfect. Not happy, not contrived, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, poor schmucks, your miserable life will not be such a witch. Har Har Har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life absorbs as badly as you have. Oh hell. It's time to watch this movie again.
