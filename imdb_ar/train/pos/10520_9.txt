I have seen this film addicted to Jane Austen and I always doubt the cinematic presentation of the complexity of her novels: Well, this change is simply subtle, clever, delicate, precise, polite, respectful, condensed, in a word, perfect! "Emma" is one of Austin's most fun and funny novels, thanks to his naive and comprehensive personality positions. The film respects this hidden paradox, and does not ignore the comic element (Miss Bates above all). What I have been involved in the novel, and the film clearly illustrates, is the profound knowledge of human life that the English novelist has shown, and the modern appearance that women and men have treated and their relationship. It is amazing if we think how an 18th-century novelist, The truth about life as I did: it still fascinates me. We can feel this modernity throughout the film: just replace fashion, use a more modern language but attitudes, feelings and ideas will be very modern. I think of the obsessive attention to the lives of others, or the concrete envy that now governs women's relationships, and it is still difficult to reveal one's feelings, express them, especially love: each position gets universal and out of time. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers a very good and wonderful performance: young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (these days may be very mature for him), Tony Collett is simply fantastic. And how I envy them on the wonderful dresses they can wear! And then, the stunning English countryside, where every position takes on such a magical dimension that looks like a dream ... it is a really enjoyable and worthwhile film.
