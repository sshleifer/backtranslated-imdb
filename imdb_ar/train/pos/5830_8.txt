The boys work outside the recording studio when they hear "angel voice". That would be Miss Van Doreen, who is testing and running Miss Andrews because her father does not approve of being a "radio singer". She hopes, however, that her great fianc√©, Mrs Bixby, a friend of her father will hire her, and then he will have to agree. <br /> <br /> She leaves but within minutes the boys run left in the studio causing chaos and make the other musicians to kill them after they destroyed the recording session. Things finally calm down. "What a surprise, we've run away," Mo says. "Yes, we have also escaped," Curly replies. <br /> <br /> Then the boys fool the studio and put Miss Van Dureen's record and Curly wears the women's clothes and pretends to sing. Mrs. Bixby walks in, is impressed and rents "Seniorita Cucacha" immediately! For an additional $ 500, she was asked to come and sing at an upscale community party that night. The rest, they say, is history as Curly claims to be an opera singer with some funny results. Oh, by the way, he was accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> What happens at a concert is simply that the truth wins, but not before some random instincts occur. In all, a very good loop. I enjoyed it but I will not value it as something special.
