The last film in the story of Lucas is a magnificent and spectacular production. The Ugly Duck is often considered the original trilogy, but I think it is a category higher than the fourth ring (and only below the third and fifth rings). In fact, I think it's the third best film in the 6-part epic. As far as I'm concerned, it is still a wonderfully entertaining movie. It is not a film with a beginning, a climax and an end; the mechanism of the film works with only one goal in mind: the closing of the universe of Lucas. There is an atmosphere of designs associated with everything, making the film a bit emotional, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it is a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and new characters face unexpected new challenges. C3PO and R2D2 (as usual) provide great comic comfort. Lea and Solo are fantastic Romanesque twins, and Luke remains a recognizable and remarkable figure. Again, the internal conflict between Luke (and Vader) is what gave the epic its backbone. Lucas's aggressive fantasy is still largely clear, and the film's themes of allegiance, hope and salvation are strong. I am glad that Lucas finally abandoned the idea of ​​making the seventh, eighth and ninth episodes, because this film is a great cover for a long, fascinating and fascinating epic. It's not an ideal film, but it's fun in a better way.
