The main story here is that Aditya (Kumar) is the spoiled son of millionaire, Ishwar (Bashan) who has a play industry, in the eyes of Ishwar, his son Aditya can not make any mistake, Sumitra (Shivali Shah) warns his son Ishwar Because Ishvar has lung cancer and has only 9 months to live, when his son runs away and married Mitali (Chopra), Ishvar Aditya is easily forgiven, but when the happy couple Aditya returns from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant and Ischwar is forced to expel Aditya From home to make it more responsible, Aditya does not know that his father suffers from lung cancer, k A he does not know that his father has been expelled from the water hose to make it more responsible, can not be transferred to Eschauer Aditya tall and is about to die, with the wife of hungry and pregnant. It is a race against time, so Aditya does his best to prove himself to his father, culminating when Aditya gets a great break in the film industry and tells his father that he is about to die. This movie is very cool, and this is a great achievement in Indian cinema that was required for the Bollywood industry, and Shah's output is almost flawless, but what movie has no drawbacks? The best part if this movie is a father-son relationship that is tearjerker. The song is only put in time, the scene is good, and the only part that fails is that the jokes between Iranian Bowman and Rajbal Yadav were too long, but a bit annoying, but in general a wonderful movie, I would recommend anyone reading this review to go And watch it regardless of other reviews. 9/10
