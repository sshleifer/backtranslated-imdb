I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought the tickets first and then checked the comments on IMDb. I'm worried about seeing a bad film. Well, I enjoyed watching the movie. Some of the parts, which were obviously scary, were in fact very spiritual, as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I do not consider this film a bad film. It's not a great movie either. Just a horror film made well. Do not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting and music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah has done a very good job, very convincing. Surely the other actors were not too bad, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The groups are nice (I do not care that the groups are the same that were used exactly in the original Japanese version). The horrific moments were often predictable. But not always. I saw some horror, and I did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The film had some nice scenes that were almost original, such as the effects of garbage, the simple effects of the ghost, the boy's eye, the cat who made a strange noise, the gargle about the dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go if you want to see Sarah in another episode of Buffy's programs, because they are quite different from her Buffy, and the most dangerous. Do not go if you just want to watch movies that collect Oscar nominations. It's a good horror film, enough suspense. I gave him 7.
