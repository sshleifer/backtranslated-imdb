Here is the strangeness: a recent film about a serial killer with no scenes of fighting, and no one saw die, and not chasing a car or noisy voices ..... And happening in Russia. There are only two short motion scenes, but they are horrifying. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is the work of a detective, and the amount of red tape that the poor detective had to go to solve the murders. This is a very bitter film, and describes a "bitter person" as the best character of the hero (Stephen Rhea). However, the story is not very frustrating and interesting along the way. <br /> <br /> Rea is awesome, he is the resolute investigator. Jeffrey Damon is frankly scary like a killer. The Russian accents to Donald Sutherland is questionable, but he plays the only character in this film who has some warmth. <br /> <br /> The story is spread again with liberal agendas, here and there, with no single signal but a sign of bias against gays, full authority for secular psychology, police and government officials being rude / crude / fanatic, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is a clever, low-level, fun crime film. It is a fairly unique film that is probably not well known but is loved by the people who saw it. Because it depends on a real account of this killer, it is more shaky. Do not pass this just because you do not have anything about it.
