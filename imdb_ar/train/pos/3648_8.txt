"Pandora's Clock" is a wonderful suspense / suspense film that combines a virus film with a disaster film. The film, which was broadcast in two parts on NBC on its first show in 1996, is about a flight with a virus when a passenger gets sick. The US government is debating whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while pilot Richard Dean Anderson and an expert on the virus (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to discover something to avoid disasters. I'm not a fan of movies and entertainment, but I liked the Pandora Clock. It's one of the thrill journey. Jean Leaves (from Fraser TV), Robert Loggia and Edward Herman (as president) also star. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
