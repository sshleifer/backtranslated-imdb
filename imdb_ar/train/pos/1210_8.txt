My kids love it now! Granted, I can watch it now and realize that the animations were not great, and that the plot is vulgar. Hello, if every Villani came up with "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think they might laugh, but for young children, it's an ethical story with attractive music. <br /> <br /> The music is very attractive, I care, I still memorize the lyrics after not seeing this movie 20 years ago. I would definitely suggest this one to younger children.
