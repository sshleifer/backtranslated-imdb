I heard about Eddie Isard, but I did not actually see him. I knew he was a transsexual, and when I saw that he was on HBO one night last summer, I wore it and did not know how my husband would react. Well, we've blown away. It's better than Robin Williams. He has full control over the audience; when he does "Englebert died - no he is not," routine, the public does not know what he thinks of the end. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his copy of the Spanish Python courts as implemented by the Church of England - "Kick am Dat"? Priceless. My jaw was tired of laughter at the end of the show. We searched the TV listings for months after that to be able to see him again, and we were lucky enough to record him the next time he came. If you have the opportunity to view this show and cancel everything and register it, you will not be disappointed.
