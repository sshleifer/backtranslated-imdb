I really liked this movie. All three stars (Conrey, Fishburne and Underwood) offer reliable performances; and Harris is more than wonderful. The lighting and shooting angles of some Harris scenes make his face look really demonic. The sudden turn of the plot in the end makes it interesting. Not a great movie, but it's a fun movie. I gave him 7 out of 10.
