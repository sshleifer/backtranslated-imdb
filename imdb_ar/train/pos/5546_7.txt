Some people say that this is the best film released by the PRC at all, I'm not sure because I have a great place in my heart for some of their secrets. I will say that this is perhaps one of the most unique films they have released, or any other studio, big or minor. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of the ferret man who was wrongly executed came back to the swamp to kill all those who killed him as well as all their spring. In this mix comes the granddaughter of one of the ghost ghosts, the current craft. She takes charge of the phrase as the ghost approaches the man she loves. <br /> <br /> The thick fog is enveloped in a single swamp set, a musical poem more than the usual feature film. Listen to the rhythms of dialogue, especially in early scenes, a poetic rhythm. Similarly, there is a similar rhythm to the work of the camera as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if it were crossing back and forth through the door between life, death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera, a fianc√© or a musical lesson more than a horror film. It is an amazing part of the film industry that may be unique in the film's history. <br /> <br /> This is not a night shift. This is a horror / low budget mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained. The story of love and revenge is what matters here, not the poetic film industry and your interest first and foremost (the technical aspects are just window dressing). If there is any real defect, it is the production license. Fog creates a mood but also hides the fact that this swamp falls entirely on land. It is always fixed back for a short time, but even after 58 minutes, you wish to see something else. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the movie a lot. It's such a good little movie that I would have wished poverty were a little lower. Definitely worth a look if you can come across it.
