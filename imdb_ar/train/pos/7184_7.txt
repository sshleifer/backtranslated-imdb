I love this show perfectly, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode, I was able to see why the people were initially turned off. The first episode is not the best, they struggle to start the series correctly. However, I still love the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop more after the episode and become really fun characters. As a first episode, it does not accurately represent the rest of the show which is really good. This episode is not bad in any way, but as the presentation progresses, it becomes better and better, so watch more episodes before making any judgment on the quality of the show.
