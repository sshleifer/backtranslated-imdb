In my opinion, this should be one of the best offers Barbara Stanwyck. She was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say with one look more than a full dialogue page. I was lucky enough to watch the original and uncensored movie, with additional footage of 4 minutes. Too bad the film is too short. Lili is a young woman who barely clings to her and works with her father in his illegitimate conversation. Her only link to anything is her good friend, Chico, who played brilliantly by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is an African American (and the presence of a white woman best friends with a black woman in the 1930s was as controversial as the subject of this film), and Lily is not, they have a special bond. It is not sexual. Only two women, or pushed them, were placed out of their will. After the death of Lily's father, she did not know what to do, she was told she had the ability to go out and get what she wanted. Yes, this is immoral, but this is the main point of this film. Then "they" had to go and ruin in the last few minutes. So, until the last minutes of the film, it's a great movie and worth watching. Still "studied" the film is valid today as it was at the time, I am sure it will be 100 years from now. Women, it's terrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, take note.
