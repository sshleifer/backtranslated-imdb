Before everything lost appeared on TV was expected. You can predict who will die or who will find something, but in Lost you can predict something. Everything was amazingly amazing and was really a mystery, not because it contained a lot of secrets but because there was nothing like it above all it was wonderful. I literally became addicted to it. LOST Classic Artwork. It gives you something you look forward to every week. He is a genius. The surroundings are wonderful and quiet and warm on the beach and very scary in the forest. The characters are a genius for each and every one of them, especially those already on the island. The untouchables are very dramatic, but we can never predict their death because they have a lot to do and many things to say and secrets that affect other untouchables who die with them.
