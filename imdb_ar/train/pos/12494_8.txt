Finally, an independent film already offers some great concerns! I see most of the horror movies that came out ... play, directly to DVD, cable, etc ... Most of them suck ... a few of them are viewable ... even fewer are actually good ... Dark Remains are one of the good ones . I watched this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... I love the audience that ... and my wife and I loved him! With no representatives of the name, I assume that the budget of this movie was very low, but you will not know it ... The movie looks great ... The acting works perfectly for the film ... The story is good ... and the big fear! While most filmmakers focus only on concerns, they often forget the development of the story and characters, two things that help deliver these concerns more efficiently. Bryan Avent Bradley must know that the character and the story are important. It develops both to the point where the characters are concerned, you know the characters, so they are more afraid when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watch horror movies that cost between $ 80 million to $ 5,000 to make, I find the "remnants of darkness" to be one of the gems out there. Check out this movie!
