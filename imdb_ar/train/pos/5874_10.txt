The friggin step was hilarious !!! The craziest I've ever seen, Akshay and John kick ass as always, the chicks are very hot. The story is wonderful, lots of great jokes, and everyone who reviewed this before me is a fool. I tell him you do not have an Indian background so you will not understand the sense of humor. Do not evaluate movies that you do not understand. What did you see, the translation version where you lose the majority of jokes in translation? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the best actor ever and proves once more ingenuity, he can not only work but also comedy, which is excellent in it. John also proved himself, this is his first comedy role and was also excellent.
