This film is light, funny and beautifully illustrated. The lightning is very cool, and the colors of Vermeer's paintings are convincingly remembered. <br /> <br /> This is an emotional comedy at its best, above American and French standards, and arguably better than in English. <br /> <br /> Every character touches, and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabel Blaise is wonderful, Sylvie Moro is better than in the Catherine series, and Stefan Gagnon is charming, and Emmanuel Beludo is wonderful in this strange role to him, and Genevieve LaRouche is the perfect perfect friend! <br /> <br /> Continue for hours before you find a negative comment on this movie, so give it a chance and add your opinion.
