Lots of user comments that I've seen on the IMDB for this movie do not really do it. First of all, let me just say that this film will not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a fun movie, but it's stupid, does not require one to think, just to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in filmmaking or humor, you will be very upset. However, if you just want to watch a filthy movie with some talented actors / actresses, and some good phrases, then you will enjoy it.
