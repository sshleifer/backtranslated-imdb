Hitchcock shows his understanding of the already developed images in this early silent film. The plot of the film, involving two boxers fighting a girl, is a direct drama without much to recommend. Hitchcock's talent, though, is found in his stunning use of images. Almost every snapshot is filled with visible icons. Do not forget the jewelry that the boxer gives the girl before her marriage to the other boxer. He raises her arms in a sexually explicit way and with one move with a simple movement showed us everything we need to know. Boxing scenes are well handled with some interesting shots from the point of view and prove once again how far Hitchcock was ahead. The film also gives an insight into his treatment of later women. The object desires of boxers driven by money and lust, not mind or love. The other single women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open sex shows or older people who help destroy happy relationships. All in all, the ring is a must for anyone interested in making hitchcock early and developing it as an optical field.
