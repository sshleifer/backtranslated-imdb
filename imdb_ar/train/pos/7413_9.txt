The shower keeps itself inside in many ways. Almost all films are made in the old bathroom, providing residents with humor, compassion and emotional touches. Love and friendship between the owner and his son is backward and deep and moving. The way in which the older brother is attracted to this small world seems unconvincing and convincing. This plot is tortuous and full of surprises and ridicule, and has generally been affected in the sense of what I should call neighborhood in the relations of artists and their opposition. This is a film I made when I want to believe in the world again.
