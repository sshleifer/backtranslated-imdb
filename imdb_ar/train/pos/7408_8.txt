I was honored to see this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> "Xizhao" or "Shower" is a low-cost movie worth $ 200,000 for a father and two sons. The father has a traditional bath somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where men, mostly elderly, come to relax and shower. The father must be a son: a backward son living with him and a son living in a large modern city and coming to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathroom and his "retarded" brother seem strange and upset, but this changes along the film. <br /> <br /> Although the story may look cheese or cliche, it is not. Through the truly wonderful performances, especially for the father and son "Retarded" (sorry, do not know their names) and a wonderful story the film was both moving and funny. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this movie do it. It's a great alternative to Hollywood cinemas. <br /> <br />
