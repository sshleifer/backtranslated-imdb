Back in that day, if Marion Davis absorbed many of her followers and did not just listen to William Randolph Hearst, she made more films like Show People and was happier. In fact when you see her get her first big break in a comedy reel two, she would love to do it in her career rather than such epics as "when Naitwood was in Flower and Janice Meredith." <br /> <br /> What you see all the accounts in Show People is the real Davis, a talented comedian, a wonderful tradition and a kind person. She can really recognize the character of Peggy Pepper, known as Patricia Prepoire, and has surpassed her share of the Hollywood star. <br /> <br /> If the Show People plot is set in the legitimate phase, it will relate to a story behind the scenes. I think it's one of the first movies about movies that you can call behind the story of the camera. Marion is eager young hope that reaches Hollywood like many others, looking for that great comfort. She wants a drama, but her introduction to the films is a foil to comical comics. She gets her share of pie and hard in the face, but she learns her business. She also won the heart of young comedian William Haines. <br /> <br /> She got her first big break, but she did not come to Heinz either, and Marion did a legitimate drama with actor Paul Raleigh and played Andrei Telfer, not pretending to be a Con Avignon accountant. Someone here was taking a shot of actor Lou Telegen, the lover and husband Sarah Bernhardt and Jaredine Farrar and others, and to hear that, one of the most disgruntled people in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Show People was one of the first movies to have an unguarded veil of stars for themselves. You will see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mai Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Burdman, etc., only in and around the film colony. This in itself makes Show People a movie worth saving. <br /> <br /> People also showed good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs, such as Is not We Fun Fun, and I'm sitting at the top of the world. You'd be surprised, California, here I am. When the film appeared on the soundtrack, a song called Crossroads was introduced. It's not a bad number, but the boy and the girl they sing are not credited with the soundtrack. I think they were not seen, they felt there were no necessary bills. I still want to know, and I'm sure you'll find out if you're lucky enough to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see why Marion Davis liked this film very much and considered him a favorite. She looks at the house in this film, and the scarcity of her real life in the demonstration is shimmering in her performance, making it a real pleasure for the audience.
