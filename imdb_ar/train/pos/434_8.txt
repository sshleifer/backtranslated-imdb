Develop a nice character in a wonderful setting. As a male, I may not be able to fully understand them, but they do a great job in creating the restricted Victorian environment from the beginning. It is not as bleak as it has been, and the treatment of women may have been more harsh. What makes this go is the brilliant chemistry among the main characters. Each of them has the "thing" they deal with. As soon as they get out of the rain and get out of spider webs, they begin to interact and lose their sense of suspicion slowly. What I enjoyed in this film is that it did not go to cheap comedy when it could have been. She did not try to teach us a lesson. People who seem to be totally undeserved are truly human beings who can see the light. I have encountered a small problem with the character of Alfred Molina who has such a diver very quickly, but, in this world, must happen. Good behavior everywhere with something positive happening in the lives of some good people.
