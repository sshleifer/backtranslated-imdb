I saw this demo program when it was first introduced, and I am sure that countless "Spirit" fans hate it, because, like Batman and Green Hornet etc., it took character in the direction of "camp". But obviously I did not get enough Batman, because I thought it was amusing, in some of the same ways that the show showed. There are two sections that stay with me. First, when a religious partner was fatally wounded, he gave a dramatic speech about how he had always supported the law and obeyed a careful speech. Then say something like, "Boy, you were stupid!" It is his way of telling Denny to become a guard instead, which he does (although Batman TV). Then, there is a scene where he tries to seduce the villain into letting him go by kissing her, but she is not fooled, because he is very honest in kissing her convincingly! This was a great example of the "campfire", which was "underestimated" by both actress and actress.
