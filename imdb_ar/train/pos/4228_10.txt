First class Colombo from start to finish. I particularly like the interaction between Colombo and the murderer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As a hungry Colombo fan, I can not remember anyone else who does not organize the killer in the end because he does other episodes. In this example, while trying to determine the correct sequence of boxes and the "message" left by his nephew, he finally appeared. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good, as in many others.
