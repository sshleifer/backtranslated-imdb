Canadian director Vincenzo Natali directed the art scene with the intriguing and intriguing "Cube" film, my favorite film of the 1990s. Laid a framework for the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a gigantic cube-shaped labyrinth, completely filmed on one set, and took the idea in brilliant directions. <br /> <br /> I was anxiously awaiting Nathalie's follow-up, and although it took five years to implement another project, I am happy to say that it's worth the wait. Cypher is a wonderful exploration of the place of one man in the world and how he finds himself in a position beyond his will through a series of perfectly logical events. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal much about the plot, because one of Cypher's joys are the different ways that take us down. It is very refreshing in this day and age watching SF film contains more of an idea in his head. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the most serious people on the planet, has been appointed by DigiCorp. They send it to different parts of America to register different seminars. To his horror, they are incredibly boring. Covers subjects such as mundane like shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan waits for one seminar, he runs to Rita Foster (Lucy's meticulously designed character), a definition of the Ice Maiden. She gives him the brush, but there is something she finds irresistible. This is not very surprising given the dry marriage in which he lives. <br /> <br /> When Rita appears in one of Morgan's other episodes, you tell him that his life is not what it looks like. I am not saying anything more about the plot. To do so would reduce the impact of the rest of the film on us, in addition to the hard track is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> As with Cube, Nathalie shows a complete talent to include seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and seeing what will happen mainly when the unknown is broken into. Cypher follows similar patterns. But it is not a carbon copy of the cube. This movie has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a more common movie with thriller movies and great madness stories. One of the great things about Cypher is how these topics sneak into the story without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his erroneous identity is a much larger puzzle, it is as shocking to us as it is to him. <br /> <br /> There is something that distinguishes Cypher from the Cube, and is more refined. he is. Cube was limited to a simple setup and a volatile budget with a group of unknowns. Cypher is also on a low budget, but Natalie provides it as much as possible, allowing him to expand the horizon and launch Morgan on a stunning journey through his own maze of identity. <br /> <br /> Nathalie's direction is exceptional, with an ingenious hand on the reins. There are some amazing camera angles from the top, such as the magnification of the DigiCorp building as a large, powerful office block in conjunction with the irrelevant patches Morgan is located outside. It seems that all the colors have blurred from the picture, which perfectly complement the movie's tone as a modern twilight film. <br /> <br /> The acting is absolutely excellent all the time. Jeremy Northham is a sympathetic figure of his loving marriage to question his identity. Its performance is excellent because it is highly tuned. It literally looks like it turns right in front of our eyes. From the insatiable clinical insanity to the confident man who would do anything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett puts on a welcoming look that has such an impact on Cube. He lives in a secret silo that looks like borrowed from Men in Black. His scene is one of the best scenes because it is an exercise in suspense and carefully calculated suspicion. He is a supposed expert in identifying double proxies, a wonderful part of writing, acting brilliantly by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan, and we are drawn to his complex mental game. <br /> <br /> But Lucy Liu is the one who steals the scene here. They are often filmed in films where their potential is not fully exploited. But in Cypher, she was finally given a personality that fits like gloves. Rita is intimate gestures in isolation from Leo's taste. They have gathered every time they appear because they always control, and can reduce the space of silence due to the strength of glacier alone. <br /> <br /> Things have reached a very satisfactory end, and this does not satisfy a vague conclusion in the way a cube did. But Morgan deserves a happy ending. After being put into the contest like this, he cheered him in the last scene. It's a perfect last moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after 90 minutes of darkness. <br /> <br /> Cypher has succeeded in all areas. It's always attractive, amazing and entertaining, it's all that Total Recall wanted to be but it was not. It comes as a refreshing antidote to an overwhelming matrix that can not be explained. <br /> <br /> A minute follow-up from Natalie. Now, I admire the man. cool stuff!
