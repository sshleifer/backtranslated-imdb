There are a lot of things that must be located in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (inside the mind of the killer), it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this movie is similar to the exercise in cinema, but it is really wonderful. It's made of 8 super, black and white footage, 35 mm, color, interviews, memories of the past. Aro Tolbukhin is like a documentary-making film or viceversa, whose most unusual side depends on the doubt that makes you wonder, was it already there? The film follows the life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked on a religious mission and killed some people. The act was arrested and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French notaries took care of this character, so they met him before his death. At the moment, more people have participated and conducted a deeper search for personality. The person we are seeing - the film. <br /> <br /> For the main part of history, we are guided by a semi-slow phase to consider within Aro''s mind, mainly to decipher what he has done. However, the important thing is that filmmakers do not give us a point of view . They have left us all, and even when we understand his actions, we clearly do not justify them. So the first half depends on collecting information; things turn later into Aro's childhood, giving the film an amazing new power (even if it does not become stiff or dull). <br /> <br /> I do not mean - and do not want - to spoil anything; the only thing left is that if you come across this movie near you, believe me, the journey to see it more than worth.
