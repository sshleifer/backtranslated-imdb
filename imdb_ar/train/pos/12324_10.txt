This film is incredible. With great characters, especially the old swordsman who can fly like a fireball and jump through trees, this film tells a classic story about the battle between good and evil. The last encounter is impressive especially the musical result is rather wonderful. <br /> <br /> Very good, not highly recommended. Not for younger children although it is worth 10.
