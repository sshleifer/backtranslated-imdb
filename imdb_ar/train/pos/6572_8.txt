One of my favorites for several years was "Last Action Hero"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarzenegger decided to spoil my time when he became a corrupt politician. So far I can not afford any film he might have a hand in. <br /> <br /> In fact, Adventure of Jake Speed ​​plays some of the same themes as Last ... Hero, so I was happy to find it on a DVD, so I can see these well-played themes . <br /> <br /> Despite the "conspiracy within the conspiracy" that includes white slavery during the civil war in an African country, this is not a motion picture. The film revolves around the "plot within the plot", which is in fact an issue not resolved by the film: Jake Speed ​​is a real person helping the heroine save her sister from the white slave trader. Or is it actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine somehow entered the universe that already exists only in a series of core novels)? I suggest that this is not all that is clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lin are quite aware of it. The film thus becomes an introduction to what the public of this fictional universe may want "an adventure story." It is in fact a rich subject, whose potential weight is mitigated by his sense of humor and humor in the film. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses in the film - it's primarily cinematography, making the film look like a TV show. And sometimes slipped speed. <br /> <br /> But I really love these characters and I enjoy the adventure they live in, no matter how silly. I just find a wonderful idea that this adventure actually happens in a novel. <br /> <br /> Catch multiple scenes - good view!
