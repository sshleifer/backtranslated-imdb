The Sopranos is the greatest show in the history of dramatic television. <br /> <br /> It is hard to think of another series of intelligence, fine writing, or first-rate displays. <br /> <br /> The epic range produces new and innovative characters and a consistent level of high quality. Centered on the life of Tony Soprano, a man living in two families. One is the traditional wife and two children of the nuclear family, and the other is a large group of New Jersey mafia, headed by both. Tony, played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and Mexican fame, is a wonderful and scary man, but also loved. Gandolfini's full praise for making him a beastly beast and a terrible aggression must be given a leading man who can be identified perfectly. Contemporary American drama has never been an exciting figure like Tony. <br /> <br /> Hundreds of actors never boast of a steady performance, and prominent figures such as Pauli, Theots and Ralph Sivarito will play in your memory forever. <br /> <br /> However, the true genius of this story is that the creator, writers and courage take a series of traditional dramas. Twenty minutes is a long dream sequence, a powerful and innovative use of symbolism, metaphorical images and scenes of truly horrific violence. However, all of this is met through themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series does not become cold or justifiable. <br /> <br /> Since television is now a rival and often poor, Soprano is long over the rest as the most creative drama in America. The family forgot to redefine. This is redefining the TV.
