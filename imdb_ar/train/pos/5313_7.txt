Since I am not a fan of almost any film for the "desperate life" of John Waters, I have prepared for "Pecker". After emerging from the ground, Waters produced copies of the trash from previous works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray ") that appeared in front of the hard fans and tasted like lukewarm water. Celebrities and tyranny in the world of art, the water is very well known for it because it also displayed and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most popular pop art was created at all because you can not imagine that anyone who can give up if it is not decorated as " Edward Furlong is as wonderful as "Pecker" and Waters' non - historic style.
