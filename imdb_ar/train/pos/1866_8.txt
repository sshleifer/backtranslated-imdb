A wonderful story, based on a true story about a black guy and all the difficulties along the way. Since this is the first film of its kind for Denzel Washington, which he himself would run, I must admit that I was skeptical about it, but who was not ..? But again, he is a wonderful actor with many years of experience, and the end result is fantastic. The story is beautifully narrated, which makes you face difficulties during your childhood and your youth, see yourself in these situations. So, it hits you hard, letting you know that the only person passing you is hell. All in all, an impressive story about a young man trying to make her in this world. (The story is based on the life of Anton Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this film) Highly Recommended. 10/08
