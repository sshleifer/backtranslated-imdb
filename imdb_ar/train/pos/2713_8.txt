Wilson (Erica Gavin) was arrested by police officers and sent to prison in this cold and amusing example to exploit prime 70, marking the first release of Jonathan Demi. After writing and producing a few "New World" films for Roger Korman's mentor, Demme was given the opportunity to make his debut, offering a film that offers not only predictable and delicious doses of nudity and violence, but also the quality of tongue in his cheek; What is as funny as it is glamorous. <br /> <br /> Standout's scenes include the lavish and lavish Fudville style of the prisoners, as well as a strong dream / fantasy sequence of readiness, and Superintendent McQueen (the horror icon Barbara Steel, obviously plays a great role in this hostile role) . I also enjoyed a bank robbery scene, and I enjoyed seeing the cars that were simply very turbulent. As in other films of this kind, it is also commendable that they represent the image of empowering women as much as they are pure exploitation. These women are cruel, they do not take any garbage, and they are more than able to deal with themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive crew here cast their most important roles: Juanita Brown as Maggie, Roberta aggressive Collins in the role of Belle Belle, Robin Smith in the role of gentle and shy Lavelle, Gavin as the newcomer with wide eyes, Linda Gold Also known as Sinclaire Crystin) in a bright appearance as a partner from outside. <br /> <br /> While our peak is over, Demme comes to an end with "Beat the Clock" while our heroines compete to save Belle from schizophrenia by Dr. Predator Randolph (Warren Miller), the type of man who does not think of exploiting Women . <br /> <br /> Since Caged Heat returns to the delightful John Calais, it is an upbeat entertainment and fun time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
