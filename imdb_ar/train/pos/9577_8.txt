Finally, we have a third category film for the summer season 2006. Made of equal parts of cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog does not only benefit from the right title, but also through flexible direction, cinematic photography and respectable performances from most participants. Of course there must be hunting, which is reflected in the form of many stark contrasts, yet all that has been told DBD represents the mature spirit that we would like to see more in the mainstream of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Represents Edison Chen, who has long since missed the first defeat last year. Chen's reserved wonders ask about the film, but it could have been difficult for Sam Lee, whose talent was crowned by a rotation between physical comedy (Crazy 'N' the City, No Problem 2) and his insane threat in the strongest role we have seen since Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the duo makes Dog Bite Dog, and we hope Edison gets an easier break from now on as a result: his projects have turned a touch of Princess D into the Epic of Infernal Affairs, and is still a rare event. <br /> <br /> Often, when the show starts, the DBD displays some charming images, and wonderful tricks play with light, shadow and perspective. Soundtracks work to enhance this effect in the atmosphere, adding to the unrealistic mood of the film. Much of the resulting synthesis is probably related to the writer Matt Zhao, who was previously involved in three equally heinous parties. Dog Bite Dog retains many of the qualities that have been called from this horror project, ie the soothing urbanscapes and the diffuse air of something strange lying in the corner. <br /> <br /> Be reassuring, though it is not a horror film, but it follows a trail by Wen and Nite Classic in Mongkok, though from a more inclined angle. Daniel Wu replaced the personality of the reluctant mainland assassin, we have Edison, playing a nameless killing machine descended from the criminologist in Cambodia. After sending him to Hong Kong for one goal, the silent killer almost takes care of the business as soon as he arrives, a process filmed in a shocking way from the wonderful film. <br /> <br /> Although he has gone from childhood to becoming a professional. Killer, the wild Edison dog known as his name still suffers from human weaknesses and leaves an impact, picked up by the CID team sent for investigation. This collection features great details from the mob-movie stalwart Lam Suet design, and good support from Wayne Lai TV star. However, the senior officer me dissident driving this charge, revealing himself to be a very disturbed individual but excellent cop though. We gradually learn that the Wai conflict stems from the background of his father's corruption in the police, which evokes the demons at hand in the relentless pursuit that follows. <br /> <br /> A small number of bodies appear, as Edison appears to be considering prisoners being banned. . There is a great deal of violence in the store, although the tone itself feels diluted in places, and the language of adults makes only a distinctive look. Again, no nudity is delivered, leading to the conclusion of the third cat these days a little hurry. DBD is still a relatively mature theater version, and we applaud its arrival. <br /> <br /> In the period between fighting, stabbing, pirating, shooting, even a professional killer needs some romance, and as Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, Mr. Chen gets his valiant sweetheart, Beautiful by my next new Beye. Her unnamed personality (too much anonymity) meets Edison in a strangely deserted landfill, abused by her father to the point of madness and craving for escape. When the killer gives up Hong Kong, he agrees to take her with him, and continue to run away together, and they love to blossom on the way. Although the film does not remain on the favorite things, our hearts go to the tragic personality of Pei Pei and her endless suffering. She makes the shy but brave protagonist surprisingly good, as she has proved that there are no villains or villains here, as it is in the end very vigilant. <br /> <br /> The portfolio of director Chang Sui has an impressive thriller, Sweet Home Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, probably surpassing most of the evil dog's tales. Cheang has been able to keep the DBD flowing all the time and look at the many parts here, standing at critical standards set up by people like Johnny Toe in The Mission's nightlife. There are some gaps that happen, to rid Edison miraculously of a shot in the chest, but these are very forgiving things. <br /> <br /> A celebration of victory comes back to talented young artists of the kind Hong Kong needs if we want the movie to return to its climax, Dog Bite Dog does not stand out for the story. Its strength lies in its strong portrayal and strong style, strongly supported by thespian muscle and keen eye on visual and audio acumen. <br /> <br /> HK has a long tradition of long-standing stories. The night in the city changes the ego, something lovingly supported by Dog Bite Dog, and reaches a fixed level if not an express masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
