We often talk about cinema features - Kane, godfather, bot de souffle. But one of the films is often ignored by "serious" critics.

Not to mention kung fu. <br /> <br /> She also has the greatest soundtrack in the history of the film (even of course the Queen's brilliant work on Flash Gordon). Although a little rarity, this film is worth looking for - it will pay ten times as much research effort.
