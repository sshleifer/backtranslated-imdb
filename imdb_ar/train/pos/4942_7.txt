I have to admit that during the first half of an hour or so of this film, I was basically lost. There was some nice humor, but at best a naked conspiracy and general sense of futility was about to make me think I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized I was enjoying it. There was no blind moment of perception and there was no sudden dramatic scene that caught me. In fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire film. It seemed as though I suddenly realized that the film was supposed to be pretty meaningless - and that it was useless in itself its magic. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman starred as an unnamed actor finding a small project "to start his career, he will play a supermarket manager and spend a day in a neighborhood supermarket looking for the role." While he is there, he meets Scarlett "It's really funny to watch" he "(because it's how personal identification is made in the credits) By visiting the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Both Freeman and Vega were wonderful together, but they were quite a strange kind of chemistry The Mancih but the father and daughter together. If you feel lost at first, Valtzm this. In the end, turned out to be a very enchanting movie. 10/07
