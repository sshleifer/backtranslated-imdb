I used to watch Pufnstuf at the end of every week when I was about 10 years old. It was right after Bay City Rollers. I saw it coming to the family channel one day and I registered it for my three-year-old daughter. I forgot all the things I loved when I was a kid, or magic flute, or a vacuum cleaner, or a Witcheepoo makeup. <br /> <br /> This offer is very low technology. The mayor is certainly a pre-mayor of Maishes, and everyone is a creature stuffed with annoying naughty eyes. But kids love these things. They were on their way, instead of watching a man working as a sock puppet instead of sitting in front of an animation of a high-tech computer. There is a light, but there are no adult topics like sex or people dying, and children accept Jimmy's schemes. Children think it would be good to carry a bag of smoke and convince someone to burn their house, and I loved how I saw my daughter running a jet in the sky every time I thought Witchypoo was flying over it. The music is old, but you get used to it really, and my daughter really loved it. I used to sing "different tough, different and lonely" in the car. My daughter has seen this show at least once a day for almost 5 months and is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that Pufnstuf 2000 is new in business. I really hope they try to preserve the old flavor and not do anything like computer animators and so on. I think a whole new generation will love Pufnstuf.
