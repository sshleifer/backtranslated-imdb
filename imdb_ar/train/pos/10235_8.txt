Unusual film of Ringo Lam and a strange film appreciation. The combination of fantasy kung fu with more realistic portrayal of the swords and spears driven through the bodies is particularly spectacular during the first ten minutes. A horse rider was cut into two parts while his waist and legs continued to ride. Get chopped several horses. It is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fung and Shaolin Brothers are caught by mad crazy crazy and imprisoned in the Red Lotus Temple which seems to be more than a torture chamber then a temple. General Kurtz is like the end of the world now, spreading a distorted philosophy and making scary paintings in human blood. <br /> <br /> Production is impressive and the setting is grim. Blood is everywhere. The procedure was performed very well and mostly coherent unlike many Hong Kong action scenes of that time. Sometimes, the film becomes absurd or the effects are cheesy, but it is not bad to destroy the film. <br /> <br /> Look for this, it's one of the best Kung Fu movies from Hong Kong since the early 1990s. Just remember that she is not child friendly.
