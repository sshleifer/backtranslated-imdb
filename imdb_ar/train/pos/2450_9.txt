I have been watching this show since I was 14 and I have loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just funny! You will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and entertaining daily and my favorite tournament is when Benny always has her last comments on George after every blow on his giant head. With my friends at home, it would be like watching a funny but short film. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, amazing. This wonderful comedy series for the family is fun for everyone and you will definitely enjoy it - I did! If you have not seen it yet, I suggest you start watching because you do not want to stop watching it. Although there are no new episodes, I still enjoy rebooting. Still funny. Never wear. <br /> <br /> 9/10
