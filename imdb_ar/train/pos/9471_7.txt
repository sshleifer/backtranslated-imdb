Steve Carell plays the role of Dan Burns, the newspaper's cousin, and has devoted Abba alone to three girls. In a large family house Dan meets his ideal wife, just to find out she is in relationship with his brother. <br /> <br /> What is the man to do? <br /> <br /> I liked "Dan In Real Life", but I imagine that the success or flick of this veto will go back to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a relatively straight and self-controlling role, rather than going through comedy moves Which made him very successful. If you do not, do not be afraid, Get Smart will be available later in the year, but for the record I thought it was very good. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" starts like a typical family drama, but it becomes more fun and entertaining as it progresses and Karel's frustration grows. "Dan In Real Life" is amusing and good actors (who will not fall in love at first sight with Juliette Pinochet), but they are not very original (but if you see films that contain only original ideas, Illuminating?) Make the most of an insightful scenario that contains enough insight into the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope that Steve Karel pays himself and does something interesting again.
