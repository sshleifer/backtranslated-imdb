The car was shot through the windshield, where someone played another song for someone else, and no one else responded, according to the voice. I just wonder how it came about. There was a lot of scenes in this film and I wondered how much the camera was. If the footage taken where Warhols descended into a post-BJM concert is correct, it was an unforgivable exploit, if not, it was perfect, in both cases it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? Along the way through this film I kept wondering how the footage happened. Taken from the face value, a beautiful image of the (tortured) genius that we all believe in.
