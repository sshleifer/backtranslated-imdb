I have not seen any of the Japanese hate films, but I really enjoy this film. I rarely feel scared when watching movies. I can jump, if the effect and sound are amazing enough, but fear of a film is rare to me. But I'm afraid of the idiots. Maybe because I did not expect anything at all when I saw it. I did not expect fear. I did not know anything about it either. Maybe that was a good thing. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you love or hate, it seems. Most people seem to compare it to Japanese Grudge films, but although I have not seen them, I think it is not right to compare any film in fact. This film is self-contained. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, as most people say. I do not agree with the narrowest story, and I did it on purpose. The storytelling techniques used - the broken time frame for example - are done perfectly. The director knows exactly what to do, and I think he got his vision as he wanted. <br /> <br /> I have made this movie 8 out of 10. It's a movie you'll enjoy watching or disliking. It's that easy.
