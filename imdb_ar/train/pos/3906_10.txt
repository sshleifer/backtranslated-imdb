This must be the most extreme comedy stand I have ever seen. Eddie Isard is a genius, he chooses the British and the Americans and everyone in between. His style is perfectly natural and absolutely delightful. I doubt that anyone can sit through this and not laugh them off **. Watch, enjoy, it's funny.
