Pinjar is a really good movie, with a wonderful representation, a good narrative, a good presentation, touching emotions, and so on. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of the films produced by Bollywood is getting better these days. This film is one of the evidence. <br /> <br /> There is no Bollywood film I can remember that had a big impact on me - I was literally thinking in the film for hours - I marvel at the different emotional situations in which a human is experienced. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the great representation of Urmilla Matondkar, as well as some of Manoj Bajpai. Ormila plays the role of a girl in North India in the background section, and all the problems seem sweet when compared to the problems she faces. <br /> <br /> A movie to watch. A technologically superior Bollywood producer, I feel it can be compared to the best films coming from other countries in the world.
