This film is a new version of two films that were much better. Another one, heaven can wait, it was wonderful, I suggest you see it. This one is not too big. The last third of the film is not too bad and Chris Rock begins to show some comic fun that has brought him to what he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this film. It's like a really bad "B", where people seem to be on some bad TV shows. Attitudes are enforced as if they are just trying to get the story so they can start a real movie. All of this looks real fake and editing is very bad. I do not know how they can make such a film. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and watch it afterwards.
