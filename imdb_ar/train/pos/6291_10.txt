Well, this was definitely a sudden episode. In this fictional series of anthology, with all these strange beings, extraordinary phenomena and many subsequent brushes, this incident is certainly unusual. His settings seem irrelevant and do not convey any morale at the end of the story. Or is it? Starting with Silent Movie Form, there is no recorded dialog box, but with a musical accompaniment. In this case, it is on the audio track, and "organ playing" or "piano" is not used by a musician on the horizon. This part of the episode, in addition to the end section, also used liberal title cards, such as "Old Time Movies". While these titles are somewhat exaggerated and beyond, I have deliberately and tenderly designed The Silent Film instead of any disdain. <br /> <br /> Veteran film director Norman Z. McLeod was the man in the chair for this half-hour installment. He has been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time, and includes people such as Marx Brothers, WC. Fields, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kay. He was no stranger to television, as he did a lot of work on the television series. <br /> <br /> It does not seem that he and Mr. Keaton have worked together before (I can not find any evidence of that). 'But judging from the film's outcome, they succeeded in doing so in bright colors! Anyone who directed Keaton was aware that Buster was also a good comic director in addition to being a comedy. He was comfortable behind the camera just as he was in front of her. Their short partnership should be harmonious, with "giving and taking" on how to do things. It is clear that many of the gags were Keaton, a revival of his own silent days. For example, a set of shorts with Rollo (with the help of Stanley Adams) were discarded by Keaton and Rusco "Fati" Arbakl in one of the Arpakl 2 Rilers, The Garage (1919), a clear example of his craft in short. <br /> <br /> Buster knew that we were photographing our world with a camera, making it a two-dimensional picture, and that's one fact at the bottom of many gags. It is a cardinal base for Cardinal. Film industry. <br /> <br /> The cast was small, and once again they guessed the talent of the veterans. Stanley Adams of Rollo was Mr. Keaton's straight man, and Jesse White, the old Maitaj repairman, Who has fixed "Time HJelmet". Gil Lamb, a quiet veteran of the RKO Short Comedy series, was Captain James Flaven, Stone, Harry Harry, Warren Parker, and Milton Parsons. Silence is largely cast. <br /> <br /> Without spilling beans, let's just say yes, maybe there is a lesson to learn here. If this is not already mentioned, "grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence!" , Then what about "Be careful what you ask for, because you might get it!"
