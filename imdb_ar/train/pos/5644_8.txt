When the United States entered World War I, the government forced Hollywood to produce propaganda films. LITTLE American may have been the best in the group because it is starring Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Beckford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hutton (French), but her decision is delayed because of the war with the recruitment of the two men. <br /> <br /> When the Beckford ship sank by the Germans (Lucitania thought) because they were carrying ammunition, Beckford had a wonderful sight standing on a lifeboat and yelling at the German commander. Later, of course, both Holt and Hutton were confronted when she was held as a prisoner of war in Château. <br /> <br /> The director Cecil B. Demel has a really wonderful spectacle in this film, Kickford, and Holt wanders through a bombed village. They pass a ruined church, one wall left. The wall has a very large steel. While standing and watching them, the wall collapses but the figure of Jesus is still hanging in the air. It is a very surreal moment in a very simple and unusual film. <br /> <br /> Beckford, as always, is happy to see him. She was always a very natural actress who avoided many other actors on the day he was using arm waving hands. It is also very very beautiful. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is fine. Among the names of the actors in the "additional" parts: Wallace Perry, Ramón Novarro, Colin Moore, Ben Alexander, Hubert Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neal, and Edith Chapman. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie, but interesting to see American propaganda at work.
