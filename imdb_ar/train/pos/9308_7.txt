If you're used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom In Miller's Crossing or Keaton in the usual suspects, I'd advise you to take a look at this film. Even if you are not particularly fond of Gabriel Berne, all the actors in this film are truly fantastic. If you've got about $ 11 (ie nearly nine vs.) say that online purchase order, or hire it from you to rent your favorite movie. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you like the usual movies or not. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you never forget, and you find yourself watching over and over again. You will talk about this a lot and your friends will beg to borrow it.
