Walter Matthau and George Burns work well together. The acidity followed with amnesia is a puzzled mix made in the sky. The scene when they meet again in Willy's apartment is a gem and the last scene revolves around the film to perfection. Walter Matthau performs superbly as an angry, semi-retired comedian as much as possible, intonation in sound and exaggerated drama as well as his general misunderstanding of what is going on. George Burns' legendary time was no better in this film. He watched the scene near the end when his son and daughter asked something of the Spanish charg√© d'affaires, and the Al-Abed reaction was priceless.
