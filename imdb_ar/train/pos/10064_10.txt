The King of Masks is a beautiful story telling that the preference of the family sex towards males against the human preference for love and companionship. In China in the 1930s, during the flood, we meet Wang, an old street elder whose talent is charming and appalled by all who witness it. When the famous opera artist sees Wang then endorses, he invites Wang to join their band. However, we know that the family tradition of Wang allows him only to transfer his secrets to the Son. When you learn that Wang has no children, Wang is encouraged to find a heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking advice to the heart, Wang bought an 8-year-old child to fulfill his legacy; his new son, Doji, knew the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers the truth about Doggie that threatens rare art and death. <br /> <br /> Together, Wang and Doggie create a link and experience a range of emotions that always accompanies him.
