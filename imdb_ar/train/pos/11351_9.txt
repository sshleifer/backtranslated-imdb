Excellent film The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My small problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian railway lines (MVV), and it is easy to see that they were used on the big train, not on the local railway - according to the story taken by Chicatello for killing local railway stations. Apart from this, the film is wonderful.
