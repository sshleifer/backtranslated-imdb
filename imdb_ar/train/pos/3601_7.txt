Michelle Rodriguez is a distinguished actress who can be the charged power of another actress to look for. She has the audacity to put herself in the role of a very inflexible young girl very early in her career (and withdrawn), an achievement that must be recognized. Although her later films are interested in the same role, this film was produced because of its hardness. <br /> <br /> Her character is a student / fighter / romance lover, struggling to overcome her frustrating presence in projects, a bit exaggerated in the film ... but not by a girl. This aspect of the film is not very original, but the story deepens when the hot relationships that this girl has to deal with boil and anger her primitive anger. <br /> <br /> I have not seen an actress taking this aggressive attitude in filmmaking so far, and I'm glad she got this original transformation there in Hollywood.This movie got my number 7 because of the average story of the young people in the ghetto , But he has such a great actress who plays a rare role in a simple budget film.
