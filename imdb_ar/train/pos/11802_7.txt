This is not the best Bigfoot game at all, but according to the modern Nature standards that came out of the film, most of which are shown on the Sci-Fi channel, these are the goodies. It has some actions, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but also some F / X operation, which I like. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie deserves watching if you are a fan of B horror / sci-fi and need to be fixed. It's better than a Sasquatch movie and not a sequel to it, so do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than you might expect to find in a movie like this and guidance is more than appropriate. Expect a bit of laughter as characters are "developed", but learn that things will get better. If you are watching a DVD, you may want to skip one or two chapters.
