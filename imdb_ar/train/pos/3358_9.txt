First of all for this film, I have one word: "Wow". This is probably one of the best films I've ever touched, ranging from story to show, so Sophia Loren and Marcelo Mastroiani have played beautifully. I was very impressed by the latter, because it has already brought depth of character, because it was a very difficult role. However, the couple formed a couple, surprised me, from start to finish, appearing in the way, a friendship full of love, evolving throughout the day, settled in the film. The story takes some time, because the introduction of characters is long, but in the end we are rewarded with a wonderful story of love and humanity. If you have the opportunity, look for it, because it is a movie that will stay in your mind several times. Simply amazing - 9/10.
