Frankly I do not understand why this film was a big "flounder" in publicity. Sharon Stone certainly has not lost any of her appeal and "touch" since the "basic instinct". I voted for this movie 10 and I tell you why: The game starts in London this time. London is the city where Katharine Tramel has moved since the events of BI1. Once again, they proved to be handling the mastermind of their unchallenged character. She "destroys your mind" like Catherine so skillfully that you are not sure in the end who the real villain is. <br /> <br /> As for the artistic part of the film: the only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. Sharon Stone is the only real name in the team compared to Michael Douglas and the like in the first part. I also think that BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone was a little smaller but still stunning in appearance and only improved with regard to its attractiveness. "Class B" assistants are not too bad even though I wanted to get some big names for the actors. <br /> <br /> I think there are very good improvements in the basic chart. I think this is a much better film than many Hollywood movies around the world, which are easily distributed these days. This plot is wonderful, easy to see technically, you do not groan halfway through the film, and most importantly, that health has begun.
