When I started watching this anime for the first time, I never thought that something about making bread might be interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started watching it, anime was pulled into the world of bread making, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> The biggest feature of this anime is humor, which is very smart and very funny, with some repeated gags. But the animation, soundtrack and personal development are less than average, while these flaws do not see much in the first episodes, given the large function in this cartoon, they really begin to appear in the last 20 episodes, Old, not as funny as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, if this anime is over from episode 52 I would give it 9, but the latter leave the episodes a bitter taste, which unfortunately can not be eliminated by the 50 great episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
