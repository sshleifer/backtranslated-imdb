Great surprise, probably because I expected to suck. The reviews were completely rejective, although they all seemed to agree that the concept was gold: the man discovers that his new girlfriend is a wonderful hero, and finds, when he wants to break up with her, that she is a psychologically ill type. I kept expecting it to collapse, but it never did. She certainly does not make as much of her wonderful hypothesis as she chooses to be short when it is better to expand the film world. But I can not blame it. Uma Thurman is wonderful like superheroes, G-Girl. I have discovered, after several years of dislike, that Luke Wilson can be perfectly perfect when portrayed as paralyzed. He has got two of the best comics of 2006 (the other in Idiocracy which has not yet been released). The expressions on his face were completely cracked when he first fucked Thurman. It's one of the sexiest sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl more of a psychic, like that incredibly. Maybe with some background you might have accepted it better. I can forgive her flaws, because I've had a really wonderful time watching them. Definitely underestimated.
