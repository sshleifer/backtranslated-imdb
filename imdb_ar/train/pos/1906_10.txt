Sadly, 8 simple rules, dating to my teenage daughter, were another sitcom that John Ritter earned after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of the favorite actors of all time. He had everything, comedy (can be forgotten in Three's Company), but he was also an excellent dramatist (unforgivable? Worth watching a TV movie) as much as I liked all the other cast members (Katey, Amy, Kaley) and Martin John is the star and had many reasons that made me attracted to the show in the first place, and his ideal comedy delivery was the one who was able to crack me up every time. <br /> <br /> I loved that the show was not everything that was resolved (as I liked Cosby's show, Come on, they were very nice to each other) they filmed the dynamics of the typical family brilliantly. It was realistic enough with all the rivalry between brothers and quarrels between parents, but they were funny. Many American comedies are trying to fill the shows with morality and not, and this offer did not. Yes, there were some, such as handling important issues, such as drugs and bullying, but they did not try and be anything other than a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote John's death in the presentation was done brilliantly, I still cry like a child every time I see him. You can feel the extent of emotion during those incredibly difficult episodes. <br /> <br /> I'm sad to cancel the show, I still enjoy watching the reloads and I never tire of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, will always be in your mind through your funny portrayal of this protective father who prefers to keep his daughters in their room rather than having a date in a boy =) You shake Ritter !!!
