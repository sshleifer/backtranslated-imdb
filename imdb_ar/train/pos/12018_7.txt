Provo makes his way to Yuma, realizing that this is not just the place where Burgad lives, but also his little daughter Susan, Barbara Hershey. Using his fugitive convicted fugitives to lure Burgad into the vast Arizona desert, promising them $ 30,000.00 of the gold coins he buried there, Provo plans to prove his bloody revenge on Burgad. But only after witnessing his daughter being brutally raped by his convicted colleagues, or she, with no woman for years, horny as a rabbit during the mating season! <br /> <br /> Wildly and very effectively Western that modern John Wayne 1956 classic "The Searchers" in the father looking for Indian territory dangerous to his kidnapped daughter.

Charles Coburn in the last half of the pregnancy, Zach Provo, is at its best, as the obsessed with fleeing from hatred and murder have escaped. <br /> <br /> The man who has fled with Provo does not really care about his personal affairs but has no other choice, because he knows the earth like the back of his hand, but to walk with it. It's just an idea of ​​their way with Susan, when Provo gives them the green light, plus $ 30,000.00 of buried gold coins that keep them from breaking in and going their own way. <br /> <br /> Also along with Burghad is her friend Suzanne Halle Breckman, Chris Mitchum, who eventually proves to be as good as Burgad, who felt that he did not have it, both in tracking fugitive criminals and in using Common sense, which in this case lacked Burgade, in doing so. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS **** The incredibly brutal and bloody confrontation between Burgade and Provo is hardly enough. Provo, who hated Burgad and was driven by the right madness, wanted to suffer from slow and severe death. It was that hatred that took advantage of Bugrade, and after he had finished half a dozen bullets, he ended up in a bloodthirsty and thirsty situation, as well as reckless and crazy away forever!
