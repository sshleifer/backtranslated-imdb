The impact of the inhuman war on war is the subject of a lesson in films; the equally inhuman, but potentially life-saving, impact of military training. Joel Schumacher's "Tigerland" follows the standard mold. We see men treated like dirt but appear as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their leading officers. Whether this extreme process can be considered justified is judged as judging the merits of the war on which they are trained (Usually, as here, Vietnam). But "Tigerland" has an interesting approach, by focusing her novel on a cocky dissident named Bozz (a superbly played Colin Farrell), who understands that all authority ultimately governs consent, and a lack of awareness among those who are powerless in your collusion. . On this character, a plot has been created and maintained, and it is also an added feature that the procedure never leaves to America (while Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, for example, has only one film of a similar genre, To Asia). Although this is not an amazingly original film, it has been beautifully presented: it is the best film of this director I've ever seen, and one of his best.
