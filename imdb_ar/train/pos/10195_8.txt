Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who are often better than his material and are always appreciated. He has been in many movies either as a heavyweight or a long hero, and he has a strong, strong presence that Wallace Berry did half a century ago. Baker can deliver materials that look ridiculous from another actor, and that is the great thing for him. He seems to really mean what he says, no matter how clear or silly cliches, putting him in association with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reid and Don Strud. This is what makes a walking trio work well, and that same magic is present in the ultimate justice. This was a great success in the theaters and in the video in the 1980s, and was much better than many of the most popular motion films of the time. By moving from Texas to Europe, there is real quality that does not worry and stay away from the on-screen movement. Frankly, I've always enjoyed Graidon Clark, a meaningless director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood in the 1970s, and this is one of his best films. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the missing gems of the late 1980s, like MAN ON FIRE in terms of form and violence. I assume that if they do this again using The Rock, a whole new audience will like it as much as I like.
