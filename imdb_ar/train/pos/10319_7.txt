After reading several other reviews of this film on IMDb, there is a apparent consensus among the fundamentalists that this film does not resemble the books on which it is based. Based on this point, I can not comment, since I have not actually read any of the previous adventures. What I can say for sure, however, is that it amazes me that many of the reviewers mentioned must have been subjected to a sense of humor. Let's be honest here - this movie is very fun! <br /> <br /> Well ... So, I have to admit the point that the film does not seem to be a character / figure but let's put this in a clear view? Are the same individuals involved in this film also showing the fact that the classic Batman series of the 1960s does not remain loyal to the character of the original DC comic book? Or perhaps there is still confusion in the same people that the 1980 film Flash Gordon was a big departure from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this movie is an incredible camp but that's exactly magic! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Ellie plays the hero named in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey's takeoff!) and is supported by a wonderful support team all of whom seem to be having the ball with their respective roles. I also look for a very short but very welcome appearance by Michael Periman's horror film. <br /> <br /> The best scene? Lots to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions that were adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men committed the ultimate pooh in order to order coke, lemonade and milk on a formal occasion! And also the scene that is often observed near the end of the film where Savage deals with his captain sea captain using various martial arts disciplines that are classified on screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film does not take itself seriously at all, but it is very enjoyable. Great fun from start to finish! (And will sing the song John Philip Sousse quoted for several days after guaranteed!)
