Unusual Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this flick. Why never become a larger store. But they are exceptional and steal every scene they are in. Garrison Kanin directed this piece of fluff and the film is first class, with Robert Dravas and Brenda Vaccaro particularly memorable. "9" of "10."
