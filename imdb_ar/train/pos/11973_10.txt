Full House is a wonderful comic about my father, Danny Tanner, whose wife has just died in a car accident. So, Danny asks his brother Jesse Katsopolis and his best friend, Joy Gladstone, to help raise his three daughters, Donna Joe, Joe Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michel Tanner. This is my favorite program at all and I can watch it all day long. Something on Full House makes me laugh always and there are sad parts too. There is no dull moment at Full House. The main characters are: Bob Saagt (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Catsopolis), Dave Collier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Judy Sweatin.
