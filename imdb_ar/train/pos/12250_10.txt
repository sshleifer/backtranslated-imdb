Kate Beckinsell steals the show! Bravo! Too bad, Knightley does not look as good as Jeremy Northham. Mark Strong did a great job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as a father of diamonds. I like the end scene (which is an addition to the novel - but well written) when the harvest is Knightly and deals with the workers and his friends in the community. Emma must show that she accepts this now. She is a changed woman. This is very fast, but OK. I will buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's ex-close-up. It's a great. Just as I imagined it. I think that when the United Kingdom is doing Jane Austen in the best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this one!
