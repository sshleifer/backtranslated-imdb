In the second viewing of this film, I liked it more than the first time. It is full of subtle differences and you imagine that life is quite normal and often scared, but what elevates this film to a height rarely understood is its focus on the small incidents in our lives that we normally only offer for the shortest periods of attention. Here the film revolves around the celebration of these incidents, the meeting of the driver of the tow truck and the client, the player hears the child's runner cry from the bush. Dialogue, acting, casting and direction are wonderful. No two of the four, no big disclosure. What I noticed is how true the characters are in their basic nature and how their lives became enhanced when they were celebrated. Glory to all participants in this, we need more "Grand Canyon" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
