This film is about to be my favorite celluloid piece. In fact, there is not much I need or want to say here. With the exception of "Watch This Movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work done by Daniel and Pascale", which brings you this stylish, funny and painful story about "spend your eighth day" - your day! <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! Some of us seem to be wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. Either if they satisfy a career or consume television programs and games. What we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something to someone else - make a difference. About taking time and time to be spontaneous and live - now! (On the eighth day) ... at least that's what I got from "Day Eight".
