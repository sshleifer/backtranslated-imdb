Why do a series of stupid, boring and exaggerated films such as "Star Wars" take on all the hype, and a truly amazing film like this one does not quite notice ... beyond me ... this film will really open your eyes to a dark, disturbing, sad and scary world where we live ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the boring "Elephant", this movie is not one of those "just a typical day until someone pulls the trigger". This film focuses more on what happens after the event ... <br /> <br /> Deana, played by Erika Kristensen, a very warm and talented girl, is a happy, healthy and direct student with good friends and a wonderful life ... so ... she was shot on the day of the shooting, Her head .. Fortunately she did not kill, but she was badly injured and must be in the hospital for a while, causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain, in addition to physical pain ... <br /> <br /> In time Himself, Alicia, also played by the very busy and talented Phillips busy, is a bad, cool heart, rebellious, girl of anti-social goth, has no positive trait on her ... she is not hurt when the shooting happens .. because it turns out she was a girlfriend With the shooter and learned that he would do what he did ... which leads to bring her to the police station and put some questions on them .. When you refuse to tell Raj If the police know that the shooting will happen, they will always come to her house to try to persuade her to say something ... and she still does not, so the school principal makes her attend the funeral of a dead student. Enough, forcing her to go to visit our hospital. Of course she refuses this too, but the manager says that if Alicia does not do that, the police will continue to try to get her to say something, and so she actually goes to see her ... <br /> <br /> Deana, physically and emotionally wounded, is more than happy to visit Avish, but of course Alicia is not happy but to see her .. For our generously granted, but of course, Alicia responds only harsh and painful comments and a harsh statement about her condition here just because she is forced, and has no intention of being her friend at all. But sooner or later this intention will change ... (That's all I'm going to say :) It's really one of the most moving movies ever, and it's one of the darkest and most disturbing movies. In fact, I think I might associate this with "American History X "Equally worrying and moving at the same time ... <br /> <br /> Warning: Watch this movie at your own risk !! It contains very cartoon scenes and pictures! Excellent movie and criminal less than appreciated! I feel so ashamed that I am the only person I know about!
