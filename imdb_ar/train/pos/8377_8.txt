My friend and I have nothing special about robots. So I try to find movies that contain robots. This movie has robots. Large ones. They overcame the reindeer and rushed from each other, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. It's really wonderful. You have to forgive this movie with its many shortcomings and try to appreciate just what the director and his crew of professionals can put on the screen while working with a clearly narrow budget. It is very hard to hate this film. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional wrestlers! Make my smile my friend. That's good enough for me. Particularly noteworthy is the veteran actor Paul Coslo: as the obsessed Russian villain, mercilessly defending his helpless opponents after they have already surrendered or complain that their proximity to the bar has caused the vodka to taste "like blood "(The line that he delivers in the dialect of Bella the demoralized Lugosi with a tasty camp), who obviously has a ball and takes great advantage of the film whenever it appears on the screen. This is a neat little flick worthy of its cult reputation.
