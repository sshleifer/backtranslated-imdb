Rosenstrasse is an impressive story of courage in adversity. The Rashdoch women find that their Jewish husbands have been imprisoned awaiting deportation. One of the aristocrats who had been released from her family, Lena Fisher, found herself among the mob, as did General Godarian's sister. But rank and privilege deserve no special consideration. <br /> <br /> She will not learn to serve the Reich as a prisoner whose husband is in Ostravaunt. In one of the finest scenes in the film, the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband. <br /> <br /> For fear that this is a typical German brutality, we in America today are desperately asking Mrs. Bush to arrest Goldstar Mothers (mothers of US servicemen killed during the fighting) because their presence is aggressive. Little, unfortunately, has changed over 60 years from the monastery of Fuhr to the monastery of Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his eight-year-old daughter, Ruth, survived the escape. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena Fisher hesitates at first to take Ruth in response in a way that we take as a typical German. Even the brother of Lena Fischer, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who understands and opposes the Holocaust, warns Lena against it. But Lena chose to adopt the idea with an American insurgency until she renamed Ruth, the name of the most famous melodies, Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends on Rosenstrasse but Lena mourns: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter began searching for her mother's past and met with 90-year-old Lina under the guise of writing a personal history of war. <br /> <br /> I've seen it interesting that Hannah wanted a lot to look for the family but never realized the fate of her last known grandfather who served at the Ostfront.
