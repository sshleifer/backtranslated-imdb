No, there is something else! <br /> <br /> Since every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion on I, II and III and because this view is biased because we lost much of the atmosphere and original tripartite characters, I will mention the good points of "Gidi's Return" And a few bad points corresponding to the introduction. Of course, I loved music, special effects and both, but that's what we've been discussing too much elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we got in the original trilogy and in this particular film: - a strong environmental concern - anti-military attitudes - fantastic visions about a serious matter and force - nice creatures - a smile of Harrison Ford - a killer scene: near the end, when Instead, Feder looks to his son and to the Emperor. The deadly bolt of bolts reflected on his black helmet. When he grabs and betrays his master to save Luke, he risks his life! Oh, boy! <br /> <br /> What is wrong with INMHO prequel: - The entire "human factor" element that the original team was able to push forward is missing - power seems to revolve around superpower and some confusion, not about wisdom - Too many Jedis at one time and lots of light Sabers on the screen - The inexperience of a few actors often threatens the cohesion of the plot. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you enjoy the theory of power as explained by Webby (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read some books about Buddhism and the forms taken in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> Star Wars magic, IMHO lies mainly in the continuous spiritual heritage of master to his apprentice, from father to son, despite difficulties. "De mon âme à ton âme", (from my soul to you), as Bejard will write to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
