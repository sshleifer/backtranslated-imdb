A gentle young mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) collides with an abandoned child in the forest and falls in love with her instantly. He is generally supported by the sheikhs in keeping the child, although the local singer (Kara Seymour) does not think much about the new family. A little girl designed for hiking and an evil salesman (David Stratharn in his creepy) has parallel stories converging in a fateful way. It is a charming slice of life in Ozarks in the same context as "Where The Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". The three were shot at their location in those beautiful hills and covered the lives of simple American people - but not simple minded. The minimal language is strong and the violence brief but pointed makes this family viewing fairly safe.
