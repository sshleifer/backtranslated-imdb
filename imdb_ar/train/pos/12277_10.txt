Perhaps the best book by Isabel Allende is the book "House of Spirits" describes an alternative Chilia history, this history is full of magic and the mystical veil, in addition to a kind of grief everywhere. This film combines a wonderful team, in addition to a great artistic direction, with a text line that can not contain all the quality of this book. It is unusual for an almost unknown country like Chile to be represented as well as in this film, whose only sin may be to be very high, and because of this the illiterate audience is left slightly displeased, mostly because of their very little understanding.
