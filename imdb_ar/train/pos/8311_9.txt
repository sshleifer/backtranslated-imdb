I really liked this movie, it was good, the actors were fantastic! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many classical singers, is very good at his job, when you see him in a musical, you know he will be good! I would suggest that people watch this movie, which is very warm, sad and special, if they want to know more about Richard! Excellence! Fresh!
