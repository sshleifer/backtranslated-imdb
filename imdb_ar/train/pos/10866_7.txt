Johnnie To's ELECTION has some great music about the opening credits? The design of the opening credits are also gentle, the scenery of Chinese characters and those Asian mobs swearing or uttering some sacred things; as a matter of fact the whole flick is a good record. I found around to Bishop Seraphim Segrest and I was very keen to watch a movie to. The story of the Aramean godfather, it uses a game of puzzles of elements, violent facts of mob life, the race for scepter, the real details , And as with Coppola, we are expected to believe that some morally glamorous mobs are titled, cute and lovable. The offerings are amusing and reasonably colorful. <br /> <br /> The election has been well done in the fun and somewhat opulent style of Hong Kong fare. The bitter end, genuine, direct will scare the children.
