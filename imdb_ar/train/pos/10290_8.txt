Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work since The Truman Show, and was pleasantly surprised by some of his recent works "Hey Hollywood - Look How I Can Behave Well!" Disappointed box office. It is great to see Jim confess and accept his power. Will not receive the Academy Award but the film itself will last longer than many of the Academy's "Granted Films". It's at the top of the picture in this latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrie, Freeman and Aniston do a great job together - comfortable in their comedies, a wonderful comic timing, and obviously enjoying themselves together but without "Mom - see how funny I am" kind of comedy. The real surprise was Stephen Carell in the image of Carrie's foe (Karel's Fame of the Daily Show), who moved away with some of the best and most extreme scenes of the film. I have laughed fiercely at Karel over anyone else in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can expect that the religious nuts in the United States will be mounting on the treatment of God, but the whole point of the film is true to all the major theological beliefs - we masses of protoplasms try to get our lives short by exercising our free will. Without a complaint without children, this will probably become a target for people of poor priority (who know the species - the men who decorate the golden hours on Sunday morning and the late TV and sell prayers to God). Again, about 0.5% of the country will be interested and 80% of the media will report it. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is a purely entertaining film. Each audience wonders with laughter about what they will do, and a good feeling at the end of the film. A walk on any main street in America must confirm that God has a great sense of humor. What is the best comic genius to remind us of Jim Carrey. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, C. It's great to get back to you !!
