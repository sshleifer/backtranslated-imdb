It's a wonderful film, and it shows what our government wants for other countries if we do not like their government. This is not bad for Reagan and Bush in first place in South America, but the United States still does not deal with other countries like this. These films also show that the American media are publishing government propaganda. This is exactly what they did with Aristide in Haiti. The reason for this coup against Ch√°vez did not succeed is the election of Chavez with more than 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This is not just a political documentary, it's going to be a great movie if it's a drama, it's amazing that it's true. <br /> <br /> The other author lies when he says, "Chavez takes over the airwaves," private media are working on Chavez's propaganda all the time.
