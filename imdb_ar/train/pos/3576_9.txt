Frankly, I find this film very frustrating for my personal benefit. It is very frustrating to the end. There is no way I can justify a judgment on any character who did things I did not like (well, except for the disgusting personality of Frederick Forest). But it is still very frustrating to see people behaving this way, and to put walls around themselves when a word can break the ice and promote healing. <br /> <br /> A shocking tragedy hits a family in Montana. They think they lost one son, but it turns out that they lost 2. The key is that if they communicate and face their sorrows together, they will not end up losing their second son forever. <br /> <br /> But they can not just. There is something that prevents this family from sharing their sorrows. Some families retreat to silence and resentment, while others point to the fingers of blame (then go on and deceive their poor pregnant wife by seducing her dead friend ... that Andy's really a snake!) The family that does not threaten Arnold somehow is his grandfather (Wilford Premly). Grandpa seems to be able to talk to the boy without provisions or even children's gloves. He seems to know what the child thinks, even though Arnold does not say much these days. It is really a blessing for a poor child to get someone to turn to. No one seems to be aware of the fact that Arnold may be in shock, or in denial, or that his way of grief may not be the same, or at the same speed, as they expect. It is very easy to judge and feel angry and feel that someone is "made of stone" just because he does not grieve in a way that we think he should. <br /> <br /> The story is very calm and natural. You will not get some stories fueled by the spoon or some of the solutions felt by Hollywood. I was very worried by the fact that this child was so guilty that he felt it necessary to sneak several hundred miles to apologize to Andy's little wife for something he should not blame himself for. Arnold may have killed his brother by mistake, but no one is responsible for the end of the marriage, which was apparently bad anyway, except for the two men in the marriage. It's just a stupid luck that Arnold did not get into the car with a pedophile or a killer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Claus are both frustratingly effective because the parents, who somehow can not find themselves to communicate with their son, know what is going on. Jason Brisson, whom I've never seen except his childhood favorite called EXPLORERS and a creepy ghost story called LADY IN WHITE, did an amazing job like Arnold, a wonderful performance by a child actor. <br /> <br /> Apart from being a bit slow at times, STONE BOY is an excellent and very frustrating movie.
