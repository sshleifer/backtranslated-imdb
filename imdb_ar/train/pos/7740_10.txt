It's rare to have a flawless film like this. It's really one of the best, most organized movies I have ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, with regard to each of the three main characters differently. The film weaves an inner net of drives and double crosses that are full of you and refuse to leave. In addition, the slow romanticism between Kevin and Faye moves like anything you've ever had on celluloid and you have the ingredients of an ideal film. They reveal the romance of films like "Titanic" as they are vulgar cliche. If you're looking for a movie to watch while folding laundry, that's not it. You have to commit yourself to this film. You can not have a conversation while jogging inside and outside the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot of it. Unless you think the movie "Titanic" is the greatest film ever.
