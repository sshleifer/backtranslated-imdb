Yes, it's too nostalgic to watch the first episode because this is the only episode I've ever remembered. I enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the exciting shows we have now, this offer seems lame. But frankly I like the "less violent" part of the show, and the story line has more of a new content now. I thought it interesting to have Airwolf and JAG in Belisario a similar theme - the main actor (Hawke and Harm) is looking for close to MIA (my brother, father). I wonder if the personal life of Robert Bellisario mimics the theme of these two shows. <br /> <br /> Q - Does anyone have pictures of the Hawk Cabin? I love this cabin (somewhat like my dream cabin) which is one of the sights I remember about Airwolf.
