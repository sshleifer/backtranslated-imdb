I simply do not tire of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was extra so I was involved from the start. They kept in touch with John and helped promote the film in both the cinema and now the DVD version. Even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross-channel phrases and various places throughout France. FREEBIRD was written and directed with a perfect mix of fun and dangerous moments as well as choice. Only Phil Daniels can fit into the role of Grouch. Great honor to meet John and the actors at the next prime minister's concert in January. Anything else you want to do John just ask, either email or phone, you know how you understand me. Sue XX
