This movie is simply incredible! I was expecting something quite different from the film I had already seen. However, it is very insightful because it indicates the aggressive nature of the human race and its association with animal behavior. Let me beware of the readers of this article who are easily insulted because of the highly sexual content, because the explicit sexual nature of this film looks like a kind of pornographic images. It even has a scene very close to rape. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sexual art". Every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit in the 1970s, by the way. No one should forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go see it! It's worth your money and your time!
