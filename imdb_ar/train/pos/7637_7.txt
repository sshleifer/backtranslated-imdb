I like this movie although I do not like James Bellushi very much. In this film, you can already watch many big names in the rise, Linda Hamilton and Curtini Cox; Kane was already a great course. The plot in this film is simple. It's just like the movie sliding door. Yet it was said in a lukewarm way and loved comedy moments in it. It made me try to live my important moments in life, for example what if I brought this girl to a movie and not to the other and so on. Tells us that people around us could have played different roles in our lives if some were the exact details of change. It reminds us of what we wish for. Life is not always as good on the other side as we think; perhaps, what we have now is the best for us, all the things in mind.
