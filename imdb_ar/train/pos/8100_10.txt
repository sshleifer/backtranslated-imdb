This film, in my opinion, is in spite of its flaws (which I think are few *), an absolute masterpiece and a wonderful piece of art. <br /> <br /> What Mr. Bakshi did here is to create a completely beautiful film and showed his great talent and talent as a filmmaker. He does not receive 1/100 of the credit he deserves to provide a literally cartoon character to an adult audience. If not for Mr. Bakshi, I do not think the animation would have survived the Disney attack. What's more, with The Lord of the Rings, he created not only a beautiful animated film, but he made a whole new art form - unfortunately, he never got out of the ground. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about using rotoscoping in a movie (using live images that are used as background images and are often animated to use different techniques than what seems to be small amounts of coloring to the entire blown animation). But I feel that people who complain about it simply can not accept an unusual technical form. No, this is not a Disney cartoon. No, he is not really alive. No, it's not "cheat" - it's a very new, wonderful and wonderful art form. Something new, so new that he feels quite at home in a wonderful story like "The Lord of the Rings". Bakshi's pioneering use of this technique makes life in the middle ground extremely accurate and dark, in particular, the darkest Tolkien creatures, particularly Nazgul, are achieved in a way that traditional animations or live events are incapable of accomplishing. <br /> <br /> The scenario of Peter S. Beagle (relying very little, as I understand it, on an early draft of Chris Concing) is a very faithful adaptation of Tolkien's work. Wherever possible, dialogue is used directly from the novel and feels that it is in its homeland in the world that Bakshi created. There are several cuts made to fit the first book and 3/4 in a single two- and 15-minute film, but there are very few changes in the film's story. There are some holes that were better filled: the re-processing of Narsil, the Galadriel gifts, and the Huorns at the Battle of Hornburg, but again, with the time constraints he had (the longest moving feature already in history), these are certainly understandable One wonders how they can be explained in a sequel). <br /> <br /> There is also the interesting result (one of my favorite) for Leonard Rosenmann (who also recorded Barry Lindon and Star Trek IV (the result clearly based on his work LotR)). It is blatant and daring, and I dare say, it is perfect. It is self-contained as a triumph of the orchestra, but when combined with the images of a movie, it introduces a whole new world of symphonic perfection. Away from the typical fare of Hollywoodland that leads to the shutdown of many people. <br /> <br /> The voice actors are wonderful. It is worth mentioning that John Hurt in the role of Aragorn who beats the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The design of the characters is wonderfully unique, but not often to everyone's taste. But remember that it is the Adaptation Manager's duty to show you what he imagines, not what you might imagine, so that Aragorn achieves a distinctive Native American appearance and Boromir appears in a Viking-inspired costume. Perhaps this is not what I imagined, but I can only salute Mr. Bakshi because he showed us what he "saw". It should also be noted that he spent a long time with Priscilla Tolkien in developing characters' costumes for the film. <br /> <br /> One distant word - a trip to the Ford series, in my opinion, is one of the most beautifully accurate sequences ever to be captured on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid of slowing him down for a moment, and his brilliance is evident through the incredible tension that can be built. Lack of Bakshi's artistic ability and the stunning work of Tolkien in this sequence to a glorious peak has not yet been equated. <br /> <br /> The latest DVD release (2001) by Warner Brothers, is largely unavailable. While we can offer our eternal thanks because the movie is finally available in wide format, the package is less than the additions. How glorious it was to have a comment on the director, and was able to see 20 minutes of additional footage removed for the theatrical version. Other tasty additions are live motion shots that were later collected. Also in the DVD version is the awesome audio commentary at the end of the film, which is a departure from the simple vocal comment that took place in the final frames of the film. This version is outlined and presented badly above the musical peak of the result. <br /> <br /> Of course, the greatest tragedy is that the sequel has never been made. We will never be able to see Bakshi's interpretation of Jandor, Schillop, and Zamir, and the crevices of death, Owen's battle with the King's witch or confronting Gandalf with him. We will never enjoy the Bakshi images of Denethor or Palatir or the paths of the dead. It is a disgrace that goes beyond all this shame that we will finally accept the glamor of Peter Jackson and Hollywood, the release of motion films about these subsequent events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I assume that even better than the lack of a cinematic version in all. <br /> <br /> David
