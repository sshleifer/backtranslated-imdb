I watched this movie, by mistake. What a small gem. This film was made in 1956, and resembles, like a late seventies film. It is actually better, more restrictive and more correct than the Blue Soldier, for example. Environmental and anthropological tones are ahead of time. Underworld cinematography is fantastic and terribly realistic. More than Dances with Wolves, The Last Hunt was able to convey the appearance and appearance of buffalo "killing fields" in the late 19th century. Maybe because those in the film were real killing fields. The film was filmed during legal forestry directed at buffalo executions, so the animals you see are actually released, the bones are real. In conclusion, a very low western masterpiece, acted beautifully, directed and fired.
