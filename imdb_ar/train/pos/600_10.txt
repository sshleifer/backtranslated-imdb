Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who wanders a thousand miles to visit his father, the absent millionaire Ray Wise, in a vast wind-powered, wind-powered farm that ends up tangled in a dangerous network for his planned young woman and the tempting father's wife from hell. In a problem for the already dysfunctional family. An exciting, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable television - where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, behaves intelligently, and is tightly located from the script that makes you nibble your nails. I can not believe the reviewers who have never really liked it. It's a classic undiscovered game.
