I like jack jokes such as "Clich√© is ..." or "On top of cliches of man, black, oily skin, kinda nervous ...". It's just hilarious! Daniel began to catch up with him! Good thing Jack is no longer in the team (in some way) or else he could have been a whore! I love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I must admit), the characters are wonderful, the actors are wonderful, I've started picking up facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Telik ... all that is theoretically possible and exciting ... Oops! What I go again! Sorry, I've also started picking up features from Carter, and all this driving my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, in conclusion, I think it's good for three more seasons or so, especially if they continue to fill the episodes with all the humor, drama, movement, etc. !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
