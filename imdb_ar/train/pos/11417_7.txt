This movie surprised me as a project that has a lot of correct ingredients, but somewhere along the way they did not meet together. I do not know who made it, but it has a simple sense of Disney. While parts of it are improbable (for example, when a teenager moves to a public position) and tends to prevent taking the story seriously, there is a healthy dose of normal life (whatever it is) to maintain balance and perspective. Acting is fine. Strangely enough, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Azali and Frankie is somewhat stifled. It is interesting to see how she has to work hard to maintain the balance between her best friend and her grandmother and her operators: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player myself, it was very painful to see Frankie trying to keep her on a team of boys, but she does a good job of showing the struggle she is facing. I read somewhere that she was not really a ballet dancer, but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dance not only natural but also beautiful. In general, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star Misha Barton did not achieve the level of realism we saw during her performance in "hashish dogs" and "lost and delirious", and her small performance, but shocked the opposite Halle Joel Osment in the "sixth sense."
