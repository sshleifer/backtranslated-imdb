If you are not a beginner to the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you're starred in Star Wars or Star Trek, there's a realistic and attractive science fiction series you can indulge in. It is not the simple robot story that the boys in the world save, but perhaps the complex and attractive space war drama where the line between "good guys" and "bad guys" is certainly less distinctive. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of the Azurouha, a na√Øve young boy living in the neutral space colony. Spends days in daydreams about mobile suits and plays war with his friends. During this series, each "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman, is certified. In the end, Al Al learns a few hard lessons about the reality of war, suffering and sacrifice necessary. <br /> <br /> I loved this OAV series, with its wonderful designs, which includes a story and characters loved. I recommend this series to anyone who likes SF realistic anime, or for those who believe anime is just a silly or sexy entertainment.
