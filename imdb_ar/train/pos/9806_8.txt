I agree that DC must be on DVD. I saw this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon in the Hudson Talbot film. It was good to see Americans working overseas in London in the financial industry for change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role he did. I can not believe that the show lasted for only 13 episodes. I loved William Armstrong as a fervent friend of Hudson in this series. When they broadcast this show in the NYC area, it was always late at night or at rest times. Offer less than 1 hour. I felt that this show had to last longer but the changes made in the second season made the show less really interesting. I did not care about Sylvia but I missed actress Julia Phillips Lane in the previous season. I felt that this exhibition took chances and often worked. They showed the Americans who loved and chose to live in London. American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the cast rather than making them all British. I loved watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt that this show had to last longer. I sometimes felt that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have moved the cast to New York City and could have been a great success in America.
