The family revolves around two families after each other's blood. <br /> <br /> Verne Sahi (Amitabh Bachchan) is a crime organization based in Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once accidentally kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Arian (Arieman), brother of Shekhar outside to avenge the death of his brother. He kidnaps the Fereen Sahi family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has one turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs entirely to him, since the expression is more important than his dialog boxes. Akshay's little role has put him on par with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bumika Chuala was doing in this film. <br /> <br /> There were some loose points in the text; like; Amitabh was found to be the most wanted criminal in the city and still walks the city without any scribbles. The kidnapping of his family also appears to be vague. How can a family like this big don have no security cover?
