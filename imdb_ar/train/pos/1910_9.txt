Oh. that what I think. Sure, he was still a great show with John in that, but I personally think he is better without him. <br /> <br /> I love to live with CJ and the grandfather at home because they are very fun. <br /> <br /> When John was still there, I did not laugh too much as I do now. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that no further effort has been made. (I do not think ...) because I like to see some new stuff. <br /> <br /> My favorite character should be Rory. Poor Rory is almost always out. It is always about Bridget or Curry. What about Rory !!! ??? Frankly, this is a great show and for anyone who has never seen it, you have to go and watch it. I guarantee you will laugh almost. Well so chuckle.
