Beit Meidler is divine again! Humorous. In love with a playful. Capable of reaching out to your tears either with old jokes with new dresses or just old songs with ever greater strength. All in all singing new stories, singing good old / perennial power like "rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "Wind under my wing". The best way to appreciate Miss M is always the inspiration - because this is the best thing after that. I have been strongly recommended by a combination of magic and appreciation for adults and the child's perverse desire to push all boundaries!
