After dipping his toes in the giallaw bath with the wonderful movie "The Strange Vice of Ms. Tail." Like his earlier effort, this outstanding star George Hilton is one of the stars of the tournament, who was to participate in Martino's "All Colors of Darkness" the following year. "Scorpion's Tail" starring Luigi Piestelli and Anita Strindberg, who will continue filming an unhappy couple (in a pompous way!) In "Your Vice-President in a Closed Room" (1972). (I just love that title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they launched this! However, this film boasts the elegant direction that Martino fans expect, as well as the twisted plot, some beautiful killings, and beautiful Athenian imagery. The story this time concerns a Hilton insurance investigator and a journalist (Strandberg, who looks like Farah Voissette's smarter and smarter sister) who is involved in a series of horrific killings after a plane crash and a million-dollar legacy by a beautiful widow. I really thought I had discovered this picture halfway, but I was wrong. Although the plot seems perfectly logical in this giallo, I had to watch the movie again to appreciate all the finer details. The highlight of the picture, for me, was Anita's fight with the killer in the end, breaking into a particularly suspicious house, and the wonderful battles on the tile surface; lots of bursts in this film! You must thank the wonderful people at No Shame on another gorgeous DVD, with nice translation and interesting extras. I have turned into a wonderful collection of Whotta, in her constant quest to recreate these lost Italian gems from oblivion.
