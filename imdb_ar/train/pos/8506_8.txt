I really like owning the film because the reason for watching it in the first place is that I'm a bus driver and while I saw this movie, I was driving this model bus. It was only (during the trial of the murder after about 15 years) that I vaguely remember that OJ was one of the stars in it. I have been looking everywhere for this film to no avail, since watching it in the mid-eighties.I liked the movie, I do not watch the thrilling movies normally, but after reading the summary in the television guide and watching its beginning (on Though misty), I stayed at everything.
