After reading the Diamond book, I was a little disappointed in this series, but overall, it's very helpful. When reading other comments, it is convenient to know that "culture warriors" work hard, watching "attacks" on "Western civilization" under each carpet. <br /> <br /> Is the diamond a little promising? Certainly. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing at all. The term "guns, germs and steel" is used at every opportunity apparently during this series. We got it, after about 10 minutes first. <br /> <br /> Is the diamond a bit simple (in the chain)? Certainly. The Spanish part of South America is particularly amusing, intensifying some very complex history until "smallpox, swords and horses", and the complete conquest of South America ends in about 15 minutes. But the point is still valid - these things actually (but not fully) contributed to the Spanish's success in the face of established cultures. <br /> <br /> Does he preach against Western civilization in any way? Both. Not a word. Not for my ears. All he says is that luck has played a big role in determining which cultures are progressing more quickly, not that luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that checks your health for your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all factors influencing how societies succeed or fail, this series provides a useful explanation for historical evidence.
