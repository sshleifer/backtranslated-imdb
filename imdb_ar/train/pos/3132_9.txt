I watched last night with low expectations. Reasons, I do not usually like "make-to-TV" films and rarely liked "reunion" films. But the Los Angeles Times critic seems to like this, so I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did. it was very good. Adam West and Bert Ward are reunited. But, somehow, they acted like themselves "Batman and Robin". They were being held and not taking themselves, or this film seriously. The film begins with a search for a Batmobile designed by George Paris, stolen by someone before being auctioned to an orphanage. While looking for the car, they also remember the series they did together. This is said in the flashback. It has been done well. The actors they got, for the smaller Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. For a television movie, it has come to the precise details of their real behavior inside and outside the screen. I give this 9/10, I loved it so much.
