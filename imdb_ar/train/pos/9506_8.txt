A solid, reflective, slightly miniature piece turns into a wonderful humanist sequence that transcends the dramatic representation of the screen. This quiet little story will make you feel fascinated - if you do not have a lot of problems with different Spanish dialects ranging from Mexican to Peruvian, use Marisa Paredes the most authentic Iberian Peninsula! Garcíadiego accomplished an ideal adaptation of the novel: even the great maestro García Márquez should be proud of her wonderful work. And hats on Arturo Ripstein who effortlessly coordinated the whole effort in Jewel, Ruby, and refined it very, very elegant, very delicate, touching ..... ..... <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - He is still waiting for his pension while continuing to live in his dilapidated wood, which lives deep in the Colombian jungle (yet he was filmed elsewhere, not in Colombia) with his fighting fighter and his wife (in this order?). That's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, much more .... this movie is raging music. <br /> <br /> I should see this little poetic piece again as soon as possible. Worth the top of 8 out of 10, which is quite high on my domain. <br /> <br /> These are not Hollywood light commercial things.
