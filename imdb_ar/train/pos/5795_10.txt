This movie is my favorite all the time! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie! I am always above the moon, watching it! This is a movie you should actually watch, even if you are not a fan of MJ, because of this movie, such as Captain EO and E.T. Ghosts, a little history of cinema and music !! This wonderful film, from Michael's feather, must be !! And: Smooth Criminal, is really the wonderful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life !! Thanks Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to hit this planet. He's a good man and he always shines in your eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you do not know this movie, watch it and do not miss it, because that would be too bad for you if you miss it !! A highly recommended film, for every movie lover
