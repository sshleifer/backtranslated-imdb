I actually thought that this is a comedy and sat watching it and expected to laugh my ass. Soon it became clear that this was not a comedy, or at least not Jim Carrey's. What we have kept watching is the characters - the film begins with some gloomy and turbulent people, gathering in an attempt to fight one of their fundamental fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. We began to gradually enter their lives, witness their troubles, guess their ideas. <br /> <br /> In fact, it has made it look much darker than it really is, and along with the series of events they soon bring some light and hope in their lives. <br /> <br /> Maybe I did not watch the film if I knew it was not a comedy but a drama, but I had a good time and enjoyed the story and I do not mind spending about 90 minutes with it. <br /> <br /> Many films deal with isolation among people in the Western world, and this film shows how people can meet and help each other. <br /> <br /> "If in the light of the day of death you meet, Let it pass you and leave, do not lose it, it is your gift from the sun ...
