First, I sing this movie on VHS more than I had to buy it on DVD, it is in my favorite movies at all times. I have read the book, but I really believe that the film is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow like Emma and Jeremy Northham where Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. It was fantastic! <br /> <br /> It's a movie 10/10 !!! <br /> <br />
