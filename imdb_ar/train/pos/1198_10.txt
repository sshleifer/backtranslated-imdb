Like most other reviewers I saw this movie for the first time (on TV, not on the big screen), when I was a teenager. My father always considered this film highly recommended to me at the time, and I must say that it was not only right, but that film stayed with me forever for more than two decades since I first saw it. I've seen him two or three more times since then (just a few days ago I gave her another hour) and did not lose anything of his influence over time. It's still great and worth to see the movie! Man Man Beckenba is considered one of the first and best West later, which had a realistic view of life in the Old West, but LOST HUNT is barely known as the best film, and it was even sixteen years ago. In fact it was probably three decades before his time, or maybe still ... <br /> <br /> Despite serious thinking and certainly seeing a hundred Westerners (I love this genre), I can not remember any Western like Dim and depressed because this one. Two men are committed to each other, partly because of hatred, in part because there are no other options, surrounded by beautiful Lady Padgeit, a paralyzed old man and Cheb Enyane, leading the life of the buffalo killers until fate comes to them. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen this movie will not be able to forget its end and the last frames of this gem. When the camera moves away from Mr. Taylor, the white buffalo skin appears in place (on the tree) and echo the past, when all hatred begins. Mr. Taylor got the buffalo, but in the end he got buffalo. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the best performances for all participants, the Smart Book and the Great Dialogue, it should also be noted that LAST HUNT was filmed in a wonderful way; I rarely saw a well-filmed Westerner (part of Anthony Mann, All of which were beautifully filmed), that all the sites are cleverly selected and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well. <br /> <br /> The director BROOKS is actually a wonderful storyteller. Mastery of dexterity! He has made several truly wonderful films and has been successful in almost every imaginable genre, but even in such a prolific career, LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best works, if not the best he can do. /> Definitely worth a higher rating, compared to the 7-Ride enjoyed by the country's high.
