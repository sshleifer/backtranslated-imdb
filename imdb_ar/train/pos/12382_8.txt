Here's a terrible flick in the middle of 70 around the Hell Gate in New York City that just happens to be an old brown stone. There seem to be a lot of gates of hell, but of course this unintended model decides it needs space from her boyfriend / fiancé and so she happens to choose one, which masquerades as a beautiful and affordable apartment. Meet many strange neighbors and attend the cat's birthday party. When she meets with a realtor because she hears strange sounds at night from the top floor, she discovers that she and the elderly priest are supposed to be the only tenants. Stop! Then who are all these eccentrics? Her friend (a small lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts walking around and finds that things are not as they seem, not through a long shot. This has some nice, gentle scenes and the idea of ​​the old, squeaky people who are her neighbors "sometimes" is not what seems to be somewhat fascinated. A little decent praise and even a show of people who are less than usual in the end make this a good time, and while I have seen this many times on television, the unpolished DVD version is of course much better. Not a bad little horror flick, maybe a good companion piece for Scorched Performances. 8 of 10.
