While I was originally hesitant to jump on a "Lost" wagon, I inadvertently caught one of the episodes at the beginning of the first season, the Polar Bear episode, and I have enjoyed my full passion ever since. Exhibition, that is. Not polar bear. So he carried me with me while he gave a lot of pompous and semi-coherent praise as much as I could. <br /> <br /> "Lost" takes a simple idea of ​​a commuter journey full of people who collide with an island desert, and gradually adds an extraordinary depth to its hypothesis by exploring each character deeply and tirelessly? What drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the stranded island acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they are fleeing something (Sawyer, Kate and others) or communicating with spirituality (Luke, Clare). But the "loss" also highlights the island itself and the mysterious horrors it contains ... It seems that they are all oddly connected. <br /> <br /> While television actors are not well known for their brilliance or dazzlingness. The cast of actors, most of the actors in the film "Lost" are, in fact, wonderful actors for their parts, showing heart and humor in their performance. There are also many eyeglasses, but not generally Hollywood-type plastics like most television programs. All characters look very real and they are very compelling to watch. Their reactions are rarely prey to predictable bravado, simple arguments or melodrama cheese (although it is uncomfortably secret) ?? These people try first of all to survive and any treatment that appears minor. The realism of these characters facilitates a plot already carved out. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... imagine a tree like a mold plot, then branches as a sub-section (in this case, one branch per character)? Well, Lost adds the twigs to each branch and then the small twigs to those twigs as other storylines. If you are a brother / sister of one of the main characters in the memories of the past, you will get your own story. If you are a DOG you will have your own story. Unless the writers can all weave together at a glorious peak in the end, they prepare themselves. I am very concerned that there will be some disappointing slowdown in this offer, because I'm sure most people will. <br /> <br /> But assuming that writers do this, "Lost" is probably the best show ever made for television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
