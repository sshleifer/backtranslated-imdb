Well, so it might not be the award-winning film "Best Film of the Year" (except for the great soundtrack I think won a few awards), but it's a really great movie about "The Kid" And the surrounding events that live in Minneapolis, he plays his music, the music is very wonderful, in my opinion you have this soundtrack, it is really classical music, it sums up the 80s and feels great fashion, and the film itself presents a nice plot. You love Prince / O (which I do) of course.
