That makes me proud to be Britain. This is by far the most extreme thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gattis, and the beautiful Reese hair scissors. Insufficient enough, this horror comedy is perfect. Iconic characters and bizarre phrases, "Hello Dave". It is a comedy that everyone should simply watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the Gentlemen Guild is that it is always always there, always pushing the boundaries. You do not need to rely on phrases (unlike small Britain) to be funny. The fact that the league is ready to kill their famous iconic characters, can show us that they have steel balls.
