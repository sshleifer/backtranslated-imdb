There are many police dramas. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it is the old basic theme of "good versus evil". <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult start of Anne, a senior recruiter, in a police squad stationed in the Baltic region. No attempt was made to spark the police. They are really on the ground, sometimes cruel and unforgiving, Ann on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Despite all the rules, they sometimes prevent information that is condemned in bar searches and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie. Not one to relax you. There is not much optimism. The police appear to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more hostilities, more murders, family disintegration and more distressed children. Let's face it. This is the world in which we live. <br /> <br /> As time goes by, Anne becomes more involved with the police and families she investigates. The only real warmth in the film is provided by Benny, a 12-year-old from a broken family. Ann has her own way of restoring things. Turn a blind eye to the theft of Benny and try to help him as much as possible. I was surprised although she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. It made me wonder whether it was about the father or his special needs. After all, the film shows that she was in desperate need of a loving partner and children. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it gently but not my idea of ​​entertainment one evening,
