I saw this movie in the theater, I was quite impressed with it. Then again, that was when Claire Dance was a good actress, not the arrogant, arrogant whore haunted by Hollywood today. Anyway, I was shocked by this film as one of the most realistic and realistic friendship films. How far will you really go for your best friend? I was touched by tears in the end, and I still hear tears when I see them now (I own them). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my close friend and cried how much I loved her. It's a great movie to watch with your best friend. However, be prepared for the almost certain conversation, then go to you and wonder if you do something like that for her ....
