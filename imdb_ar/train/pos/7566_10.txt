The name of the young lady is Bonnie (Bulay). She is attractive, she seems to be living a decent life, but suddenly she is snatched in an incomprehensible way from her home and her life by Evel Dodd and Feltens and Sindy Henshmen. Now she has no idea what the hell is going on, just that a handful of armed people seem to want her death ... and she'll die and not even know why. <br /> <br /> By God I hear whining all the time. Now that the production of this content has become very cheap and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal members of their own, there will be no one to ensure a quality level! We are on our way to drowning in crap! The only people who really believe this are people who have not seen any movies or read any books recently - because we're actually carrying out a dead man in nonsense. People like Ferrari and Rodriguez who put lies in front of these ignorant and jihadist by throwing $ 8,000 on the table and making it ... Well, what I'm saying is the best flick about anything I've seen in cinemas this year ... but you have not seen any clicks in Cinema this year. I've seen the box office. You're staying away in droves. It would be better for you to get a copy of this, spend twenty minutes in entertainment, and continue your life. <br /> <br /> It's pure entertainment. You enter, like Bonnie, with lots of questions and where the whole thing ends. The entire idea has been implemented in many ways, but not in such a compressed time period and is not free from this kind of concentrated delicious weapon. You're there for the atmosphere, ambiguity, and guns. That's all - that's all the filmmakers promised, and they're going to present it. <br /> <br /> It is heating the black holes in my heart to believe that this has been on such a budget. We've got a lot of independent films here, but we rarely see anything polished as it is short, and we've never seen a movie of the kind that looked good. Hell, you can hand over these two guys MI: 3 It might attract me to watch it. Privilege Bond. Hell, nothing. No, in fact, the best of it: I would like to see these people make their own advantage and stay in hell away from Hollywood. Whatever the film industry kills, it is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> The best Indie we've seen in a while and the most effective calling card we've ever seen. The DVD is $ 20 and has bonus features from the ass. Go take your movie ticket budget and put it in that direction instead.
