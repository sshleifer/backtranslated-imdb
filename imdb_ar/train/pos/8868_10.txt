I must say that higher education is one of the best 3 films I have ever seen. They have a wonderful crew, and the director is just as wonderful. Singleton shows how life can be in the university. There are 3 main story lines: African, American, and gays. I have been interested in all the stories, but the story that sparked my story is the story of Christine, fighting her feelings for another girl. The end was fantastic. After watching the movie 25 times plus, I still cry. I had been given this movie 11, but I have to settle 10/10.
