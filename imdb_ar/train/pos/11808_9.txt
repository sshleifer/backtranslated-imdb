At one end of the 1980s, Warren Pittie starred in the epic Reds epic about the founding of the Soviet Union as seen through the eyes of the famous radical John Reid. It was both a deep film and an entertaining message from all the stars. At the end of the decade, Warren Petty devised another kind of epic in Dick Tracy not claiming to be anything other than entertaining with a whole host of best actors just about to spend a great deal of time clogging him under tons of make-up. <br /> <br /> Both Reds and Dick Tracy could be from the same person talking volumes about the extent to which this man is a player. In this film Betty succeeded in getting all the famous cartoon characters out of the tape and put them into one original script. <br /> <br /> Big Boy Caprice is taking a step to really eliminate competition. The film begins with the dismantling of the followers of Lips Manlis in a depiction of the Valentine's Day Massacre, and Lips himself is installed on a cement coat. But Caprice's moves make him a target for Trecy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a mysterious third-person anonymous person is looking to drop Caprice himself. Will this mysterious crime be solved? <br /> <br /> The fun spirit of this movie is truly contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorfino, and William Forsyth. Armstrong made themselves grotesque to look like cartoon creations by Chester Gould and then indulged in a carving exercise the biggest slice of pork, you should love this movie. <br /> <br /> Pacino got a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor award, but none of those players could have gotten it, he just gets Pacino like Big Boy Caprice on most of the screen time. Only Beatty plays it directly, and it seems that others are playing it out. Dick Tracy won the Oscars for the Best Art Design West, and the best song by Stephen Sundheim and introduced by Madonna, soon or later. The fact that he was even able to get someone like Sondheim to write a result of this film only shows that Sondheim wants to have fun. As for Madonna, The Material Girl does more than hold on to all these heavy weights, such as the Burnath Mahoney, the club's flute singer. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, Dick Tracy was moved to B images and worse on Saturday afternoon series. The only thing that competes with this all-star magnificence is the radio broadcast made by Radio Armed Forces during World War II that got Vinyl. Can you believe actors such as Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and The Andrews Sisters? Try and look for a recording for that jewel. <br /> <br /> Until then, the classic comic strip of Warren Beatty will work on the big screen magnificently.
