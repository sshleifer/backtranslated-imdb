Remember a lot of reviews on this page that this movie is a bit dark for kids. This depends on the child. This is not a film for the age of 2-6 years; it is directed more about 8 years and the older crowd. I saw this movie when I was 10, and I absolutely loved it. At that time, most of the animation films were too childish to my taste. This film deals with more serious issues and therefore has a slightly more emotional impact. In this movie characters can die, and sent to hell! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes in which characters risk their lives. Good people are not always sweet and quite nice (like other cartoons). They have "real" motives, such as revenge and greed, but also empathy and friendship; explaining that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
