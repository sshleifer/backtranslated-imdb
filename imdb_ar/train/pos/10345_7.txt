The only other review of this film as of this history is truly the trash stars and the film itself. I usually like reading user comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I do not know much about. It is unfortunate when there are not many comments for a particular tile, because when there is only one review and the film is defeated unreasonably, you have no idea what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I do not know where all the toxins from this movie and stars came from. Both Douglas and Blondell were talented and attractive who usually reached, even when the material was not the best. I found the movie and the shows enjoyable and fun. It's not one of the best classics of all time, but it's fun and funny - more than you can hope for in most modern movies. If you love these stars, you will not be disappointed.
