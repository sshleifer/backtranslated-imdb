Alan Chapt is a good actor, director and director, but it may be trivial misguided to get an "idea" about a story that probably made them flocking in the aisles when Aristophane was still learning that he was "pre-" "beyond" c. But, as I said, young women are a good actor and can do magic when they need it. I also gradually overcome the hatred of Charlotte Ginsburg who also led to a wonderful performance. If you insist on knowledge, the "plot" is about the man in his forties and more than just content. This does not sit well with his mother and five sisters, and to get them out of his back, "arrange" with the sister of a colleague to raise - for fifteen thousand euros - as his new girlfriend, let the romantic to attend the fruits with a wedding and then jilt it, and thus get it from the hook. It's natural that they end up together but along the way, there are some subfields Benidick and Beatrice, and all the things that were considered to be ninety minutes are very painful and well done at the French box office so there is no supplement is not available.
