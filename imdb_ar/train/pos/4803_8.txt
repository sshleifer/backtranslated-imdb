It is difficult to find a very bad historical drama based on the lives of any number of British kings. Just take a respected British or Australian representative, make things look beautiful, and guarantee you a formula for Oscar success. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is no exception, so you get everything right, the movies are amazing and beautiful, with soft lights, lush colors and fabrics. Starring Emily Blunt in a role she can finally play. The film begins with Victoria's 18th birthday and moves through intrigues and issues surrounding her eventual ascendancy to the throne and her famous marriage from Prince Albert (Robert Friend). While Victoria is astonished, she has moved like a chess game from a variety of parties where she finds her voice and voice as one of the most influential rulers in Britain. <br /> <br /> The area is fairly typical, it is developing Victoria's relationship with Albert which makes the film a little more interesting. I confess: I have a degree in history with a specialty in the Victorian era, so I am a bit attached to these numbers. Despite many flaws as governors, Victoria and Albert were among the first dedicated leaders to improve the civilization of their people. They left their legacy in the arts, in public health and education, in Victoria's conservative views and a culture of mourning after Albert's death. But these things were only hinted briefly during the film. <br /> <br /> It has been well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but were respectful of each other and were not usually seen among kings in arranged marriages. Even if it happened behind the scenes, their pictures were certainly one of the most famous ones. Both Blunt and Friend have the right kind of chemistry to achieve the famous marital justice, the right combination of restraint and despair. It is a different love, it does not usually appear on the screen, especially in this kind of movies. It is encouraging to finally see a relationship between men and women on an equal footing. <br /> <br /> But we do not see this love enough. While filmmakers try to contain the relationship between political decorations, they do not build the kind of momentum needed to keep tension high. Also, without going into the most important public work of the husband, things feel a little oblivious and superficial rather than intimate, and sometimes confusing. It's not a big problem during the movie, but then, the effects fade away quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you've just seen, despite the perfect performances of the shows, the most famous blunt that captures the famous King expressions. <br /> <br /> Because as much as he tries, Victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks some of the brilliance that he might take from solid to classical.
