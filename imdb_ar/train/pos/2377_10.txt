I have waited a long time for someone to film a sincere copy of H.G. Wells Classic, "World War." Timothy Heinz did it finally! I could not believe how good it was! From acting, to fashion, special effects outside this world, I can not say enough! It was fantastic! Exciting, intense, full of first class performance through a first class crew! It must be seen as believed. I certainly do not. I have read all those negative comments by others and I can not believe what they were saying. We have to watch a different film, huh? And those real bad comments made by this guy vepsaian, man no matter what he is, well, he does not know what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, Mr.. Heinz.
