I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see people refer to her as a comedian. It was amusing at times, but really, it was not very funny at all. If I expected to be a comedy, I was disappointed with the film, but with my expectations, I found it enjoyable and charming. Perhaps that was because, as an engineer, I dealt with the protagonist. You are less interested in irony of capital or work, and more in the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man less interested in the cash profit of his invention than his vision pays off and enters into production. He is very heroic when he refuses to take big money and hot women in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting to compare them here with the Jurassic Park; me, compare it to The Fountainhead.
