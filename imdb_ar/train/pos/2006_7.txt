At this point, it seems almost unnecessary for Jon Bon Jovi to perform a strong and smooth performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was previously identified by the acclaim of critics he obtained in other films (The Leading Man, Not Seen Back). But, if anyone still wonders, yes, John Bon Jovi can work. He can act well and this is what is expected of him. Easy to separate Derek from the person watching the strikes on the VH-1. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will not watch a horror film. I came to expect them to focus on the loophole instead of dialogue and conspiracy. What happens most in this film is that there was a viable conspiracy. This is not intended to become the focus of the film and does not have the disturbing real quality of films with high technical impact budgets. So, fan fans may be disappointed, but fans will not enjoy the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike a movie like U-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bomb, we'll get a chance to know "the good guys" and really care about what happens to them. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this film, this will never happen again, these few cases can be tolerated knowing that vampires could have been a continuous chain. /> <br /> Is this the best film I have ever seen? No Is it a good way to spend about two hours in entertainment? If you are somewhere between the horror horror type and horror horror fans, this movie is suitable for you.It reaches a happy medium with influences and story that balance each other. > <br />
