The envy is not as funny as I thought it would be at first, but after some reviews I read that I find it funnier than people give it props, right now it's not a short film like zoolander or dodgeball, but between Stellar and Black Jack are doing well with each other, Great as always, so the story revolves around the character of Jack Black, who invented a spray that makes Bo the dog disappear, and Ben does not want any part of it, but when he makes the product, Jack black rich ben stiller begins to see envy. The Jack Black has the most entertaining and best movies under his belt, but if your fan either recommends it The we are still flick funny and laughed my ass several times, because a fan of Ben Steele strongly ID to say that this is less fun but still wonderful,
