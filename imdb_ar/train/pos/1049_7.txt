The sisters will be released in law on March 24th in Sweden. Good occasion for our friends from the Nordic countries to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in GÃ¶teborg along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinoto, "Director in Focus" of the festival. She gave a major category, highly appreciated, to tell her about her way of working as a documentary filmmaker and informed the public of the special circumstances that led to the shooting of the sisters in the law twice: the first edition was lost forever so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different End. There was a very terrible problem, in this case, to create a very powerful movie capability.
