Director Douglas Cirque records again through this, the grandfather of all the dysfunctional family films. This amazing, epic epic is a masterpiece that beautifully combines all elements of circus sheets and strategically puts them all into one film. The writings of "Written on the Wind" clearly influenced the television series "Dallas" and "Dynamite" in the 1980s, mainly a long version of the next night's soap. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, a brilliant and skilled role plays Lucy Moore, the New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unaware of both, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) adores the quiet and sexy secretary. They all return to the Kyle family's home in Texas where they meet with his white sister Marley (Dorothy Malone as an Oscar winner). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from romances to battles, this is a camping trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight his feelings toward his best friend's wife, but Marily tries to sleep with everyone because she can not enjoy her real love, Mitch. Kyle beats everything, he's helpless, but Lucy ends up pretty much. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love him? This film refers to one of the best Universal films and one of Sirk's best director. Some of the dialogue is very amazing and visual metaphors are thrown in every way - the wind theme in every wonderful place. The cast was fabulous, although Bacall was not fully used despite receiving the upper bills behind the Hudson. It was reported that the loss of Oscar Stack destroyed him. He considered this his best performance, and he seemed not too happy to lose him. He has shown great performance as an alcoholic. What an amazing movie! This film proves what I've been thinking through the ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
