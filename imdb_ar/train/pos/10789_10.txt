When I was young, my father got the film to watch it. I really liked it and watched it over and over again. Even when I was in third grade, I still watch it from time to time. I recently saw him again, just for nostalgia, and although the show was not for my age group (I'm in my late teens), I still find it amusing and educational. This presentation teaches good lessons about imagination and communication with others. Some parts found very amusing. Also, this gallery does not contain any bad content, so you can leave the children alone with this offer and do not worry about their choice of any bad language or at least. I would recommend this.
