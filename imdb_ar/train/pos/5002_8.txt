I was honored to see some excerpts from the original Aardman presentation for this show in the UK. It has always been fun and always funny. Nothing is lost in the translation - it is as new as the people interviewed - whether the text is written or not, as is common, is beside the subject. It's always entertaining. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations show a great imagination in the characters used for each sound, and the only aspect that I might like more about the show and its concept (animosity between pandas, pigs that discuss fear of needles, and monkey painting). The regulars also grow up, like teenagers on horse and donkeys from Maryland, and most married couple (parrots, insects, cats to name a few) and the character expressed by the child, I have come to dig the ferret! Monday is finally a day to look forward to.
