Well, but just plain stupid. Not bad for a horror / comedy film. I read how people converted it with the release of Michael, and this is a good trick in my opinion because some adults hate the horrors of horror and when they see this will raise their interest in horror movies like this or perhaps (unprecedented) horror (perhaps comedy) Uncle Sam, I will have to see him About the rental of this movie or buy it, but the second film is better than that, but I bought this movie on the VHS of Amazon and got it on November 21, the day before Thanksgiving. Worth four dollars, l.o.l. In this film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
