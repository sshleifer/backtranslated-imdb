A good movie with strong performances (especially leads). The film is about two American girls who were arrested along with 6 kilo heroin at an airport in Thailand. They were thrown into prison and one of them signed a confession. Bill Pullman plays the role of a lawyer who tries to get them out. All they have to do is find Nick Parks who puts the drug in one bag of the two girls. So far for the story that is not original (contain many similarities with the best return to paradise). <br /> <br /> The beautiful photography of the representation and Newton Thomas Siegel makes this film worth watching. 7 of 10.
