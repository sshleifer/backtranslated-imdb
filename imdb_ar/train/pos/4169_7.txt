Yes the budget was a bit low, but this movie shows love! The only bad things about this is that you can tell that the budget of this movie will not be compared to "Waterworld" and although the plot was good, the film never took advantage of it. The powerful offers of everyone's thrill makes it worthwhile to watch a rainy night.
