For anyone who has seen nothing but Disney's beautiful Beauty & The Beast, or even the imaginative fantasy of Jane Cocteau, she will be surprised by this 1975 French version (but with a director from Poland). The plot relates to a French family disappearing from the aristocratic class that marries a well to make the English family. The main catch is that the groom carries an old curse on the family. The movie also includes several flashback sequences (potentially) that explain the family curse. From the opening credits, to the end, it is an almost non-stop fun entertainment trip, with some explicit and very graphic sexual content (hence the X rating of the film in the United States in its initial presentation, which is now not appreciated). The somewhat prosperous film in the ruling class is likely to recall one of Bonwell's trips to similar territory. If you have a really strange taste and did not feel insulted by the "forbidden" material, this film may scratch the itch.
