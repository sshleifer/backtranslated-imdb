I really enjoyed watching this movie. Like most people who have seen it. I was not sure I was getting it. Webby Goldberg Comedy is very funny and has done a lot of funny movies. Meaning sister acts. <br /> <br /> But this was not really comedy. It's a drama with comic moments. So if you're looking for a laugh, keep searching. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around a black family moving from a cute neighborhood in the city to a middle-class neighborhood. I would say more, but she thinks it will spoil the film. This film not only deals with race relations between white and black, but also about relations with the black community. I think it's worth a chance. If you're not really interested in seeing another movie about race relationships, this is not a good movie for you
