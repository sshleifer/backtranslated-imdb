drilling! I would say to anyone even if you do not want to see Metallica as "a kind of monster," it is a tap-type documentary about one of the world's greatest bands acting like mentally ill children during a kind of breakdown. It's fun and wonderful. The same goes for digging! A film about "Dandy Warhol" and "The Johnstonstown Massacre", two bands from Portland begin a kind of musical scene in the original city just to become one of the huge bands and one fell on the other side of music history books. From the beginning, the two bands pull in opposite directions only on their ability to make decisions, whether good or bad. The film was filmed over seven years, and sometimes it is painful to watch. We see a meteoric rise in Dandy to fame (thanks to the Vodafone announcement!) And Johnstown's downfall from the instigators to the rioters. As the difference between friendships becomes more intense, tension intensifies and clashes in several points with arguments and even battles on stage. All this half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is watching with the utmost ability. As I said at the beginning, you can watch Metallica even if you have no interest in the band. drilling! On the other hand, it varies slightly and is much fun and much easier to watch if you have transient interest in any of the ranges. Still a good film and a testimony not to participate in the band of encouraging it as a career path. drilling! It is a crazy trip on the tails of rock and roll and a good example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous.
