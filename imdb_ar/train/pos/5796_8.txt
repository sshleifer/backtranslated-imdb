Moonwalker is a fantasy music film staring Michael Jackson in different sections. I will hold each section separately. <br /> <br /> The first part opens the movie with a music video. The Music video is a concert by Michael Jackson, which performs the song "Man in the Mirror." The video also features pictures of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first part was a good choice for opening the film I liked the song and I also love editing historical characters. I liked the message in the song. I give part I 9/10. <br /> <br /> Part 2 shows Michael Jackson's start from five Jackson to his solo career. I made the montage I thought was good, loved the animations they put in it, and loved their choices of songs like "I want you to be brought back, overcome, thrilled, you can feel it and the way I feel." The only thing I wish to be a little better at one of the songs in the montage is "We Are The World". The reason behind all that you see is the rain drops and in those droplets pictures of Michael Jackson and the Celebrity Choir, but it is a little hard to see the choir. Otherwise the part is still good. Give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> Part 3 is a bad song. You might think it's Michael Jackson's bad music videos, okay yes and no. This part is a music video clip but it was prepared by Kids. The portion was nice but it was not as good as the other portions. Give it 6/10 <br /> <br /> Part 4 is a short film called Claymation Music, which happens after a child releases the bad "Speed ​​Demon". The short story revolves around the hunt for Michael Jackson by his fans and the press disguised as a rabbit and riding a motorcycle to try to get away from them. The clay in the chase sequence was wonderful, but some parts of the film were Claymation characters that look a bit fake when they interact with real people. Also at the end of the clip out of nowhere comes the costume of Michael Jackson's rabbit to life as he dances with her. I loved dancing, but it was like nothing. Give it 8/10 <br /> <br /> Part 5 is the award-winning Michael Jackson video "Leave Me Alone". The music video revolves around the media that raises her nose in Michael Jackson's personal life and Michael Jackson feels he will not leave him alone, no matter how relaxed he is. The music video is really talking (but keep in mind that this happened before the child was molested all about rumors about it in the 1980s.) But I did not feel that this video should be in this film because it is a children's film and I do not think the child will understand what it sings . I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Part 6 leads us to the main story of the entire movie "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays the role of a gangster who uses his powers to star as a criminal character to protect children (including Sean Lennon, John John Lennon) from Evil Mobster's film Mr Bigg (played by Joe Bisky). The part I thought I really finished the movie especially when I danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a bunch of criminals. I also think that the special effects were good. The odd thing about the category is why children hang out with a man who has grown up and never explained it. Joe Bisky's character also talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean why you talk about drugs in a children's movie. The other wisdom was good. My classification for this part is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Part 7 is the last part of the entire movie. The movie ends with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of Beatle's "Come Together", and then watching Michael Jackson sing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael had a good cover for "Come Together" and I think it was good to put together a group of good singers with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie and I think it really highlights the children's imagination. The film is almost fictional, like Beatles Yellow Submarine. If you love Michael Jackson and you're on a movie with a lot of creativity, that's the movie. My overall rating for this film is 8/10
