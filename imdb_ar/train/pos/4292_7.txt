I did not know anything about the film before watching it and I thought it was a "non-expectation" factor that helped me hold on to the beginning and later I liked more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The setting was fun, weird but interesting. The story had loopholes / hops that I think they bring up a little audience. There is no fantastic soundtrack in the background, creating a "romantic" atmosphere. But they did not care. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Louis was simply brilliant. There was some strange chemistry that could not be explained and which I could not resist; I fell in love with it and I am here, writing this review. The gentle portrayal of the actors was wonderful, and I think it is the essence of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a romantic comedy every day. In fact, not every one of us would appreciate it. I had to sit for a while and then slowly began to understand the little things I did not pick up at first. I can not guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you do.
