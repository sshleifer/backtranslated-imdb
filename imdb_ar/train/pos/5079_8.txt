Well, I would first like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of the Tamil prayer and its translation almost means "protection." Khakhee points on the other hand to the uniform color of the police (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> Also, the Tamil film industry is full of purely commercial ventures, and any film from Rajnikanth or Vijay will see this statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is a wonderful movie with fantastic soundtrack. Definitely quite spectacular in the last scene, especially loved the finish (which is definitely unexpected!). Gore very often at times, but certainly this is a wonderful movie!
