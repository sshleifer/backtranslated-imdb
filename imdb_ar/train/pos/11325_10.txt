When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I must say that among all the shows I have seen, this program tops everything. I had to see this show, and that's what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I liked the animation, and all the fighting scenes were fantastic. I must say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber and Archer and of course I love Elijah as well. Of course, all the episodes on the folders were interesting, and very fascinating. Another thing I must say about the series is Michael McConnoy (famous for Transformers, and others) playing Berserker's voice. He has a cool personality. I have seen the whole series again before watching the final volume. So if you see something good, then you see this offer, it's the best.
