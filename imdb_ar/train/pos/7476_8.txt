I can really say that I felt that the film was in its proper essence as the mind games entered the dreamer's reality on the surreal side of the future Tom Cruise faces. I did not care much about Tom Cruise's skill, but I must say that he seemed to be impressed at every point in the film ... not only because of the attractive story but also because of moving himself to the leading character ..they merge and then speak and beauty. However, I must say that this film does not come under the "average weekend flick" you choose at random and see with joy; it carries strong feelings and personalities, so do not wash these things with beer and corn pops up. Definitely needs more.
