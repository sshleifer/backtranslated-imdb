I just saw last night, it was broadcast on Canadian Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's "Emotional Eye" series. It was recently screened (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many other films. It's a great movie. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, where they were there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves in the middle of events when the coup was revealed. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and most of all, let the story unfold as it happens. They have, of course, their own ideological point of view, but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, the background and the history leading to the coup. As a sponsor, it is not a pioneer in stylistic or aesthetic sense, that is, I think, the way it should be. What we got to know what the press should really be "compact". What we see is a wonderful story of a country struggling for democracy ... A charismatic leader cares about his people ... A story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests gathered to lead a coup for a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historic event When it unfolds. <br /> <br />
