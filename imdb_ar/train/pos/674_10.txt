While for most people watching the film, this will be a bit of an issue, but among the hundreds of films dealing with magic and magic in one form or another, this film is likely to be the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> From The Golem to The Craft, it seems that the subject raises endless interest in the film industry. Most of the films touched in any way do so childishly (for example "Witchboard", a real piece of absolute garbage in every way) either take the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for the special effects of cheerful villagers or the charming "cf". The subject often appears in a hysterical religious context (in various film-oriented revelations, the Antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of New Age style practice). Rarely does the film seem to show at least some passing experiences with magic because it is practiced in real life, but at best the mysterious show in these films can be described as allegorical rather than literally or symbolically ... or just not quite true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie again several years later tonight. I've seen it before on VHS. It's a dark and moody piece, and after watching it on a DVD, I would say that you have no intention of watching this movie, watching it on a DVD, and not watching it on VHS. <br /> <br /> The dark and moody beat the VHS system, but the movie in the DVD takes a completely different tone. I think weir push the dark sides of the deliberate method, but when the film is converted to the lower color medium of the VHS, this will exceed the edge. DVD returns the movie to life again and I see it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've seen it for the first time, I realized that the magic treatment is very good in this movie. It's hard to go into all the reasons why I do not care about taking the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has curiosity, anyway, if you want to see what it is in real life, this movie is absolutely right on countless levels. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is not, you have wasted a lot of time reading this point.
