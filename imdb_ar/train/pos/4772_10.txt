This film may be the most influential and progressive film I have ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a wonderful piece of art can give me such an almost religious experience. One suddenly realizes that there is a real meaning to life. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this film I was skeptical. I thought the plot seemed fabricated and I was afraid the story would be normal. But as a fan of David Lynch, I decided to do it. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the film, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema and felt that I had really learned something important about life. <br /> <br /> This is not the typical David Lynch film, and it was very surprising in some ways to make such a film after exploring the film. The dark aspects of human nature for many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he is capable of conveying deep feelings and deep human insight because I also thought he was able to do so well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors around them and I think The Straight Story is his best yet. 9.5 / 10
