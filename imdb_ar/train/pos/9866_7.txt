I just watched Ice Age, a very funny and nice-looking movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are pet and attractive but what really glitters is the digital set design. <br /> <br /> Inspired by more traditional animated films than reality, the designs give you a truly nice truth that searches the world for stunning color use. Sometimes the touch of reality (especially the water was impressive), but nevertheless, it is a fantasy world based on reality. Including much of the vast landscape in particular helps to reduce the cost of submission. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with artistic brilliance, this film shines with the effective uses of technical knowledge. <br /> <br /> Enough is technical chatter, the movie amusing, family friendly, and sometimes very funny.
