It's the weekend I've seen this funny film. I really liked it. All the children are nice, and they remind me of my childhood with this stupid thinking. It is a real entertainment film for a group of families on a weekend night, which can make a lot of memories and teachers. Kid humor always works. Nice acting as well. The story is simple but cool shooting. Nice job for the director to find a way for the baby. When it comes to children's film, I think of "12 and Hold". Another one this year but the side is different from the child's world, which is real and cruel. good job. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every child and family needs. Note I think Twitch is the Nemo voice of "Finding Nemo".
