This is a film about life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I challenge anyone not to shed tears at the end of the film. This is more than just a tear player, it's an engaging and thought-provoking drama with excellent performances from all actors but Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. Seven years later, I am struck by the fact that Locke is still unknown and that Washington has directed only one film. However, regardless of slow deceleration, the story of the experiences and plight of this foster child and how it still affects him in adulthood is the kind of film that stays with you for a long time after I've seen it. Like many Fox Scouts, this was a great success and he did not get the cash he deserved. The scene in which Anton finally meets with his mother sums up the film for me, there were many ways that could have been done and everything could have been schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but Washington hit its right tone exactly the word and could only shed Tear, while simply asked me why. Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most exciting cinematic scenes I've seen.
