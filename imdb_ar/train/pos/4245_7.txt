If The Girl From Missouri is familiar, it should. That's because Anita Los who wrote the script here also wrote the classic classic blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this film, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men by means. <br /> <br /> That means guys Jean Harlow. She leaves a retail house on the side of the road run by her mother and her father's wife because she decided that the best way to get an easy life is to marry her. Her talents as a chorus girl are limited, but she will be able to trade in this beauty. <br /> <br /> She begins her return with her boyfriend Patsy Kelly to receive an invitation to a concert hosted by millionaire Louis Stone. But without Jean's knowledge, Stone had a final toss before he did the same for the money he did not owe. Is still floundering with some papillae noted by fellow millionaire Lionel Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Lionel is so amused that Jean puts his eyes on his flirtatious son, Francois Toon. After that he was not amused and looked forward to shaking Jean from climbing the family tree. <br /> <br /> The girl from Missouri entered the production stage amid adaptation from the blog, so she was censored. I have a feeling that we have seen a more important film. Jean Harlow is still a smaller and older version of My West than always appreciated. The girl from Missouri is a sad reminder of the huge loss that the film world suffered three years after her death. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Patty Kelly casts a big tinge. Harlow is undoubtedly influenced by Kelly's successful short shorts with another famous platinum blonde, Tilma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry that Patsy had with Thelma. Todd will die a year later in a strange accident / suicide / murder that has never been satisfactorily explained. <br /> <br /> Do not miss The Girl from Missouri, she's a glamorous glamor, she must be of all those sparkling jewels.
