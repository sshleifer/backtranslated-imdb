This was another message for World War II to soldiers and allies to be cautious about spreading rumors. These cartoons were called "educational" because they are a combination of dangerous messages along with a funny master character called "Snafu Soldier." <br /> <br /> We all have our imagination, along with fears and what do you have, and this is what happens here as a soldier. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with "five". You can start panic and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people would believe them. This includes a loss of confidence in your country and in your country, as shown here in this cartoon. A good way to lose the war is to defeat the enemy. Still being done today. <br /> <br /> "We have lost the war," declares one of the top boxers near the end of this caricature. Amazing how some Americans have not yet learned. This cartoon may be 65 years old but it is certainly relevant today. As I write this, there have been two terrorist bombings in Europe today, and some people still believe that the "war on terror" is a sticky slogan. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The famous author "Dr. Suss" uses the "hot air balloon juice" standards here to deliver the above message. With Theodore Giselle (his real name), you know that the rhymes will be clever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is hilarious here, but this was not intentional. You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that existed there during World War II. People forget that war can easily end with the other party winning. Time was tense
