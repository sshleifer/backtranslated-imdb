This scene contains scenes that came back to me in the strangest time - that intense scene with Mr. Mkirge tells Mrs. Milandes that someone spoke to him with witnesses that the girl who pushed the window from a woman fits his description - one that revolves around - the way you keep the signal By name --- in the Greek accent "Mr. Muckerji" - then when Boyer discovers that she has just taken her name and gives her a final blow on the side of the head before she died --- the joy! "Fools - fools - all my life" ... etc, you get a point .. I have to buy this one. I love the representation of Dan Seymour - usually playing the role of some foreign sultan or police chief and appeared in Casablanca and many wonderful images.
