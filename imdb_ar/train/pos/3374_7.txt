"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 1970s and is still very convincing even according to today's standards. Although there are flaws and a little dated, the appalling touch and environmental outlook (typical at that time) are still very concerned and provoke thoughts. The quality of this film exceeds the majority of SF's contemporary clicks because of its strong presence and some intense sequences that I consider classic. In 2022, New York City is a frustrating place to live, with a large population, unemployment, unhealthy climate and complete scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston plays superbly as a policeman investigating the death of a senior executive in Swellent and stumbling upon scandals and dark secrets. The script has sometimes sank and does not really peak as a big surprise. The atmosphere is still very tense and strange. The sequence of riots is really exhausting and easy and one of the most terrifying moments in cinema in the seventies. Edward J. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there is a big (but very modest) supporting role for Joseph Coton ("The Blood of the Baron", "The Ugly Dr. Peps"). This is science fiction in my book: An Inescapable Nightmare and the Evaporation of Humanity! No fancy space ships with hair monsters attacking our planet.
