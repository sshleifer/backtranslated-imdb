The short essays were insightful and very enjoyable. It was strange to see many soon to be famous actors when they were very young. The presentations and attention to detail were great to see. <br /> <br /> Note. In the film, source materials need not be compatible with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile. The novel "Small Ethics" is strange (or shy) only in the eye of the beholder - fortunately. The story's content - which is well informed - can overcome time, subject, or place. <br /> <br /> Ironically, there are a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or the latest habits of the present age. The introduction of "little ethics" content - sometimes - can provide a nonexistent dimension.
