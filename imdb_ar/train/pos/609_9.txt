The story of a young man living outside a fictional world walking inside to retrieve a little of the fallen star only to find the star alive, young and beautiful. . The kingdom, which is about to die, said the king had unleashed competition for his many sons to see who could retrieve the rubies first to be king while the trio of magicians wanted to sculpt the star and use it to keep it small. These three threads of the piece are intricately woven all over the image, mixed with good effect, wonderful special effects, some strong emotions and humor as well. Stardust is a fun movie and has some entertainment shows like Claire Dance as a star (I can see her in her face for a while) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I can look at her with full magical powers for a longer time). Charlie Cox as the leader of Tristan is credible and credible, and we get some good work from a group of players who play with the children to be the king and they are constantly trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Fleming, and Robert Everett play their part well in both life and death (I love this whole thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the killer of death father and watches a funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his short minutes (beautiful feet). But the real force in the film is Neil Jiman's novel and the text of his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates her own myths and her own world and works.
