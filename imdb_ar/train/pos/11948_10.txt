"Match Point" and now "Scoop" convinced me that Woody Allen was not only making important movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson was the right member of the team), but that was what she had known for years: focus on the neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays the role of journalist Sondra Pransky, set by the wizard Sid Waterman (Allen) in his hidden box, where she meets the ghost of the dead reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial murders that plagued London were committed by millionaire Peter Lehman (Hugh Jackman). So, I got to know him, well, I do not know how much I can tell you without giving up. But I can say that this is probably the film I've been craving for years. There is his unique style everywhere of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> So, you're sure you'll love this movie. If there is nothing else, you will love London. But mostly, it is just a hilarious curse. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, I have this love.
