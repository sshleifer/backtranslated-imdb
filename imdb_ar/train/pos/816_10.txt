First, I would like to say that, while I know about Star Wars, I'm not fanatic. I do not know the number of chromosomes owned by Wamp Rat or the extended TK427 family. What I know is: Star Wars, all the movies (less than Episode 2), I picked up something magical. It's hard to say what, Lucas has found and pressed him boldly, but he works. Star Wars is more than just a movie. It's an idea. <br /> <br /> How, you might ask? I will explain. Star Wars touches the most universal stereotypes, good against evil. It does so clearly, deeply, so that anyone from any environment can understand. The sixth episode works very well, ending the epic conflict between the son and his manipulated father. Yet, with the addition of the perkle, it reveals more about the puzzling back story. Suddenly, it is Darth Vader in the lead, and viewers realize it's a story about Anken, not just Luke. But even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to everything. It seemed real, as if the capsule had fallen from the sky in the lap of Lucas, detailing a historical account of a very distant galaxy. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the Star Wars game is much higher than the norm, and I must admit, whenever I see them, especially this, I feel very small. I feel as though I have entered a world in which good and evil are clearly defined. I feel very shaken when I see them, feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could have hoped for.
