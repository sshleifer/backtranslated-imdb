Look, this may be one of the best films America has to offer to the rest of the world. To hate this film is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the early 1980s was a period of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost certain. From this confusion came hero, Ace Stroker. Ned Beatty's performance in this film showed that he was never again to be represented as a one-dimensional victim in the wild. NFL is an inspiration for everyone. The on-screen chemistry between Bert and Lonnie is based on clear comparisons between Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go to see this movie tonight!
