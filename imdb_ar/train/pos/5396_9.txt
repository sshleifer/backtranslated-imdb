Simple and meaningful and provides an emotional punch. I regularly walk in boring short movies, and it is always good to find something that has a simple and enlightened message, without any excuses or guidance indulged in itself. <br /> <br /> A boy in school must attend a lesson when his friend plays absenteeism and is given the most important lesson in his life, only to find that when there are not enough copies to move around he should share it with the bully school. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films that show children or actors these children hold their own and it is reasonable. The soundtrack completes well the passion of the piece and the film works well.
