I had just arrived to the thirteenth when I first saw the series, and I watch it again, on DVD, after more than thirty years. The pictures on the opening credits never left me. I have influenced my view of the world and its people. My parents had been with me long enough to watch the series with me, and we had always discussed the program afterwards. This has given me my love to study the history and the highest grades I have received in the general exams of our school! <br /> <br /> The voice and communication of Mr. Lawrence Olivier is never lacking. I feel that the people who passed through will feel that this is their account of the history of World War II. I can not imagine ever getting bored when looking at them. Perhaps it is now possible to think of a similar series of Cold War, although it is difficult to replace Sir Lawrence. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
