Compare some between this movie and delivery. Think of mice and men is more convenient. Our leading man, Heaton, definitely likes Spike. It does not matter and does not matter whether this is sexual love. That's why Heaton does not leave spike. He needs it. They need each other. As brothers, as one family, and their only link to humanity. The setup, script, minimum cast all add to a good movie. Frankly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But I was interested in what the filmmaker did with them. He did a good job with them. I spent some time wondering how the end will be in the form of mice and men. The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and interesting.
