For the scenes that come a long time after its creation, "Winchester '73" has something in common with "Casablanca". As you watch it, you feel that you are looking at a series of cliches that you encounter so much in this genre; then you realize that the cliches became cliches only after they were copied from this particular movie and that they were widely copied because the movie was too big. In other words, it's a great job. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is the joy to watch. The outline of the plot is fairly predictable, but mostly because you've seen it copied many times in subsequent movies, yet it still contains a number of transitions that surprise you. Dialogue, pace and direction are excellent. Stewart shines in particular, and if you are a fan, this is "a must", but it is not lonely in delivering a good performance. Remarkably, many of the most lines and / or intelligence go to lowercase letters. Because this makes these characters (much more) than cardboard pieces, it has given extra realism to the film. <br /> <br /> This is a film that has been remarkably underestimated and deserves attention. The DVD also contains an interview with Stuart that provides some basic information about the film.
