Most of the comments were positive, but I would add that viewers should also focus on groups. The group designer used many beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. Attention should be paid to. The film is characterized by characterization and rich symbolism. All gang representatives were thrown out - it was like seeing old friends and it was a wonderful treat. The dialogue was fun at times, but it was sometimes intimidated and I suppose it was supposed to be that way. This is a movie buff movie. Made by people, for those who love the mediator. Do not miss this one.
