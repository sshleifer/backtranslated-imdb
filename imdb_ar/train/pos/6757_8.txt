Dana Andrews stands in "Where the Sidewalk End" in 1950, in which Jane Turney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand also took part. Andrews plays the role of sergeant in New York City. Mark Dickson, a bad mood cop who has been in the past in trouble to hit suspects. When a man is killed in a gambling club owned by a gangster, Scales (Merrill), Dixon and his partner go to investigate. Scales casts blame on Ken Pine (Stevens), who left the club after fighting not only with his wife Morgan (Terni) but the victim. Dickson believes that the victim has won a lot of money and was killed as a result by gangsters. He goes to see Pine, did not realize that he had a plate in his head of the war, knocking him on the ground and killing him unintentionally. Now he must cover up the killing. As additional complexity, falling for Morgan. Her father (Ken Tally), who went to the apartment of Payne after seeing that Pine had hit his daughter, was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This Nuer is really wonderful with some good performances. Andrews, who is tough and contented, is convincing as a difficult but nervous investigator to stay ahead of his colleagues. The film combines him with his famous film "Laura", Jane Turney, and looks pretty as a bad-taste costume for men who seem to get used to getting lost. She does not know anything, she got another one on her hands. Ken Tally performs a wonderful job like her father, who invents his innocence despite some compelling evidence. Carl Malden is very difficult as president of Dixon. <br /> <br /> My only problem in this good-directed, accelerated and absorbing film is the end. Hollywood is pure, I put myself in the place of Terni, I doubt I will respond the same way. A simple critique of a film by Ben Hesht and directed by Otto Breminger. I did not find her as impressive as Laura, but few things in this world. If you love noir film, this is a must.
