Man, some of you have been cold. This film was a technical genius. Instead of looking for thought or messages to justify it in your reality, why can not you understand that it is a fictional work? a story. Entertainment, for God's sake (not pun intended). It seems to me that a lot of people here are trying to be critics of movies - and they do not do a good job. I was very impressed with the film and Bill Paxton's job at directing, so I would call him personally to tell him that. You know, if you're not trying to analyze out of the possibility of a story line, you might just enjoy the movie. I and all my friends did!
