William Powell is Philo Vance in "The Kennel Murder Case," a 1933 film starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Pallet, Helen Vinson, and Ralph Morgan. The display of dogs in which Philo, his Scottish dog captain, entered the background of a closed room secret with many suspects. Mystery is highly intelligent and convincing both complex and interesting. Because the talk is still small, the camera's work is somewhat static, but Michael Kurtz does a good job guiding the work. <br /> <br /> The support crew is excellent; casts the entire cast of the first-class movie. Many actors played Philo Vance, including Paul Lucas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde White, Edmund Lowe, James Stevenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William, and others. Powell played more (five times) and is the best suited to this role - very relaxed but dangerous at the same time. He had spent about 12 years in the film by then and began his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A wonderful man, a wonderful screen attendant and a wonderful actor from 92 years old. We are very lucky to have his films available on DVD and on TCM today. The Killing Case is a wonderful story and a fun film - do not miss it.
