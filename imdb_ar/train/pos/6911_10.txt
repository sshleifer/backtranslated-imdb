While the "spider woman's kiss" is described by Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unknown country in Latin America, this time he is a dictator in a fictional country of Latin America. Specifically, the dictator suddenly falls, so Julia replaces the president in the Broadway film (Richard Dreyfus), which depicts a film in the country. From there, Dreyfus must know how to be a dictator, balancing it with his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into a comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with it. No matter what they do in this film, they pull it. It goes without saying that Richard Dreyfus is one of the greatest actors of our time, and what we lost when Raul Julia died. Definitely worth seeing. As well as Sonia Braga (who took part in the tournament with Raul Julia at TKOTSW), Jonathan Winters and Sam Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: The First Lady is hot.
