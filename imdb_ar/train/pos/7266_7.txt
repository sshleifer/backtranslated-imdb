I remember a low estimate of a project like this when it was first released. James "Not Jim" is Belushi, a childish play actor, and a cheesy title in the John Hughes formula. Can not pay me to see him 15 years ago. But I was suspended watching him while he was missing on Sunday afternoon, hitting me on several levels. The fairy tale (Pretty Woman, Pretty Woman), very weak, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street - like the performance of Kelly Lynch, the escape. On the whole, gently pull some very nice strings. It is very hard not to fall into the story, develop a crush on Kelly Lynch, sympathy with James Belushi, hate her strong evil friend, and laugh at Curley Sue's lines. It has both ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the type of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time in this movie, it's worth it.
