"Purple", is really amazing. There is nothing like him, and I do not think it will be there. It cost the roller of emotion and pain that takes the viewer. The actors are flawless and the steering is fantastic. I absolutely loved it. A movie never made me happy. It's beautiful, that's the best way to explain it.
