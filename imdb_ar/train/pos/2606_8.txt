Maybe some people might consider this movie slow. However, this "slow burning" specifically allows him to have a profound impact on the viewer. Such a wonderful first scene: First, we can hear sounds. Finally, we are allowed to see the characters; finally, the camera slowly moves back to the side, and we see another character, a young man sitting there only, and he does not seem to even listen to the conversation or, at least, really care. The fact that this young man will be the lead role illustrates the film's strategy: to allow the character to develop and determine the environment surrounding it but without mentioning the points too much. People come and go and flow out of his life. Although most of the film follows it (most supporting characters see only when it is close to it, determined according to the relationship that has been preserved with it), we encourage us to believe that we are objective, so the director's touch is accurate.
