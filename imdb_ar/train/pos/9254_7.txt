There is no movie with Denis Hopper, Gary Bossi, Erika Ilniak, Tom Berenger, Dean Stoyle, Marilo Heiner deserves less than 5 ratings here. This is a lousy version of movies like 16 Bloca or the immortal Midnight Run except for the prisoner who is being moved here and it is very easy on your eyes Mrs. Elinayak. Tom Bringer plays a good role in another military well, and William McNamara plays his role in playing well. The plot on her face is ridiculous because I have lost the number of times that Iliak had to spend it. I ran away, but this is a wonderful movie, and there are wonderful films from all the actors mentioned above that keep the film going. This is not a really family film where there is some right and rare nude scene with eleniak but this is much better than some other guff types that have appeared at this time.
