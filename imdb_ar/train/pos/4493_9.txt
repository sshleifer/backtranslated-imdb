This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern England. He was filmed at his location in Bolton, starring James Mason as the father who represents the dominant power within his home. Or so it seems. The smart film based on the play depicts the intricacies of family life. Cast support is also wonderful, with many familiar faces lending support.
