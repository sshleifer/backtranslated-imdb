The first puzzle is to guess the original Wales movie format. This makes this adventure real - to see an incomplete skeleton and use forensic cinematography, imagine the beautiful woman that was once supported. <br /> <br /> If you do, you'll see and try out probably one of the best mystery films ever. As the mystery goes, the narrative is fairly normal: a simple transformation, one pair lurking in the red herring. <br /> <br /> What a miracle to some extent Willis put the story into an artificial eye seeing a dark, multi-faceted dark world. The first Nuer is real, but even darker. It's not a clearly twisted world, unless you're thinking about the camera. What we can see for myself is that someone created vocabulary that became common later. <br /> <br /> Despite all the celebrations, Kane achieved success because of the drama and the great story. The camera's eye was horrible, but experimental. Wales will go from there to explore Shakespeare's mystery and self-reference story with this eye. Othello and Macbeth began this period, and I consider them part of one vision. <br /> <br /> Noir stops here on the idea that people are not responsible for their lives, even a little - they are dealt with by random factors in the environment. So when this story is told, Wales has to turn the environment into a personality. Many characters as suspects in the mystery. <br /> <br /> Thus we have the famous lighting, the ban and the corners we know (and since then we have seen countless times). We have deliberately closed groups: garden, yachting, picnic area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and fun. I'm sure that what was made by the barbarians was a lot and lots of "external" narratives not dealing with the personality but with these exotic environments. <br /> <br /> My solution to the mystery is that the theater did this, among other characters' environments presented as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of black Irishmen (whom we know through memoirs and writing one scene in the Union Hall was an ambitious novelist) was not: the power of the human conspiracy (the garden or the civilized version, the courtroom) nor nature. (Picnic or civilized version, aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of deliberate whimsy by the gods for amusement. This is of course a subjective reference to what Welles does: putting these people (including himself) in hell on our whims, an issue confirmed by the Peking Opera with Welles anesthetic. And of course leads to theater where the environment is manipulated directly with perception. <br /> <br /> More about the self-reference: There is certainly a conscious comment on his relationship with his relationship in the near future. But I think there is a strong subconscious comment on his own mocking the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Surely Wales was equally tight, in the same way he was. This tension took the form of killing this film, leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> The poor Rita comes from China and links the whole thing, the Chinese theater, the expected rape from the top, and the loss of women. Invest in the environment behind everything.
