People expect at least fantastic when Steven Spielberg directs a film, and this film is no exception. Some of the movies I loved were bad at the box office, but I'm happy to say that this is not one of them (more than $ 9 million, which I do not think was bad at the time). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not ambiguous, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated film. I did not think that Professor Burg Aiz or his "scary virus" was too scary for young children (the target audience for this film), but I thought that what happened to the scary teacher in the end was very dark for the children's film. In general, this film is a fun and charming classic film that I loved dearly for years.
