After watching this film on the Fox Channel on a lazy afternoon, I can not think of the best way to spend a lazy evening on Friday and then give my year. Especially when you think of no user comments on it. Does not every film, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? This movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when watching a movie like April Love is to remember the time it came from, and in this case the late 1950s. Films were pretty much a happy way at the time. The cinemas were free of tragedy while the screens were full of wide-screen technicolor films to get people out of the gray glare of the evil middle in a box called TV. I do not know how many people were pulled out of the boob tube to see this one, but it managed to attract my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager sent to live with his aunt Henrietta (Janet Nolan) and Uncle Arthur (O'Connell) outside the country after being put under surveillance to steal a car. It seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their son (Jed Jr.) so it seems that Jed has lost his zeal to live. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick at the farm has been well taken out of his predicament. Story lines like that are what they are, and Nic and Nick do not care about each other of course. Jed then meets to meet with neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Jed immediately develops Fran, and of course it is not necessary to tell you that Liz develops a crush on Jed. Then there is the issue of Uncle Jed, a jog that turned wild and will not let anyone deal with him since the death of Jed Jr. Maybe you can fill in everything that happens from that point on your own, seeing how there are no real surprises. It does not matter, though, you'll enjoy yourself anyway. <br /> <br /> Once you get a clean babe picture, as a bad boy, you are supposed to have no problem with the rest of the movie. In view of this, Boone plays a great role in Nick's performance like Nick. Surely the role does not require much depth, but it is still good to do when you do not expect it. As a good actor, Arthur O'Connell is the best choice for this role. At first, it can not be accessed and cool, but with temperatures slowly rising to Nick, we see that he is a really good man. Janet Nolan is very enjoyable like Henrietta, who consistently plays the role of mediator between Good and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers and Hammerstein and gets few chances to honor her singing talent. As Liz, it's great to look at, great listening, and sometimes very funny. Dolores Michaels in the role of Fran, who is a little more in the lateral side, equally amusing. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love, is that there is no real personality to collusion of any kind on the screen. . Not the real villain is one in all. Everyone is very loved and you can only enjoy the movie. I honestly find it refreshing, like putting your problems behind you and enjoying a summer stroll with friends. Think of it as an old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a little more plot, and a wide Technicolor screen. The songs are a mixed bag, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing I really liked is that they did not back down on using blue screen backgrounds during horse race sequences, and they are more fun and a little exciting because of that. In fact, you will find the entire film beautifully illustrated and it was good to see that they did not skimp in this section. Chemistry between Jones and Bon is good. The best thing about it is how the hate is portrayed between Nick and Good where everyone tries somehow to earn respect for others. <br /> <br /> This movie and movie will not be confused. However, sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, one just needs a nice stroll in the garden, and that is what April Love is. <br /> <br /> My estimate: B + <br /> <br />
