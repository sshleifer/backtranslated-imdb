I think this film is good and realistic. You're used to watching "Motion" films in Hollywood, and using them as a criterion for evaluating this movie, you must be frustrated. This film is much closer to the real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and this is what brings it out of the ordinary film. I have no experience with the Swedish army at all, so I can not point to any errors in their behavior. But as I saw an additional "making", I am convinced that much has been done to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I recommend it to others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie.
