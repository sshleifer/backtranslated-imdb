I bought this game on a batch purchase from Wal-Mart. I'm glad I did. It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game. I thought the graphics were the best I've seen in a new movie / game. The reward levels were very tough! The sniper, who I think was very difficult, made me so frustrated that I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were a lot of people shooting at you without hiding or living to deal with them. <br /> <br /> The only thing I might change is the upgrade system. I have not noticed any difference from ungraded equipment to upgraded equipment, such as buying armor upgrades does not seem to make the armor stronger or more filling my life standard. I really love the Q helicopter. I think the developers have done a good job.
