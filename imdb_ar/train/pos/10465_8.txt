Until this early career, Capra was fully accomplished with his camera work and timing. This is a thin story - and quite predictable at times - but it gets very good performances from its crew and has some complex moves to the camera that involve scenes closely. The first part is similar to that of Cinderella, although anyone with brains can see that the bottom will come out of it - the rich "prince" will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> However, because of its good crew and fast speed, it is easy to engage in cliches. Then the film becomes more original, where the couple must find a way to make a living. The end is highly predictable but satisfying. I also want to commend the writing address: witty and very enjoyable.
