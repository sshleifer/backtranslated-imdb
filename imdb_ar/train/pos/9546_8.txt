It is clear that the release of Battlefield Baseball and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine" is a new version of Yamamoto 1999 with the same name. I doubt I'll get a chance to see the original, so I'll stick to that. The first is the "minced meat machine"? Simple in this moment buzz low-budget dust-packed spots with great make-up and gore effects. It's not something that will finish writing around it, but it's fun if you dig this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The Meatball Machine follows the well-known plot. The boy loves the girl but is very afraid to ask her about a date. The boy finally meets the girl. The girl gets a strange creature parasite converted to cyborg killed. The boy, in turn also turns into something happy, and continues to seek to save his love. Will he succeed? Who gives the curse, as long as there is a massacre and death, I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and relatively cliched but performs its function well enough in putting the film's path straight ahead in a bloody confrontation between two leading characters. There is a sub-plot that focuses on how the parasite that infected the girl enters her life. And yes, fortunately there is more violence. I am happy. Acting is what you expect from a budget-free film. It is not quite painful for the ears but it is not quite good either. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film, along with violence and calm (as I have not already mentioned) is Cyborg's designs. Done by Keita Amemiya who creates strange creatures and costumes for both movies and video games. The overview of necroborgs as called in the "minced meat machine" looks amazingly detailed. Without the use of Amemiya CGI designs, they are a wonderful combination of meat and metal, which is very impressive in appearance. Capable of turning different parts of the body into cool weapons such as saws, rocket launchers, shotguns and so on. Although you can easily recognize the cost of the movie, the necroborgs are of the A-movie category. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien" and all are made with a low budget and additional ketchup mode. It is a huge entertainment film that ignores the new special effects and proves that this kind of spray is still alive and kicking.
