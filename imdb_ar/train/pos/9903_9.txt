Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I try to remember the name of this wonderful film for more than 15 years. High slaughter, man! Hell yeah! <br /> <br /> I will not carry you summary of the plot and the actors, yadda and yadda yadda, because you all know what it is. That's why you're here anyway. However, what I'm going to do is explain the cherished memory I have in the 1980s D-Movie. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was about 7 years old, my dad used to rent all these horror movies. Did he care that his children were watching him? No. So, at that early age I saw the slaughter high. What I saw in this film stuck with me a great time. I have not seen her since then, but I remember to this day that most ridiculous people are killed in the film. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in the school?) Is subject to electrocution. Or, the man who drowned in the pool of cess. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... the explosive stomach of contaminated beer. amazing! How can you honestly hate a film where a character finds a beer in an abandoned school, for example, after 10 or 15 years and thinks it would be good to drink it? Then his stomach explodes? What!? And this wonderful line: Let's take my car ... It always starts. Classic crap along the way. <br /> <br /> I mean, look back now, after about 20 years, and laugh at him. But when I was 7, I was scared sh! That clown hat (or was it a mask?) That the murderer scared me all over! f / ck! <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a crappy movie. But for the purposes of nostalgia and humor, this film gets 9 out of 10. Either stay awake every night late, hope to watch this late Late Late Late movie, or look for a VHS copy and dust from a VCR.
