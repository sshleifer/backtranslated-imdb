One of my favorite movies is the end of a very nostalgic. The film revolves around the Sullivan family. It is clear that Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the main members of the Mafia, and the killer who says this way, an expert. One child wants to know his father's work (a fatal mistake), so he hides in his father's car and is in good health, seeing Tom Hanks working to say it that way. <br /> <br /> Mafia does not win anyone in the Mafia, when he wants you out, takes you out. Of course you can see anyone working in the Mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but doing wrong work, or doing something your boss does not want, and you're steady, and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the film, Sullivan Jr. sees something he did not have to see, and also, killing almost all of his family because of this "wrong" his son did. The movie is really fun, you see how Sullivan lives after being chased by the Mafia, or kinda of it. <br /> <br /> This movie is somewhat sad, and shows us about revenge, that dirty work done by people, almost everything you want. Hopefully this person has read this comment does not work with the Mafia, and if you work in the Mafia, do yourself an interest and extract the hell out of the country before being killed by your boss and your workers. <br /> This movie is received: 10/10
