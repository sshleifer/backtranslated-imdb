I was hooked from start to finish. Great horror comes from disturbing pictures and organic shocks created not to make you jump, but to make you go "What game is f * ck that you just saw?" All other commentators gave brief summaries of what the film was about, so I would not rephrase what was actually said. I was telling others about this film days after watching it just because it still haunts me. I've had a bad dream after seeing him, and I'm a true horror fan, and I'm not as easily afraid of them as "The Grudge" or "Silent Hill." What gave me bad dreams is what I felt about what I would do if I was in that cell with these guys. What will be my personal terror? The subconscious took me there, and it was not fun. That my friends is what the horror flick does to you! The best part of this film is that it is accurate. It's not about Bogiman jumping to you, alien invasions, or tons of bull. It is the opposite. The horror you create in your mind. The irony in the four characters is that the horror does not come from an external force that confirms that it is controlled. Simply ask men about what they want, and get it ... but not the way they imagine it. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from a mysterious book, but they may wish that they did not. Sometimes confinement in a prison cell is the best place for you!
