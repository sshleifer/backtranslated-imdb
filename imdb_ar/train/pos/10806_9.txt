I felt this movie - all the time. I was impressed by the talent of Russell Crowe in developing his relationship with Lilly, such a typical Australian mix of softly soft approach, self-immersion and self-immeasurability. I really like cinema and direction. Pace was perfectly right and the pictures of all the characters were almost impressive. <br /> <br /> Gosh, Russell's talent was not even in 1993 sparkling! .. I have not seen the wrestler yet.
