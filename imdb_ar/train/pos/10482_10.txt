I love this movie. It's one of those I can see over and over again. Acting well through a good team does not try hard to be starry. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis of a modern housewife can widen widows into selling the bet to meet her needs have turned into an American feces movie or thriller movie. Maybe it could have killed the film altogether. <br /> <br /> The movie is being shown as an ealing comedy with a wonderful feeling factor wonderful all the time. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing only the scene with the old ladies and a box of corn flakes ... (no this is not the spoiler!)
