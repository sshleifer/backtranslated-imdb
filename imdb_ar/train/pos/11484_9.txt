I just returned from the premiere of Montreal on Zero Day, and I was really surprised to find a negative comment on the film. The blame lies mainly in the fact that Coccio is making an easy and exaggerated social message ... Well, Mr. I am a reviewer. He is an easy-to-read and cost-effective critic. <br /> <br /> I want to break my life here, but I came from a small town School is more similar than these young people. Refuse and ignorance in the list. The thing ... I understand how young children can be induced to do such a horror. Secondary schools have become areas of battle for conformity. It is a real ugly scene. You need to fight your way to be like others. Hard to explain, many people did not realize that high schools became tombs of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and smile at how their lives on their comfortable outskirts are perfect. <br /> <br /> The real motivation for the film is not about what drives them. It is about this quiet suburb that resembles death and closes everyone's eyes and tries to create an atmosphere of the ideal city. Via Cal about it so well. It's a wake-up call. Drama is everywhere and can take every shape. In this case, small dramas (such as Andre's gay label wearing a JC Penney shirt) turn into the worst nightmare for an entire city. Andre & Cal took the most extreme ways to express their pain. The narrowness of the lack of conformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the recent scenes where some men burn the crosses of André and Cal, as if with the pain they have been told, Cal & Andre has informed their blind anger of their society, and their refusal to think about the causes of some actions. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive as a film, but Coxio contemplates more than whining or publishing. What André & Kale lives is a fact ... and scary may reach other children. <br /> <br /> An annoying film ... Making a home and a strong feeling Ben Coco is making a very disturbing film.
