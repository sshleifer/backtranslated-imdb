Reign Over Me (title after the song Who) is a movie that will surely bring tears to almost everyone's eye. It was a moving story of a man (Sandler) who lost his family in the attacks of the World Trade Center from 9 to 11. Several years later, he entered his colleague at the old college (cheadle) did not know even because of the pressure followed by the loss of his family. The two are reviving their old friendship and Cheedle, Johnson, realizes that he must get help from Sandler, Veneman, some help before it's too late. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie that made me cry for a long time. It is worth watching and after seeing it, I am sure that the viewer will appreciate his family / family much more.
