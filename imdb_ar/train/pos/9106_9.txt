Since I saw her for the first time, Piedras is a favorite character and one of the few images I can see over and over again. The great scenario depicts the lives of a group of women (all of them somewhat entangled) with a deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramon Salazar made a convincing film in his first director appearance, proving to be an effective director. <br /> <br /> Not all of the offers are excellent, though. All the leading women from the average (Najwa Nemri) are very good (Vicky Peña), but the warm applause should be directed at the newcomer Monica Serveira, who plays the role of his daughter Antonia San Juan lagging behind. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly enchanting as a male nurse, and there are nice little roles of Andrés Gertrúdix and Geli Albaladejo and the same director, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> The film "Piedras" is written and filmed beautifully, when I watched it I was so touched that I could not stop thinking about it for several days. I strongly recommend it.
