"Intruder (L'intrus)" is a visual journey through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> The delightful Michelle Sobor plays the role of Louis Trepour like Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past and lives simply in an isolated hut in the forest for reasons of paranoid justification (but attracts beautiful young women who may be useful to him). We learn more about him through dreams, memories of the past and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not, as well as through his raucous interactions with the family, its fans, and its business partners, most notably. Like The Limey, the film reverberates with the remorse of the parents / child and the suspicious past that was revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man (here is the 1965 film Paul Gégauff's "Le Reflux"). <br /> <br /> In perfect contrast to his mood, we meet with his son, Grégoire Colin, who must be the most attractive homeowner in the world, solves and lures home repairs and takes care of a child and a young child who needs his working wife. Surely director / co-writer Claire Dennis has to have created it as a fantasy for women if there ever was one lesson for other filmmakers to portray foreplay. There is another extended scene where he searches for his father in the jungle and carefully carries his angelic child in a bag. Is all not his father and has every relationship his father is unable to continue; no wonder he believes that his father "crazy." I spent the rest of the movie in a dazed state that something bad would happen to him because the true nature of his father's separate heart was running very gradually in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> The film is a mystery, but Sobor is mercilessly wonderful as we watch him cross states and negotiate outrageous deals. The voice story of "Pooh Travel" in Denis was annoying anyway. We have to know the legends and occasional signs that he travels to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific. The passage of time is indicated by changing seasons and scars that are created and cured. There are lots of pictures of water to clear and to move away. <br /> <br /> Dennis continued elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando Tahiti, continuing their fascination with the transformation of colonialism into globalization, as well as playing the stereotypes of the mysterious Orienteering and Russian criminals. The idols and memoirs of 40 pages by the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the latter about the title and the plot of heart transplant used for the subject of ridicule of limited immortality that have consequences. <br /> <br /> While Lewis believes he has succeeded in being above limits, rules and ethics, there is some entertainment in the last chapter because the locals do not know exactly what they are doing and are trying to help him solve his strange doctrine, Isolation. <br /> <br /> Many people in the audience have been frustrated by the way the elliptical stories are told, but remarkably beautiful. The unconventional novel raises a lot of conspiracy questions on the details.
