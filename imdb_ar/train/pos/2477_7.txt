The great epic is, Kenneth Branagh's massive rendition of what he considers to be the most famous tragedy of William Shakespeare suffers under the weight of his four-hour playing time and certainly takes some real survival power. There are likely to be two separate sessions that are better to fully appreciate what is certainly a high-quality film industry. Although I fully understand this masterpiece as such, I must admit the lack of enthusiasm for old indifference, and his speech (which sends himself well) and many thrive. So Hamlet loses his influence because he loses his grip. <br /> <br /> From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thompson's cinema to the wonderful collections of Tim Harvey, the film is a spectacular visual and audio feast cast. The Prang has taken on three huge cloaks, adaptation, direction and play. His adaptation is wonderful, his direction strong, but by the time he reached Hamlet's role, the pressure seemed to be showing; yet he still did a good job of what an incredibly taxing role was. Derek devours Jacoby's villain Claudius with joy, and Julie Christie is the most exciting like the Queen of Gertrude. Richard Breyers is as wonderful as Polonius, and Charlton Heston once again has a strong influence on the screen as player King. There are many other people, including Jack Limon (gorgeous in a very small role), Billy Crystal, Dam Judy Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gilgod, Sir Richard Attenborough, and Gerard Depardieu. Although the acting award must go to one of the great discoveries of thespian in recent years, Kate Winslet. Is an impressive portrait of the most tragic figure in this whole case, Ophelia. <br /> <br /> To the end (before this review lasts longer than the film), I must say it is the length that really test the viewer in this film. Prang has directed the goal, with many impressive scenes. Many of them outweigh their welcome. Watching this movie is a wonderful reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have obtained. "No lender or borrower be" or "Be honest with yourself". And of course: "To be or not to be." <br /> <br /> The first hours of work require some perseverance, but if you can stay awake, you will certainly deal with a noisy conclusion that gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onwards. <br /> <br /> Monday, June 8, 1998 - Hoets Croydon
