The Korean War was called the War of the Americas. Many unanswered questions were buried in addition to the 50,000 men who died there. Sometimes, we deal with a play or movie dealing with the cemetery of frozen ghost towers. Maybe here is one of the best. It is called "Sergeant Reker". The story of an American soldier named Sergeant. Paul Reeker (Lee Marvin) who was chosen for a very secret mission by the commanding officer. His mission is to break away from the North Koreans and provide his services against the United Nations forces. His success is his cover, proving to be invaluable to the enemy and giving him the rank of pioneer. However, he is then captured by Americans, and prosecuted as a traitor and a spy. Pointing out that he ordered to run away, he knows sadly that his officer has been killed and has no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He was convicted and sentenced to death. However, his conviction is questioned by Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), the prosecutor. Persuading the commander-in-chief Amos Billy (Lloyd Nolan) to suspect, give a new trial and if convicted will be executed. Drama The courtroom is first class as in the team that includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Wil as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was far away, but the possibility of convicting and suspending a communist struck a place very close to home in the 1950s. Because of her superior text and strong message, this drama has become a classic in the courtroom. Excellent view and recommended for everyone. ****
