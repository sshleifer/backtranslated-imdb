This film is a film "Cliffhangin" really nervous! Stallone was as good as always! Michael Rucker made a spectacular performance and John Lettjo plays a wonderful evil! Great music especially the subject! The movie is full of excitement and never tires! Stallon fan then watched Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
