I am biased towards any film that paints a luxurious portrait of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic countries in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, and was unusual for a period of time, and a little bit of film. However, the excellent story makes up for it. The four ladies begin a much-needed rest with problems in their minds. During the film, they realize their problems and begin to solve them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle where they stay, has a fascinating effect on people. "It's the basin of love," says Lotte Wilkins. You can see the gradual change of dissatisfaction with abundance as the Italian seashore works with its charm. <br /> <br /> All their problems and solutions are reasonable. The actresses were great. The background music looks very appropriate for one of the most romantic Italian languages. All in all, film 10/10 for me.
