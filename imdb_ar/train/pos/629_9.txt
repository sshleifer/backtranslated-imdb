The 14-year-old is very happy to be able to produce really good-looking fantasy films, and they are very angry, with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia. Cash at the box office. This year (has already seen) will see several other times, most notably the Golden Compass, containing the most exciting trailer I have seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Jimman, appeared in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I have not seen the previews for that, just a few commercials. The monetary reaction is a kind of blah. I did not see it, if not for the fact that I should wait for a friend to watch Bourne's alarm and did not open anything else interesting this weekend. Well, if you forgive the game of terrible words, the stars must be aligned correctly, because I went to see the Stardust company and loved it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The plotline is your basic fantasy price (the hero goes to look for a fallen star) full of obstacles. But within this basic scheme, the story is full of imagination and imagination. It is simply designed to be a lot of fun, romantic and small witch. And succeeds beautifully. There were a lot of big movies this summer, but none of them was as enjoyable as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and almost coherent. It is not a masterpiece, but it can certainly occupy the same kind of things as the Princess Bride (although I do not like it much like the previous one). Lots of fun here if you are a fan of this genre.
