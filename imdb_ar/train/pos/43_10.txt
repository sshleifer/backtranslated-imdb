I love this movie very much. I have really been interested in how Diana and Alicia became friends in this tragedy. Alicia was just a turbulent spirit and Diana was very happy to see someone after being shot. My only complaint is that initially it was slow and it took some time to get to the basics. Otherwise it was wonderful.
