This film is one of the finest American films of the 1990s. If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some actions, lots of laughter, and tongue-in-cheek contrasts on cops who fight gangs, it's worth watching. Everyone chews the scene a little bit, but that's what the film is all about, and everyone is very funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have a lot of chemistry and need to make another film together.
