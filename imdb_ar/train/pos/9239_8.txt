As I said in my comment on Part I: These two films are better than most science fiction fans who admit. <br /> <br /> The scenario in the second film is not that moving because we do not see the destruction of a human civilization, but in the wake of that, thousands of refugees fled in small boxes, protected by only one powerful spacecraft. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story rises moderately, carrying the battle to the planets Cylon. Well, it contains a little Mad Max game because all they fight for is the fuel for their spaceships to travel to find the distant land, but it works for me. It's a fun science fiction entertainment that has great actors and decent special effects (although these tend to repeat themselves, at the very least :-)). <br /> <br /> I loved continuing with Starbuck and Apollo on Board. Instead, we got a second sequel without any nominal characters that proved that the story had worked before, especially since the VIPs were well chosen ... <br /> <br /> So we objected to productions in 1980, but excellent for the cinema of 1978 .
