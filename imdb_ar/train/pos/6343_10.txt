Let me set the scene. It's school holidays and there's nothing at all in movies. I am with my friend deciding what to see. We are looking for a film that will start soon and the film "The Grinch" will appear. We buy tickets do not know what to expect. What we got was a tool for a roll of fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (who I can add was my first representative in the whole world) was absolutely wonderful because Grinch was in the best movie Ron Howard (Next) to Apollo 13). The way in which this film was produced and the scene, actors, props and music was very spectacular. I really brought this childhood film to life. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of wonder. As we all know, Grinch is a terrible person who can not stand at Christmas. He lives high above the whoville and never mixed with the inhabitants of the city. But a little girl will change her view of Greenshell and others radically. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lo (whose role is played by the wonderful new actress Taylor Mommes) meets with Grinch where she finds the nice part of him instantly. She is trying to break the barrier and help Grinch move and mix with city dwellers. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a barrel of laughter for the entire family of children and parents alike. Solid 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
