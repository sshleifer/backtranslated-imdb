I have watched this movie several times and will never tire of it. It is classic in every sense of the word. The film is funny hysterically and touching everything at the same time. For those of you who are not fans of "subtitles" or a foreign film in general, open your mind. It's a great movie for "beginners" because the story is very entertaining. Do not make a mistake, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something (even if it's just a big laugh on one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the most famous characters I have ever seen!) /> <br /> I can not even think about this movie without smiling !! I love it ... I think most people will too.
