Being Austrian, it was a straight blow to me. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere near the place where this film takes place, but unfortunately, it depicts everything that the rest of Austria hates about the people of Vienna (or people close to that area). It is very easy to read that this is exactly the intention of the director: let your head sink into your hands and say "Oh my God, how can that be possible!". No, not with me, (in my opinion) a completely exaggerated slingshot club scene is not necessary, I watch pornographic, certainly, but in this context I feel disgusted by putting it in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story about how misguided people with poor education or bad company are trying to live and live in a world of repetition and boring prospects. A girl treated as a dear friend to her jealousy (and still going back), a teacher discovers masochism by putting the life of her "lover" too harsh at stake, an elderly couple with almost a daily sports cycle (the "official alternative" to his previous wife) Just divorced and the ex-husband suffers from the actions of his ex-wife, obviously having a relationship with her masseuse, and finally, a madman who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and extends their nerves once it is very troublesome. <br /> <br /> After seeing him, you will feel almost nothing. You are not even shocked, sad or depressed or feel that you are doing anything ... maybe that's why you gave me 7 points, it made me interact in a way I never interacted with before. If this is good or bad, it is up to you!
