Full Marks to Present Pachino's Speech on the Dead Child's Casket; Marc Anthony will be subjected to Shakespeare for shame !! <br /> <br /> Was Paul Schrader the mother of Ken Lieber, who should be praised for great dialogues? They are rich, smart and worthy of your time if you love movies with good scripts. I have found that story narration develops well up to the audio recording footnote. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to talk about in this film; even John Cusack played better roles than that. Interestingly, the film is very male oriented - women are just accessories.
