Perhaps the first Portuguese film I have ever seen, I enjoyed it. The plot relates to how young army officers took power in Portugal in 1974 to defeat the Kaitanu fascist government and finally finalize wars in the colonies - Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau - Cape Verde Most of the events in the film accurately reflect the behavior of army officers and soldiers To carry out the coup, from oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and freedom, resisting the Kaitano men, as well as in a subtle way to most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as new president. The Portuguese Revolution can be remembered for the work of many young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed the need to develop Portugal democratically, and this is what the country achieved a few years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never want to kill anyone; even the most dangerous enemies were respected in the end.
