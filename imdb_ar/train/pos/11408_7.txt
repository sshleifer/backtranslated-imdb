Etienne Girardot is simply a representative of personality - the kind of person that people never know by name. However, he plays again the role of the investigator - one of the only actors in the films Philo Vance, which played more than once. I have already seen him twice more and loved him every time because he was funny and blowing out of the fresh air. This film is great to watch because, in addition to Girardot, there are many other outstanding actors on the journey - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith and H.B. Warner and Nate Pendleton. This is a wonderful and impressive team, and they certainly made the job easier for a leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great character actors are one of the main reasons I liked these old movies. While the same puzzle is rarely wonderful, because of writing and acting, the films really satisfy. As for this film, Louis played a wonderful role for Lowe, but, as I said, the same puzzle is only after thinking - with a silly conspiracy involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnosis for anyone to do anything like that - I have training in clinical hypnosis and if you've done anything like the wicked guy can do in the movie, you've done it! Used car vendors and a few of my old superiors were clear targets !! <br /> <br /> In general, although it is not the best film Philo Vance, it was very good, and it is a shame that Lowe played this role only once. In fact, apart from William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series has hampered a long series of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfried Hyde White, Warren William (and many others) who play Vance. This is a similar problem plagued by the Bulldog Drummond series - too many different actors playing the lead man. <br /> <br /> Worth watching and exciting - although it is also very impossible.
