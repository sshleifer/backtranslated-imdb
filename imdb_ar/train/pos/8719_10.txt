I was amazed at the improvements made in the animated film. If you sit near the screen, you'll see details in the grass and surface structures. Details, colors and shading are at least ranked in terms of size better than Toy Story. How they managed to shading, I will never know. I hope Pixar will make a documentary about how the film will be produced so I can figure out how all this was accomplished. Based on this film, I think that future animation films will be evaluated based on this film.
