James Stewart and Margaret Solavan play co-workers at a Budapest gift shop who do not like each other, unaware that they are really close friends. Comedy, played very attractive by two beloved stars and representatives of the support very eager to please. The story is well written and the film holds a romantic innocence (I do not quite know how to explain it) that movies today are not. This is clearly comparable to the mail you recently received, and the original win in every way. <br /> <br /> This is a mandatory offer on every birthday, I can not think of a better way to start Christmas. I feel of this small gem.
