In any number of films, you can find Nicolas Cage as a strong and silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a bug / hobo, and recently GT. Welsh heavy. These are the kinds of roles that these four can play during their sleep, and they have done so much to see them play again on the vulgar frontier. What is gratifying, then, is that John Dale, a master in getting a lot of mood from a little work, drew this nuireish subtle excitement. Hopper is able to keep the top, and Cage shows a slightly deeper depth than his usually superficial heroes. Boyle turns into a paranoid, innocent, and planned, and one gets a sense of the steel of the soul that is central to his personality, Wayne. The Dahl trend gives a sense of Big Sky's space where the story unfolds with enough intimacy to show how the curly eyebrow can indicate a radical change in the plot in the store. Graphic transformations are top notch, and one of the other great twists in this film is that some supporting characters actually behave as if they had brains. It is not often that simple figures like the deputy deans have more brains than their superiors. But with a clever director like Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected to this film. Excellent movie
