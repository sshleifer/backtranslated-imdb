Part of what was wonderful in the classic cartoon of Looney Tunes was their dissatisfaction and how they were not afraid to do anything they wanted. In this case, Marvin Mars has an important mission to restore Earthlings. He certainly encounters Bugs Bunny, who warns of a rebellion by Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally blows up the blunders - through the bazookas that exit the strait from the Acme jacket! - Bugs has more planned things for the trip to return to Mars. What I mean is, if you think it was a big change in the solar system when they stripped Pluto of its position on the planet, you have not seen anything yet! Yes, The Hair Care goes all out. How to buy Acme products in outer space probably exceeds most people, but the point here - I mean "rabbit" - is to have fun. Believe me, I will definitely. After all, a little dawn of space did not hurt anyone.
