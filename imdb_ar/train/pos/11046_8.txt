Maléfique is a very interesting film. It is an unholy alloy of victories and failures. The central concept is wonderful, three prisoners with strange characters join them fourth (who the public recognizes) and try to escape from their cell using the magic book they find inside the walls of the cell. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is good, it reminds me of reading about staying at the Edmond Dantes prison in Chateau Dev (before becoming Count Monte Cristo). The manager puts a sense that the characters are connected to the cell, especially the personality we are supposed to recognize (Carrier - a white collar criminal whose crime has not been determined, but it is indirectly suggested that the fraud is). On one occasion, Carrier disturbs when he leaves the cell to exercise and closes the door of the cell; we never leave the cell, the fear of indoor space is uninterrupted. As no footage of the prison outside the cell, the view through the bars is the sunset longing over the prison wall of the year. Although the film looks very recent, it has a very old universal prison. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting. Marcos, a violent transgender before sexual acts, plays the role of an abusive mother of a young man who is deeply backward. Pâquerette loves to eat everything he finds beautiful, and unfortunately this included his infant sister, and then his current predicament (I like this comment on the interior, very primitive). Lasalle is an elderly man who was withdrawn and owned, for killing his wife brutally. <br /> <br /> The main message of the film is that your desires will be destroyed, and there is a ritual that agrees with that. I think this is what bothers me most, as I see people destroying themselves in a ritualistic way. It has a real life ring for it. Simple soundtracks support this well, each step deeper into the shifting sand accompanied by the dull Brenn of Gong. I hear gong now every time I do something self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think one of the problems of the plot is that the ends of the characters do not continuously reinforce the message, especially with Carrere, it also seems that the concept of the book changes during the film, not in terms of the successive revelation as well. I also think that some of the pictures we see a little amateur, more design than implementation, such as the famous "eye vagina" and homosexuality in LaSalle, for me, completely hollow pictures. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the director seems in a hurry to beat him, and some things do not seem logical, for example, he has been clumsily convicted of believing things different from Carrier's child. This does not change the fact that what we have here is this rare bird, a horror film "pure." There is no comedy slag or qualitative separation, like Cube (1997 / Natali), the clear film to compare it to, it's a complete immersion experience, where you feel like you're in a cell with characters. This last comment about being a "pure" experience I think is something others have also mentioned, and this is a fairly unanimous point. <br /> <br /> On the personal side, the favorite part of the film is when Lassalle talks about his past as a librarian. He describes very clearly a scene where he goes to work someday and sits in his usual place in the middle of the room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. The books seem to cheer him that he will not contain their information. This prompts Lazal to go crazy. This is really a mania problem with understanding and knowledge. It's something I felt myself. <br /> <br /> One of the last comments is that two of the comments that were well received on the blackboard confused the names of the characters. To convince yourself that Lasalle is the trustee of the library, just click on the Philippe Laudenbach page and you'll see that he was born in 1936.
