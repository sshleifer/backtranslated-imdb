Immortal musical gem, with Kelly's Kelly in its upper form, the elegant direction of the Minnelli Vincente, and wonderful musical figures. It's great entertainment from start to finish, one of the movies that people see with a smile and say, "They do not do as they used to!" But they never did. The 25-minute series without dialogue is among the most beautiful in the history of films. The magic of the film, clearly derived from the heart and spirit of all involved. Must see!
