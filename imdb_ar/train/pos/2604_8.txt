"Amazing Grace" has little sense because it tells a contemporary story about the lives of different people in an apartment building. Spoken language is Hebrew, but drama can occur in any modern city. Notes family values, romantic relationships and age group characteristics with their equality. It does not judge personalities, it only offers them directly in a direct way, as it strives to solve its individual problems in this modern world. The quality of representation is very good, and the notes made to the characters are smart and sharp. I appreciate this movie streaming a lot.
