In Mexico this movie was broadcast only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a real example of a good German, especially a good man. Talks between Tokur and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. True War of Ideas: Two different Germans believe, with faith in them. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: a man, a fighter for freedom, a friend, a cleric, and a great thinker, Ulrich Tocor, as wonderful as Bonhoeffer. I highly recommend this film, especially in these difficult times on the planet. In Mexico, we do not know much about the life of Pastor Bonhoeffer, it's a great job to save a forgotten hero.
