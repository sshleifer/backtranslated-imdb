I finally started watching this show, and I must say that it made me really laugh. You have to appreciate its unrealistic aspects, along with everything else. Some other people said that this presentation should have more realistic reactions to the dead, among other things. If you accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other parts are completely insane of the show. I could not help smiling after every episode I saw. I really think it's great to have a show that can take a very strange theme and make it great to watch. I love the narration perfectly, and I think it adds a lot of wonder to the whole show. You can not always compare the author's old offers with his new shows, since you have to take everything as his own entity. Certainly give her a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
