At first, I had a reaction many people left after seeing this: that shots from the bleak people who take solar baths, etc. were cheap shots somehow. Well, he meets Diane Arbus. . . whatever. . . But it was not long before I realized that this was not done in an inhumane way, as the images unfolded. I felt the problem was entirely in her audience: we feel the condition of Hollywood and also movies from almost everywhere to feel that watching people over a certain age act sexually An improper order, something should not appear. If that's what the movie is all about, it would be great. However, the story of a woman with her abusive boyfriend and his drunken friend is really striking like a lot of bricks: telling very eloquent stories, incredible presentations, and thinking that the scene was impromptu. This blonde guy is a genius actor. Finally, I want to contradict those who say that this film revolves around the compassion of all these people. The old man who is about to dance for him in the end is a good figure cut off this mold, so do not oversimplify the film by ignoring it. Yes he kills his dog. This is not a rosy picture of the world but it is not. . . Totally hopeless. Anyway, I was grateful to the filmmaker for making a beautiful film. I will not say that each thread was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this film basically kicks and strongly recommends it. . .
