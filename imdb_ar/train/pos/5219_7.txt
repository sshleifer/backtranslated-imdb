Gere and Danes are two stars in the Department of Public Safety who track the perpetrators of sexual offenses released. Gir, who plays Babage, refers to them as his flock. Gear is more of a vigilant maniac who is on his way out. He trains, newcomer Allison, to take over his job. Ger finds his flock very sick, troubled dogs. Ask them questions that are not on the list, and try to act like police and solve crimes. Continue to warn against this behavior, and therefore why to replace it. During the last few days of his work, a young girl disappears, and Babaj is sure of his rib. He and Allison narrowed the list and discovered some violators had gone away. So, he decides he needs to track down the lost girl instead of helping the police. This part is a bit elusive. <br /> <br /> There are some sick and twisted things in this movie. Such as when Babbage and Alison go to this building where a group of patients stir up some things for each other. Also, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see what sick freaks are. However, I will not call this movie too much because it has not been much shown in the film. <br /> <br /> The end result: If you love thriller and film about the armed killers and the police who hunt down the killers, you'll love it.
