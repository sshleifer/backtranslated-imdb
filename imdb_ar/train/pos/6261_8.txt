A wonderful documentary film of 1924. This geography in the early twentieth century in today's Iraq was strong. Watch this and tell me if Cecil B. Demel did not record notes until he issued his Ten Commandments. The photographer Merian C. Cooper, later created Cinerama, an idea that perhaps hovered during the filming of the wonderful landscape in this film. Werner Herzog's fans will find that this film is a treasure, with tragic tales of struggle, complemented by the land around them, and the human capacity to bear it is not very clear. The fact that this has happened when it shows not only the will of the subjects, but of the filmmakers themselves.
