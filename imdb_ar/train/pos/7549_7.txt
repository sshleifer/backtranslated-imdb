The young cat tries to steal the spirit of his brothers from death, but only gets half of it, and then she has to apply for the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm not sure what's going on in this film full of extremely exotic and surreal images that some parents may find annoying, (ie cats cut off part of a pig to be traveling with them and frying it like the bacon eaten by the three ). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange film that some people like Hello Kitty on the acid, and I think it's more like Hello Kitty than Daley did. (Certainly this is more lively than the Destino which was directly based on his work). <br /> <br /> If you want to get a good-faith movie that will challenge your perceptions of things, check out this movie. Just be prepared for some very exotic images that will be copied in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
