My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. During her 22 years of age, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school, which is also occupied with other disabled children. I have been following everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and I still think to this day that no one, or ever, will give her a curse and her status. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what the Christie family was going through. But they were lucky. Christie could speak, communicate, and have technical skills. My sister can walk, but she can not speak a word, and she can not use her hands to do anything but grab things. But this film made me realize that there were other people in the world like my sister, and that the end (to tell the truth) made me cry. I have seen Shashank !!! This film is seriously underestimated, and it should not. This film tells people something. That people should be proud of their lives. I think you can not write well? This man wrote with his foot. Thinking that you are not attractive? This man was rejected by many girls, because of his condition. Not the fastest runner? Christie could not stand. <br /> <br /> My point is: Parents of young children, I suggest that your children watch this movie with you so that they will know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, not staring at them as if they are foreigners. My sister got millions of stars, and he breaks my heart to think that this still happens to many people. This film will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are also people. 10/10
