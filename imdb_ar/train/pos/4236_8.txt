Take this film for what it is, not re-making, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original; it's more of a popcorn film. Visually, it is incredible. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> As it is, I think the film is wonderful, but I love everything Burton has done. People need to calm down and stop acting as if they were the end of the world B / C for this film. It was not supposed to be a remake, nor is it. <br /> <br /> The end was great. . I took him as a parallel cone.
