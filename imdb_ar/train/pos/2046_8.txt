Although the soundtrack is a bit old, this story is more important in the United States now than ever before. With not only blue collar jobs, but companies operating overseas are being used by US companies while government profits and US suffering. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a hard worker working in the same job as his father for 35 years. His wife Pamela Reid, who is very realistic, is trying to support the family with two children when Emory loses his job. The plant was closed on the pretext of mismanagement, but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steel plant in one month (outsourcing) for what they have to pay to Strauss / Emory in one day. Do not mind that these men are all loyal workers who enjoy values ​​and are trying to make the best of their families. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (Strauss Brothers) and a few of his co-workers are also affected. It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes his local union will be able to reopen the mill, where they promise it. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother, I already write on the wall. There are no remaining jobs in the rust belt (Ohio) and they have to go ahead. But where in the United States can they go? Where would it be best for a blue-collar worker? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end, where Emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products. The guard allows them to do so as a last gesture, as one of the men suicides and has sympathy. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is a good message about the difficult times here in America. Something a little care for the face so personally affected. 10/08.
