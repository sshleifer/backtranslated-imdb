I've been a fan of Edward Portinsky for years, and it was a pleasure to be able to see the guy working, thanks to Jennifer Bischwal's documentary. The sheer beauty of the shipyard in Bangladesh, the quarries in Vermont, the massive assembly plant in China, and the old, besieged neighborhoods of Shanghai that are just waiting to be demolished: these landscapes are well captured by the photographer and the film director. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I've been thinking of old TV documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories; the kind of things that I've created and seen. Burtysky's work has great value in referring to how industrial activity turned only to Asia, did not stop. The strangest scene for me is the junk computer yard somewhere in China - the waste had a threat about it, while the workers were very mocking.
