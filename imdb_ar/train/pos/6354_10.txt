Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought this would be a stupid childish film, and it was not. It was incredibly funny for everyone, adults and children. I've seen it once because it was almost out of theaters, and now it's finally coming out on this Tuesday DVD and I'm on its way to excitement, as you can see. You should definitely see it if you have not already, it's been so wonderful! <br /> <br /> Liz
