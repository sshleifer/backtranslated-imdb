What a lovely film to warm up a TV movie. The story tells a small five-year-old girl lost her father and finds it impossible to overcome. Her mother is also deeply distressed. Only a miracle can ease their grief. Which all viewers hope to achieve. Samantha Mathis is as wonderful as the mother of the little girl, where she was like a nanny in the film "Jack and Sarah", well worth watching if you love Samantha Mathis and happy; Ellen Burstein, as she is, is always her delightful grandmother in this wonderful and wonderful film. Jodelle Ferland (the five-year-old girl) is a charming and more convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it very influential. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness that is clearly visible and still around us in this difficult world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us all hope, by realizing that there are so many beautiful people in the world with so much love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland United Kingdom
