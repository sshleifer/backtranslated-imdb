First of all, I'm a straight white wolf. But even with this handicap, I like this movie. It's about real people. Real-time location. And of course New York City in the 1980s. I had many gay friends who grew up in New York in the 1980s, and the only thing I always liked about them was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live. Regardless of the consequences. This is brave. You have to admire this. It's a wonderful film, watch it and take what it looks like to be an African American man or a Hispanic gay man in New York in the 1980s. It is real life. The bottom line is that it is real life.
