"Dance, Fools, Dance" is a Crawford Jable vehicle early in 1931. Crawford plays the role of Bonnie Jordan, a rich young woman whose life consists of partying, vintage, stripping her clothes to jump from a yacht and swimming. All this ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blackwell) bankrupt. Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper using the name Mary Smith. Her brother goes to work for men to take off. The main man is Jake Lofa - portrayed by Clark Gable as he plays the role of another scammer. Later, of course, he was transformed into a romantic hero, but in the early thirties, MGM used him as a bad guy. Not realizing that her brother was involved in illegal activity, Bonnie cooperates with Lofa. <br /> <br /> Jable and Crawford have made a great team. Her facial expressions are slightly on the lateral side, but this, along with her dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, like Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting watching pre-show movies, "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
