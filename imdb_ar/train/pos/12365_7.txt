I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned that there are two copies of this same film. The lion's share of the footage in both is identical, but here lies the difference: In one version (the version I have often seen on the television screen), the group of clerics guarding the gate from the Muslim Brotherhood to the Hama, Of pastors and brothers "deprived" of the church. In the other version, which I saw only once on television, the clerics guarding the gate are depicted as priests in the official church, the parish of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also, in the previous version, and in most of the relevant scenes, the clergy are referred to as "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say "father" etc. But the Madbalij voice says "my brother" I think everyone is referred to as "the father." <br /> <br /> However, one of these two versions appears to be partially or partially re-firing on the other, with all scenes of the Muslim Brotherhood being re-presented as " Scenes "parish", or vice versa. (Kind reminds me of the separate scenes of Raymond Pour in "Godzilla.") Versions outside the television broadcast, so no, I do not imagine this, could you Anyone shed more light on the story behind these two versions of the film?
