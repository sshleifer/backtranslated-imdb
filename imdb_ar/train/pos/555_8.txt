My comment was added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find a place for it. I was really surprised to see this film was introduced in the United States in February 1955. I saw it at the "Premiere" theater in Washington DC in March 1958. I wonder if it has been reissued or a problem? In my opinion, this film is very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. John McIntyre serves as a judge / judge / businessman / corrupt thief. Walter Brennan plays the same role he did in the Red River years ago. In my opinion, James Stewart is performing as well as he has ever done. I saw this movie half a dozen or more, and I was not tired of seeing parts of it again. Photography and landscaping are wonderful, providing a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.
