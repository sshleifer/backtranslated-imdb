John Waters (Happy Birthday, John!) Went to a world away from the world of art / celebrities. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working-class teenager in Baltimore who likes to photograph things. When a New York client (Lilly Taylor) discovers his work, he gives him a big break, which he accepts. But once it reaches the big size, it has to rethink everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, Pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his natural life once he becomes a celebrity. This is something we would certainly expect, but with Waters' directions, there are always some things that shock us (you'll know when you see them). Definitely recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricci, Mink Stol and Patty Hearst.
