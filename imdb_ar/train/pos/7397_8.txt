"Xizao", is a tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, its impact on a family in China. Quanxiu Pu is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zu) has died. He found that his father was still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old works and public bathroom. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the Daming family and how it learns about the importance of his father's job, something he always considered an ancient tradition that should have died soon. The film also explores his relationship with Er Ming, who faces mental challenges, the problems of a small society and how pigeons are a place not only purifying their bodies, but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, the family and the problems of progress are addressed incredibly well, and the film never loses the point it tries to make. Both are very well developed and have a glimpse of Chinese society and customs. <br /> <br /> The director, Yang Chang, tells his story in a simple way, and leaves characters of characters performing the task. It's a very simple way, but it fits the film perfectly, and I doubt strongly that another approach fits the film well. Zhang has enormous potential, where he can tell a story without the help of optical glare or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> Representation is great in its natural approach. Everyone behaves in a very natural way and it seems that if they are real people being photographed. The three prominent characters offer great performances, Wu Jiang as Er Ming certainly steals the show. <br /> <br /> Even when the film may have stuck to the "old days" message, it takes a message of balance, such as saying that progress is good and we must move forward, but we must not forget where we came from, We maintain a balance between modern life and ancient traditions. <br /> <br /> Fantastic, touching the movie. 10/08
