A notorious film before, is the only film that has caused people to insist that the Hayes Act be strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of a young girl who does not face her father who sells alcoholic beverages a problem throwing them at customers. When he dies in an accident, she goes out into the world knowing that her body is fit for marriage and can get what she wants. You go to New York and continue to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although it is clear that there is no actual sex shown, the film is very flabby. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value has faded (almost immediately Stanwyck is monitoring the car inspector so you can travel for free), the film becomes repetitive and delightful. Stanwyck itself is the only thing that makes the movie worth sitting. As always, it's fantastic.
