Corbin Berenson offers an impressive and impressive performance, such as Dr. Alan Finston, a wealthy and successful dentist in Beverly Hills who is a complete obsession. When he discovers that his beautiful wife is a blonde babe who cheats on him and the IRS begins to pursue him on tax problems, Finston cracks into the pressure and moves violently around the curve. Directed by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Bowley and Charles Finch, Bryan Yozna reveals the psychotic nerves and psychos that thrive under the clean, well-groomed surface of rich, rich, delicious, richly malignant America. Moreover, Yuzna mixes what is going on in a terrifying way with a wickedly twisted sense of the humor of the black gallows. Brinson shines positively as Dr. Winston. It presents with a truly disturbing creeping experience that lies beneath the quiet and misleading Venestone crust. The cast is equally excellent: Linda Hoffman as the director of Winston's office, the unfaithful wife Brooke, Earl Bowen as the ladder, Marvel Goldblum's tax agent, Molly Hagan as Jessica's gruff assistant, Pattie Toe as a cheerful assistant, Karen, Kenny in the role of Sarah, a sweet teenager, Ken Keane, as one of the investigators, makes no sense, and Tony Noaks as a partner in Gibbs Doctor Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadfick as a dresser for Mavennnenenen Matt Matt, and Mark Ravello as Stephen Stevens. Make-up first-class f / x is all that is dark and gross and annoying as it should be. The polished film by Levie Isaaks features a lot of camera angles and a few close-ups. Alan Hwarth's lively, snappy points also hit the scene. A deformed treat is fun.
