I love this movie very much, and I do not feel sick from watching it. The only line I can not do in this is when Riff describes herself as a fine teen surgery but otherwise, everything else is perfect. I was never a fan of PJ Soles and it was not good to hear that she did not even know who they were from Ramones until she filmed this film, but I can ignore her little face very much. Most people who watch this again and again are lovers of the Ramones game, really .. That's the only reason I like it so much. Do not feel tired of seeing DeeDee miss the pizza or air lines spoil the teacher's name again and again, haha. One of the best parts of the film is seeing them singing. Do you want to dance, down the high school halls? I love them. The special version of the DVD has a good retrospective display, and surprisingly PJ Soles is not. Maybe she was working on another project * laughing * Anyway, a wonderful movie, even better if you love Ramones.
