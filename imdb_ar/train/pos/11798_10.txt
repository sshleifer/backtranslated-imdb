I've seen this movie literally more than 100 times ... It's full of entertainment !!! Powers Bowth gives excellent performance. As an admirer of actors such as William Schattner (Implas, 1974) and Ron Lippman (The Academic Father, 1981) I never thought that any actor could capture "intensity" such as Schattner and Leppman in those roles, until I saw Petty as Jim Jones! As far as I care, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... This film captures his best performance !!!
