This review is intended for the long story of this film. <br /> <br /> I first watched Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD several years ago. I have always loved this film and can read some of his positive reviews to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> This is said. I've always found the story a little confusing. The film, after all, is a love story. It always seemed strange to me that the story of love ended with a 20-minute fight. <br /> <br /> Well, this is no longer the case in the extended version. The original "original" version starts with a huge sequence similar to the climbing / rugby barrel, the new ending sequence in the expanded version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be practicing and reading when his father is present. <br /> <br /> The other sequences have been changed or extended in the extended pieces and the story has a lot of sense when you watch it. The speed is also better and generally it works better. It looks like a love story and does not leave you asking questions about why it ends as radically and permanently as in the normal release. <br /> <br /> I suggest anyone who is a cinema in Hong Kong, or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get an extended version and watch the movie in the way it originally was intended (or at least that's what I think was meant to be. After watching it, I felt like I had seen a whole new movie from Jackie Chan, although most of the sequences were the same.
