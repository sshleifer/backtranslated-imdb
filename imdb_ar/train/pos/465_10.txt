Marilyn Gouris has established herself as one of the world's greatest filmmakers. This beautiful visual-sensitive film is based on Vladimir Nabokov's story and captures the dark paradox of the writer. John Turturro presents what I consider his best performance (usually not his fans); Emily Watson is also great. worth watching.
