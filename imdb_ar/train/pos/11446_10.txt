At this moment, I watch this movie for the second time (on TV) and for the second time I fell when it was already working for an hour (I think I saw two more minutes this time) This film is really impressive, the way Goldsworth looks at nature, You never think about it, it's really amazing. This whole movie gives you a warm feeling and vision that plays with the world around him with such love. Or just see his hands, covered with dirt and broken nails, just holding.
