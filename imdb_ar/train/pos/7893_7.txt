I think I am part of the silent minority that enjoyed this film. Is it one of the best "nightmare" series? Probably not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddie Krueger reaches his evil potential. Because parts 4 and 5 of a later series felt that this alleged final installment ("New Nightmare" was the real ending), I took the series out of recession. There are some wonderful sequences in the nightmare, including the sequence in which Bricken Meyer plays the role of the stone who gets the trash, and sleeps and stumbles in a video game controlled by Freddie. This sequence is very original and hilarious, especially when we see it outside the dreamscape, navigating around like Super Mario. Freddie belts out one funny, "great graphics". Since the film was released about 10 years ago, he regained his memories when Freddy began to control the game using Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic. Lisa Zan is completely cast in the lead. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man", and I think the last time I saw the film was about 5 years ago. He is another wonderful actor, who does not appreciate him very much and has a strong presence on the screen. Who can forget the inscription? The best film by Johnny Depp (from "The First Nightmare") plays the role of a spokesman for a drug trading company. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence in the end is really great! For those looking to check out this movie - please rent it or buy it on DVD! We hope all versions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video version has removed the 3D element. <br /> <br /> Personally I have not seen many wrong things in the film. So she put the background on Freddy. The film is a wonderful mix of humor and fear, and awesome terrible effects. Could this have given better justice to excellence? Of course it can be. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. Finding an ideal conclusion is easier than doing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I liked the montage over the opening credits. Fans of this series will be delighted and will see it as a tribute to Freddy Habib. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 7 (out of 10)
