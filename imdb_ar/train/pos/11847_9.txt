The horse is actually a good animal. The picturesque images of wild horses and their nests were never more spectacular than a cartoon click. <br /> <br /> Animation is simply enormous. Beautiful animation is the backbone of the beauty of horses in the click. Moreover, when the steppe crosses the various terrain, it jumps across the cliffs and the courageous waters. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is fantastic. Great, wonderful music attracts you to the movie's appreciation. <br /> <br /> "They say the story of the West was written from the horse's saddle." Hey? Well, a beautiful horse story was written from West Saddle. <br /> <br /> In general, this film clearly exists with the best. It's one of the best viewer flicks. It would be a very good choice in a single night. Easy 9/10.
