This film was hysterical. I have not laughed this in a long time. I mean it is not "good faith hunting", but was it supposed to be? I actually went to advanced examination and I expect much less and was pleasantly surprised. Comedy hits hard and fairly steady. Amanda is a warm and wonderful house. The entire audience I was viewing seemed to enjoy the film as much as I enjoyed it.
