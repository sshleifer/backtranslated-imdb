"Thief in the Night" is a film that has been generally ignored by film lovers in general due to its low budget (which was clear) and its theme - the real Christian church ecstasy and the fate of their successor. However, it was an interesting story to capture the viewer and certainly made him review his relationship with Jesus Christ. I have touched everyone - he even showed a priest preaching the word, but he did not believe it, and knows exactly why he was late. You should watch this movie and its sequence "Away from Thunder". Even with the emergence of the new "Left Behind" series, which tells the same story at a much higher budget, the effect is still the same - "Thief in the Night" has paved the way for this genre and will always remember it.
