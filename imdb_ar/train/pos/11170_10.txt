There is something about the Sematary Pet I have never felt anywhere else. Maybe the fact that I was a kid when I first saw it made this experience memorable. But as I watched again and again, I did not get old, and I never felt bored. From the opening credits of that creepy opening song to the chaotic ending, there is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and continues to ring: sometimes death is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to link the entire story again. All you need to know is that it starts from point "A" (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and strides step by step to point "B" (which, believe me, the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story is logical, the special effects are fantastic, and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I'll be in. As I said, sometimes dead better!
