It is a film that contains many things that only the Japanese can understand. Even well localized, there are some things that are obviously special jokes or regional symbolic. I think he tried to send a message of some kind, but that just wasted me. <br /> <br /> What I felt was basically a medium sized movie with nice special effects. Some children become "the person" and in the end have nothing to do with the senseless Yuki war at all. It was good to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between Azumi and Yuki wash the ones that look like big umbrella tongue (Rihanna eat your heart!) <br /> Bottom line: beautiful pictures, the child cries a lot, Princess The river is really terrible and the rest is crap.
