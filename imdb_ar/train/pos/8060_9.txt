**** SPOILERS **** Powerhouse shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as to sacrifice their friends and family members and do not realize what monsters they are. To what was the case in the case of Gypo Noland, which resembles bulls, and Victor Mclaglen, it is too late. <br /> <br /> In 1922, the Irish Black & Tan rebellion against the Great British Empire with Tans came to an end. British occupying forces searched for the wanted Irish Republican rebels Frankie McPhelep and Wallace Ford to kill a British soldier. Guebo, her close friend, and best of luck, her fugitive McPhillip is retreating because of his luck working with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Graham, who had to turn tricks in Dublin's red light neighborhood in order to pay her rent. <br /> <br /> After angry Ghibu has worked on a potential John who wants to spend a few hours with Katie, in return for Shillen or two hours, angry Katie tells the gyroscope so bright that she prevents her from supporting herself with her banking assets, her body. Katie Guibu also told him that he should wake up to reality and realize the desperate situation in which she lives. Gibo told the drug that it would cost her £ 10 just to go to America and get out of Ireland. He suddenly remembered a sticker for his close friend Frankie McFillip that he had just seen a £ 20 reward announcement. This is enough money for both he and Kate to travel to America. <br /> <br /> Gobo goes to the Dublin house to flop and the soup kitchen for a free meal is dazed to bump into his friend Frankie McPillip. Frankie told him that he had infiltrated Dublin to see both his mother, Mrs. McFillip and her sister Mary, Ona O'Connor and Heather Angel, and if he could make sure everything was safe for him to return home and then later leave for his Irish Republic alone outside the city. <br /> <br /> Everything you can see Gypo in Frankie's face is £ 20 reward for converting it to the police! Without much second thought, after Frankie reassured that everything was fine, Ghibo secretly goes to the police and informs his friend who was later shot and killed in a shootout at Tan and Tuman's house. <br /> <br /> With the act of a police chief handing over £ 20, much like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost passionate gypo who takes it and sneaks out of the back door of the police station so that one can see him. You can see in the face of the police chief and his actions that he has only the absolute contempt for the betrayal of Guipo to his friend Frankie McFillip. Although he was wanted to be killed and promised to the British Empire. This is the way low traitors or informants are kept by even those who work for them. <br /> <br /> It turned out that Guebo was his worst enemy after Frankie betrayed him while his conscience controlled his mind. Gypo sees everyone hearing, including his reassuring girlfriend Katie, pointing with a finger and getting involved in Frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the British authorities. The guilty Gypo mind made him fill himself in a royal and glorious way, on the rewards funds, that by the time he was forced to confess his crime to his Irish IRA colleagues, who fought a dead drunk Gripo, and the money in the trial ended up at concerts he drank and drank . <br /> <br /> Whatever your good feelings, if possible, Gypo has been completely destroyed when possible in a state of total despair, in order to feel total despair. To protect himself from the shooting, an innocent man, Mulligan, Donald Mick, was falsely implicated in his crime of telling his friend Frankie McFillip. Which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non-others and then Guibu wet with the same guilt. The dye is dyed at the time the straw is painted on who will be the person who placed a bullet in Gypo's head in the last chapter of the gastrointestinal leak from the classics of crime and punishment that are unforgettable.
