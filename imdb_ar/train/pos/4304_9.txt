I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7, and at that time I was shocked. I had seen a violent film before, but I did not watch a film with the consequences and reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this film did and failed to do is to be honest. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (Crash actually had a built-in bias against Asians) and reached it from a morally higher position. The Grand Canyon came in things from a hard and realistic perspective so that it actually ends up on a higher floor than the collapse. Especially when comparing endings. The end of the collapse is such a small end that it is supposed to bind everything. While Grand Canyon simply ends in a quiet tone, where you know nothing will change in your personal life, but because life continues as well, there is no appropriate ending. It does not matter how good ... you're bad. There is no end of chapter to start another.
