As a reader of the comic book, who still sees myself as a full-hearted child, I admit that I may have been somewhat biased toward this film. I mean, there was not a good superhero movie out for some time (PS: Batman Forever was not a good superhero movie). I really wanted to have this film well, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read Blair's Witch Project) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The mystery men of the intense influences were definitely flicking the action, it was a comedy. On this basis, it was a success. Everyone was laughing at the small theater, and they got applause and laughed at the last scene. Stellar and Garovolo are still hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds the right touch of madness. William H. Messi plays the role of Straight Man, while Mitchell and Paul Robbins are powered by a fart just to keep children happy. <br /> <br /> Although these groups are strange (and sometimes look like pieces from both Batman and Blade Runner), some jokes are clear, they are still funny. There are some lines that will attract more careful viewers, and bring tears from the belly laughs between us. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although not classic at all, it is as funny as the latest version of Austin Powers. The writing is good, and the actors are wonderful. If you're worried, plan for prizes and pay less, but in both cases you'll be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who of us does not root the losers once in a while?
