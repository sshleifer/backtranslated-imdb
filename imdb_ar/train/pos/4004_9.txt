"Mother" is that extraordinary piece of filmmaking - it makes you think and do not pull any punches - and in the end let you think. Is largely open with regard to the fate of the leading personality. Ann Reid (whom I only knew briefly from appearing in some Victoria Wood-inspired projects I think is pretty comics) is really wonderful here. She is not a typical widow housewife who was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. Not all that is free and adventurous at first. She plays her character only with the correct observation that shows the truth (well, she did it with me). Strong cast. Great script. Renaissance for European cinema already;)
