The appearance of old films is usually these days. For 1980, "foxes" really give their meaning. Judy Foster plays her character directly. Since becoming a "taxi driver" four years ago, she has become a stronger character in this film. She is Jenny, a high school with a lot of courage, and she seems to have gotten out of any position she is in. Scott Bayo plays Brad on his way in front of Chachi in "Happy Days". It is considered immature by other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanging with the wrong crowd, chased by her cop father. Jenny and her three other friends decided to live on the brutal side until they moved into a rented house where the party was completely out of control. Life can be explored on the other side of fun or dangerous tracks. Annie is saved by Jenny and Brad every time she gets lost. The reality is strongly back where she was killed in a car accident. One marries an older man. It is not easy, sometimes we explore how life is. In fact, you have to be careful about the people around you. For me, I was my own personality, I tend to stay that way! Great music, fantastic plot, this jewel movie! 4 of 5 stars!
