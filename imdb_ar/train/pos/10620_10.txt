At first sight, I found this story less disturbing than at least the tales of other cannon films. After a lot, I think it's one of the best. Some songs are very bad, especially the song of love, but there are two things that show that the film, even singing, is worth the effort. One is the direction of art. Like other Cannon movie fairy tales, this is a beautifully decorated period piece. Each piece of cloth and jewel (both of which have major parts in the plot of this film) looks new and new and contrasts with the simple peasant clothes. Even during the love song, I find myself studying the princess's dress and hair, and she did so wonderfully. The other thing is the comic timing. Much of the cheesy film, but the Emperor's vanity (and ridiculing himself in the end), the suspicious guard, the guard who stalks Nicholas, and the stupid prince, were all very funny and seem to be extremely silly on purpose. The sequence during the song Weave-O compensates for songs that were not very good.
