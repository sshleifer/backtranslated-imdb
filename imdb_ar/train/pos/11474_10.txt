This film is one of the ages. First, I must say after seeing this once, it became one of my favorite films at all. why? Simple; Ben Coquillo (writer and director) put a real piece of art. Where 99.9% of the films these days are pure entertainment, director Ben Coco gives us the truth, gives us a fact, gives us an educational tool to find out why this happened. Spin the mainstream media spin, but Ben Coco seems to be shooting at the schools in his face, able to go anywhere else from the media never before, in the hearts and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. Although it is certainly graphic and terrifying, how can it not be? The gloves bear fruit, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters aside and we are moved to a place where we can find the truth about what happened. Sometimes, it is not just a screw as lively as everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, more human, and we have shown that these boys are us and we are. The community has left them behind and its consequences are terrifying and real. <br /> <br /> Respect your fellow men. A lesson we all have to learn, thank you very much for this film, Mr. Coco, I hope you will continue your career in filmmaking.
