I watched the first series eagerly, but I wondered if I would come back after a long break from it. However, I caught in the first episode of Series 2 and I was hooked again. This is really an excellent shortcut. Leading things like mission: an impossible return in the 1960s. The characters are rounded well, expand with the continuation of the series, they change when they adapt - some more easily than others - with their new surroundings, but they remain smart in their strict character, yet it is best to sympathize with someone you did not think you could feel sorry for , When something happens to them. I hope there are many years of "loss" to look forward to - and I do not really mind too much if I do not get answers to all the secrets!
