It's a really funny film, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. It's a very short film, and I definitely recommend watching it more than once, you'll get it more than the second time. <br /> <br /> It's like a spinal tap but a rap version. He has a lot of attitudes that can be negative in rap films, but they are just a complete experience and not a problem because of the paradox he creates. <br /> <br /> Lots of outstanding bits, one of those types of movies that you will find yourself quoting in lines with your colleagues, will excite laughter. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is the "Gangster in the Middle" section. Great video, awesome!
