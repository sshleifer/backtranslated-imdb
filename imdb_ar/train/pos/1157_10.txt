This is one of the best comics ever! Writing this parody of soap is great and takes a good look, just look at the names of the actors and you'll understand why it's so wonderful. If you're a fan of Kevin Kline, he (as always) offers great performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you will not have any sense of humor.
