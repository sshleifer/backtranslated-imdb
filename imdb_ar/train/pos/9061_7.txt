The fact I liked the film. I remember reading it several times when I was a kid and I was happy to see a movie that was produced around the book. <br /> <br /> I was sitting a kid, a boy and a girl between the ages of 11 and 8 and I had to talk to the girl to see the film. But fortunately, in the end, I was happy to see her, and she wanted to buy it on the DVD once it appeared. <br /> <br /> There were some great and funny moments. The film was not "gross" as I expected it to be ... although it ranks very high on the pay scale ... <br /> <br /> The only thing that I can not find out that's why they had to own a "dilly" line there that Woody did in reference to his part ... which was for me the only moment of surprise (and you can hear adults from the audience enjoying the audible voice at that moment in the movie ) ... I have no idea why he put it in the film; I did not add anything to the actual film except for the Shock Factor / Moments ... otherwise, a very good movie. Nice to see the girl "Pepsi" grew up.
