This film was a fascinating look at the Creole culture and society that few African Americans know. My child is a parenting novelty product whose father was a member of a sex library and a black woman whose father was a former slave. Married outside his culture and was isolated from all his family except one sister who felt sorry for the plight of her brothers; raised eight children during the Great Depression of 1929; provided the family with food whenever possible. Of course, this family helped secretly in fear of previous contacts. My daughter was fascinated by the film. We have made it part of our library.
