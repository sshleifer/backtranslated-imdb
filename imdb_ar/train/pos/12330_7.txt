I have seen this wonderful parody of "The Night of the Living Dead" and I would say it was very awesome and very enjoyable. This film included all the exotic images and landscapes of the original, including the cemetery, the abandoned house, the basement and the front grass. What I particularly like about this film is the comic use of bread and all the bread of the common house enemies with a grudge against them. Come on, we know that toasters, toaster ovens and zippers have made bread a dozen times, and now we should ask for help to defeat the recycled bread. Apart from cheap acting and exaggerating voices, this short horror film is my favorite spoof of Night of the Living Dead, better than the 1990 film Night of the Dead Dead. <br /> <br /> I think that What makes this movie worth watching is how writers and filmmakers took advantage of all the dialogue from the original film and its lessons about bread, including how bread was baked and the remnants of food avoided because they were especially dangerous. Another big reason to love this film is that there is no exception with regard to bad bread, bad bread and even arteries, which is reflected in a hilarious scene that includes a news anchor and an attentive priest. I think the actors are particularly humorous as they attack bread slices (like the car scene). I think the end deserves to be debated. <br /> <br /> Although this is a short period "Dawn of the Day Dawn of the Son of the Bride Return of Revenge of Terror" Attack on Evil, Mutant, Alien, Eating Meat, Hell, Dead Living Dead Part II: Is another impressive ridiculous, still highly recommended as a great horror spoof to do, it seems to be a college filmmakers.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is able to mocking the Night of the Living Dead and still respects filmmakers. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes D movies and a spoof of horror, it's just a great short horror film to watch and learn.
