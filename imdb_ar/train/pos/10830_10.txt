I enjoyed madness more than any film I had seen in years. A successful band from the 1970s decided to try it again. They start playing some of the vehicles in some unfamiliar European places, with fun results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are wonderful. The characters appear in the foreground, especially the main vocalist of heavy metals, makeup and personal problems. The concert was ultimately unrealistic. Go and watch it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
