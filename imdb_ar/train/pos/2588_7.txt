The brothers with mental mobility (yes, indeed) are not only competing for Debra Wenger's pros, but also the secret of their childhood that left them at odds over their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (a fire brigade that acts like a Greek singing choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very much like the one used by American Werewolf in London. All of Wolff's wonderful songs can be obtained by fire but I do not think I will ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), where he put his own piece on rock music. Lady "~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> Best line missing from bidding section BTW ~" Once you get a clown, you will never be back! "<br /> <br /> I like this movie (I ordered a DVD from the United States) and if the comments by this kind of people who are happier with Legally Blond 3 do not stop you - try it :)
