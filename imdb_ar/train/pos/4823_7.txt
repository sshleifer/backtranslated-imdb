It's hard to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress must be majestic and effective; on the other hand, she must show weakness in a difficult position in addition to gathering the courage and decision to overcome the odds, since all the movies around the queens almost line this basic plot. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just as sparkling as Victoria, but she is not performing as well as I want, and does not blame her. I can only feel that this is the assignment of Mills & Boon, compared to a darker and more exciting film about another young queen, Elizabeth. From here, Plante was unable to manage a series of core emotions, at least not to the full extent, because she, she knew, young Victoria. To see Old Victoria, see Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Valle is an interesting choice for the film's director. The last time he did was C.R.A.Z.Y, which was excellent and pushed him to fame. It was a very different film but I remember it looks great and maybe this is the main similarity between the two films. But while writing Vallee C.R.A.Z.Y. , This was written by Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed Joseph Park, the story of this film was less interesting. Soon all government policies went awry. Perhaps it was less attractive because there was no prospect of the overthrow of the monarchy. I just say.
