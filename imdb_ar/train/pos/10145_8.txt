This is a really charming old fashion film. Fantastic locations and the situation is one of those old Preston sturgess movies. If you want to watch a movie does not require a lot of other things, then sit back and relax this is the case. The acting is good, and I really liked Michael Respoli. It was in the Rounders, too. While I was asleep. The rest of the cast is fun. This is what happens when two people are about to get married with someone they really love on the weekends planning their own weddings. I know ... it seems kooky ... but it is as well. This makes it interesting to watch. Make your girl friend either hug you or leave you, but you will know at least.
