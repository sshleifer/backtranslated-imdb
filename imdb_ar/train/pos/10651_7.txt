Some movies simply should not be remodeled. This is one of them. In itself is not a bad film. But failed to capture the flavor and terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as always, and most of the cast members, except Owen Wilson, did not bring the right sense to Luke's character. But the main mistake in this release is that he moved away from the story of Shirley Jackson in his attempts to be great and lost some suspense in the previous film in the exchange of special effects more enjoyable. Again I will say that in itself is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the fight of terrorism in the older version much more.
