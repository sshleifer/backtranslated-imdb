"No Importance" is far from a great film, from a play, directed by Nick Rogge. In the Roeg film scheme, this is higher than most of his works after "Do not Look Now", which is characterized by the wise use of Teresa Russell as the lead actress. It's actually very good here, away from the problem in other Roeg movies like "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As the "actress," Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, imagining her as a sullen, but loving siren. She plays well alongside Michael Emile in the role of Einstein, which is excellent at the very least. It's like an impressive part, and although Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, she's certainly attractive enough to make the ring a real part. The other players are enough, if not as much as Emile and Russell. Intelligent text that is well applicable by Roeg is directed, but certainly not brilliantly, like "Walkabout" or "Performance." As in the subsequent Roeg films, tends to rely too much on the mysterious and unimportant past memories, which add very little to the film. In many ways, the film would have worked better as a shorter piece (for example, 60 minutes). Still, the film is very acceptable, acceptable. Sometimes excellent, but generally lacking. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
