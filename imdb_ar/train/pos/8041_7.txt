Despite some negative comments on the IMDb film, it is still worth seeing as this is a story about survival and intimate friendship between two different men with different minds while on a difficult mission in the Panamanian jungle. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Luis Losa leads us to watch this thrilling story in Panama. The film takes some good moments as Pickett, a Marine, picks up a newly arrived man recently sent to try to eliminate the head of a notorious drug cartel and the corrupt army general who may be the next president. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what it cost him to achieve. <br /> <br /> Miller, the arrogant man who has just arrived in the jungle and into the guerrilla war between the military and drug emperors against the infiltrator. US intelligence officers are learning a valuable lesson from Beckett. What sounds good in theory, irrelevant in the forest. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger, actor does not record much, as evidenced in this film, but in the context of the film, he is true as a man of a few words. Billy Zan plays Miller's role in doing what he can through a role that gives him no glory until the decisive end. <br /> <br /> For movie lovers of motion, "Sniper" offers 112 minutes of action with a little more trivial film rendering.
