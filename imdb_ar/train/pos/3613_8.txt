When I came out "Girlfight", I complimented reviews on it, but I did not go around to see it. I finally saw it when it was introduced to the video, and understood the incandescent comments. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a high school in the middle of the Jewish Quarter. We quickly get to know the student Diana Guzman (Michel Rodríguez). She has a bad expression of her face, and any idea of ​​Diana that we may derive from this expression is quickly enhanced when she enters into a fight. When Diana has a problem with this, we meet her father, an aggressive type in itself; obviously, we can not blame Diana completely. <br /> <br /> But the film really resumes, as a new idea emerges in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this dark existence. Her older brother has already entered boxing, but her father will probably not agree. Only Diana herself is the one who can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only in the first few minutes did I determine that I was in a highly adventurous movie other than Hollywood, but John Siles' short appearance in a supportive role really confirmed that. Even before you reach any boxing scenes, you feel hit in your face to see the hideous life of Diana. When they finally reach the main story of the film, there will be no turning back. <br /> <br /> In general, I would definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a way to show that someone is trying to do something by themselves has been a kind of cliche in cinema for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Child"), but I still think he did it a big job here with her. In fact, this may be bringing this species to a climax. really good. It is unfortunate that Michelle Rodríguez wasted herself in Hollywood films after this film.
