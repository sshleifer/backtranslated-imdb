(Warning: Little spoilers) <br /> <br /> I ran in this first part and watched it from there, I do not know what it is or what the plot is. It certainly drew my attention. I did not even know it was based on a real story! The man who got used to the dirty act came out like a very nice man who had reached his head for a crooked girl; I had to ask how true this picture was. Anyone who kills a husband and wife during their sleep can not be quite pleasant. I still have some sympathy for him, where he has been prepared and taken advantage of; <br /> <br /> My main complaint is with the end (here comes the biggest spoiler! Skip this paragraph if you do not want to know it). A few minutes before its end, there seems to be no way to discover the truth. The way I found out was "biting," but my question was: How was the police convinced? The film did not tell us that, and seemed rather appropriate in the absence of an explanation of how they were persuaded to do so. <br /> <br /> I think the way they dealt with it was for dramatic purposes, and the omission of interpretation gave an aura of suspense to the crucial scene that otherwise would have been there (we already knew what the scene was and what was happening) With Brad in it). <br /> Otherwise, this is a very good movie. Give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm interested in knowing the facts of the real situation. <br /> <br /> There is something else: the film was made in 1996. Some reviews here seem to be dealing with it as a newer film. <br /> <br /> PS Marj Sesto is beautiful. I have never seen her before. She can act a little too (always a plus sign in her line, LOL).
