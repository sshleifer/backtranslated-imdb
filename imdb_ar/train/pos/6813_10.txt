Like others, I have seen and studied most of the books and films related to the killing of anarchy, including some dramas based on themes and works of psychological legends of the participants - including Capote himself. For Capote, I can not forgive him because he deliberately withheld the confessions of Barry Smith, his marks and writings, even from defense lawyers. I think the facts and facts "kept by" Capote for his "book", which asked Capote for two guilty verdicts and the death penalty, would certainly continue to successfully defend madness for Percy Smith even under the old McNaughton rule. Capot was unable to write another major literary work after "In Cold Blood". Shame and guilt. In my opinion, he encouraged and planned the brutal death penalty to provide the stunning end required for his book / drama. For him, both men might die for the success of his book. The book had to justify itself by pretending to be horrified by the death penalty. His actions and stigmatization confirmed that the conclusion of cold ice. <br /> <br /> Cabot's book is not a fact. It's not realistic or journalistic. It is drama and melodrama imbued with a creative psychic imagination. What most people consider the virtues of the first contemporary film is the stark images of Capote's mind, which may have been the most bloody side of all. No wonder viewers are ridiculed but necessarily prefer Blake's performance. This actor is a nightmare of Cabot's dishonest imaginations. <br /> <br /> So who says how the killers should play? Who will judge what can make a fundamental psychological trauma of courtesy and excessive kindness "to kill now"? I agree with the few who see in the work of Eric Roberts wonderful performance, Shakespeare in their range, but he played with a heartfelt sincerity. Anthony Edwards takes the most dangerous "position positions" to create an abandoned Hickok; but he is monolithic and boring, with only a few observations in his television set. Roberts is nearly four dimensions, adding physical weakness and suffering to the strong animal body, a creature of Frankenstein who thinks of poetry and knows exactly what not to do. Like Leopold apropos Loeb, Robert Perry Smith is in desperate love with a wicked man. Lula Hickock or a man of his own, Perry Smith had not brought his mental mind into a world of terror. He fears himself more than anything else in life. <br /> <br /> Given the liberation from the grip of Cabot's death on the awareness of the killings in chaos, Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personalities and minds to create different personalities. And a new production of drama. The same facts, some of the same lines of the case record, but deeper and more complex, with very deep psychological stress - Roberts is actually very good at this fluent insanity of fluid so much that it shows physically and vertically at every moment how little consciousness he has where or who he is. <br /> <br /> What many of our reviewers dislike about this movie, Roberts in particular, is that cold-blooded murder does not appear the way they expect and are manipulated to claim it. That is because we see here an "explanation of life and death" much more realistic than can be created by Capote - a real tragedy. <br /> <br /> The real killer in cold blood, Mr. Capote, and his "non-fictional novel" artistic hypocrisy does not control these interpretations and presentations. <br /> <br /> If the effect of "cold blood" and the influence of Cabot on life, literature and truth as scientists say, it will take courage, as well as talent to portray the truth, or a copy of the truth, is not the rank, the cowardly lie emanating from the abyss In Cabot.
