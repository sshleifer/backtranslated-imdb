This is one awesome movie! I played all the Nancy Drew games and read the books, and I did not expect the film to be very funny and funny! If you do not hear about Nancy Drew, read the Secret of the Old Clock so you can get used to Nancy, then you can watch the movie, because in the film they do not really show the characters. Names quickly. ;) I enjoyed my entire family and this plot was very exciting. This is the final return to Nancy Drew's previous films, which Nancy Drew's representative seems to be incompatible with. This movie is pretty much like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. so cold! Nancy Drew lovers, you should watch this!
