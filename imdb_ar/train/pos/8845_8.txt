The beginning of this film is a little blurry and confusing too, but sit tight, because you are on a journey in your life. The concept is convincing, with interesting devices used to tell the overall story. There are wonderful shows everywhere, so Philippe Seymour Hoffman was the best surprise there. Ethan Hawk also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. Mr. Lumette's output is wonderful. The film has a sense of respect for the risks in the story, but unlike the majority of popular films that inhabit the scene today, this film is exciting and based on relationships rather than special effects or plug-ins of the product. . You will be rewarded a lot on the investor time in this film.
