I think this movie was a good reasonbaly. It is strange that Olsen's twins are 13 years old and have friends. I enjoyed them a lot when they were young children at Full House. Anyway, it was a good casting and the film was fairly funny. I kind of mixed all the switch places and their names. It's just a version of the older version of It Takes Two.
