I make one apology for this film: there are many distant close associates, and if that bothers you more than stamina, it's fair enough. They paid me the Marmi in the first ten minutes or so. But then, I reached a truce with terrible cinematic photography; before the film ended a long time, I stopped paying attention. This comedy is so rich that it can not be easily destroyed. It is hilarious, it is intelligent, and the comic connection of all actors is flawless, and although many peers begin their characters through the cold fish's eye lens - they may not care too much - it is able to offer warmth to them. "Masked Men", in fact, is not only more entertaining, not only smarter, but also deeper, than anyone who seems to have given it credit for being. The jokes in Austin Powers movies, for example, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also toothless. The "mysterious man" spelling is full of when something is worth nibbling gently when it is not there. Do not make fun of anything old. That is why, contrary to what some critics have said (I must consider unobserved), ideas have never run out. <br /> <br /> "Big" heroes are an attractive bunch. Sure, they are second class, but they are not second class only. The most likely blue, for example, does nothing but throw knives at people, which is not good at it. On the other hand, it is not a bad comedy. He is the best in his limited field of most people, and practiced diligently. He is not a clown, making him a more entertaining character than he was. If Superman is Christ in the head, the masked men are all half-gods from the slopes of Mount Olympus, in the heads. Funnier is also much more endearing.
