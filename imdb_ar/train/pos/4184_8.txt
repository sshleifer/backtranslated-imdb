Some war films succeed where other films do not succeed and can be judged through a variety of angles. The human angle, where you can feel the harsh feelings (the horror of being attacked, the intimate friendship among the soldiers, the hard trials that people face while fighting, etc.) are films I find always compelling. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies in which you feel connected to characters in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is also successful at this level. He speaks of "supreme honor" and this honor does the right thing. These twenty-three soldiers did the right thing, and they were honored and recognized in a way that was not fully compatible with Western thought, but it was, in the end, a true honor story. Unforgettable movie. Based on the real story.
