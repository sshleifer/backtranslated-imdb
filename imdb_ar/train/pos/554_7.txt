(Contains minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> It is interesting how Anthony James uses James Stewart here. Of course, many remember Stuart like George Bailey from Frank Kapra's "It's a Wonderful Life", so it's easy to find similarities between the two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life," Billy sees the world as if he had never been born. In "The Far Country," Jeff Webster of Stuart recognizes that he does not participate to help anyone else (except himself) see essentially the same thing: a world where there is no (for all practical matters). <br /> <br /> By not getting involved (and trying not to pay attention to anyone), Webster has to see those who can not help them but care about the hurt, are pushed in their place, and even killed while standing beside him doing nothing. This reminds us of the scenes of George Bailey watching the world turn upside down because he also decided not to engage in his non-birth. <br /> <br /> Both movies end with the same picture - a close-up of the ringing bell. Stuart, by changing his philosophy of non-intervention, appeared to have received "wings."
