Outside the home is a different world and the family is struggling to transcend the line between parents' authority, their hopes and their dreams. <br /> <br /> This period was captured; switches, bakelite light, Georgian floorboard, photo rails, wallpaper, short skirts, boys, cheeky, small car, shiny modern hills .... <br /> <br> /> The site was captured; icy wind blew on the rocky landscape, the walls of the local stone, society, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there are many. Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, power, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deception, mexmo, ethics, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice and horror Acceptance, revelation, comedy and paternity are all there. (And in any particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a woven expression rich in family tensions that are now relevant. The fact that some of these are not dealt with directly is a testimony to the positions of today, but the fact that they are all here is testimony to the skill of acting, story and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is anything bad about this film, it is that all this deep and deep-rooted tension is finally swept away. You may be wrong to understand - the depression and depression that many teenagers feel does not really disappear if they deal with it (**) - the film may try to send even that message - worth doing. <br /> <br /> Is the film trying to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents are also struggling, everyone is wrong, everyone learns, things change, and the struggle can end happily. Parents: Do not try hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their wellbeing. <br /> <br /> It seems simple, is not it? Sometimes, the movie looks as well, but then you will notice the magnitude of the challenge and the detection. <br /> <br /> The movie is classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the same problems.
