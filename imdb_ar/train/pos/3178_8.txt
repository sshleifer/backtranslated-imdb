The film "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones drives the viewer into a round of redemption because the main character regains control of the wheel and adjusts his life. Adam Jones found an innovative and refreshing way to empower his character and achieve what is more important. These facts become clear to both the characters and the viewers as you laugh and laugh at the credits with them. Simple / attractive settings / fashion keeps you informed of what you'll see next. You can only smile and laugh at the alien that occurs in this film. I can not wait for a freshman effort. It's a matter of time before Jones hits again. Bravo!
