I remember the first time I saw this movie - I was at the office during the weekend and the TV was working on noise in the background. But I found myself more and more engaged in this film that I never saw or heard about, until I completely absorbed it. "The Question of Life and Death" (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the United States), exhilarating, convincing, quirky and animated, all in one beautifully written, well-behaved and ideally designed package. It's a classic game already classified in Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, gone with the wind, citizen Kane, fire vehicles. Why did not you receive the same public notice and promo? Fortunately, some insider critics put them on the "Top 100 Songs of All" lists. There is hope - Fantasia in 1940 was not a big success in the sixties of the last century, was the Wizard of Oz in the box office game, but he was a great success on television. Buy it - rent it - watch it - order it! I will not be disappointed!
