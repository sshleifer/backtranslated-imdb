The film is very interesting and interesting. The similarities of David Lynch (who literally quotes the red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the house keeper in this film called Mrs. Grupac, as in the case of the monastery of Brozis ...) are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear signs of the past Colonialism of Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the film I can not describe clearly: This colonialism is an important part, such as the inability to deal with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character is also a central issue, and its pursuit of social communication and love. These are the symbolic features that I deduced from the film, but they are in fact not just impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you try to follow the story without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover a very wonderful movie full of wonderful images (the beautiful popups of the Beatles, the larvae and other bad insects are rotated with a great dream sequence as well as the dark atmosphere lends to the movie Extra pattern). You might say I did not get the film, but I was watching hypnosis for an hour and a half, and I was very impressed with the visual quality and the wonderful ambiguity.
