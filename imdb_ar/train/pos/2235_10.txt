I liked this film very much because it is a true story that takes place in the Amazon, part of the world that has always intrigued me. I think an intensive model of the book was published in Reader's Digest shortly after the actual event. <br /> <br /> Because I am a "little mutation," the character and actress are my contemporaries, and for this reason I am related to the film. I also think that the film is useful for teaching survival skills if you observe the following personal scenes of currents leading to the river and coastal settlements where you can get help as well as other survival techniques. Most important is its desire to stay and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope viewers will learn something from him, as well as his vision of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I hope the movie will be released in VHS and DVD soon and I would like to add it to my video collection. It should also be shown on satellite channels.
