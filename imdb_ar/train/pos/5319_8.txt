Forget that this is a movie "B". Forget it in many ways that are out of date. Instead, author Ida Lubinu gave much credit to a subject that was at that time a taboo in Hollywood. As far as I know, this was the first film about rape and the emotional and mental effects this crime has on its victims. <br /> <br /> Although most actresses are pedestrians at best, Mala Bowers, who was then 18 or 19 years old, performed excellently throughout the shocked young woman Psychic, Ann, trying to escape from "her shame". Based on her work in this film, she surprised me that she did not have a more successful acting career. Andrew Andrews also has some beautiful moments as a minister who continues to help her. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lubinu, who is clearly working on a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes such as seeking through the streets and alleyways leading to rape, and police the following lineup. I made a sweet and a mirror and left me wondering if Ann really could have a normal life again.
