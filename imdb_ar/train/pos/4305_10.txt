Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique urban piece, where the whole conspiracy may fail to convey much. <br /> <br /> The main theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty of people's lives from every race, background and station. But to declare that the subject of the film would be a terrible reduction of its scope. Similarly, it is futile to place a pigeon in a particular species. <br /> <br /> The film contains folders that can be said, although probably different sizes for each viewer, and say it all in an unsatisfactory way from many angles, in the end, I can not even define its central message myself. <br /> <br /> However, they work with this precision laser; each support and line of dialogue and music in the background contribute to a broad mood and a strong message, I feel surprised and happy after each watch. Still does not feel at all claustrophobic. Fawar film with great team and everything works.
