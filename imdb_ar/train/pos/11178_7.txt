The Little Spoiler <br /> <br /> A little taken lightly by Stephen King. It is not ideal, however, even if the performance of the Arles by Dale Medkiv and Dennis Crosby is better, there are still elements of the mysterious story that have been mishandled. The land of the ancient burial of Mikmak, Rachel's sick sister, and Jacob Marley-Victor Pascoe never converge on anything coherent, and the film in places feels confused and tired. But a few horror films are really perfect, and what this film may lack in other areas is compensated for its willingness to shock. The movie "Pet Sematary" may actually be one of the most serious horror films in modern memory, with his deadly zombie child and his futile portrayal of Zelda. It's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's unjustified - yet it makes us feel disgusted by anger in a way that horror movies can not be safer. Add to this one of the best performances by Fred Goen and the smart direction of Marie Lambert, and you have a scary film very sick - even at the end. Highly recommended for genre lovers. 7.5 out of 10
