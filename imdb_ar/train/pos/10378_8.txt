This movie is an hour or more of good entertainment and has some really funny moments. I love Matt's personality as well as small. They looked more attractive and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is the case for his cousin is not good), and provides a woman police and woman cyclists Blonde candy confectionary candy. I must say that I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Australian representative, Eric Pana. My favorite part was the scene of the brothel, and I love it. In general, I liked the movie and would get a rating of 8. But the penalty was disappointed. They were curled in the side foot, rather than bursting the appropriate ligaments. <br /> <br /> I'm joking, of course. :)
