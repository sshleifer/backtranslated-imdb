This is one of the entertainment movies that I have seen. Her moments were blunt, but she was full of magic. It's an Altmanesque movie, a great physical humor, and the friendships were a pleasure to watch, and there's a part of life that most of us can communicate with. I can say with a measure of honesty that I was scared of Steve Carrell's nipple ... I really was. Surprisingly, this is a good, shameless comedy, which is basically about love, and many relationships that we may find ourselves on our way. Katharine Kenner was as wonderful as Triche, and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but they were very friendly and fun. The idea that they suspect Karel was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. But the simple truth is that he wanted to be in love first. Original, charming, and very funny. Highly recommended.
