This excellent drama was my thrill all the time. I could not take my eyes out of the screen for a second because each word continued to connect the pieces to this puzzling killing. This film really touched me because it showed how hard life is. I really screamed at the end (I do not want to give it up!) It also allows me to realize how hard people can be when it comes to killing. <br /> <br /> The cast was also good. The only bad actress is the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director did not. I say this because he found someone who did not look like Ann Marie Fahi herself.
