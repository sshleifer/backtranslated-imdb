Most martial arts films in Hong Kong in the 1970s and 1980s barely work as films; there are usually a few well-planned sequences of fighting, but the plot is largely tied to filling gaps between those nodes - such as pornographic films. <br /> <br /> But this step does a lot of things well. More importantly, there is the direction and design of the dances, which limits each fighter to "style" - it really depends on Chinese acrobatic and comedian dramas, but the effect works. Second, there is the language of the camera, which uses some impressive techniques (even by current standards), changing the real-time projection speeds to slow motion, and non-filtered views to the filter to describe the story's direction towards the past or Towards the future. <br /> <br /> The least public, but the most powerful and unexpected, is construction. The winner of this contest is determined by the "reveals" story. The writer sets up a game in which the personality of the leader does not know who he is looking for, the same situation in which the viewers find themselves. One by one, who determines who, at the same rate as we find who is who. All this follows the arc of tragedy / noir. The end tends towards the paradox, a "sting". Things are much smarter than we usually come out of this kind. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"The Five Poisons" is the "Killer Snake Killers" model from Tarantino of Kill Bell.
