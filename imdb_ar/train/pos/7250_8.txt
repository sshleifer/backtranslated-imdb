I read the book first, when I was a young teenager, then watched the film late one night. About a year ago, I checked on IMDb and discovered that no copies were available. Then I clicked on the web and found the site showing War Films, so glad I did, asked for a copy and sat down, and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion to truly enjoy the movie I suggest you read, get a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book was no longer printed, but I traced it across the e-bay. The author, Alan White, was a comedian / shadowwriter during the Second World War who participated in various covert operations. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I think gives the book and film originality. I have not only given the film ten because of the nature of the film's ending, not as good as the book. There are some conspiracy lines that are different from the book too, which is strange because the book is not about the vast nature of the war but about the individual in the war. The film illustrates this very well. I have a copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him see it, in this order. <br /> <br /> If you can track the book and movie it is definitely worth it and I just wish it was more easily available for more reading and seeing, one of my best war movies, ever!
