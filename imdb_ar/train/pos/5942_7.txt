I really liked Batman: the dead ended, and I think he had a theatrical feeling and that given the chance Colora could make a great film. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story line, or the possible storyline, was very good but because of the special influences and influences I felt that this would make a TV movie or a good TV show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not a good Superman. In fact I thought that, in his short appearance, he did a good job for Clark Kent. Sorry, I'm not thinking of SuperMan as buff. Kent suit masked size. Batman may have bodybuilder body but Superman does not have. Tuned is no doubt but not wholesale. Anyway, I did not care about all his transformations, and it seems that his transformation from you to Superman looked like a cloudy. Now this may not only be O'Hearn's fault, Collora should have some credit for poor scripting and direction. <br /> <br /> Second, the special effects of flying were flying in her mind. Superman flies in the sky. If it is clear that this Superman flew near the ground, with telephone cables and buildings visible above it. I do not think there are any full body shots of Superman. Obviously there must be harnessing and forging O'Hearn's support on his lower trunk. <br /> <br /> In general, the trailer was good. I might pay for seeing a movie, if it was produced at all, and I would be sure to watch it on TV. The story of the story is an alliance between Lakescorp and Wayne Industries, and Superman is jealous of Lewis's attraction with Wayne, Lex and Tupas to beat Superman and the strength between Batman and Superman is a good idea. I'm sure there's a bigger budget and the approval of Collora and his entire company, so O'Hearn can make a good film. Definitely one of the best of the most comical-based nonsense coming out of Hollywood recently.
