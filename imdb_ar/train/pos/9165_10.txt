This must be the best adaptation I've ever seen is my favorite and I think it stays very close to the book. What makes this really necessary, even though key representatives have been selected. Timothy Dalton is the most wonderful Rochester I have seen on the screen of brood and tragic, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shame and affection like Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know about it) is that Jane Eyre, a young and ordinary girl, is a teacher at a girls' school in the 19th century who advertises her services as a newspaper educator. Nanny in the Grand Palace Thornfield Hall to teach Adele the young wing of the halls of the mysterious and esteemed owner Mr. Rochester. As the months pass, he falls in love with Jane and puts some positions into effect to try to find out if Jane is as mad with him as he is with her. However, there is still a mystery to be discovered at Thoranfeld Hall when its effects are devastating. This is an impressive and well-behaved drama with beautiful locations and fantastic fashion in addition to what I said before and he behaves excellently especially from Zeila and Timothy.
