To say a bleak film is not necessarily a bad thing. I am quite willing to watch a bleak movie if there is a point to be raised and this is definitely his movie. It is often a tragic story for a Chinese man and his family to experience many years of hardship and plenty. But I have to warn you that this may be about the most depressing film that comes out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because the lives of peasants in China were very difficult. Be prepared to watch clips of famine, death and disease. <br /> <br /> About the only negative other than the lingering tone of misery is that Paul Mony performs the role. While an exceptionally gifted man, it is a real shame that Hollywood always resorts to people of European origin to play Asian shows during this age. If you care at all, it is clear that Money is wrong for the part.
