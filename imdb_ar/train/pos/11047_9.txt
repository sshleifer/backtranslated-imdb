I waited a few years before this film was finally released in England, but I was very pleased in many ways when I finally saw it. There are a lot of wonderful things to film, to start acting. It's not something I desperately need in horror, but the people in this film are doing well. This scenario which is constantly controlled and interesting, with a rather nice Lovecraftian feeling, gives the film a real solid spine. Add to that doses the images of a surreal nightmare, sometimes gruesome humor and winning films. He has my favorite kind of ultra-gore, supernatural spots. Also, Marcus characters, transgender Angry Bodybuilders and Daisy, mentally retarded lovers / playwrights are really awful and sometimes disturbing, and given away, nothing goes to the craziness of the crazies who grow well with repeated Freudian tones. This is one of the most impressive horror films, more shocking or there is more than anything that Hollywood can produce. My only presence was that I wanted the finish to be darker, but it still works, so, in general, I recommend it to the horror buffs.
