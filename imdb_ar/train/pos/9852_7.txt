Not a day goes by without a new animated movie released on your computer, so we now have opportunities to see more than a few nice effects. After watching the Ice Age, I felt that this did not have much impact on me from some other films of this kind. <br /> <br /> But this is because I am a great man now, and I'm sure this is a very fun movie for kids (maybe even 14). The story is very simple, the actors are "funny" in a funny way, without any rude or complex humor. Even the "evil" lovely, big thin cat with those funny teeth. The story has a happy ending, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are endangered in a sad way) but great for kids. Regardless of some battles, no one dies (not even when the mammoth is broken down several times), which makes a sense of karateum. <br /> <br /> The animation part of the computer is beautiful but there is nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoon feelings, when you feel like walking in a beautiful board or pages of comedy. [There is a lot of work though!] <br /> <br /> There was some depression that made me smile - I agree, the creators tried to please these adults - but it is difficult to identify them and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, Since it does not feel in harmony with the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a beautiful movie, but in Disney it's ideal for babies and animals for children. If you do not hate cute animals that make funny things, see them at least once.
