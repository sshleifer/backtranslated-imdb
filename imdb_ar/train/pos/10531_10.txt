I like this film. My friend Marcos and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had a desire to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled upon this wonderful film. We had no idea what it would be like, but it was amazing. 2 Excellent. I liked how the film was filmed, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that makes you think too, I strongly suggest you run quickly to a local video store and find this movie. I would like to tell you some of my favorite things, but that might spoil the film for you, so I will not. This movie is definitely on the list of the top 10 good movies. Do you really think nothing bouncy?
