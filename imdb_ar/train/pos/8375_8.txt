<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a great little movie, some groups are bad and misrepresentative, but the special effects are very good for a movie of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is over 10 years old and has been made cheaply in the first place, so you can not complain much about the bad parts. So just relax and watch a great movie with big robots.
