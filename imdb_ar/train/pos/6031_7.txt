About 200 members of the Cleveland Society, Ohio, USA, named Cinematek, met on August 19, 2000 to watch the original film of Michael Angelo Antonioni's 1970 film "Zapreski Point". The film director, John Ewing, who does a great job of getting the best of his series, has already shared with the audience that this print was exclusively for Italy to show. <br /> <br /> The audience was suddenly retained as the film revealed the artist on the huge panoramic screen. I saw this wonderful print, as shown in the way Antonioni intended, to make you realize that this is a modern art work. It was more appropriate that this series located at the Cleveland Insitwit Art Center at Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's works were created for the cinematic scene. His beautiful balance of images, stunning use of colors, and sweeping dance movements are all works of a real artist, using the screen as his canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the public can understand the "Zabriskie Point". When his narrative is revealed, it becomes clear that this work is not about the story itself, but rather about presenting an impressionist artist with transient images of his subject. Setting up some of the most turbulent activities of the 1960s provides only a dramatic engine for the artist's sweeping faculty. <br /> <br /> Anthony does not adhere to traditional narrative standards, and can stop at any time to creatively match an ornate event. The audience went willingly with the flow of his wonderful imagination, as his huge picture on a huge canvas put one in Rapt's attention. Although the public may have been incidentally involved in interpersonal relationships, he realized that the issue here was human impossibility, which was the recurring theme of the director. <br /> <br /> He also realized that there is no lower quality or lower quality than the original version in Cinemascope that can correct this particular view. So the audience was very grateful to present "Zabriskie Point" in its stunning original format, and burst into applause in the end.
