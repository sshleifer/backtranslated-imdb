Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very interesting SCI-FI film from Japan. I noticed a lot of disillusioned people who liked Versus for this director or his third film Azumi. I heard that they were blood-drenched movies with swords and zombies and all sorts of good things. Frankly I went to the video store to get Versus, but I was fine with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a beginning to finish working from wall to wall, Alive will not be your choice. There are a lot of procedures even though they come as a full-hour profit from the accumulation driven by personalities. I personally think it was done well and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course some conspiracy is as absurd as with many motion films in SCI-Fi and I think that translation using the term "foreign body" can be replaced by parasitic for more effect. This movie is brutal when it needs to be very dim and does not need to be applied. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget pretty low and confined all the events in one underground building (they took a signal from the cube) but the film does not suffer from it. Another reward for this film is the intense Gothic fantasies that are made with great artistic taste during many of the flashback and dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
