Potential spoilers: Not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I could only get mixed feelings about the whole movie. It's definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing in it that gives you the same feeling as the Lion King. For those who have not read the other reviews, the story revolves around how to interview Timon and Pumba, and how they affect events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> There are already some very funny jokes in a movie. My favorite part is when they show the husband raises Simba. However, for me the worst parts must be when they show Timon and Bumba interfering directly in the events of origin. I can never take a look at the "circle of life" sequence or "Can you feel love tonight" in the same way again (I'm fine with the sequence "I just can not wait to be a king"). <br /> <br /> Voice talent is excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a great job, as does Matthew Broderick, the man with his companion and hyena. Even the actor who does the young Simba looked like Jonathan Taylor Thomas to me. But why did they even include a voice representative for Zazu? He literally had only two lines, neither of which was absolutely necessary. Add additions to Julie Cavner and Jerry Stiller just to the talent, although you still do not hear the sound of Timon Mum and do not think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that seem to be out of proportion to the original, one that comes to mind being when the Rock of Pride finally comes. How did they have time to fit the initial fight with hyenas? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, you can only feel that for a set of discs, special features are not available in particular. It can easily fit the suspension, or the aspect ratio of the first disc. I enjoyed the game "Who Wants to Become the King of the Forest", even if it was the most shameful example of the cross-promotion I've seen in my life. Some questions are already difficult. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, although it is not as good as TLK or TLK2.
