Although I love this film, I can barely see it, it's very real. So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my computer bank. I remembered that clearly, but I just wanted to know if I could find something I had not seen before ........ I did not do: that's because it's true to me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" wrote the age of commentators with their summary. I'm all that! It is quite clear that most of those who have commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born yet. They mention other films by John Voight and Dustin Hoffman later on. I will be quite frank: I am 82 years old. If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll realize that I was a professional actor for 60 of those years. She also appeared in the film - she never met me, even if I was familiar with the night club. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film? You bet that I do !! .... <br /> <br /> .... I'm not shy. If you do not run in some of them, this is your loss - but, there is a great chance for you, but you did not know it. Many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters may surprise you. There should not be many secret actors / actresses who came out of the "Midnight Cowboy" backgrounds. Who is the referee? I can name many of the older BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the abnormal streets in many cities and were not much affected by the time they spend there. Do not judge, because these human beings, like all of us - love, courage, compassion, compassion, intelligence, humility: names are named, they are all there, regardless of the form of the package. <br /> <br /> The "trivia" about Hoffman is actually begging the streets to prove he can play a "Ratzo" gem - you can see him driving all over Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name a lot of male stars who stood in the streets and toured bars for money. Although last night's 26-year-old nightclub was world-renowned and legitimate, I could name some of the huge stars that must have always been chased in our back street, and look forward to getting a pickup. /> This should not be surprising today, although it certainly happened in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. He woke up and smelled the flowers. It smelled less sweet because it had a different color. <br /> <br /> Some of the "users" thought that Joe Pack had been haunted by his grandmother. Although I saw him in her bed with her boyfriend, I did not find any situations for that. Believe it or not, children do not always have their own rooms - because this is a must today should tell you something strange might happen in the main bedroom. Who to work for? Hoffman may have asked for a change in the streets, but some "users" have pointed out that John Voight was not a major star to shoot "Midnight Cowboy" - his actual salary will surprise you. I think it was stolen! No one can doubt the clarity he placed in his role, or that he made him the star of a great work such as "Salvation." He identified a strong man who conquered his demons and was his best: Few people commented that he was naturalized in this film. Perhaps the end of the sixties was one of the first films that were very open, but society was always hip. <br /> <br /> Nor did I find any sexual anomalies between Ratzo and Joe - they were clearly opposites, unattractive to one another. They found a much higher relationship - true friendship. If you do not understand it at the end of the movie, you're wasting your time. Confused "Joe", but the sincerity without shame was obvious. Yes, Voight deserved the Oscar for this role - a role that John Wayne could not pull out of, and was handsome in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them a wonderful. Wayne got his Oscar. Each character in this film was beautifully identified - if you do not think they still exist, you're wrong. "the party" ? - Bring some "youth" attended by young people ..... if you can enter. Look at the ranks of people trying to get into hot clubs - you'll see every horrible character. <br /> <br /> Brenda Vecaro was an example of elegant society women who sometimes have to get to fine details. If I was shocked by her wonderful work, I thought, "This is not real," look at the "ladies" today who live on the edge of reputation ... and admire him. <br /> <br /> The brutal "Joe" displayed in the old man's robbery, unfortunately, is also a part of life. You should not overlook it, but it is not very different from any violence. Joe has clearly set his goal - in this case, I would have delivered the money faster than I asked. This is one of the scenes that makes this film a breakthrough, and I do not watch it. I feel sad for both of them ..... <br /> <br /> Certainly John Schlesinger was so familiar with this wonderful opening of the eye - Valdo Salt did not write a clue. Anyone with any part of the screen should realize that he was making history, and he should be proud of his honesty. Perhaps "only in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers have no role in presenting them to the public. Not searching does not mean it does not exist - give me the truth every time. Bravo! For everyone ......
