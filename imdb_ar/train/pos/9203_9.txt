This is one of Dev Anand's films that has made great and distinctive films for the Indian film industries like Jewel thief and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), it's simple, as the brother searches for his missing sister. The sister joined the hippies who smoked from the pot and chanted Harry Rama Harry Krishna. However, the film portrays a few of the important events the world experienced in the 1970s. Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom, their escape from service, the family, the adoption of anything new such as Eastern religion (which was new for whites). I've been dealing with it perfectly. The decorations gave her the best and Dave as usual was remarkable. The songs are the best-used (unlike what's misused for owning songs) in this movie. They were not corrupted. One perfect example is "Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo". Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but this is not the essence of the film. Devji, who believes in a different film industry, has succeeded in showing what he wants to show here. Must see to experience the Hippie culture, Nepal is beautiful than 70.
