I have watched this movie twice now and I think it is very good for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (Filmed in 1947) Dr. Hurdahal explains his theory of the migration of South American Indians to the Polynesia Islands by the raft that fell from the big balsa trees. This documentary follows Dr. Herdal and her crew during their selection of Balsa trees in Eucidore and floats with them in the river to the Pacific Ocean for assembly in Peru. Embarked on a 101-day naval adventure to test the power of their primitive rites, which remained only through the means available to the citizens of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
