There is a certain genius behind this film. I was laughing all the time. The scene was in the sex office by phone, discussing how to cure love doppelganger a nice attempt at this genius / humor. Implementation is weak, but you can see the writer's message and they have some talent. The doppelganger division was finally like ... "Well, you did not quite expect it but let's see what the film says." Surely it is ridiculous, but it is a very sweet and cohesive idea indeed for the story in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Is the purpose of the film to be logical or amusing or communicating emotionally? I was easily bored by many films, but this film kept my attention all the time. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have some biographical roots, but that's just a guess. Bad awful, but good. I'm looking for other movies made by this person (with more experience).
