If you like Long Way Round, you'll almost enjoy it too. It's educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charlie shares the screen with two impressive team mates, two eccentric mechanics, two excellent photographers and Ross. Ewan appears in a few appearances but Charlie really pulls him apart. It is funny, attractive and still a pool of tension and suspicion. cool stuff! <br /> <br /> The series ends in 7 episodes. Like LWR, preparation is almost as interesting as a race. Although it covers the ins and outs of the race well, there may be more explanation for trucks and cars, which are only mentioned and rarely seen by the race. It's a motorcycle movie and anyone on two wheels will like this. <br /> <br /> The series offers amazing images as well as interviews with people's mouths. Yikes. There is another very attractive song like LWR, but this song is not as good as stereo sound. <br /> <br /> If you live in the United States, God knows when it will be released, so purchase it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as you did. Oh, be prepared to buy another motorcycle.
