If you have a chance to see this movie, look for it. It is very shocking in parts and makes you really think of many important but not instructive issues. In my opinion, it's a piece of art ... beautifully filmed, upscale music with many styles, and the impressive level of acting that one expects from BBC Drama. Nathalie Bryce (described as "Natalie Press") is also disguised as a depressed teenager exploited by her classmate. Celia Emery enjoys a comforting quality that provides stability that does not disturb the viewer at times, and the viewer's comfort in knowing that someone is already "normal." But the real star, as always, is Timothy Spall - certainly one of the greatest actors of our time!
