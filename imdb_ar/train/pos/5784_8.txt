I noticed that a lot of people are posting on "Kerching!" The council seems to hate this offer, which I find very surprising. I think it's one of the best British children's shows out there. It is shameful to end up being very funny (if sometimes cowardly) and has wonderful personalities. The main character is similar to Dellboy, although it is smarter. With two of his best friends, try to get a million pounds for his mother by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym for "Rudeboy". His friends Seymour (who loves cooking) and Danny (a simple minded and comic relief character). During the show, I left some characters and entered new characters, but they were always amusing and improving.
