It's a great movie if it's shown in the right context - it was supposed to be a spoof of the horror films of teen demons (and the 1980s saw a lot of them)! I saw this movie when it was released for the first time, and I loved it right away. Being a great admirer of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the film. And anything with OZZY as a preacher of hate for metals can not be bad! Also, Fastway was already my favorite, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS cover (this was pre-DVD) appeared for Trick Or Treat, which represents an illustration of Sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" looking. I had a special request, and the price of the VHS version at the time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not that funny price. The "OZZY-Gene" cover was created only for a reissue of $ 5. It is possible that the company that launched it figured that Jane and OZZY were the only two people recognized in the film, so it was better to put them on the cover! The same with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it for five minutes, but now they are on its cover as if it were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a website "trick or treat" on the Internet, and it is surprising how many people believe that Sami Core is a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate this myth by dedicating her album "Sammi Curr". <br /> <br /> All in all, it was just a good time, for rock and roll. Certainly not to be taken seriously, but only enjoyed!
