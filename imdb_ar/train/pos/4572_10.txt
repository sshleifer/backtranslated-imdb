As a person who has lived with cerebral palsy for more than forty years, I find this film inspiring. If someone with such a severe cerebral palsy condition as Christie Brown can do a lot, there is no reason why I can not achieve my dreams. Daniel Day and Brenda Fricker offer great performances. <br /> <br />
