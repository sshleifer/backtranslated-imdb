All about Metzee. I love her in this. Did not look fantastic ?! I love these popcorn movies on Sunday afternoon. This is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to business in the most troublesome times. Richard's character was quite creepy. I've dated men like that. Well, not quite like this lol. I hope Zach was not killed. It was cutie and very easy on the eyes. I love these chase type stories. It always makes me wake up and make sure my doors are closed. My husband usually does not like these kinds of movies, but he really sat with everything and really enjoyed it. I can not wait to see what Metzi does after that!
