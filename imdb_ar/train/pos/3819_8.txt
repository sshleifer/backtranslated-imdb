I have been waiting for this film for a long time and finally managed to watch it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I was expecting a lot from this film and that's why I was a little disappointed. I was not the best film from Korea, but it's still worth watching. <br /> <br /> The theme was great and the film keeps you watching without being bored though it's long. But there are loopholes in the film jumping from one point to another. However, Jeon Do-Yeon's representation is incredibly beautiful. I have had one of the best performances in early cinema history and I think this film would not be nice if you are not in the leading role.
