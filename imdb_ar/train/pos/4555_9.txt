Based on Christie Brown's autobiography, this lovable film tells the story of his life. He was affected by cerebral palsy and considered by everyone not to be a man, including his mother. Surprisingly, he teaches himself drawing and writing using his foot, the only part he can control. An amazing story of courage with Oscar-winning performance is truly amazing and memorable by Daniel Day Lewis. 9 of 10
