In a truly diverse range, this offer outperforms FOX. It's the type of sitcom that grows on you. If you watch one show you may not like it very much, but once you see two or three - you become addicted. <br /> <br /> This is because some jokes hit and miss some of the way you see them. As usual today, the subjects are very mature. Humor is usually very mature. The most funny parts are often the parts where mature subjects collide with the innocent. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith) The veteran actor has a very good humor in this show. Debra Jo Rob plays well in this cast team too. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor for the "children" is very good. Laura Prebon (Donna) looks better in previous performances as a natural red (who made her make her blonde?). It shows very good talent and often comic timing. She looks good without makeup too. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best entries on FOX in the sitcom section and is the most successful live movement since Married With Children
