It was a great movie, but it had the worst end I think I've ever seen !!! The actors were great and displayed a wonderful talent. The entire story was crooked and unexpected, which made it amusing. As good as the film was, the entire film is judged by the end, which was terrible! Perhaps the sequel could eliminate this bad ending.
