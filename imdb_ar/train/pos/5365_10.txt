The Run Man is often dismissed as just a thriller of Arnie's full of explosions, bad bad guys and shooting. To be fair, there's plenty of it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorest films of Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> But, give it 18 years, and you'll find yourself able to appreciate it in a different light. Instead of being just an irrational action film, it works very well as a spoof for reality television. It's quite different from Stephen King's book, but I doubt that Hollywood, with its lofty endings and so-called "ordinary men" who have the skills of trained commandos, would accept him in his book The Current Model. <br /> <br /> However, with revision. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a policeman working in the United States where democracy has been a thing of the past, and the whole country is governed by the integration of government / media. The economy is in dire straits, the food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic games for them to watch, such as Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs. The most popular is the Running Man, a boxing show hosted by boxer Damian Kilian Played by Richard Dawson), where the "criminals" who are supposed to be hunted by pro-wrestling "stalkers" are being hunted. <br /> <br /> Some tried, however, to try and speak against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in Bakersfield, California, a helicopter led by Richards is sent to "calm". When Richards refuses to shoot innocent people, he is arrested and tortured to kill people in the crowd. He was sentenced to a slave labor camp but escapes with the help of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and continues to escape. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long, and after the network abducts the employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape his pursuit, he finds himself being held again, but this time forced to appear on The Run Man. <br /> <br /> There is, of course, the entire movie begins with the standard Arnie mode. Richards was launched into the Los Angeles land that followed the end of the world (why is Los Angeles always destroyed in these amazing worlds?) And forced to escape from the "stalkers" along with two other prisoners who fled the labor camp. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protests over the innocence, and discovers that it has been framed. Guess what happens to her then? So, as Amber, Richards and the other two run in an effort to avoid stalkers, we soon realize that Richards is not a normal policeman. It is Super Arne, a tireless man's army that can destroy evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men in Christmas lights, while being just an ordinary American man with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the movie becomes stupid and noisy and enjoy the classic Arne. There are a lot of exciting combat sequences, terrible bad guys for brands ("He had to split" being his favorite), general public final confrontation and happy ending. Some of the most pleasant moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the apparently benevolent host (watch out for the damned old lady!) And the cynical cold guy who is In fact it will do anything to increase the ratings. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting a high resolution HD movie, you'll be disappointed. But if you want a big flick in the 80s, well, that's it. But the great thing about this film is that it was totally prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll notice the way reality TV is going today - shows that show people ready to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and all the producers are willing to let them humiliate Themselves on TV. It is not a big step to imagine that some lousy television programs were trying to get the right to show that people are being executed live on television. However, we have already seen this through the hostage-taking hostage of the video clips posted on the Internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are good at watching real death on their televisions. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, in addition to the fact that everything today seems to be the revival of the 1980s, you must be impressed by the sight of this film. Of course, we are not there yet, because they are terrorists, not the mainstream media, who bought us readily available programs with real human death, but you just have to wonder how long before some executives decide to find a way To show a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and the desire to enjoy their obsessed curiosity ...
