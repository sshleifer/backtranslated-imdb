I recently watched version 54 of this film with Judy, and while I appreciated the story and music, I found that the film failed to catch my attention. I was expecting the new version of '76 'to be the same story, except for the evolution of Barbara. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a more realistic and modern look to fame, money, love and the price of it all. This version is much more realistic than version 54, with better music to say, better representation, more plot line grip, and of course, deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film was on the list of the top 100 institutions of the American Institute of Cinema, while this new version failed to affect the list of any critic.
