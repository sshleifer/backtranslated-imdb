I really do not understand why people get upset and move this movie! Remember people, this is SNL movie, not anything supposed to be unpredictable and original in the plot or direction! The Liddies Man is a hilarious, though sometimes stupid, film with defeated actors, and, as always, wonderful performances by Phil Verrell and Tim Meadows. Yeah some stupid jokes, and yes, the characters are incredible but they are comedy! I do not really understand how no one could have laughed so much during this funny film. Anyway, all I ask is for people to take this as it is - SNL comedy is ridiculous and unstoppable. Nothing will win the prizes, but nevertheless, some modern comedy gold. "10-4 apricots!"
