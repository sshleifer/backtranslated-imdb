According to this forum, I think you like it or hate it. Usually how things go with all the movies. There is no need to get testy with others though. All we do here is give opinions.

I am a fan of horror film. Most lovers of ol√© films do not like ordinary horror movies. Many of the low-budget movies that are looking for movies come out these days. Difficult to keep up with. What makes it difficult to stay in these films is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review about "Living Dead Hood" because it is very good compared to the rest of the scrap that is there. It's not something special, but it's the horror filmmakers who try to be so serious that they end up producing a horror film. I really loved this one. You tell me there's no effort in this one? There's another thing, I bet that you all have huge DVD sets that are proud of them, is not it Major Motion Pictures? There's nothing wrong with that, but you have to know how to appreciate the low budget independent. I knew what I was getting when I watched this movie. It will not bother me because I thought it would be a $ 100 million film. Some of you may need to commit to observing the matrix over and over and stop trying to compare everything with the matrix. If most of you are less than 24 years old, that explains everything. People a good movie, check it out.
