I must admit I am a big fan in South Park and I expected that the basketball would be funny but not as close to good as it turned out! I think that's what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This movie has a great restart value and does not bother itself very seriously. Humor style slap stick mixed with Stone and Parker working flawlessly. This kind of humor in basketball was not common at the time it was released, and it would appear today. Do not bother trying to be awkward, just leave your mind on the door and expect endless laughs. Recommended for anyone with a good sense of humor.
