Well, well, stay tuned. I was kidding. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is really a better and more honest title anywhere. <br /> <br /> The racist drama and crime gets a comedic treatment from the cartoonist X-rated Ralphie Boy. He is doing one of his best jobs here. <br /> <br /> On the crime front, the truth emerges. They build and defend it, then the boredom and the strong make them (perhaps) lose it. See for yourself to see what falls. <br /> <br /> Elemental? I do not know, I do not know. Since Scatman (RIP) and Love Tunes (and also RIP) are the black color and the main point, I saw it as an attack on racism mostly. The fact that Richard Pryor likes it says so. Mike Thomas's younger film (before "Miami Miami Vice") was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> It's the animated movie "Blacksploitation." This is a good thing. Well done and well done. This will cause some confusion (such as the sight of extrajudicial execution), but unfortunately this depends on reality. <br /> <br /> But Raleigh must really have a rethinking of this title.
