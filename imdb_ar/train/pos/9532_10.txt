The time spent developing characters, attention to detail, wonderful performances, stunning lighting, cinema, and brilliant soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> Compact density and tactile touch that will not work with anyone who wants to shake Rapid motion dust. If we live in the days of Elizabeth, I will say that this film is somewhat like Shakespeare's tragedy. But since we do not do that, let's say it's like a teaser. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The film is clever in the way exploring relationships and issues. Much of the story is presented rather than listed, which I find to make it more precise and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or novel). I sometimes felt that I was actually present in the 1930s, part of this story - there was a realistic quality like a dream in the way it was narrated. <br /> <br /> I do not often prefer movies to the books on which they are based, but in this case I do. (Although I also enjoyed the book). I purchased the DVD, which is great because it has some great deleted scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> I also took my little cousin, who was a little younger than the boy in the film, to see him after I first saw him, because he had problems at home and wanted to use this as a way to start a discussion about father and son issues with him. And discussion.)
