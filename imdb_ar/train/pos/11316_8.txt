I did not read James M. Cain ("The Postman Always Rings Twice") on which this film was based, so I can not compare this version to the film, but I saw and liked the 1946 release in the United States. (Also known as "postman"). <br /> <br /> The best thing is that these gems from Italy, which I read, were "distorted" in the editing because of the many blatant signs of the fascist regime. Well it does not matter? The rest is a wonderful piece of cinema, and seems to be the leader of the new realism movement in filmmaking. One can certainly see why? Despite any severe adjustment continued, there is still a prevailing sense of social and cultural repression, as well as personal persecution, largely dependent on supporters who face many restrictions in life. <br /> <br /> Think of Gino, the young man then, not well educated, unemployed, resorting to storage, stealing people and deceiving them in order to get dressed, his only wife of synaptic shoes so useless. <br /> <br /> In Giovanna, he sees a way out, yet he should have continued, because Giovanna is being persecuted for her brave marriage from an older man who has some money, her job (working in Trattoria for her husband, And in the kitchen), their sex. In the past, she had limited options and decided to marry his restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that he would not make her happy. She told Gino that she felt sick every time Brigana touched her. <br /> <br /> Under the pretext of helping Brigana repair his car and send him to the village to buy the required part (actually in his pocket), Gino wins for Bregana (also repairing the broken water pump - the water that symbolizes life or not) He leaves alone with Giovanna. They immediately start a passionate, emotional, but volatile relationship. <br /> <br /> Geno soon feels strangled by the relationship and feels the need to move forward again when Giovanna proposes to get rid of her husband. Guineau does not want any part of him, leaving the city on a train he can not afford, and he is asked to pay it by another gypsy man named Spaniolo, a fellow train. For Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom, becoming friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes the morality and conscience of Gino), traveling and looking for work in carnival together. Finally Gino has a steady action. A month went by when Brigana and his wife went to the carnival and persuaded Brigina Geno to return home "to live and work with them again, because it is useful to get around." After a period of time he gives in to Gina's demands to get rid of her husband.As soon as this evil act is completed, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, and seems to have little Of conscience, while guilt and shame eat away in Gino to harm a man who has suffered no harm. As much as he wants to leave, he does it again briefly, they are now inextricably linked, and they must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked the way Spagnolo returned to Gino's life to act as a judge for his actions ?? <br /> <br /> While the copy of '46 US with Lana Turner and John Garfield is lost a little in a swamp of peripheral characters, especially the police and lawyers, Ossession is doing well to focus more Much of the psychological effects of crime on lovers alone. This gives the end result more effective, and makes a strong statement enhances the inherent deficit in the community in which the characters must live. <br /> <br /> A simple ripping: the amount of time (barely there) that elapses before the lovers declare their love, how to kill the husband quickly (no failed attempt as in the US version); Jeno's extremely fast relationship with a dancer / whore ? They quickly recognize their love as well, and are willing to take a great deal of risk with the man you just met! ?? They are all rather unrealistic, are not they? I found this problem in the time frame completely distracted? It made me think I should have missed something somewhere. Otherwise, well worth the viewer's time. The acting and direction were uniformly good all the time. Recommended.
