I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was done beautifully, from cinema to acting. It is the story of a father and son, and how they value each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that does not ring false, the film presents acting talents Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this wonderful actor. The film begins with the elderly father trying to find out why his wife, Olympia Dukakis, left him. The father presents himself, without warning, on the threshold of his son and wife. Father and son start the next day to look at some property and end up on a classic land trip. They hunt and play billiards, watch the baseball game and are drunk and get involved in a big fight and dance with foreign women. But more importantly, they both face undeclared tensions that can affect any family. It is the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those closest to them.
