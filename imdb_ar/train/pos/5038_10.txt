What a real treat and completely unexpected. That's what the real thriller is about. I rushed to the video store and grabbed a movie without reading the entire uproar on his back and I hope to be the best. I was completely surprised and pleased. I really enjoyed the actors and their personalities. I thought they all performed great and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, written and well-directed. I kept you interested from start to finish and did not get bored for a minute. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to those who love thriller movies, especially the excitement that goes well and those that keep you interested. Definitely 10 out of 10 of me.
