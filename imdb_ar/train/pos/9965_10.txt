Ideal for families with young children looking for fun, non-violent, interesting children's movies and adult entertainment, though full of vitality. Not a bad film for a low-budget job. Children will be amazed at Santa's workshop and the "magic" that can enter homes through chimneys that look very small, or houses that have no chimneys at all! <br /> <br /> The children will thrive on Santa's success in thwarting a bad devil named Pitch (complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl who wishes to have a small doll that she loves. And the poor rich boy who just wants to spend time with his absent parents forever. What is a child who does not know someone in school like the bad boys who were recruited by Pitch to help capture Santa and destroy Christmas? In the end, everyone, including bad boys, will get what they deserve on Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will block children in Santa and the message of love he receives to people all over the world. <br /> <br />
