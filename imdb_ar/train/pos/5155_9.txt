"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was controversial before being broadcast at all, and this controversy might obscure the film's completion. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the film, and did not see it, did so with good intentions, based on the misguided thought that he would be very sympathetic to Hitler. However, they misunderstand the point: to humanize the evil Hitler does not sympathize with him. It is far more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of the greatest evil men in history have been committed by man. Patient, a sick maniac, certainly, but a human being nonetheless. It is necessary to know how Hitler managed to gain power to prevent him from happening again. <br /> <br /> The "Rise of Evil" has been highlighted by the best professional performance by Robert Carlyle, who makes Hitler a man without being recovered in any way. Carlyle captures flawlessly the Nazi leader's view and behavior, never allowing himself to be impersonated or away from us (something Anthony Hopkins could not have done when Hitler was portrayed in The Banker, another good film made specifically for the television film). While repulsed by Hitler's corruption and harsh anti-Semitism, Carlyle gives him some of the magnetism and power that Adolf Hitler must possess. After all, while another nation would have followed it? <br /> <br /> Among many sub-aspects, Matthew Moden is the most creative character, Fritz Gerlitz, who makes his life important to draw attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. Although Modine's performance was somewhat delayed in Part 1, it seems that in Part 2 he has settled in, the character gives us a real hero in a movie full of villains. Peter Sturmar and Jeff Schreiber also provide strong support. <br /> <br /> The first part of this mini-series has suffered in part from being overly choppy, including a look at Hitler's childhood, which lasts only for the opening credits. In the second part, the sections that separate Hitler's relationship with his niece and his mistress Eva Braun are less successful than the central plot, but give us more insight into his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> In the end, no film about Hitler can make us understand it. The average person, fortunately, is unable to understand any man trying to exterminate the entire race of people. "Hitler: Rise of Evil" tries to make us understand Hitler less, and more to make us understand how he came to power. It's an important story to tell, and it's impossible to believe that anyone who saw the film would be accused of having anything but the best intentions and the ability to do anything but good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
