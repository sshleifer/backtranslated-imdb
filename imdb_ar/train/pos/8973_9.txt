I saw this movie when I was a little kid on TV (thank you with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I had nightmares about it for years afterwards. Best Animation National Film Council. Pojar was in turn a mentor and collaborator of Great Darwin. If you like Trnka, you'll see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The code is clear, but used wisely. Opposes the opposition of beauty and life (plant) with non-disclosure on the part of the glove. The poor puppet hero was convicted despite the absence of a political agenda. <br /> <br /> The most I remembered was the feeling of persecution in the decor. The small room where the event takes place is the whole personal world. Invasion by hand is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and painful film. I found a copy of this story and other wonderful short films written by Ternaca in the public library and presented to my children. Must see.
