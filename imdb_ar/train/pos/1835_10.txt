What a wonderful movie this I do not have words to describe. I do not know how come the 7.3 film rating, it should be 9.3 but anyway, no one can make this film, Akshay's only wonderful actor in the second half of the film makes you cry and the film really has a good unexpected end making the perfect film. You should watch this movie once, and I think it is up to you. Anyway, I like this movie, which is not only sad and funny, but it also gives you really good meanings and what you should do so I think this is one of the best films in Bollywood history. But I know that people have chosen to differ even oh. The only thing I do not like about this movie is the music well and the background music is good but the songs are not good enough and I think the music would be better if AR Rahman would be the music director but anyway we can not do anything about it so hey.
