Just re-watch this movie after thirty-seven years. I was 11 years old, and this blaze caught fire on South Beach in the long-gone movie theater on Washington Street. In 1969, I thought where is it! It was a very good film now, however, after nearly forty years, the situation was not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this film has now become a tired old reincarnation of the intergenerational war. However, catch a place at a time that is just a memory. It is really interesting to see the modern models, the old Vegas, without the narrow reekels, the smoking chain, and the hip opening song. The representation was appropriate, and the text was somewhat old, but the memories were still new. Wherever they are, you may not be in the right place for you, but for me, it was still an enjoyable and entertaining journey into the memory lane.
