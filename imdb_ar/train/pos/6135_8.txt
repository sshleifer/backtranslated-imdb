Bedknobs & Broomsticks are another one of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with a sequence of animated actors and actresses interacting with animation. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children disappear and Mary is in pavement art.) I classify this film primarily through the eyes of the child because I have not seen it for years. At the time, it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scene (the conflict that began with the ghostly armor that entered the battle) was my favorite. There was also a lot of stop animations used in crows (ie, people are turning into rabbits), which may be a bit dated and silly now. (Also, I think the movie starts slowly.) Through the eyes of the child, it is a fun film and makes it easier for children to put themselves in the children's places in the film. It is a fantasy film that today is largely forgotten.
