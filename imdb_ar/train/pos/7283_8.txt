I love buying those cheap, cheap DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, I happened to buy this one. It's the best fucking science fiction film of the 1950s. Full of all unscientific things, girls in tight clothes and a lot of drama, it's a fun movie, for those who appreciate this kind of thing. If you can "suspend your disbelief" enough, you can actually slip in - not just by the psychic head or by hitting the thing in the closet, but in the end, with the "ideal body" character. that's it . . . . What is the other word of mind ***?
