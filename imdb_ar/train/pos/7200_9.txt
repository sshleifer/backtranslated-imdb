Deathtrap gives you sophistication at every turn, every turn, in fact, the biggest problem is that there are many twists you can not ever direct in the movie, and often it does not make sense, although it is usually useful for you by surprise. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has a lot of transformations. The screenplay is very good with a great dialogue and characters, but you can not see all the developments because of the fluctuations. The special offers by Ken are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can guide. Visual effects are fair, but more than once again are actually a fake play. Volatility is way too much, but it still works and is worth watching.
