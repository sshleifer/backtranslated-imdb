Carlos Menesia was excellent this is a special watch. He worked hard to show everyone that it was a real deal. I know people said they were stolen in this particular article, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy forward the way he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, and that's why he's good. People say it's not funny because they say DDD a lot, and they still do not realize that this is part of their doing, they do not want it that way, but it brings in anyway, and succeeds in making people laugh. For all those who are there, there is a message, Carlos is there to stay, and you have no benefit in trying to drop him.
