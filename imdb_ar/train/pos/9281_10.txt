I do not know how and where the Iranian managers draw inspiration from such a plot. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors can come out with --- but they may not be able to show it to a film the way Jaafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The film is like two worlds at the same time, linked to each other - the football match and the gender battle that takes place behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you're in a movie and you're "preparing a character, and while watching the movie, as if you also want to get a glimpse of the football game, you will feel the same excitement and emotion that these actors feel in the film. I love the intermittent conversations between the chimney girl and one of the military trainees ... It's like the planet Venus against Mars, it really shows the difference in the way you want to see the end, you will want to know the referee and you will die to see what happens to the girls. The thinking of men and women and the struggle of women for equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is The second is Jaafar Panahi, which I have seen (the first is Crimson Gold) and I look forward to watching some other films. <br /> <br /> I am already addicted to Iranian films, and this movie must be seen!
