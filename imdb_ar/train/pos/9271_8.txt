That's what one of the girls said at the end. <br /> <br /> Is the football game a metaphor for a qualified match between girls (or a wider, free thinking group) and power? Does the word "Germany" mean hope in the future? <br /> <br /> It's one of the most memorable cinematic experiences I have ever experienced - despite raw filmmaking and plot, and over-acting (although I love the cast), they are loved and above all Much anticipation for the amateur). The situation is caught ridiculously well. I can be very frustrated by the game (being female and encouraging football) and I can not stop thinking about how to make a disguised disguise. I wonder why there is no women's section to protect against dirty language and bad behavior - defeating the defective causes of denial. <br /> <br /> The movie is cleverly made - the title is amazing, the title is filming during the actual game, the spontaneity, different styles of putting viewers in the characters' shoes - the game is very important but inaccessible (not shown), the light and delightful sound of the playground, The vanity, and futility when communicating with the inside with crowds celebrating outside. I can feel comfortable coming from the radio, drinks, food, of course the kindness and consideration of each personality to others. During the final credits, I feel happy because no character has a name - it's just a "soldier" and she's just a "girl" or a "sister."
