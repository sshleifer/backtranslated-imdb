Surprise stirring with more twists and turns of the doodle panel. Gorgeous actors mix him up with an intriguing plot dominated by the influence of twin peaks in director D. Nicolas Cage is a very underestimated actor and shows a wonderful picture of a man in trouble looking for the right thing to do. JT Walsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is Dennis Hopper. It is shameful that it is unprecedented in the business world. I'm sure he has his followers, though. Overall, this is a great movie that shows you do not need big sounds or commercial soundtrack to be an entertainment movie.
