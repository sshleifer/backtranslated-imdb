What an ideal example of "Less Is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) contains only 72 lines and about 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black-and-white image, when your eye is forced to fill in blanks, facial expressions, physical drama, and emotional gestures all combine to make a stronger impact. This is one of the top 5 films I can not live through, there are directs with classics such as Road Warrior. If you like this, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" both starring Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was also in the Soldier. "Warrior XIII" starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" starring Harrison Ford.
