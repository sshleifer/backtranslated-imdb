Like many Americans, I first learned about Hayao Miyazaki's work when I saw "Spirited Away". I fell in love with the film and saw it many times. I'm now in search to see every film for Miyazaki. One of his previous works is "Castle in the Sky". Although it is still fun, it is not as good as "Spirited Away" (although the comparison between this film and any other 2002 film he has given may be unfair). <br /> <br /> Work in a mine late one night, when a girl sees a slow fall from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Chita (Anna Pachin). But Chita has a secret, and before he knows it, Paso is taken to an adventure that will lead him to danger with the pirates, the army and the lost floating city. <br /> <br /> Going to a movie directed by Hayao Miyazaki means that you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a Miyazaki movie is like a wonderful dream experience since your childhood. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is moving, shooting the film is not a big problem because it is impossible to determine whether it is impossible to determine whether lip movements match words. It also helps the translated dialogue be well written and articulated by talented people. The voice representation is varied. James van der Beck is the best. It brings irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to Pazu's role as the ideal character. Anna Pachin is as good as Chita. She is afraid of the events around her, but she knows what to do. Mark Hamel can not be identified as an evil Mosca. He is dangerous and wants something from Chita and will do anything to get him. The other sounds are bad. Cloris Leitchman is as terrifying as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for "The Last Picture Show," but as a pirate leader. Leachman gives a personal grunt that is almost always monotonous. It's very bad that it destroys the film almost! Jim Cummings is an effective voice actor, but he is mistaken as the general. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommend seeing "Castle in the Sky". Maybe I'll end up buying it myself. But although it is not as good as "Spirited Away", it is still good.
