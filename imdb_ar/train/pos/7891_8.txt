Now all the children and teenagers of Springwood, Ohio all of whom died expect one teenager (Sean Greenblatt) still alive. Freddie (Robert Englund) is allowed to leave and the teenager does not have much memory, when he arrives in a new city. When a tough psychologist (Lisa Zanne) tries to break the new patient. She discovers where he is from. I brought him to Springwood to raise some memories but three teenagers (Leslie Dean, Brian Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan), who came unexpectedly for the ride. Once in Springwood, the psychologist has some memories of having lived in that town before as a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of her true identity. <br /> <br /> Directed by Rachel in the Machine, Tank Girl made a bleak sequel but somewhat oddly different with some visual elegance and funny moments for this horror / fantasy / thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has a supportive role as an expert in dreams psychology. This has some brilliant visual effects (everyone will not rush, especially in 3D) and some good style in his novel. This film has made some film series at the box office. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a distorted widescreen (1.85: 1) (also in Pan & Scan) and a powerful Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround system. Voice. The DVD has an original play trailer, go to the nightmare view and Cast & Crew information. The Box Elm Street Series Box, the eighth disc, has interviews with the crew in this sixth film. The sixth movie is also in 3-D on the film's peak but you can watch it in 2-D as well. This is the last Elm Street movie until Wes Craven re-animated Freddy in a different darker style in "New Nightmare" and an amazingly silly and thrilling "Freddy Vs Jason". Robert Shay (co-owner and co-executive director of New Line Cinema), Rozan Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper watched the series as an amusing veil. Written by Michael de Luca (John Carpenter in the mouth of insanity). From the story of the director. (*** / / *****).
