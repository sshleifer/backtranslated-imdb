The material in this documentary is so strong that it made me cry. Yes, tears tell you. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population must inspire us all to defend our rights, to demonstrate the greater good of society and to stop making cowardly excuses for not challenging the institution. Chavez is the weak and the unfortunate in the same way that Bush represents the face of dirty and capitalist companies are complacent. In fact, Latin America and its marginalized majority have been reshaping for more than five centuries. However, in the case of Mexico, Calder√≥n clearly stole the election. Chavez is not perfect, away from him. He is trying to change the constitution to allow him to govern indefinitely. This can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to the film; the pace of taking breath in moments, philosophical deep in others. He portrays Chavez as a popular hero who is not afraid to challenge the hegemony of the United States and its domination over the world's resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing prevents you from performing your duty. One of the critical messages of the film is the questioning of sources of information, as is clearly evident from the losses of snipers who have been blamed for Chavez's supporters. Venezuela puts the alleged American democracy in shame. Hasta No Revolution!
