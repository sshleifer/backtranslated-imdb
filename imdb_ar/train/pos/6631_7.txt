I have no idea how this film is described, and I also love providing others with the same opportunity I had - seeing it without knowing what to expect. I have enjoyed it a lot but I can also say that I hardly understood what was happening, if there was really something to understand it in the first place. Fans of David Lynch (casual) or Jay Madden films should especially enjoy this, and any EIGHTBALL comic book fans will probably be beside them with joy and wonder (I've come close to any movie I've seen on the tone that creates the mood of Dan Claus with great effectiveness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a simple observation just to warn anyone easily of insult - this film, if it is rated, .
