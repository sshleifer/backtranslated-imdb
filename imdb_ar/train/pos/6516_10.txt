Hi. I watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has a lot of time on my hands. I need a life. I found the film has a striking resemblance to the broken mountain. I also found that I look like Jean Lafitte if he was white. Also, my favorite line was in the entire film by Mr. Petey - "This child can shoot the squirrel eye of 300 yards !!" My favorite scene in the film was when the British came, the drummer who was devoted to his work, and knocking to death, as if this drum would end the war completely .... he would not. Well, that's all I'd say about this film. Oh, one other thing .. Brown brown is crazy mood Vizko bipolar swinging BEEYOTCH. That's it.
