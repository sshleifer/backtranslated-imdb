"My Lips" is a wonderful and extraordinary film from Audiard, a heart-warming film and loneliness. It is perfect for the wonderful charisma of Vincent Cassel and is characterized by a wonderful performance by Emmanuel Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that Ka'arin Viard appeared to Jean Pierre Jeunet: Funkyly beautiful (referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a continued profile. <br /> <br /> This is the definition of her role almost as Carla, office dogs ready, making fun of colleagues who exploit designed. However, they find a way of sexual exploitation, if you love Paul Castle previous. Each of them exploits non-traditional talents for others (reading theft and lip) to struggle through their positions and form an unconventional romantic affinity. The Devos / Audiard is designed by Carla and accompanied by an interior world marred by a subtle and elegant elegance. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001) Audiard has already clearly controlled his handling of tension and motion and invested his frame with a truly visceral experience that will become a powerful blow - a prophet - nine years later. 10/07
