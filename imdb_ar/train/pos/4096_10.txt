Maybe I and my deviant side, or the fact that I tend to think with a very sick mind, but I hired this movie randomly on one strange night and my great surprise, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have read the summary at the back of the DVD and read that it has been banned for 25 years and I think I was ready for anything to do. I was clearly deceived after seeing ... well, everything, to cut a short story. I can see why it was banned, not only for such explicit sex scenes, but for brutality. <br /> <br /> Of course, because it is freely based on a classic fairy tale of beauty and beast, a favorite figure of my work, it tells the story of a girl's awakening to a dream about chasing a Duchess by a monster whatever that monster-like thing was with Excessive erection and a large amount of ejaculation. Of course, the monster gets what he wants, and the Duchess decides that she loves her and continues to overcome the forest. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. Oh, there's a lot! <br /> <br /> Not only do we see sex between the sexes, but there are also babes, babysitters who descend and get dirty with the slave when they do not lie down on the bed to get them ... er ... satisfaction and the girl masturbating daydream with petals Roses. <br /> <br /> Creative and fun, but it took some time for my dad to talk to me again after seeing him after I went to bed ... I was 15 years old. Tip words When watching this movie: Make sure you are the only person you know you own and watch it with the curtains closed. It may be fun, but I doubt there are other pornographic movies like this one.
