Elvira, Mistress of The Dark, is a terrifying comedy in the horror camp, where the fourth wall is broken several times and jokes often remain under the navel. Cassandra Peterson's breasts become their own personality. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is exposed to a horror hostess, learning that she inherited her aunt Morgana. So go to the small town of Falwell, ruled by the most horrifying beast ever to embrace the earth: moral courtesy. Elviras's lively appearance is, of course, too much for the peaches, but the town's children come out of their different approaches to life. Of course there is more wicked evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after Elvira's mother book of spells. You see, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just does not know it. althoug. <br /> <br /> As for what it is, the Elvira is a very funny film, although the text leaves little room for improvement. Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals, but there are some good visual gags as well. Everything is fine, but it never rises to be more. In all, a good comedy, intentionally, comedy. If you love this kind of thing, this is it.
