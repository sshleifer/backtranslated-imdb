This series could be the best Britcom at all, and that means a lot, taking into account competitors (Volti Towers, Good News, to name a few). <br /> <br /> What made the butterflies so superior, even better, is that they represented not only a wonderful, classic, elegant and smart comedy, but also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and in every detail - change Socialism that was taking place in Britain at the time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this show when I was a teenager and took care of everything about it. The photographer's lifestyle was wonderful in itself. This was the first time I've seen real people using cordless phones. The wardrobe for all the characters was far removed from the 70's wacky clothes that were still seen in North America at the time. Then there were trims, storefronts, and cars. These people - even the sons of layabout, with their philosophical approach to life and humor - were sophisticated. They were examples of "new Europeans" who will have an impact on life and style all over the world in the next decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the hypothesis was strange and wonderful. The idea that someone was living a suburban dream could be very distressing and restless was revolutionary, especially for North America who always knew happiness as money and things (certainly the situation was filmed in American movies and television, but not densely of butterflies or mountain film the black). If the hypothesis is not surprising enough, the means expressed are maximized. A possible romantic relationship was not about sex or even romance? The butterflies have amazed many, but some people must be left with their pawns in disbelief ... at any time anyway. <br /> <br /> Butterflies are, in many ways, a prophecy. Before her age, Ennui has documented postmodernism, a widespread lifestyle, the concept of emotional betrayal, the separation of generations and male discontent (ideally depicting the tense relations between father and son). It is very bad that this series has not been greatly discovered, and all those involved in it are credited with creating a meaningful snapshot of a specific time and place, and expect all the joy and anxiety that will happen.
