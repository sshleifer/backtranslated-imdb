Unexpected pleasure because I have not heard anything about this film. <br /> <br /> It is outrageous that it calls for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderful human story with a gently conveyed social message, although it is admittedly predictable in its decision. Acted strongly by school principals. Beautifully photographed with silent colors floating on gray and reflecting the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent invasion of the Chinese film (The Shower, The Road Home, not One Less) was exciting and I hope to continue exploring. China and its people are an amazing cloth for filmmakers. "King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone who is equally interested in the latest Chinese film. <br /> <br />
