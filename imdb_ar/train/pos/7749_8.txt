This movie hits you on your feet. This film, which first appeared from Tom Barman (known as the Belgian rock band "dEUS"), presents you with 8 gay characters, blocks of brilliant mosaics. They stay every day and one day in the city of Antwerp. Barman paints his characters with great puzzlement and intertwined efficiently with their individual stories, a tour of power that reminds us of the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. A mixture of anecdotes, surprises, moves, amuse. Dialogues are very natural and seem impromptu. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts and Natali Broods and the very funny duet of Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Loick is an unforgettable "Windman", a strange man who dances throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the amazing dances design, and of course Tom Berman himself took care of the very impressive sound track. We were deeply moved: "No Way To Wind" is a movie that explores you.
