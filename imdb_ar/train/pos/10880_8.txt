It is not the worst film ever produced, actors are not confused, and the script and director are not entirely incompetent. <br /> <br /> It's not the best film ever made, the actors are not excellent, the screenplay and the director are not quite fantastic. <br /> <br /> The movie is somewhere in the middle. Fun somewhere. Fun and well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> Needless to say "do not take it seriously", "very bad" or "not scary". None of these comments are relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut him an atmosphere. It is the unique atmosphere in fact, the really original aspect of the film, and it is personally what makes the film for me.
