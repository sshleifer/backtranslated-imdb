Jack Cassidy's choice of role was Ken Franken's brilliance. Cassidy embodied arrogance, confidence, magic and intelligence - all with a sinister little smile on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is the best killer (three times back) in the Colombo series. This special performance (and first), is my favorite Colombo ring constantly. Steven Spielberg has a new interface with amazing camera performance (yes, there were occasional camera shadows) capturing nuances and joking at different and interesting angles between Colombo and Franklin. Also, the narrow, panoramic shots in Big Bear Lake, California (Capin Franklin House) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this episode yet, you owe it to yourself to do it - it's a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976, at the age of forty-nine, was very sad and very tragic - he certainly had his best years in front of him. The rest in Jacques Jack, you will live forever through your great work.
