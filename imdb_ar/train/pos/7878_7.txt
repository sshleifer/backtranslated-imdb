As the story says in my family, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the band, my father spent hours with him. Then, at some point, my father told Sinatra that it was good to be associated with a small group (band), and that he had to go out of his own accord. By that time Sinatra had enough credits "under his belt" to do so! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest, they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have some photos and records in this sense, as well as Berkeley University in California. <br /> <br /> Every movie in Sinatra has seen more times than I would like to say, and his films will not become old. . .
