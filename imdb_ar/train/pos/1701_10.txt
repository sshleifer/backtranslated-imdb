This is a silly guy thinking movie. If you do not expect Star Wars and have a British sense of humor, this may turn out to be just a classic cult for you, just as it did for my wife and I - casting Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as Christians into the very light masses of Big Bean, Or watch it carefully and enjoy either direction. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy a comfortable sense of humor that takes your mind quickly to see humor as it slips off before you will enjoy this movie.
