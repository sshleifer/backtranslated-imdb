How to lose your friends and people graduated in 2008. I was bombed at the box office in the United States. It's a very hilarious movie with great actors. Simon Bigg is wonderful in the role of Sydney Young, who wrote "How to lose friends and alienate people ... I know it is not a real story ... The only way I know is that Sydney wants to go out with an actress called Sophie Maes." Sophie Mayes does not exist, The film is real, so how can we lose your friends and isolate people is perhaps the most entertaining film in 2008, and I think you will certainly see it, as I said earlier, the film has a great crew including: Kirsten Dunst (Spider Man, The Virgin Susaids) Danny Houston (No. 23, 30 Days of the Night) Gillian Anderson (X Files) Megan Fox (Transformers, The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing In general, how to lose friends and blow people up is fun, and I think Simon Big and Kersten Donst work well together, and I think you should see him, even though there's some nudity Strange, including sexual transgression, it's a hilarious comedy, it's one of Simon Bigg's best films. <br /> <br /> The Land: Sidney Young, a journalist from England, travels to New York to work for Sharp. While there, he met an actress named Sophie Maes and tried to sleep with her before the boss did.
