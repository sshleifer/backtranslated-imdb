I am not usually a fan of pure romantic films but I have heard that this was good. I was astounded. Easily the most romantic thing I have ever seen. just awesome. Wonderful, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is impeccable as it is writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawk and Julie Delphi are very natural and fluffy together you think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> Pick up movies for you right away and do not leave them. You can not look away and you can not stop listening to them. Even small moments melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This has jumped into the ranks of one of the favorites at all. Masterpiece.
