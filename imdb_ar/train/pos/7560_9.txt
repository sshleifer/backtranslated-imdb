The Starfucker (who reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing film I have ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not 10? There is nothing perfect. Jimmy Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look on the dark side of Hollywood. I forced a few others to watch the movie and all agreed it was a great click.
