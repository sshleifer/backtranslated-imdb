I have read most of the comments on this film. I have seen this film (and the whole series of prophecy) several times with family members of all ages, we have all enjoyed and contemplated what we have already learned from reading and studying the Bible about the rapture and the times of the end. No one was afraid or shocked as I read in some publications. The film is based only on the Bible facts. I have seen many end-of-time films such as "Tribulation" and "Armagedon," and thus, this is one of the best films that presented the facts of the Bible. There may not be a lot of great special effects like today's movies, but I think it's a good viewing tool. This movie and its prophecy series can be viewed free of charge on the highpraise.com website, judging yourself. His blessings to all.
