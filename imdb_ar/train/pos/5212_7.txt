Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A very bad actor, looking at his looks (now vanishing) instead of any A strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always been a curious place in the Hollywood-American scene, and is always a sure bet in the roles of leading men who are still remarkably present to this day. But at present it seems to have settled more in this kind of direct roles for DVD / limited edition, so it seems that it may be more stable in its power now. <br /> <br /> He has to take advantage of some tough things here, like Earl Babbage, a hard-working worker, one of the few hundred sex offenders in one area of ​​the United States who should take his case New Alison Allthrop (Clare Danis) is his last case, dealing with the issue of his abduction. A young woman while trying to forgive himself for a cause where he failed throughout the ages. <br /> <br /> This particular dive on the dark side of humanity, do not step on materials certainly not for the sake of hypersensitive or for those looking for light to see. As such, it is a strong and attractive film, unshakeable, and not directly budgeted for DVD. The only thing that really draws it is the highly intermittent, fast-moving camera sequence used in the most dramatic moments that look a bit wet after a while. But it is still some of the most hardened material I have seen in Gere, where it has become darker and more relentless on the edge as it continues. ***
