First, I did not know what to expect when starting the video. <br /> <br /> At any time someone returns a kind of cult-type movie and edits it at the moment, something is lost in the translation. This is not the case here. This movie just starts on track. It is a familiar part of the earth but it has also been able to control it. Scene Crockzilla anyone? You should see it, and just try to keep the face straight. This film takes some of the old classics of cult fiction and can be seamlessly integrated into modern production. It's good to see someone meet the need in this market. very good. <br /> <br />
