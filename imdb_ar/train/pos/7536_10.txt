The comment of the person who said that Pat Robertson is evil and that his program is evil has nothing to compare between evil and the righteous. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days, people will call good and evil good! He does not even know that he fulfilled the prophecy of the Bible! If you do not know God and refuse to know Him now, there is nothing wrong with that. Still loves you but when you finally bend over your knee for him, it will be too late. God does not send anyone to hell, nor even you! You will go there with your own decision and know your elimination! May Allah have mercy on you and give you the experience of the way of Damascus. 700 Club and Pat Robertson are one of the reasons I'm still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery, and possibly death, God arrived across television and used Pat Robertson to do it, thank God for doing it! You have the right to say what you said but you do not have the right to curse your words. God bless you.
