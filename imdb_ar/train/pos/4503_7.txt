This short, agile and delightful of 1916 - when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbakl were among the big names in the comedy - young Oliver Hardy stands out as his best friend who should quickly influence his rich uncle by producing a wife and lover to visit him. <br /> <br /> Of course, this does not go smoothly, and there are more wives and children than he can deal with; in addition to the mandatory stalking and misunderstanding that are the hallmark of an early movie slap. <br /> <br /> It has been well restored as part of "The Early Films of Oliver Hardy" and is now available on DVD, adding to the wonderful collection available from the big screen duo of favorite comedy.
