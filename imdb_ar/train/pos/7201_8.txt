A very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas. I can not say much about this film without giving up the story. I can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. A nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good offers by everyone.
