Before Satan discovers that your money starts promising, you set up a simple robbery that deviates from different perspectives (in a RASHOMON style). Around the clock, Sidney Lumet turns this film into something much more than the sum of its parts; it eventually turns into a multi-faceted family drama, exploring the whole world of emotions / human relationships, where the story reaches its horrific climax. <br /> <br /> As with Lumet, he is capable of extraordinary persuasion. Performing outside his starry team, without any idea of ​​over-representation or overdoing. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting figure, often the dwarfs Ethan Hawk, who plays his brother, Hank. This does not mean that Hawk is not bad; in fact he is above an appropriate level, in a troubled role suited to his style. Marisa Tommy is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she strips her body adds to it). The character of Albert Finney (Andy's father and Hank) is the most interesting, and in my opinion, it was worth a little more time than the screen. Amy Ryan performs her job adequately. <br /> <br /> Before Satan discovers that you are not dead, he proves that Lumette is still near the peak of his play in the (obviously) bright twilight. Many of his features and trademarks appear here, not least the use of his characters. Filled with a killer scenario (no pun intended), intelligent dialogue, speed, and decent degree, before Satan knows you are dead. The gem is really underestimated. 10/08. 3 stars (from 4). You should only enter the top 250 in 248. Highly recommended.
