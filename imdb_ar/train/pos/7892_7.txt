FREDDY has moved from scary to funny, in this sixth installment of the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> It has been two years, so far 11 years since this movie was shown in 2001. Freddie killed every other child on Elm Street except one, John Doe (Jacob of Part 5, so doing the film gives a hint Who it is), where it is used to bring more children to the Elm Street. Freddy not only gets his wishes, but he also gets his daughter back to Elm Street. When she discovers what is going on, she and other children decide to kill Freddie once and for all. We also see some Freddie alien wallpapers. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has been in a nightmare series for a long time now. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. I tried to show what Freddy was doing with his wise thoughts ... COMDEY and makes the series more funny than horror. This film is really annoying to speak. It is not extravagance in the series, the second part is still retained. <br /> <br />
