I like this film. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and still find appealing. Congratulations !! I think all those involved in making the film and the scenario should be proud of themselves. It's very strange, you feel like you're seeing a real life team. I would like to watch more movies like this. I'm glad they did not choose the famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably will not work. Even if Billy Connolly is well known, he has already stumbled into this role and I did not imagine anyone else playing it. Congratulations again, I really think that this film deserves the Peter Sellers Award for Comedy for Bill Niggi. And when you reach the final scene ..... Well, what to say!
