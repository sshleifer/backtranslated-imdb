Whether this film is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The significance of this documentary is not to show the quality of Chavez's man. It really shows how the Bolivarians saw how it happened, and Chavez's way of seeing it. Although it may seem wrong and biased to support a film, I think the view presented in the film is quite legitimate. The Venezuelan people through Venezuela's private media establishment saw only a unilateral view of the coup, the neo-liberal aspect. This film shows us how the Bolivarians saw it. Call it publicity, I say they call the referee by your side.
