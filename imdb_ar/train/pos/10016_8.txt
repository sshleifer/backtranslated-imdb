If there is one thing I recommend about this movie it is interesting. Surely the hypothesis attracts the audience because it is a mystery, and throughout the film, there are hints that there is something behind it. However, there is not much tension, and the mild-light Williams portrayal does little to make us deal with his obsession with the boy. <br /> <br /> Collett was much better than a woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. Hair production rushed and holes clear. It certainly looks like a preview of a more complete and better effort. Maybe the book is better. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something really good to inspire at least one commendable effort.
