One night, I stumbled upon it at the Bravo Space Station. Out of curiosity I decided to watch it, and to be completely honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and her body shows well. Will be lost as a gladiator but not after watching the whole movie! My only real attraction is to represent the supporting actor, especially the actor who plays Melnik. Christ is bad! The prison guard Hank is very sad. All he does is submerge and try bad attempts at the guard of his Wanda colleague, but fortunately for us the viewer and your opponent landed and fell with Wanda near the end. The music used is very tense and creates an ideal atmosphere for executions. This film is a single movie of Jennifer Thomas who is beautiful, talented and very sexy
