Without doubt the best novels of John Le Carr, has turned beautifully into a classic film. Peter Egan (Magnus Bem, The Spy Spy), Rudiger Weijang (Axel, Alexander Hamble's real name, Magnus, Czech intelligence observer), Ray McNally (father of Magnus Kun Kun Mann), Alan Howard (Jack Broadwood, Magnus) British), along with the rest of the characters, are perfect and very natural, and the person responsible for casting them should have been awarded a prize, even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are ideally executed. Despite the Magnus double, one can only feel near Magnus and Axel over Jack Braver I have read the book at least twelve times and have watched the film almost several times, and I am still fascinated by it.If I have one book to take on a desert island, the perfect spy is the choice above all.
