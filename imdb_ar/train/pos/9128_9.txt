I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest pleasures. Purple rain did not only break the border, but put a contract, fashion, music, behavior, dance! To this day, I and my friends still feel crowded on the soundtrack of Purple Rain and pretend that we are the prince and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the movie itself, I just meant what I said in the title, because most of it, this same movie is made by music. the acting? Please do not let me judge it because this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know they were not worth Oscar in any way. But I think the duo who took the film was Maurice and Garom, and their talk about the passwords was just hilarious. I just want to make this film a sequel to the concert because I felt it was film-making. <br /> <br /> Prince is a musical genius and creating beautiful music. Although the movie and acting are very bad, this film is still fun to watch at night and even dancing. Select this 80's movie, so enjoy it. Prince will want it this way, just for the party on the bottom! Boy, it looked lame. <br /> <br /> 9/10
