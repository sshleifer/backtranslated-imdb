10 out of 10, this wonderful and superlative documentary must be watched, with movie footage of the war that people have not seen for years, until it was shown in 1974. Movie clips in this war documentary do not miss anything, left some clips of me dumbstuck. The entire length of the series is more than 20 episodes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells the story of an amazing war. Simply put, this may still be the best documentary about the war, and now still 25 years old able to fill a huge punch. You should see this sometime, even if there are a few episodes, even while you will be on the alert because of the impact of this documentary on those who suffered there and died in the name of war, at WORLD AT WAR ..
