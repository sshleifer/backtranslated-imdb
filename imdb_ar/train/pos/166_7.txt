This was the first film made by Joan Crawford and Clark Jable and they will do more. Crawford starring a rich young girl whose father was eliminated in the collapse of the stock market and left nothing to her brother. They have not worked before, and brother William Buckwell gets a job with Jabel, a gangster and Bakwill believes it will be an easy task but gets his head very quickly. Crawford becomes a reporter in a newspaper but wants to work on big stories, but he is given useless things to work on. This is a massacre in which many of the men of Gable were killed and Crawford was witness to everything. It's a good movie but not one of their best.
