Most of what I recall in this film is that it was broadcast on local KTLA TV (Chapter 5) during every Christmas season during the mid to late seventies of the last century, mainly due to the fact that the real story took place in or near the Christmas night. It was always a concern to see the hell this girl was going through, being the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian Forest. The graphic scene of this young girl pulling the lice from her injured leg was a big impression on this young viewer. This is not the kind of delightful Christmas I used to see at the time. Definitely not the production of Rankin Bass.
