It was the first film I saw in my life, Ashley Good, and the first film by Victor Nunez, which I told him, and I'm glad I did. His calm tone, his quiet pace, his realistic portrayal of a young woman just beginning to live, her good portrayal of the struggle she must go through to leave her mark on life, and the decisions she makes on the basis of the real things, the people she meets. It is closer to the magic of the film than I have seen outside Star Wars films, and given the format of these films, this film deserves a high rating already. The representation of Ashley Goodes, Mr. Nunezurting, and his interesting little story makes this story a wonderful story and a wonderful film.
