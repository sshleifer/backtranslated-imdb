The game continued to play for only one season, but it was interesting to the fans because it required visual efficiency and steady hand. One wrong step would deprive the contestant of winning the prize, although it was clear that the contestant knew the right answer. It was always exciting when the contestant began drawing, wondering whether he would complete the drawing or finish. Allow the other contestant to easily win the contest. It was an open show, but it was clear that the contestants were often embarrassed by a silly mistake that was made unintentionally. Rarely seen, the game did not survive the season. The show will only be remembered as a seasoned game addict because it has proved to be very unpopular, even though the games show was making a big comeback on television after the gaming scandals of the 1950s. But it was a unique concept for gaming, never before seen.
