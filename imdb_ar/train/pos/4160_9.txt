One word that can describe this movie is this weird. I recorded this one day because it was a Japanese painting and it was old so I thought it would be fun. Well, the film was about a little boy traveling through the universe to get a metal object so he could take revenge. On the way he meets very colorful characters and must decide whether he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are an animator / sci-fi fan, you may want to check it out.
