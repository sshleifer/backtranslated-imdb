You must be one of the best political satire I've seen so far, with excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei, and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> An excellent plot, in a very good position and a very unexpected good twist in the end. Motion scenes were well shot and designed. very funny. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this movie a big thumbs up. He strongly criticizes US military intervention in the Middle East and, as such, may receive bad reviews from people who do not share the same political opinion, or those who are politically ignorant simply to appreciate dark and gloomy humor. In fact, in some places, comedy was so close to the truth that it was a boundary between funny and tragic.
