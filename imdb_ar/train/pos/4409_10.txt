This movie is one of the sleepiest of all time. 10. The story revolves around the famous "Bush messengers" of Missouri who fought alongside the South during the interstate war. The clothes they wore were authentic, history and why they fought very meticulously and well thought out. In fact there was one of the fights that did not happen as portrayed ... but it's not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well represented and were the most intelligent actors or the director really knew how to get the best of them. I think it was a combination of great direction, super-casting to find the right people and excellent performance by the actors. Not just one or two ... This movie is really jelled! It contains movement, romance, suspense, good men, and villains (sometimes depending on your individual point of view). History has been integrated into a single film. So he has Spiderman and a future jeweler. And it's good!
