The first time I saw this "movie" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in music and dance. As I grew older, I became more interested in acting as well. While the first half is just a retrieval of Michael's future (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), he was still thrilled to watch. The sequence of "Badr" was possible to neglect, although the children were good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Let Me Alone" were funny, especially when police officer Michael says, "I need your signature right here," after stopping him to dance in a dance-free area. But this "criminal smooth" is this ice on the cake. Joe Pesci did an excellent job like adversity (this hair was wild). Perfect dance as well as special effects. The only thing I could do was spiders. Anyone who loves Michael should see this, if you have not already done so. I give it 10+!
