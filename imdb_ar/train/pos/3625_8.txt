This is the best picture about baseball since Redford hit our natural way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths shine on the screen with a wonderful story and a team that looks real enough to involve you in their lives. <br /> <br /> In reality, after 9.11, the dream of the American dream is full of a real story about the middle-aged boy of Devil Ray, Jimmy Morris. Australian actress born, Rachel Griffiths, plays the role of West Texas native better than many Texans I know; Dennis Quaid was perfect ?? The wannabe and the modest winner also cast psychological baggage like ordinary audiences. It's real. Chemistry works on the screen. If you love baseball fans, you'll love this movie. The ingredients of Americana and apple pie were all in there. Become my popcorn? <br /> <br /> Hey: Buy the CD! Rock music and carry the story beautifully! Syncing words and music drives the story forward the way it should, which is often a frustrating area. <br /> <br /> Criticism: You've been given a baseball game to someone else. But Quid has something to teach us all about "personality" and heart. St. Rita and the nuns had a beautiful decoration, but they did not find their place in the story to open and close around them. A little long. Worth every minute in the final analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
