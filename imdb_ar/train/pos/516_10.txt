One of the best few films of all time. The change from black and white to color for Heaven and Earth Sequences was administrative excellence. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely clever, the entire movie leaves you surrounded by all the human sentiments, although the war movie does not discriminate. I must have seen this movie more than anything else, never tired of it. It is a film that makes you wonder about your deaths and beliefs about what happens after our demise.
