This movie is simply wonderful. It's rare to find a comedy with levels, and this is a good bloody example of this. When I first saw this film, when the credit was over, I and my friend looked at each other and asked, "Did you just do that?" For those skeptical, look at the levels. See comparisons between Vic and people at the club, DNA! See the various characters, and everyone who competes for the post, if you do not see anything else, see the relationship between treatment Vick and the path through the film. It's all in Vic's head! The opening line around the world of Vic. The closing scene with the camera go into the head of Vic, and inside, the whole universe! Totally citation, fantastic cartoon bands, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
