With all the modern films, dealing with British property, is it time for another? Answer: You bet! Young Victoria is another contributor to the wave of cinema from Britain that deals with the royal family. In this case, he deals with the early life of Princess Victoria, the events preceding the coronation to become Queen of England, in addition to her romantic marriage and the final wedding of Prince Albert. The film also deals with the storm life and occupations of Queen & Prince in England, as well as many other events (political unrest, etc.). Emily Blunt plays Victoria in her youth, while Robert Friend is her best friend and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the actors are rounded up with the likes of Miranda Richardson, like Danesis Kent, always welcome on screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a host of other actors who shine on the screen. John C. Vale (C.R.A.Z.Y, Loser Love), directed by Julian Philwells (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Laes Break). I came out of my head completely from the visual appearance of the film (by the filmmaker Hagen Bogdanskar), who gave every frame of the film an amazing look (with the help of the production designer, Patrice Vermitt), as well as some minor modifications (by Gil Bilkock and Matt Garner). What I also appreciate in the Fellowes scenario is the use of chess, as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivations (characters in the film move like pieces on a chessboard). This clever, well written, directed, photographed, edited and represented entertainment (and enlightenment) that makes spending spent well spent in the cinema. PG has been rated by the MPAA for some thrill scenes, some short violence (little blood, though not something very strong), a rude spree of languages, some on the smoking screen
