I think this film has been well put together. The amounts were also large. I loved how they all overcame their struggles and reached their goals. I recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to see it. Atlantis has some scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. Others made me happy. It's a movie that any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is a crazy "professor" or even brings together the crew for a wonderful underwater journey. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was also good, but the film puts better pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
