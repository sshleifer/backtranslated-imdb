* May contain spoilers * * may contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> In the era of Shrek (the movie) and Pixar (studio), this is a traditional animated film. I collected some characters that usually would not see together (let alone try to save a human child and bring him back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as best friends. If this sounds like a Disney movie, it is (only done through 20th Century Fox). The film trailer was one of the best I've ever seen, but the film does not match the expectations outlined in the trailer. The problem lies in the fact that the filmmakers have not reached a consensus about the target audience for the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the film that are understood by adults only but the film mostly targets children. Parents will enjoy the fact that it is for 90 minutes. Their children's attention is focused on something else. The backgrounds are excellent and the sound is good but this is nothing more than a beautiful movie. Children will love this film, and adults love it only.
