I am certainly delighted to have a film about the amazing life of Carl Bracher. Because of the civil rights era, Barashir has become a source of inspiration for people from all minority groups who are not prepared to settle for an expected situation. <br /> <br /> Prashiar also played Cuba Gooding Jr.. The life path he chose. It is very similar to Jackie Robinson, who has incorporated baseball and made it stick to his character and behavior. As Barashir knows, Gooding realizes that he does not want the life of the missionary of his father Carl Lumbly and Lumbley. It is clear that getting more life than he has got is real. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman has integrated the armed services after World War II, the Navy still has its limitations. A black man can only be a cook or a servant of the officer, being deprived of real combat parts. This is not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a deep-sea diver. <br /> <br /> Once he arrives at the diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding gets on everything and has been thrown at him, mostly by the Chief Chief Petty Officer in charge, Robert Dennero. Deneiro may have some remaining prejudices, but he is nevertheless a hero and someone who can inspire if one can transcend the racial divide. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but when they get to know each other, they both become Men Of Honor. <br /> <br /> Other good performances include Charles Theron as wife of DeNiro and Hal Holbrooke as president. For a diving school, the man you wish to sail in will retire only for reasons you'll see. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people who have the courage to spare them and the ability to change.
