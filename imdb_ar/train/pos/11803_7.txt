"Sasquatch Hunters" were not actually as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling to the Forest, Park Rangers Charles Landon, Kevin O'Connor (Roger Gordon), Matt Lattimer (Brian Stratton) David Zilina (Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet (Stacy Branccomb) accompany Dr. Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton White), Amy Shelton White (Gary Storm) and Louise Keaton assistant (Juliana Devier) to find some of the most famous bones in the area. When they make the camp, the team discovers a giant burial ground and more exotic bones scattered in the area. When group members begin to disappear, they begin to walk through the forests to safety. Sasquatch has discovered that behind the killings, the band team together to survive. <br /> <br /> Good news: This was not as bad as I thought. The film really begins to gain some strength at the midpoint, when the creature attacks. This fascinating series of scenes, as the entire group is subjected to attacks by the creature, the suspense in all stages of the game is very high. The wooded area is well suited during these parts, increasing the tension and wondering when one person will walk around in the forest. It also spreads quite vividly through the film, which is the effective use of noises and noises that do not appear on the screen and which are truly non-earthly. They add a lot to make this part very creepy, as well as at other times when the scream of roar is heard. It's very effective and works well. It is nice that the last part of the film is rising at a rapid pace, as it comes out very well. I should refer to one scene especially as it is a special sight at first sight. While a man running in the forest of the creature, he discovered the mission that continued to search for it. Raising his hands to yell at them for help, the second goes to announce his presence is that he attacked from nowhere and was killed very hastily. I was surprised by the surprise and gave me a small jump in the first show. <br /> <br /> Bad news: There were only a few things to complain about here, and one is a normal complaint. The creature is presented here mostly by the horrible CGI, making it look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it may have. The air threat evoked by the opening of the film is almost fired from the window when the creature appears on the screen. It is a distraction that it is a shame that no further work has been done. I have complained a lot about this, something that has to be eliminated, because it does not seem realistic and rather fake. Another big one is killing off the screen here. Often the person who was captured in the movie then snatched it away, then found the bloody body after that. It is very intense when the killings look nice and delicious afterwards. Otherwise, I do not have a big problem with this problem, since everything else usually criticizes about this problem did not really bother me, but it is called out to others outside of these things. <br /> <br /> Final Judgment: I liked Kinda this, but it is still not the best movie at all. It is not supposed to be taken seriously, and if we look that way, they are actually fun. Fans of these films should add a look to this look, and movies that like Sci-Fi Creature may find some great things here as well. <br /> <br /> Category R: graphic language, violence, and some graphics
