This movie is great if you enjoy watching B movies, that's the case. This is a classic college film in the 1980s, where one song plays through the entire soundtrack. Horrible movie, but worth a lease to enjoy it, or just to watch older men as they come out of the cupboards with kinda funny knives, if you ask me.
