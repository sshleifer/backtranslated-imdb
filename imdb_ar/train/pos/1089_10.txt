This film was produced in 1948, but it still rings today. Very, very funny. It starts with a family that wants to buy a small place in the country and "builds" from there. Anyone who has built a house will find this movie very popular. Great cast. Carrie Grant and Mirna Lloyd are delighted in this film. It is a classic black and white film reflecting the great style of the 1940s .... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of objects, and those comparisons at today's cost are very spectacular. I can not imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely. I am surprised at the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. Classic real.
