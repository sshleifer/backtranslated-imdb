Here are several lines of story about different personalities of women. The shoes they wear act as a sign of their troubled lives. All are converted at the end of the film. Adella (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; her daughter Anita (Monica Serveira) is underdeveloped and has a restricted life. Lier (Najwa Nimri) is a troubled shoes designer and loses her boyfriend; Marimarmine (Vicky Pe√±a) lost her husband and now raises the children of his deceased ex-wife. Isabel (Angela Molina) is a rich lady bored. <br /> <br /> Other characters are used to connect the five main female characters. In storytelling, everything is not given away at first: some contacts are created surprisingly late in the film and this adds to the experience. The theme of the shoe is to the extreme: for example, when Lear works as a shoe designer and works in a shoe store where she steals her shoes, she cuts through one of her heels. <br /> <br /> When editing small links are made between the scenes. Phone ring, cigarette lit, song, etc. Used to make contact and quick cuts. Frequent change in story prevents it from being dull or reaching TV levels. It strongly relies on music to set tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as background stories, and the footage is used for those cities to expand the story beyond the characters. One of the most moving shots is that Anita, who walks the same day every day, expands her career and restricts her life from the relative calm in her street to the busy main road: how the space is visually constrained. As with most Spanish films, many stories are narrated visually, using soap-like stories as a simple background. There is a somewhat romantic and emotionally poetic end but it is still beautiful. <br /> <br /> Since Ramon Salazar loves many of his own materials, he is too long. Some scenes are a collection of fragile materials and soap-level, including acting (Adila's love life, Isabelle's doctor). The subject of shoe is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to magnolia because the structure is similar. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically efficient, but somewhat mechanical. This has more ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually. After watching this, you tend to go directly to the new movie city: Madrid.
