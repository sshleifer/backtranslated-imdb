Thsi is one wonderful movie. Probably the best film I have ever seen. I watch it over and over again. I have to give it 10/10 stars because like I said this is probably the best movie I have ever seen. This movie + popcorn + coke = the best mix you can imagine. If you want to watch some movies then I recommend this clearly. First, I saw him, I liked him, so I bought him now and I own him and see him every day. My sons love it and I think this is the best movie ever. This movie is about Guy in Fantasy World. I do not want to spoil every movie so you can enjoy it after reading the text. Beautiful movie Beautiful characters, beautiful story, just great things. You should watch the movie. I hope you enjoy my comments Cya <br /> <br /> Jim Make
