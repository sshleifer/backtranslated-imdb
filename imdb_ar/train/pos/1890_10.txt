This is one of those movies that I have seen so much that I can quote most of them. Some lines in this film are not competitive. I especially enjoy watching him stumble and fall off while drunk, then go out to the lavish, drunk restaurant and part with Moss. <br /> <br /> I do not know how often I've seen this sequence but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur arrives at Suzanne's father's place with the piece, you will laugh a lot the whole time. I remember watching the racers in relation to the mosquito. I fell exactly as I imagined it would be. They were all laughing hard and it was hard for them to photograph. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gilgod was a wonderful addition to this. His behavior, his followers, and the way he treated Arthur were all hilarious. It's always a funny moment when he hits him on the head with his hat or tells him that he is a little spoiled. I laugh every time I listen to "I will be bathed" and the following lines.
