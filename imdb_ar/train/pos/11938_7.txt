I enjoy such films for their soul, not the pun intended. It's a decent and clean film about a baseball team being left behind, and a young fan wants to win it, because his obsessed father said that was the only way he came back for it. <br /> <br /> The Spirit shines in two ways: a funny film with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon Levitt, and heavenly teacher Al, taking the dynamic shape of Christopher Lloyd. In a vital film. It makes you smile, and really engages you in this sport. <br /> <br /> And here lies my grip. The only thing that bothered me was the kind of sports movies that make you an unexpected fan of the team. There is nothing wrong at all in that. I find it strange to get out of the film believing that the angels are a strong and gentle team, when my primary allegiance lies, as it is, in the Toronto Blue Jayes. It's really interesting. If it was just a film about a vulnerable children's team, then OK.
