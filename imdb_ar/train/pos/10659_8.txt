"I love cheap perfumes better; do not last long ..." - The character of lawyer Ralph Maquier (Lawson) tells the character of Helen Barbara Stanwyck, after receiving the scent of perfume she took with her husband in Tijuana ...! This line has cracked me, and I also began to borrow this movie - that cheap is better than price, because the cheap man who loves perfume and who has a way with 2 Ã— 4 is the best man in the long run! I agree with some other comments posted about attracting Helen to Lawson. Although her novel states that she wants to distance Lawson, she seems drawn to her fire nature, and that the emotion he raised in her will probably wash the tide!
