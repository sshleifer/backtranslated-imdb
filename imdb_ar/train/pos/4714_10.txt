The famous words of Roman nightclub owner Roman Maroni, that the "lousy corkscrew" that spends the entire film not only as a competitor to Johnny Dangiros, but also cut the English language. <br /> <br /> Another bland classic you can only discover in the afternoon or "Late Late Late Show", Johnny Dangerously is a wonderful spoof about a good-hearted boy who secretly lives a crime life to help pay for medical care To his mother and put his brother in law school. Yes, there is a story, but who cares? Representatives of Joe Piscobo, Dom Delis, Marilyu Henner and Alan Hill Jr. will keep you waiting for what happens next. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of laughter in this to put it here. Like a plane, you have to pay attention or you will miss something. Highly recommended for anyone who can use a good laugh or two !!!
