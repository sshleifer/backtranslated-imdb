It's refreshing to watch a movie that you think will end happily like almost every American movie, and then be surprised when it does not. I love a happy ending like the next guy, but sometimes it's better to shoot things in a more realistic way, and I think Brokedown Palace did this very well. <br /> <br /> The end, with one friend essentially sacrificing herself for the other and thus recovering their poor behavior earlier and which pushed them into the situation in the first place, was very impressive. I almost did it without the last line, which proved that she had not done the act she recognized, because it would have made the film more about the friendship between the two girls, not about the crime. Whether or not they do it is not so important. <br /> <br /> The story itself is bordered by cliches, but the actresses kept my attention to its excellent performance. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
