A year after losing the brilliant Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) to his rival Tarzan, the hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the woods to get another Bash to win a hearty blonde heart. He mixes work with pleasure, and plans to seize some ivory from the elephants' graveyard, which lies behind the Mutia cliff, the land of Tarzan al-Dasma. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by Martin Balarlins, who is characterized by vanity, enlightenment and a range of consumable objects. Pregnant, Harry finally arrived at his destination (having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage parents and hard-boiled monkeys) only to find Jane still fascinated by her strong lover. Worse yet, Tarzan refused to allow fishermen to take any ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Nasty Arlington decides to solve things by ambushing and shooting her and then telling Jane and Hult that Tarzan was attacked and taken by a crocodile. Tarzan of course did not die? After the leopard (!) Again nursed to health, swinging back to work in time to save Jane from a tribe of vicious eating monsters that attacked Holt's mission. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his companion, the second film of the star Weismuller as a jungle man from a few words, is often cited by fans as the best series; although I prefer the original little, but I can certainly understand the popularity of the film: There are some great serials! The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fascinating and leads to some steamy scenes. With the two stars wearing sexy clothes all over the place, there is a lot of candy enjoyed by viewers of both sexes (although O'Sullevan enjoys Much of the nude underwater scene is actually being carried out by a double body. The beautiful procession still shows a lot of skin, so it threatens to make "Stone Stone" at one point while its centipede flows to one side!). <br /> <br /> The most exciting movie moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater battle between Tarzan and Crocodiles, the stunning final where Jane is attacked by blacks and citizens, but is rescued by her lover, fellow monkeys, and a group of elephants. In the situation of the complete lion crush (again, the violence is surprisingly bad at times, although I am concerned, there is nothing as shocking as the Evil Pygmies and the Gorilla Pit from the first film). The cheetah also has its fair share of excitement, escaping rhinoceros, crocodiles, and large cats, riding the back of Tarzan crossing a river, and even navigating an ostrich to ride. <br /> <br /> Like his predecessor, Tarzan and his companion suffer a few bad effects and unproven props, drop dodgy back, a few ridiculous monkey suits, Indian elephants masquerading as African cousins, and convulsive swing fluctuations? This movie is very entertaining. If anything, they make it more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.
