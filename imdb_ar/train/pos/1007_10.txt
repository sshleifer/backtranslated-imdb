Well, let's show this. I'm really not in science fiction, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through Stargate. A circular device creates a dead end. It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like a conventional science fiction series, but it is not! This plot is not set today in some remote millennium like many other science fiction series. I find this wonderful. It gives you things, events and what you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to know many new terms and names for all the tools. They have some course but thanks to O'Neill who likes to keep the terms simple, there is not much. <br /> <br /> The series contains a beautiful mix of movement, humor and drama. If you enjoy a lot of special effects, you will not find them here. Do not use many bad effects but a limited amount of well-made special effects.
