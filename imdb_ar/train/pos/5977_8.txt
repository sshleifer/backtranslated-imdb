Eddie teenager spends his life being bullied and humiliated by his obsession with heavy metal music. One day he discovered that his hero, Sammy Kaur, had died, supposedly burned by the institution that wanted to put an end to his music. But Eddie has his last record, never released, and when he plays he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his fans. Long before Sami revealed his intention to return to life at a local Halloween party to avenge the town he had mocked one day. <br /> <br /> Full of humor and jokes, this is a very fun movie. Sammy himself is the original villain villain, playing on the "rock evils" obsession of 80. Well worth watching.
