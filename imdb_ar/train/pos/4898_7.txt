A charming little movie was shown in the United Kingdom about the reunion of a girl's swing band in World War II. An impressive group of seniors bring vibrant views to this delightful story through the award-winning performance of the exquisite Dench and Laine Tubes. Spend a pleasant time and an enjoyable hour for everyone.
