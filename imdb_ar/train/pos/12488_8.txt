I'm not bothered at all by horror movies, and I'm willing to watch any of them pretty much. This does not mean that I am willing to re-watch many of them, or I will not be criticized for them. This movie is creepy, and is done very well. In fact, I think this film will present an excellent double bill at Session 9. <br /> <br /> Before I arrive at my comments, I must determine that I have seen this on my own. I started watching him before going to sleep and I entered about 15 minutes before realizing that he was very effective, so I saved the rest of this morning. Even while watching it in broad daylight, it was still creepy. However, I can not guarantee how effective this is when viewing in a larger group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, the couple move into a remote cabin as a means of trying to reach conditions with this death. Let me refer to this death - this is one rare film that does not shy away from the death of a child. This is much more important, as they define the tone, as well as explain much of the representation that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> The couple is not so good. The wife herself came out of the relationship, and the husband did what he could to try to bring it back. While some comments complained about their actions - one of them indicated that they were acting as father and daughter more than husband and wife, and that was legitimate. He is trying to give her more guidance. It is a role played by men sometimes. <br /> <br /> There are a variety of concerns in the film, most of which are somewhat violent, although in some ways it is grotesque. The story itself seems very clear to most of the film, and takes a strange turn near the end. Although the role is not ridiculous, it is certainly not what I expected from the way things were going. <br /> <br /> My temperament, in the atmosphere, is very good performance for something that seems to have been filmed on video.
