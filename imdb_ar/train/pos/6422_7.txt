Military training films have become so common that they have become their own. Among our most prominent are "Officer and Gentleman", "Top Gun", "Ji-Jin", and now "Gentlemen". The fact that this has happened to be true does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This film is probably like "GI Jane" because it focuses on the angle of eliminating racial discrimination. <br /> <br /> The story is truly inspiring and perhaps the best story of a humanitarian interest between the above. There is no doubt that Karl Prascher (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a man of great courage and principle, whose personal power brilliantly shines in this film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman has a tunnel vision in presenting characters and avoids the personal evolution of different personalities other than Prachir in favor of Bracher's show in a state of continuing adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a pivotal figure, and except for the initial scene, the fiery battles, and some scenes with his wife, we do not know much about him. For example, Prachir sees scars on Sunday trees and we have to assume he worked as a plow, but there is no follow-up at this point. Mr. Bape (Hal Holbrooke) gets one short scene from which we can judge him. The rest of his screen appears as he breathes and hands. If a director produces a human story, he needs to humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. offers a great performance like Prachir. Maybe this is the best I've ever seen. This role and character is far more complete than any role played by him, and he rises to this occasion. In Jerry Maguire, Rod Tidwell was a wonderful figure, but one-dimensional with the depth of the rain pond. Brashear more complex and basically, the issues faced are life crises, making the part more difficult. This is a great recovery from Gooding's last role in Chill Factor, a film so horrific that it was almost a professional suicide to take part in his role. <br /> <br /> After spending his time as a comedian ("Analyzing This," "Rocky & Polynucleic Adventures," "Know Parents"), Robert De Niro returned to his dramatic roots with a remarkable performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedy, he's just a dramatic actor so great that he does not seem to waste his time doing comedy. DeNiro gives Billy Sunday a strong rock character who lied to the tormented soul. It is a pleasure to watch his work. <br /> <br /> Every movie I watch recently appears to contain Charlize Theron. I saw "The Legend of Bagger Vance" and "Men of Honor" and "Squares" respectively, and I began to wonder if she had a role in every film in 2000 (in fact, she did only five). This was a minor role for Thierron, but he campaigned well and succeeded in staying with DeNiro's step for the move. David Keith, who starred with Richard Gere in the film 'Officer and Gentleman', has a veil here. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting special features, including Carl Barrshire's real reflections and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie despite the vulgar plot and the one-dimensional display. I rated them 7/10. I am a sucker for consumer stories and I have a passion for stories where the power of character is the main theme. This film is particularly strong in both areas and combines two memorable performances that do not make up for some of the director's shortcomings.
