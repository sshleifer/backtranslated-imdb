I found the film quite expressive, the way lost by the main character but at the same time more clearly about certain things in life than the people who ridiculed him (eg apartmentmate). <br /> <br /> He was tortured and loved to watch him being tortured! This was a perverted side that was scary, but we were all happy to see it go out of misery again. <br /> <br /> He was like the characters of the game or the man of the pan through a landmine or enemy and we love watching him under sniper attack or fire but in the end we are happy to see him survive ... <br /> <br />.
