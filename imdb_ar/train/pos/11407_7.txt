Updated on January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of Wagner's favorite operas or musical drama, and to be more accurate, Meistersinger is the other. Although hard to imagine Libretto, by the composer as usual, is a combination of religion, idolatry, eroticism, and perhaps even eroticism, and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing the paint dry. /> Wagner, being a famous anti-Semite (perhaps Klingsor is one of the alternative Jewish villains), naturally assigned the first offer to an unchangeable person (not because of desire) Kundry, who is more involved and more likely to be a Jewish substitute, is either deceitful or grainy, depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> given that many of the video versions of Parsifal appear in the high position side, this film opera is, in contrast, a breath of fresh air. ft director Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, a great imagination for it, but it's hard to know the reason for his choices. For example: the infamous Double Parsifs (for each sex!), Dolls, Mask Set and Wagner Mask, and many dolls and symbols such as the Nazi Swastika in one of the travel scenes. (If I remember, Engelbert Humbertenk wrote the "real" actual music to quell the scene changes.) Although Wagner himself died too early to become a real Nazia, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife Kozima). They were at least travelers, including their grandson Wolfgang Wagner who still runs the Bayreuth Festival at an advanced age. In fact, Wolfgang Vagner, son of Wolfgang, in complete opposition to his father, tried to reconcile honestly with his great grandfather. <br /> <br /> Seiberberg seems politically obscure from what I read. In 1977, he made a famous film about Hitler, "Hitler: Aus Deutschland" (sometimes called "our Hitler" in English). Because it lasted for 8 hours and was not widely distributed, most people did not see it (including I.). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the audio CD-ROM on which this film conductor, plays Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton), plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick playing Parsifals (both Ngnehma Reiner Goldberg .) And Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland both play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera occurs over a long period of time have been described all of them (except Kundry?) as being aged between 2 and 3 considerably, but no one seems much older in the day at the end of the opera . In this opera, the cup is the cup from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper and not Mary Magdalene as recently, an idea I find rewarding!). <br /> <br /> All of them work very well, and the DVD seems to have improved the sound, if not the picture, pretty much. (Yes, I agree that "Kna" "superior style, even on the second version, stereo, but it may be superior to all recorded versions on the whole.) <br /> <br /> not for all Wagner's Parsifal, but I think it works fine Such as Opera was filmed.
