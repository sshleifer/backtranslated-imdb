This is a "odysessy over time" via computer animation, presumably working for more than 300 artists. It was manufactured in the late 1980s and released in 1990, and was the latest in the day. I thought it was good and very enjoyable at the sites. <br /> <br /> Most short scenes did not have any meaning, just shapes that evolved into other forms, but it was fun to watch. This is all about images, not really about any kind of story. There were some strange sequences in which strange creatures lived up to hear the birds. All that is a mobile computer that was new at the time. Even the term "computer animation" was not known. <br /> <br /> It is simply an opportunity to introduce this new technique in short sections of animation-like events with beautiful colors and creative scenes. There are no words, just pictures with electronic music. Stoners must have really loved her. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy". According to the current CG effects, this may have lost its effect, but I think you can still enjoy it.
