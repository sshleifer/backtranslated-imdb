It was simple and very nice. I think that the full sense of gender segregation in society, which can be bitter, has been demonstrated with great precision. He had a bitter type of Hummer in it. The fact that most of the actors were not professional, made the film more realistic and more realistic. There was a "documentary" side of the film as well. The best scenes are those that all the girls, who are prevented from watching, were listening to, to the soldier who was supposed to watch and broadcast the game. If you are an Iranian, cheering and dancing in the streets after winning the game, fills you with national pride !! If you are not an Iranian, you will still love him completely!
