I do not remember when I first heard about this film, but I hired it about six years ago, and it's still one of my favorite comedy movies. I'll admit, maybe you'll despise this movie if you do not know anything about rap. But if you're a fan of rap, so you're an informal person, you'll love jokes and internal references. One of the best lines in the film is the difference between a b **** and h **; I still use this line today and get a lot of laugh. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played nerd Lamar in the movie "Revenge of the Maniacs". Unfortunately this movie will never get a DVD copy.
