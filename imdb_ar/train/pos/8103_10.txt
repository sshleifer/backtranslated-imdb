This film was the most expensive, when produced. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells distressed because of their weak ratings --- for good reason. He was and still far ahead of his time. Irrespective of the apparent bad trend, most likely, at first, the action moves to a spectacular conclusion. <br /> <br /> Whether the role of Sir Ralph Richardson's coach, or even better, his wife, Sir Cedric, as an opponent of spaceflight, the role of Raymond Massey as the main "John Cabal" - all offers spectacular performances. <br /> <br /> The scene with Mr. The unrivaled Korda group runs out of the little girl into a "never-to-be" spectacle, and says "Will life continue to get beautiful and loved"? That quickly brings tears to any father / grandfather. This is not a film for young people - unless it is "experienced" but those who have seen "horror" that opposes it. <br /> <br /> Sure, the "parachute" appears to be in a state of distress --- while using a "magnetic gun", now known as the "universal driver", can be considered ridiculous, compared to the rockets --- Give Sir Korda Rest period - Mr. Wales made this choice. In +8- $ 8 million, this film exceeded the "over-budget" --- so focus on what it can manage. <br /> <br /> The real power of this is John's greatest cinema, "the last statement of the human fate of Kabal" - his friend Basworth suspects in the wisdom of wandering in space: "We are small animals." John Cabal's correct answer is, (rephrase) "Yes, small animals, if that is all we are, we must live and die like this." They stand under a great astronomical telescope. He sweeps his hand over the night sky. "However, we may have all the universe, or nothing." - - Then the final choir goes on --- "What should it be?" --- This is not "Star Wars", "Blade Runner" --- anything you might consider "great" --- this is the real thing. <br /> <br /> Remember every last Stephen Hawking address, on another Medal of Honor --- "humanity must leave the earth, or die." - - the essence of this action --- I love "standard entertainment" - Be the "mood" appropriate - whatever it takes --- will take this breath --- I "guarontee" - Since the publication, I have noticed that many have commented on the poor "media quality" of "surviving" examples.In the 1980s, I developed a coloring process "Special" requires an original "clean" Korda, who noted that, unfortunately, all of them have left for --- so we have to taste the rest --- "sad but true?"
