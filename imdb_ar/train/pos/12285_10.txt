The murder of a wonderful author of a novel famed for the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende was killed. In the large real estate environment that grew out of the rubble, to become a force for the abuse and exploitation of anger, a luxury property that benefits the astounding Esteban Tropa and his unworthy family, the great Danish director Billy August brings back, to a large extent, the process that will lead to larger A defect in his story of the rigid Chilean nation, whose main character will be Augusto Pinochet (the similarities with Stephen are inevitable: remember, for example, the dark senator's glasses that make him wink at the general to start making the palace). <br /> <br /> Bille August brings together a great team of Jeremy's outstanding music, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, and the hard lesson in life always brings us to force us to change. In Esteban, the law of resonance is fully applied, with great wisdom, Solomon describes these words: "The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." <br /> <br /> Glenn, who never forgets, plays the fragment of Stephen, his contaminated sister, whose sin was driven by loneliness, spiritual love and Platonism, the cruel wife of his snowy brother. Meryl Streep is also wonderful, a woman whose name came like Clara's Glove. With the kinetic, cognitive and Mediterranean forces, this militant woman, loyal to her conservative and outspoken husband, is an indication of the personality and restraint that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. <br /> <br /> Every character is an image of brilliance (as Blanca leader deserves the rebels Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a picture of humiliation, such as Stephen Junior, the bastard child of the senator, who acts as a tool for the return of Bomerang. <br /> <br /> The film moves the intestine, re-creating some facts that should never be repeated, but this is still ridiculous (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, anyway, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende Bill August only.
