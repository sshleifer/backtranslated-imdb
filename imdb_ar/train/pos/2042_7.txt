Star rating: ***** Not acceptable **** Very good *** Well ** You can go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Career Development Hook Kate (Franka) ) Goes to the London Underground train train to take her to meet George Clooney. However, after a hectic day of work, he falls asleep and wakes up to find herself alone in a deserted platform. As she races with a position she moves from one strenuous encounter to another, she learns something more insidious and waiting for her there. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British have become a truly independent film industry, especially in the horror movies, with movies such as Creep and 28 successful days later (which have strong echoes in parts). Using it, crawling does not intelligently create (especially at first) a frightening sense of isolation and tense fear. In a smart runtime, as he (though inadvertently, I suspect) is capable of honoring some high-definition horror movies of the 1970s that rely on trauma and fear without focusing too much on personal development and such. <br /> <br /> Among its weaknesses, some scenes can be predicted a little, but these scenes do not really succeed in making them less fearful or effective in any way. I'm not sure whether the end is meant to make it a kind of moral play and not quite perfect, but it's certainly very effective and serves its basic function well. ***
