Joan Fontaine plays the villain in this Victorian film. She plays a convincing role in the marriage of a married woman who has a lover on the side and places her sights on a rich man, Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is as good as Miles. Miss Fontaine behaved towards perfection - at the same time she was cunning, sensitive, and looked innocent, scared and charming. Take an actress with an extraordinary talent to pull this off. Joan Fontaine appeared to be very elegant in the elegant costumes written by Travis Pantone. Also in the movie Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Mrs. Flora. I highly recommend this film.
