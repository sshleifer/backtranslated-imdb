I enjoyed this movie after I hated it because I wanted to help this man! I'm in my fifties and I have a lot of friends in the field of music ... who are still trying to become adults .... no more fans, groups, money etc ... They face such a difficult time for a regular life ... As they see new bands etc. Get the spotlight ... It's almost like starting over again ... This movie is a testimony to a lot of old rockers from the 70's and 80's going now .... That's where I find the movie Sad and frustrated. But it depicts the life of an old rock abandoned and produced in an incredible way. The little girl who arrives at his dilapidated home reminds me of McLaren Hollis (outrageous) ... a lady in a movie will shout to him. This film is necessary for people in their fifties who saw the rise and fall of gangs, people who knew members, and watched them get hurt as they crawled old, and popularity faded. It 's almost a perfect movie ... but happy way ... because of the whales. Must see!
