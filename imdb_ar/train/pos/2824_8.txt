The debut in the American film Greta Garbo is tantamount to likening how our fate lives derailed through our destiny and our actions, as in the torrent, causing us to lose part of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta Leonora, a poor peasant girl who loves the character of Ricardo Cortez Don Rafael, plays the landowner. Ricardo also loves her, but is easily influenced by his mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she became a famous opera singer and develops her reputation for being a loose woman. In fact, part of her position is bitterness because of Raphael's abandonment. <br /> <br /> She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually encounters Raphael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is the famous celebrity La Brunna, and that Garbo takes on her role as the singer she really enjoyed and appreciates with such subtle craftsmanship in later photos. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez reminds one of a lot. Valentino seems like a clone of Valentino by MGM, although he never thought he could actually be right. It is reasonable in a non-sympathetic part like a weak-willed mummy, allowing himself to live realistically but playfully at the end of the film. Leonora fails to win when she returns home, and later when he follows, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This film was beautifully filmed, with wonderful sequences of storm and collections depicting Spain at that time authentic looking. There are also some good secondary performances by veteran actresses Lucian Littlefield, Marshall and Mac Swain. <br /> <br /> Although this is a lost love story and missed opportunities, I do not think that Leonora and Raphael would have been happy together, because he needed a more traditional wife and was a very professional lady, and I do not think she was happy at Small village. The end is right in life and no punches are pulled. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie as the first appearance in the American film Garbo and a series of things to come
