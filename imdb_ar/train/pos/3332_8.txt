Yes Commitment. Let's say "Fever Pitch" may fool you into believing it's a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you do not have to be a baseball fan to really enjoy this picture of Brother Varelli. But, of course, if you're one, you'll enjoy it more; with all the references (those very accurate, as I say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet history; from Bambino's curse and everything to it, including those two words you can not pronounce in front of a fan In Boston: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jamie Fallon portray two people perhaps, perhaps the second thoughts of getting into a relationship: successful job addicts who are wealthy also meet the schoolteacher? The thing is that Fallon's character wins Barrymore's heart by being funny, caring, sweet and perfect. But her friends ask her a logical question: If such a guard, why is still in the market? Enter Boston Red Sox. He has been committed to his team since his uncle issued his Sox season tickets; he has never missed Red Sox at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> This delicate balance, how willing is the workaholic to abandon his mania; how much this baseball-obsessed teacher is willing to make concessions in order to preserve the other love for his life, is what this film is about. <br /> <br /> At first, you might think that sports mania is a little overpriced from the movie to ease the comics. Well, I'm sad to admit that they are not. Myself, as a fan of Houston Astros fanatics, can say that all is true. I will try in every possible way to see every Stros game; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet. I read the sports section at Chronicle every day. And yes, my room looks like the Shade shop, Minet Mid Park. With a closet full of Astros equipment, including 5 shirts, 20 T-shirts and you know the rest. Fallon was carrying a Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon had sufficient credibility as a fan of the so-called Red Sox, although he could have withdrawn it without becoming a cartoon (thank God Adam Sandler); the plot is about how the couple tried to manage them With passion for each other. <br /> <br /> I would say it would be a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be among the best movies in history; but definitely breaks the mold in this genre and attracts both men and women.
