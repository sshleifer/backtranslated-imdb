Season finale sent a mix letters, I felt feelings of joy, as well as feelings of lies and deception. Rosanne told all her viewers that the entire ninth season was a lie because her husband, Dan, died. She also admits that the family never won the lottery, and the ninth season was just a lie, as she wanted to. I'm still confused when she said that Becky ended up with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit the pregnancy. So I think that's what she wanted to be, but it was not. So the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be impressed with the offer. :)
