Personally, I liked this film and I am concerned about the classification that some people have made. If you do not like comic books or animations, you will not like the movie, of course, so why do you watch it and you are annoyed to see it live far from me? However, if you are a fan of attention and strong characters and heroic (erotic) women who are kicking and executing the world (hell), you will love this movie. I thought the story really attracted me and it was a very wonderful film. Anime is quite or more like some American films following this new trend of adult animation. Such as Titan A.E meets the direct action version of Punisher. In the end I highly recommend this movie to fans, comedians, superheroes or anyone with a mind open enough to look for a fun movie.
