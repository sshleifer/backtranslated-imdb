City Hall is a fairly mixed bag. The short essays are part of New York City politics and part of the morality tale. Al Pacino, Boss Dukakis-esque with presidential dreams, often gives poor or weak performance. There are several times when the scene is chewed, and in the case of CITY HALL, this is where it shines. John Cusack performs poorly and flawlessly in general, without getting into the New Orleans accent comics, or slipping into melodrama during the climax of films. Danny Aylo as a rising political leader, is also very good. I love entertainment songs too. <br /> <br /> The main problem in CITY HALL, a good film in many ways, is the general sense of lack of momentum. It's more like a documentary than a moving picture. See action or follow the story from a separate perspective, of course, do not share the viewer. When the viewer is not quite involved, he becomes indifferent to the characters, and ultimately the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to be isolated, and should not have been a chapter full of details, came out of "Hmmm ... uh ... well." They say to you, "You can not fight the city hall," as Clichy goes ballet. However, it still can not stop you from thinking about what might be, if the scenario has just tightened the pace of this movie.
