Strange enough, all the previous comments just described the beginning and left the details more. I feel the need to emphasize that this is a family work, because Marina Vladi was also the wife of Robert Hussein, and excellent jazz music was written by the father of director Andre. Under these circumstances, no wonder it was a really wonderful film, it was watched when released and instantly identified with music. The suspense was flawless and lasted all the time to the end. Robert Hussein, who was then one of the best European players, managed to impose himself as a screen and theater director. He still offers wonderful theatrical performances, preferring religious themes. Carrie Carraso, Paris, France
