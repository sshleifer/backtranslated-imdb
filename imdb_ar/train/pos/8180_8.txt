This really fun movie may make you uncomfortable because it is not mentally ill or mentally ill, it is your daily doctor. How scary that. I got some good actresses and actresses in this film, although some are not as appreciated as Virginia Kehan ​​in Sarah's role. Ken Fury, who may be acquainted with demons Rob Zombie, refuses and shares Halloween (2007) in the starring role of Dr. Alan Finston (Corbin Benson). Short short summary is this: Dr. Alan Finston, the guy who has an exciting wife, a beautiful house, and a great dentist loves everyone. So his wife holds him in the pool cleaner. He then begins to hallucinate that the teeth of his patients are all rotten and the female patients are his wife and he begins to eat nuts in this film. But before that, gentle man.
