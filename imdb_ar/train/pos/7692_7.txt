First, I will give my assessment of the series in general; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I took it away from the three slope slope of this series after the departure of John Amos. Do not get me, there were strong hit episodes later but only after leaving Esther Rolle for one season he returned. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a very impressive play (with dramatic references) was performed for the first time CBS. Was the first television show on an African-American family living in Chicago for projects in the 1970s. Designed by Norman Lear as a sub-show of "Mod", he struck again the right chord with viewers. <br /> <br /> Since this show, I have not seen comedy stand talking directly about the struggles of families within the city. (Well, there was "South Central" from Fox in 94 but it was not renewed.) <br /> <br /> John Amos was James Evans Sr. He was the supreme father of this family and behaved like any father his family and his children should keep together in the wrong ways of life. <br /> <br /> Esther Roll was a wonderful mother or mother meaningless and was on the same page as her husband when it came to raising their children. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael is a young but very bright young man who is stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is the same program founder Mike Evans who was Lionel Jefferson in "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Telma is a young girl aged 16 or 17, who must deal with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto. Jimmy Walker as Jie. Evans Junior is a young man of the kind who cracks wise and does not take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Simply, all my favorite episodes with John Amos, except Benny lines the story of Gordon / Janet Jackson. <br /> <br /> After James Evans's demise, the show lost its stability and the audience left. She left Ester Roll for a full year, unwilling to play a minor role in the smart JJ game "Dyno-mite's"! <br /> <br /> She returned to the next season, having secured a guarantee that the writer would end up. Florida's neighbor, Willona Woods, was an absolute woman who ended up adopting a little girl who was abused by Benny Gordon (her 10-year-old Janet Jackson played). Abby Penny played the role of Totti Fields, Kim Wildes' mother. <br /> <br /> In August 1979, the show ended, leaving everyone projects for a better life. JJ artist has sold an idea for comic book company, Michael went to live on college campus. <br /> <br /> Both Willona and Benny, Thelma's husband and Keith + Florida footballer moved to the same building in Chicago. It is not the most realistic ending, but by then it was not important.
