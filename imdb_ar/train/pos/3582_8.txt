Here's another film from the 1980s that most people do not know. This film is slow and wonderful (the footage of Montana's natural landscapes is amazing and reminds me of the last "open range" of Costner, which Robert Duvall also starred), and the film The Emotional Illness is the best film to watch late one night when you can sleep or on a Sunday afternoon silent. Those in the mood will be dealt with in a detailed and intimate manner about the grief of one family and how to return together after the accidental shooting of the younger son and the killing of the eldest son during hunting. The offers are all first class and delicately quiet. Glenn Claus, Robert Duval and Wilford Primley are idealists in their portrayals, as are all the young players and actors. I particularly liked how director Caen (who unfortunately did not draw anything noteworthy because this except the first "small guns") gave us small, quiet glimpses of the personal grief of all. We do not see how the death affects the younger brother or the parents, but also the confused middle sister, the lost uncle, his crazy wife, and the girlfriend of the dead teenager. What we are essentially getting here is the western western rural response to "ordinary people". There are also shades of David Lynch's "Straight Story" in some moderate Middle Eastern ethics that depict people here, as well as in the haunting images of the farmland in which they live. This is one of the "most of the tear clowns" better than that era, and finding a little cute for you quality film hunters there.
