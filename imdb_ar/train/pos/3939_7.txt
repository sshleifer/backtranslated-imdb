According to John Ford's biography, the fictional biography of Abraham Lincoln may be his greatest mistake is the wonder of women and their ability to dance "in the worst way." The Ford camera only compliments the views to reveal Mr. Lincoln's early life. But what the film lacks in the intricacies of character, it compensates for beauty and depth of vision. The unusually beautiful works of early films, which could not have been a series of brilliant fixed frames, Ford has a unique eye for storytelling. The film sings the life of a young man full of hope. Henry Fonda plays Lincoln's intellectual and intelligent role in one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film concerns two young men, two brothers, who are on trial for a murder they both allegedly committed. In the style of the angry classic mob, the town decides to take justice in its own hands and kill the couple, so that Abi Sadiq steps into battle. He charms them with a sense of humor, asks them not to steal him from the first big case, and that they are as good as execution with the children's lawyer. The following appears to outline all the tragedies of homicide in the courtroom afterwards, where Abbey interrogates the witnesses with pleasure and humor to the judge, the jury and the city before stumbling over the missing links. <br /> <br /> The movie is shown as do many of John Ford's films: A Tread of Americana, a dash of moderate predictability, and a hint of irony that you are not sure whether you have put in a recipe or if Ford did it By himself. Despite Hollywood's public sensation of the film and the excessive national joke that refers to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is quite enjoyable and well-designed, if you can take Dramak with a grain of salt.
