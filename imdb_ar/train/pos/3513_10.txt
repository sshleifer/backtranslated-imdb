The actor Herman Jose plays football as a footballer who gets a pass from African players and tries to sell them for a little money to rival club Benfica. Porto have not played well and wanted to be unfair from FC Port. But what happens is that these two players are good at the end and that FC Porto sell them a lot of money to a foreign club, which makes them a good job. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without great precedents in the great films, is a very good and funny comedy, showing all the rivalry between the north / south of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
