The emotional powers and personalities of Dominique and Eugene are things that Hollywood no longer manufactures. This is one of the most emotional and sensitive movies, I felt the heart! Roy Leeotta, Tom Holsey, and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, offer Oscar Winning! There are not enough words to express the size of this film. Certainly, people who do not participate in emotional films may not care as much about Dominique and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this film extends to the heart and is blessed with compassion and humanity. Never forget this movie, never <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS BELOW ***** <br /> <br /> The simple and eloquent story is brilliantly written. Eugene is a middle school intern and faces long hours and a great workload at the hospital. His brother twin brother Dominique (born 12 minutes ago) is a bit slow and embarrassed because of brain damage due to abuse victim by their father. (A tragic moment when it is discovered in a movie that will leave you to cry!) Eugene (like "GNU") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish his studies at the medical school, which means accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominic (like "Nikki") behind him, or dropping the rest of his education for his care. Nicky helps pay his middle school brother's fees by working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Issues of ethics, ethics and responsibilities are brilliantly combined in this historical film. When Geno thinks that Nicky may make progress toward independence, Dominic turns around and ends up like a drug dealer, or hooking him up with a defective wire found in a waste dump on an electric device. <br /> <br /> Larry, "The Character" and Nicky's partner on his way to the trash that fills Dominic's naive head with all kinds of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, studying in clinical pharmacology) goes to Atlantic City and plays away all their money . But in the depths, you can see that Larry cares about him. In their tours, Nicky also endorses a young boy, who we discover is also beaten by his father. The end result is also tragic, and the pain you see on Nicky's face when it happens, speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the brothers share with each other can not be overstated. All Nicky wants is to be loved and looking for acceptance in any way possible. (Meaning he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother become independent enough for Geno to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor? A wonderful film had to get a greater appreciation of tons than it deserved, but unfortunately appeared at about the same time with Rain Man, who treated a similar case. However, Dominic and Eugene love better because it has a much stronger emotional element. Be careful that this movie is directed directly to the tear ducts, so make Kleenex useful! What a movie!
