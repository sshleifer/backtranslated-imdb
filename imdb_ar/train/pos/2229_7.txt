I've read some horrible things about this movie, so you're ready for the worst. "Confused, confused, horribly organized." Although some of these charges may be helpful, this film was nowhere near the normal DVD programmer. In fact, it was actually aspirations. I have tried something behind this wild / slippery nonsense. By God, there are some interesting things going on. <br /> <br /> Ms. Barbo is a miracle. She holds the film on her shoulders directly. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is a masterpiece. Harmony eventually collapses under the weight of his own ambition. There are a lot of sub-schemes that are trying to live with. For example, if Hope learns that her mother is evil and that she will eventually kill her brother, why not kill what is in the sequence of the first film? It seems he would have won the hell of traveling to the future to do so. <br /> <br /> However, I give abnormal points to her attempt. Little ambition is not bad.
