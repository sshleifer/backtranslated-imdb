What a fun movie! Shepis is very beautiful and Scarecrow is distinctive and innovative. He really brought me back to the monsters of the 1980s. Obviously the budget is low and not everyone is Baccino behind the lens but that does not matter because it does not take itself seriously. From the lagoon garbage trailer to the high martial arts moves of Scarecrow, this is really a jewel B movie. Get some refreshments, snacks and a couple of friends and relax and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much that I came out of all three Scarecrow films I purchased. It is certainly not for everyone but for everyone. Sometimes, you just put the roof of your thinking and smile.
