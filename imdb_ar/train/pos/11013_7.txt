There were a lot of films made by Hollywood during the war years and designed to mobilize support for our troops from the public. Today, some may reject them or see them as mere propaganda - as they are technically, but they are positive and aimed at uniting the nation. This film is an effective example of this type of film - it has a very realistic scenario and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays pretty much the same character that he has played in many other films (you know, a strong guy talking, but "bulging"). Randolph Scott, as always, is qualified, fun and the rest of the additions are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombers in training). While the story reminds us of many other films about our pilots and crews, the film is well designed to make it interesting and not out of reach. This, perhaps, except the end - where the film is slightly higher but also very satisfactory. The only serious downside, and this is mostly for the Newbies, is that some of the footage that was stored is rather slowly integrated into the film and the "nuts" like me who may be history teachers and airplane enthusiasts probably noticed it - others might not notice.
