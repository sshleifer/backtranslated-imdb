"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the most martial arts films I have had the opportunity to see. Samo Hong depicts a Chinese farm boy who comes to visit a friend of the city. Just like Tang Long from Dragon Road. Wherever Samo goes, the problems start, so he has to rely on his martial arts skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even hit his nose with his thumb just as Bruce Lee does as he screams. It also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching Bruce Lee fat. There is a big confrontation near the end of the film which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo must face each opponent one by one. Is somewhat like the "game of death," where each fighter has a different martial arts system. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I really enjoyed watching as well as the first Sammo Hung movies that we've seen. Excellent battle scenes and lots of laughter. A rare classic film Sammo Hung I strongly recommend to all martial arts lovers there. 8.5 / 10!
