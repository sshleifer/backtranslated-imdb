I do not give a film or a show often, but this show touched a guy in a way that did not have any other show. I found the whole string on mysoju.com and I thought that the premise looked interesting so I took a look. I was not disappointed with what I saw. I have moved. This story remains on the side of giving as the main characters pass through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played by Koyuki, has shown us human nature because she wants to prevent the emergence of problems. No one really wants to put his soul in front of the companion perspective. So instead, replace the human, who plays adorable Matsumoto John, as a pet. This pet looks like any other creature we will look at in a pet. Difference; he can retaliate in the same way, after all Momo is a man, not a dog. Being treated as a pet, it interacts with the situations in which the dog may interact. Spending some time with her new boyfriend, Momo feels jealous. When she realizes that her pet is not just a pet, the sexual tension between the two becomes thick - Momo is a miracle of dancing. Her thinking slowly changes as we begin to look at his own ideas. Matsumoto takes us from a very first one-dimensional vision at first, to two-dimensional when we see him as a dancer, to a three-dimensional character when we see him begin to fall for his master as a man, not as a dog. In my opinion, it is worth watching this story just to see this character evolve. Matsumoto plays Momo with such a tenderness that she almost begins to wish if you had one too. Do not want to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo mentions (the name she calls the new puppy)? We both know that this will not be able to continue. Watch this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
