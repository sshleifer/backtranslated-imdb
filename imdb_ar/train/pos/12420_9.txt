Was a great success at the time but was now classified as an Australian cult film. Humor is wide, insoluble, and in the final scene where a BBC studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it. Contains only all the cliches about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the Old Country, and all the cliches about those greedy, stuck, joking, conservative Britons. Will be acceptable to the British because of its strong cast of well-known actors, and for Australians of this generation, who can "get" humor. Americans - Forget it. The language and jokes in the Australian dialect of English, therefore will not be understood.
