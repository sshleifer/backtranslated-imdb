It's undeniable that Ealing's comedy films are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best films. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London was discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the people in their battle to preserve the treasure that was found after the bomb exploded, and to drive away black market traders who soon realize that the exemption from UK law does not exist. When they become prisoners in their streets because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fighting against the regime. <br /> <br /> They are forced to rationalize water and food in their position for what is right. In fact the situation is worse than it was before everything started, and this is where the moral comes. It is when they lose all the food they think they have been beaten and call to surrender, only to make the entire London respond to their plight by sending food, much of it. Enabling them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> The film was the right one. It was a great performance, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Badley and Pete Warren. I've been properly positioned, not too emotional, and the story's morale has not been imposed on your throat. deserve watching
