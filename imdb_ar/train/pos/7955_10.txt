This is one of the greatest pet movies ever created. I cry every time I see the cry of the shadow "Wait, wait for me, Peter!" As the family car is pulled away. This is a must know if you love animals! Best movie ever! The lines in the film are sometimes stupid. Such as when Sasi says a chance. "Rule the cat and dogs drool!" Lines like this I could have done without, but when I was six I bet I loved it. The story may seem intertwined, but I love it. The older dog who prepares for the chants to take over when he goes is really moving when thinking about him. My dog ​​reminded me of my childhood. I think everyone can find a part of themselves in "Homeward Bound".
