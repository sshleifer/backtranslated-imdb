It is clear that Ang Lee likes to turn into a film, to pick up the movements and characters and to set a guise when they appear. Covering the random end of the American civil war through the indiscriminate actions of a young militia, unmistakable in mind or masculinity, this is the ideal approach. It turns out that the film revolves around the formation of personalities, maturity and relationships. He also shows me the beautiful panoramic pictures in the middle of the South as a silent figure, bearing the conflict like a Guardian parent. <br /> <br /> James Schamus is probably the standard holder of this film; nearby, there are a number of well-received and impressive performances. The name Jeffrey Wright alone can carry this film for me. He is clever here, but he plays a slow role: instead we are treated very well (if not revelation) by a large and often recognizable group. <br /> <br /> A noble and optimistic film. One to see if you are not fancy more difficult, bitter cold like a mountain or claim, for example. 10/07
