I love this movie. It is well written and acted and has a good cinematic. The story blends action, humor, mysticism and compassion with great collections and beautiful site shots. You can watch it, buy it and show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> Acting is well done and Murphy does a great job portraying the reluctant / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them interesting and well developed through dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I was interested in what happened to these people, and while the result was very predictable (winning good men, the hero gets the amazing and amazing girl who saves lives - who does not see it coming?), I still feel happy when all Something in the end. Praise be to Allaah. The dignity of this film has never been destroyed by the sequel of Karbi. Get some popcorn, hug your couch, and watch this fun, happy and fun movie.
