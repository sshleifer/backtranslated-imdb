Why did Dynamo have no pants? Where did they go?? This was never explained. That's why this movie was so cool. In addition to Starsky gave his children AIDS !!! Great acting too. Richard Dawson deserves the Best Supporting Actor award! A I D S My favorite film in the film was "That hit the spot" A I D S. This film was about "Birds". I tried to give this movie "stinking" but continued to play. What wrong do I do ??? !!!! I thought that "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I would like to exhibit. Why Dynamo was not wearing pants. I know his arm was slanted but ... what's up with those crazy future networks. Why did not that family get the runner Ray Combs on the network ?? I could have used one. AIDSSSSS
