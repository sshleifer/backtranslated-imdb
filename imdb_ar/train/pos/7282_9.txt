This film was very good and it was totally unfair to judge it without taking into account the time it was issued. There are some movies that do not get older but this is not clearly updated. However, I saw this film when I was young and for more than twenty years, it was both pictures because the story is memorable for me and most of my friends, so we can appreciate it again on the DVD. In fact, I remember this film as the subject of many conversations and meetings where boys talked about things we shared. So there was a little bit of disappointment and even sadness when we finally had a DVD. First, there was a theory about how naïve our generation was. Second, I think there is something more. I would appreciate that this film contains something that should be interesting for all modern filmmakers, specifically those who focus on the type of debilitating horror. This is the distortion, the idea that gives coherence to the film; the fact that human distortion produces a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how nauseated it was when the beast ripped Kurt's arm. At the end; when the creature bites the neck of the doctor to take a piece of his veins. Another wonderful thing is the manic atmosphere that prevails without decomposing heavily in all scenes, regardless of whether the procedure is in a secret laboratory, a lonely street where the man in the car looks for a female body, a room to wear clothes, etc. and so on. It may be because the good movie is no longer just a technical thing. For example, at the scene, the man who saves the head of his fiancée is more precise, making a manager of a second and modern unit may be interesting. Same with all motion scenes, including Kurt's arm. Moreover, something can be done using the make-up monster. Some remodeling was good. I think in this case the attempt is worth some time. However, the tones should be preserved in black and white.
