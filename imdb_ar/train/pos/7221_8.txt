Every time you think that you have a handle on the Deathtrap, comes the development of another piece of land. Best to sit and enjoy the trip on this one. The most famous because of a kiss on the screen between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (unfortunately broken from the teaser version you've seen), this movie has a lot to recommend. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. Once he was a successful playwright, his last Broadway play failed. Although his wife Mira (Diane Cannon) is only supportive, in a critical and emotional sense, this does little to make Sydney feel better. To further insult the injury, the young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), Sydney, sent a play to consider. He is the first Anderson, and Sydney can see that young talented writer. He joked to his wife that he should invite Anderson to kill him, and submit the play himself. She would have laughed with him at first, but when Sydney already calls for dinner, she fears he might already apply his scheme. Their fears may be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful program. There are transitions and reflections throughout the plot, and they come faster and more furious as they approach the end. It's the kind of movie that put you on the edge of your seat from the start, and keeps you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Cayenne offers his usual excellent performance and shows talent in playing well-educated and thoughtful men. Reef also offers a wonderful show of a man who does not seem as broad or almost innocent as he seems. Frenetic guns works well for Mira. Irene Worth performs well as a neighbor as well as a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This is a never-ending movie you never expect, and repeated views will help you capture objects that were not found earlier in the watchdogs. An unknown classic is unfortunately remembered only for a scene that aroused some feelings at the time - and this is a real shame.
