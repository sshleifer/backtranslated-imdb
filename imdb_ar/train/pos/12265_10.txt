First of all, I was struck by the film "Tintin and I" as a great documentary. Photography and editing are breathtaking (almost anti-religious). <br /> <br /> We follow the life of the Tintin Hergé staircase in an open interview of 1971. The Tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological battles of the 20th century. In the midst of this Hergé has his own demons to fight, it seems that much of his graphic activity is trying to calm them down and escape into a world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Despite stunning photographs of panoramic Tintin graphics, as well as some reconstructions and album reviews, Hergé's story is fully recounted through interviews and archival materials, not through reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Hergé lived a turbulent life and a true artist suffers. But the wonderful world that came from his imagination will continue to surprise readers again and again.
