In 1954, Marlon Brando was the hot actor after his performance in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra was not reinventing himself on the silver screen. But Sinatra's portrayal of the former Nathan Detroit helped to re-establish Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful version of a fantastic play and the options of the pro players and the players are fantastic. Imagine a movie in which Brando sings? This was his only and only singing role and he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition, Jean Simmons and Vivienne Blaine (who have been playing Nathan's long-suffering friend Adlead) have made extraordinary efforts. Particularly noteworthy is the great Stubby Kaye (like Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, there is no version of Rockin 'The Boat until he approaches Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who will be famous for television productions such as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, wonders Harry the Horse, BSPulley, such as The Big Julie, the tough and modern talk, and even Regis Toomey, featuring his character as Brother Arvide. <br /> <br /> It's one of the visuals you can watch, a good comedy, and you'll get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Lucky Be A Lady Tonight" and his brother ... "It's a dice game"
