Yes, it flicks as it moves rather slowly, but it is really very good - and I consider myself a man of manhood. You should love Judy Davis, no matter where she is, and the girl who plays her daughter offers a convincing natural performance. <br /> <br /> The scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the film. Anonymous actors and actors (at least not known to me) are realistic about the film that draws you and draws your attention. Overall, I give it 8/10. Go see it.
