I know technically that this is not the largest television program ever, meaning that it was filmed on the video and that its limits appear in both the audio and visual aspect of it. It can be a little timely representation too. But I love this showed a lot. I was scared of hell when I first aired in 1988. Of course I was 5 years old. But I recently purchased DVDs from the first three episodes, which I unfortunately hear now omitted. I also heard that Warner would not publish anything because of the bad sales of DVDs. Also the TV series did not have the same feeling as the movies, in fact I thought it had an evil tone. Even if the color palette resembled a nightmare on 4 Elm Street (both the film and the TV program were produced in the same year), this has a serious tone while the movies gradually began to get more and more sarcasm and jokey. Not a bad thing, Freddy like a wise cracker clown. But I think this was the strength of this TV show, you do not have Freddy featured every minute cracking utes before and after a joke that kills someone. In fact, it seems more sensual, enhanced by the soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure whether they are considered part of the creators' performances or just the limitations of shooting the video. I love this show and can not be considered an accompaniment of very enjoyable movies. Much better than anything on TV today.
