Film / documentary film about the different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. Follow what they are doing and probably do more than they do. The rhythm is very quiet ...... So you have to relax ....... Breathe in the air ... Breathe before seeing it ...... <br /> <br /> Think .... but nothing It happens and you'll get a little angry. That's the problem, because the mood of the film and the nice social realism pictures in this movie ... ..... many people will say it's disgusting ... but not bad. .. I think it is more used for marketing .... There are really funny moments ... 60 old women stripping ..... I guarantee her the most unusual striptease in the history of the film ...... his real film .. I think this word. ..... in your face ... .... This makes it a little scary. There is no computer manipulation here ..... in real life ... As we all know, movies can actually win when it comes to things that are sick ...... .... so much worse in the real world .... ... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie, you can start looking at your neighbors and thinking ... Maybe they are like people in the movie t ... I bet there are a lot of them ...... sick. .. crazy people living with a beautiful facade ........ After watching the film I feel it is fun to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> <br /> But perhaps you should not see this movie On your first date ...
