"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that ridicules the irony of pop culture until it destroys self-humor. The characters are very interesting and fun to laugh at / sympathize with. Which leads me to an introduction to the characters I loved best ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s / early 40s and creates a popular magazine called The Big Big Thing. What is important is that this magazine does not exist, and it is just an excuse for Simon to approach representatives by interviewing them, just to deceive them with absurdity, and to insult their way of buying into pop culture. Mainly related to her and Simon, as well as she and her father.Darla is a truly beloved (or caring) character, depending on the way She is a flat figure who does not have much, as does Tidra, the queen of music and video for a group of rock bands B. Still, these characters weave a very interesting network together. The film is about all the motivations people have for what they do and why they do it, it's a great movie, and I suggest you see it if you're in a crowd.
