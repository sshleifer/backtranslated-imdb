Put yourself in Carla shoes. It is a cumbersome, uneducated and invisible administrative effort. You know her: You've trained three of her last three heads, you know where all the bodies are buried and you may be seen in the mirror when you clean your teeth. She always has time to do another useless job and do it better than most. Despite a serious handicap, she has an office on his way to the bathroom, which becomes a storehouse for half-finished coffee cups for begging. What? You do not want to hear it? Well, you can not and can not even put the hearing in place. Prepare to experience life from a hearing impairment perspective. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuel Devos) needs a change in her life. Work does not lead anywhere; friends depend on them to meet their local needs and the only way out begins to collapse that is almost unnoticeable. It will not take leave - the contract is crucial - so the only alternative is the appointment of an assistant. Carla presents the requirements that convey her real needs: a "well-prepared" man. This brings the applicant for approval and reminds us that we must be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Castle) does everything wrong from the beginning of the interview and clearly identifies Carla's interest in his non-job qualities. You see the potential of this former thief and when the story unfolds, their relationship grows in an unusual pattern of interdependence. <br /> <br /> Paul is going through a difficult transition back to the world outside the walls of the prison and finds himself in another prison: one kind of office and the other from bondage paid to repay old debts. His skills as thieves help Carla win a political battle at the office. But Paul sees a greater chance of Carla's skill in reading the lips and drawing her into a world of conspiracies. <br /> <br /> It's a cruel film Noir is not uniform and may be suitable for older youth. Carla grows more powerful, both professionally and personally, as the story progresses and gives it a clear advantage over the rest of us. She grows as a woman who discovers her sensory side while using her resources to overcome obstacles to competition in the man's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are meant to be in a strange way. Without Paul, Carla will remain in her role in the mop. They have our sympathy, our hopes and our best wishes even if we do not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla's ears, from hard adjustments to help you with audio and muffled sounds, but everything is unheard of without relatively distinctive sounds when you can see who is speaking. With the disruption of one large sensation, we see the power of the intuitive high Carla to compensate. We can all use this meaning to hear not only what people say, but also what it really means.
