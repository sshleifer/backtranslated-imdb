In my opinion, this is still one of Superman's best pictures on television, in addition to being one of the most faithful of a certain cartoon period. <br /> <br /> This series has praised Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s and the Superman series of reruns of 1986 and beyond (Steel Man, Superman Volume 2, Action Comics, , "Superman Adventures", etc.). The opening score and titles were thrilling, based on John Williams' score of films, which were updated in a Saturday morning film series. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to the comedy rerun ("Superman"), was the best choice to participate in this animated series. In general, the series had a more mature feeling as it continued to be very friendly to the child. <br /> <br /> Superman has been presented as a true, powerful and creative author. His frequent opponent was Lex Luther in his huge incarnation / CEO. The characters of Daily Planet, Lewis, Jimmy, and Perry were filmed well. One of my favorites was Wonder Woman, and the story revolves around the island of Themisira, her hometown (Paradise Island). Her design and the design of her mother, Hippolyte, were in line with a series of comic books of wonders that were re-launched in the same way in the women's age, and it seemed possible to develop an equally well-crafted cartoon series if handled the same way. <br /> <br /> The only hard thing to believe is that this was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It's worth it.
