Of course, the origin is better, but that's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it's made up of 3 stories, but hey, what about it?! I thought it was good to be honest. I really liked how little Anastasia changed when she fell in love, and this shows what love can do. The stories were not too bad. <br /> <br /> I like Cinderella's voice better in this too. I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I think it looks better here, nicer. I loved her personality in this too, she had more spine, yet she was still nice. <br /> <br /> So, I will give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True 7/10.
