CRY IN THE DARK <br /> <br /> CRY in the DARK was a film that I expected to make a great show from Meryl Streep and a strong, if not remarkable, film. This assumption came from the fact that, along with Starb's nomination for Best Actress, the film received little attention from the grand prize groups. <br /> <br /> I did not expect CRY IN THE DARK to be very exciting, built on every level. If you ask me, this is a classic film of little appreciation. <br /> <br /> The movie opens very slowly, allowing the public to settle in the Chamberlain Chamber at a comfortable pace and really note that they are in essence an incredible love, simple family. Fred Schepisi picks up random moments to catch a family on holiday that gives a sense of looming tragedy, while the bliss of Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neal) Chamberlain also shows to their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "A Dingo Took My Baby!" Became a bit these days, never approaching the film of laughter. The actual death of Azaria is apprehended horribly. It's great and realistic, leaving the audience terrified and asking questions. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film takes place in the courtroom and focuses on the ongoing Chamberlain battle to prove their innocence to the press and the court, in which Lindy is suspected of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is clear to us from the start that they are innocent makes tense trials more arresting. As a member of the public, I was fully invested in Chamberlain's plight ... I was really angry and sad and sad when I was forced to make the media look so awful. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I liked the way in which the media were not sympathetic in any way, but they always had good reasons to express their views. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film is very deep and captures the essential element that makes this film quite different from other dramas in the courtroom. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, the only performances that really matter in this film are the Streep and Neill ... offerings in every way. For me, this is rated as one of the best Meryl Streep offers (if not # 1). Despite their mastery of different dialects (which are of course impressive in themselves), Streep never loses her heart and soul of her characters. I find this one of Streep's most accurate offers, and it blows out the garden. Neil, the actor who never surprised me beyond being an attractive and attractive person at JURASSIC PARK, is an ideal point for Streep's performance. From what I have seen, this is without doubt Neil's finest work yet. It is a shame that he has not been recognized by the academy with the nomination of a key representative for the Streep match ... B / C are playing with each other brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Dominates more emotionally than most movies, and is also incredibly impressive ... Crying in the dark far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend people who only know the movie as a flicker as Merrill screams "Dengo took my baby!" Watch the movie and see what is much more to the newspaper in the dark then this one line. <br /> <br /> ... A ...
