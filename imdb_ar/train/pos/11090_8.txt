The successful married businessman Harry Mitchell (a wonderful performance of steel for Roy Cheddar) enjoys skillfully with the beautiful young stripper Senny (the wonderful Kelly Preston). Harry was blackmailed by a trio of terrible low-life hoods - the director of stray pornographic plays Raimy (the glamorously glamorous John Glover), his anti-tape stripeer Leo (played well Robert Trepor) and the crazy pimp Bobby Shi (a very scary Clarence Williams III) - who filmed an affair with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, Cini kills the shells and makes them look like Harry did. This in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wits and wits between Harry and the Queens. Director John Frankenheimer, who has adopted a difficult scenario based on Elmore Leonard's crime-ridden novel, maintains expertise at a rapid pace, offers a lot of tension, and effectively creates an unnatural radical atmosphere. All outstanding customers are consistently excellent, with outstanding support from Anne Margaret as the neglected wife of Barbara Barbara, Vanity as a prostitute, and Lonnie Chapman as a loyal business partner of Harry C. Owell. A tight plot keeps viewers on his toes all the time. The evil dialogue, the glamorous cinematography of Gust Vaakano, the powerful degree of Gary Zhang, the harsh moral tone, and the sensational result are also all about money. As an additional bonus, Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. Very few are strong and satisfactory worth reviewing.
