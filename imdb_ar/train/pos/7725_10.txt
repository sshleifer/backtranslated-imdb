I saw this film for the first time when it originally appeared. I was about 9 years old. This film was very enjoyable and very scary and unlike any other film I have seen until then. <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: An exploratory flight from the Earth is sent to the fourth planet of Altair, a major star in the Aquilae constellation to see what happened to a settler colony that landed 20 years ago and has not been heard since. <br /> <br /> Subject: Minimal civilization (specifically our country) come into contact with the remains of a highly advanced foreign civilization, and the removal of Krell-200,000 years. The "seed" of destruction is transferred from one civilization to another, without knowledge at first. The theme of this movie is very good against evil. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie with my brother when it was originally shown. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes had actually scared me as I had battle scenes with the unseen power creature. I was also amazed at our view of the real things in the film. <br /> <br /> What really attracts my attention as an adult is despite the fact that the film "Forbidden Knowledge" and how important it is when we do (if any) contact an advanced civilization much more advanced than we are now. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work for ourselves to gain knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This, in my opinion, is the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned at the Graduate School that "knowledge is power" is at best, in fact, not true! Knowledge is the "potential" force depending on how it is applied (... if it is applied at all.) [Not what you know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> In the future of humanity. That knowledge itself is not enough, we must, we must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on really controlling our destiny, or that we will end up like Krell in the cheat movie. <br /> Thanks a lot to those who responded to the previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, all of which are highly appreciated !! I hope you enjoy this story as much as you have over the past 40 years ... <br /> <br /> التقييم: 10 من 10 نجوم
