To me it was a wake-up call, and the realization that most of what we see, hear, read and think about anything depends on what the media feeds on us. This is a classic example of high-level doctors trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people with a freely acquired constitution are affected by this media control or any attempt at misinformation. Again, this shows that at the end of the day, the needs of many will actually exceed the needs of the few. It is also useful to see that in a country where there is no civil religious war, democracy is not difficult to implement.
