As Christmas has evolved over the years, whether it is religious or secular, it is time for people to behave a little better together. One way or another, Abnizer Scroog, a merchant and money lender in London in the 19th century, somehow overtook it. <br /> <br /> As his nephew pointed out to his uncle, he does not keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels everything. Is humbug. Humanity has been expelled in Scrooge for a long time, a difficult situation, just like his counterpart in the twentieth century, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, redemption is not too late for any one of us, a single ghost and three souls to visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> Carol Christmas is a classic game of timeless holiday to the point that we sometimes forget the social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist. The characters in this film are middle and lower class. Cratchits are a few degrees above the street people at Oliver Twist, but they have to struggle to stay there. Love and happiness still reign in their homes, no doubt the man Bob Crashit works for it. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a lot of good in his life and had to be reminded of how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake-up call with regard to the possibilities he still has to do some good in this ancient world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart, in his live performance and playing the film, has captured much of Scrooge. But George S. Scott captures the old miser in this film. His abomination, but with the impact of grief that makes us root for him to change. Scott joins a great tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who have made wonderful interpretation of Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles that were particularly enjoyed by David Warner in the role of Bob Kratchet and Edward Woodward as the heart and soul of the current Christmas. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this version is one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol that they archived and is one of the best versions.
