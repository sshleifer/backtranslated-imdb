I was surprised by something about this film - it was actually original. It was not the same old recycled nonsense that comes out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on video because I did not even know it before I see it in my local video shop. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. Builds suspense everywhere and end excellent twisting. <br /> <br />
