What a relief to know that I do not imagine this program! The summary of the taxman is great. I also remember finding it painful and not particularly watching the family, I must have got 10/11 at the time I saw it. I think for a girl that the old part of the attraction was blond hair lead, and his sad condition permanently. I played the idea on the flute I remember - though I can not remember how things went. I think the intro showed he was playing - or maybe he played the flute in the program, especially when he was sad? Maybe I'm destined to never know how I ended up or see a piece or hear the tone, but at least I know now that it's not just me.
