I must admit, when I read the description of the type on Netflix as "romantic steamy" I was a bit skeptical. "steamy"? In a 1968 film? I was ready for disappointment. And when I realized that it was filmed entirely in black and white, I knew my dramatic hopes had been shattered. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! Not only does this film contain all the elements of a lively romance - the discovery of first love, the fear of discovering the secret, and an unexpected sudden end - but sometimes it was quite exciting. You will soon forget that he is photographed in black and white. The film industry deserves all the appreciation it has received over the years. The performances of the two stars (Essey Pearson and Anna Gail) are intense and memorable. Well, so both of them in their mid-twenties are trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect the teenagers of the 1960s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story? Many older women still try to control their sexual life at the time. Anyone looking for real teenagers here expects a lot. <br /> <br /> I think this film was too advanced for its time. The level of sexual excitement was an unexpected pleasure. However, she can still leave a lot of imagination, instead, to give us poetic descriptions to add what we have presented. <br /> <br /> I do not doubt that lesbians will know the characters here. For you guys who want to watch lesbians at work: Although this will not be all you expect, I do not think you will be disappointed.
