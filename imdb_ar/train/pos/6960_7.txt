A desperate man trying to hit a wonderful girl on the bus. She rejects him, but when he runs behind someone who tries to steal her bag they meet anyway. There begins - a slightly stained relationship to the fact that she is a jealous and nervous superhero. It can not be a secret that things between them will be problematic. <br /> <br /> In short, a story can promise to grow into a great movie. And IMO, has managed to be a beautiful film. It's not a masterpiece, but it made me cry from laughter on more than one occasion - two main characters circled each other in the crazy love festival that is, even with the continuation of the supernatural hero thing. > So. The story is thin, but has been set up in a really funny way and is therefore well worth the time of cinema. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
