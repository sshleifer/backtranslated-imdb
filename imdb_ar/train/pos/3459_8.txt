Along with Patrick McGohan and Robert Kolb, Jack Cassidy was the famous Colombo villain. The first "appropriate" episode of Colombo, after two independent pilots, "Murder By The Book" is not far from classic status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays the role of Ken Franklin, half of the writing partnership for the mystery of murder. . His partner Jim is talented, while Kane has no talent other than gift giving and skill promoting books. Once C decided that he no longer requires Ken's marketing skills, Kane plans to plot to kill Jim. But it is not a new conspiracy, it is actually the execution of a murder story originally designed for one of their books. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Colombo to know that Kane is the murderer, although unfortunately another murder (Ken Romanians and then one of the key witnesses) must be committed before Colombo has sufficient evidence to secure conviction . <br /> <br /> Nothing is wrong at all with "Killing by the Book", but it is not so first class. I just want to give "Publish or Perish" an advantage over this: both cases highlight Jack Cassidy and the publishing world, but "Publish Or Perish" is a bit more stressful and unpredictable. But this is still a big episode.
