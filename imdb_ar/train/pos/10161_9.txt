I took a flyer to rent this movie but I said, it was very good. On all fronts: scenario, actors, director, photography, high production values, etc. Proves Eva Longoria Parker is a head and shoulders in rom / com over bad actors like Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who dribbled and described them as acting. Who would threaten him? <br /> <br /> Barker and Isla Fisher are in a row and should try to keep up with good projects like "Over Her Dead". Lake Bell is also excellent, and this is the first time I see it. Finally, Paul Rod starred in a really good film, instead of less important films. <br /> <br /> A film like this does not get paid for close-minded males. It's very bad as other IMDb reviewers have noticed here, there is nothing lame about this gem - there is no breakthrough or writing. <br /> <br /> A photograph of L.A. The contemporary California, in general, makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean, and gorgeous of any kind. Never before made a L.A film. Ah, what a small talent can do and a lot of attention to a film. <br /> <br /> I will not disclose this plot, but as an atheist long and hard, I was willing to comment not to believe and buy a supernatural subject to enjoy an excellent and light entertainment piece. It reminds me a lot of the old "Topper" movies, which were also fun. <br /> <br /> This film features famous, yet penetrated, films such as "Ghost" for modest festivals and excessive emotional waste festivals. We already know that the general taste is heavily inclined towards the average. But some of us pay tribute to what they really deserve. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed other neglected gems like "At Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Chloe Golagher and "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "The American Dreamer" with Jopth Williams, Robert Downey Jr, Christopher McDonald, Sibble Sheppard, "Make Mr. Wright" with John Malkovich, etc., will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> A first class job is everywhere (even if it is hard to believe that a straight guy can claim to be gay for more than five years). But even this drawing device does not detract from the film's overall excellence.
