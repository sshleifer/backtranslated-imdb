Melvin Douglas and Joan Blondell co-author The Amazing Mr. Williams, a 1939 mystery / comedy, was very good, though forgotten, perhaps because of the number of spectacular films released in 1939. Douglas plays the role of a talented police detective married to his job while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What happens in this film is no exception - it has been called to a scene killed as it is about to walk down the aisle again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent in comedy, worked well (often) and helped make this battle between the sexes enjoyable. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are ready to get excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Milvin Douglas does not make much of a woman. <br /> <br /> Entertainment is a bit on the long side. <br /> <br /> A comment here broke Melvin Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He was literally treated effortlessly through dozens of films as another man and best friend before entering his films as an old man. He was not lazy, he was a very hard actor (who made it seem easy) and had a Broadway career in conjunction with his career. He was not a prominent actor in films or given very difficult roles under the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his destructive performances in "Hood" and "I Do not Sing My Daddy's Dad" and call him lazy or referring to his smile.
