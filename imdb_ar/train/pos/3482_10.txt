This is my first comment on the IMDb site, and the reason for my writing is that we're talking about one of the best movie movies ever! "Ni goryuy!" It will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not yet a fan) with the Georgian Georgian singing tradition, and perhaps you will accept the difficulties of your personal existence and you will be satisfied after watching it :) What I like very much about this film is that actors in non-leading roles By creating memorable and equally important personalities. The film starring Vahtang Kikabidze (which is great), but you will remember every aspect of it in the film. You'll find yourself quoting from its lines, which have become family names for many Russian-speaking people. A movie to live with. Simple, but deep, you will want to see it again and again.
