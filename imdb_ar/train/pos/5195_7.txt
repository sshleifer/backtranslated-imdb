As a lover of bad movies, I definitely wear with this film. The plot is not that bad really, but there are a few cases where you have to ask yourself "What's going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this the most entertaining and bad movie ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore became fat and slow when the film was filmed so that the special effects of accelerating the scenes of fighting to double the time. There are also scenes where there is an instant slow-moving rerun, jumping on a 10-foot wall (through playing backwards from it), naked men walking in big letters, and having sex that descends the ceiling (literally) a cable that holds the roof on fire). <br /> <br /> Of course, none of Rudy Ray Moore's films will be complete without a completely random comedy scene where Rudy makes fun of all the customers and talks to people doing some strange dancing. There are so many bad things about this film, but it's amusingly bad, and if you close your eyes to the movie, you might miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for the actual value, 10/10 for the cheese factor, 10/10 for error capture and mute, averages to 7/10.
