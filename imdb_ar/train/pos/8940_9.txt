The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most heart-warming books I have ever read. He tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both of whom received the dedication and respect of working well in the 1970s as a teacher and dentist, and then lived another 30 years in dignity. Robbie De steals the film with her exact performance just like the "rebellious" Bessie, a dentist. It not only expresses anger, sadness, and wisdom; it allows you to know exactly where they came from using the word economy. Diane Carroll feels like the big sister, the teacher, at the bottom, but I'm afraid she will not make me believe she's over a hundred years old. Amy Madigan is too extreme and intrusive in soaked and unsafe acting in the first half of the film as a reporter for the New York Times. This, too, is just a simple distraction. All the stories are real, they are an attraction, and although two or three have been slightly damaged in translation, most of them do well. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as a basic reading for all people recommended by any books. I can only understand this television film in this strange atmosphere, but it certainly embodies enough flavor to be of great value in itself.
