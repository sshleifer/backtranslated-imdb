Another Australian masterpiece, this turns into a world of unknown and supernatural, which is very good. Do not resort to large special effects such as exaggerating American clicks, they focus more on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot brought by Rebecca Gibney & Co.. It follows the story of a couple who bought an old house that was supposed to be the home of a very old woman who did not go abroad. Her husband mysteriously disappeared a century ago. Strange things begin at home, and John Adam begins to turn to the disappeared man, who was in fact a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 10/08
