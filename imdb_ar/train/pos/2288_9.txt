It is very rare to find a properly translated literary work on the screen so much so that I have rated this movie higher than it deserves, but not so much. As a longtime student of the works of Vonnegut, I have no hesitation in recommending the film to read it, at least to those who love it as I love it. The casting process has been inspired: Nolte's value has been reduced by victory, confusion in defeat, and decisive in judgment. Cheryl Lee is upscale all the time, but her dealings with treacherous Risi and her tragic rise make you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin delivers a totally beloved Soviet spy, but left just as much. <br /> <br /> You do not feel like you should read Mother's Night to appreciate the movie; however, if you have not read Mother Mother, you may want to do so after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Note the shifts from color to black and white and back again, and do not miss the last symbol of Campbell's gallows. Watch, too, for a Veil Kurt Vonnegut near the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will not sound the same (I write in mid-December, when the song gets a heavy radio run, and it brings me to the nuts).
