You'll notice by the stars that I gave this wonderful movie that "... before you see it for the first time," implicitly. I have never heard of this film and have just happened across it that this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not great in the future). I'm not sure how to skip this film, I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northham so wonderful. However, it has done. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. He just had the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very enjoyable and keep the viewer in the dark; enough. The entire movie is you (the Projector) who tries to discover plots and twists. I had made this movie 10/10, but some of the footage was pretty fake-looking. I do not carry this film very much, but I do not think it deserves a full grade. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think they underestimate their ability as a serious talent. Do not ever worry about her beauty (which is difficult), she takes her roles seriously and does not feel comfortable for her appearance to lead her through scenes of evolving emotion. It can look cool, and even it has no life if necessary, as well. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northham works well, initially, as an eccentric mouse for businesses, ready to walk around in a labyrinth to prove himself. However, it changes throughout the film, is like night and day. I know that some fans of Clive Owen or Jude Law or those who hope to become the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northham will / can / should fit into the bill. He is fragrant and cultured. I've got a great bond position and a voice. I think it can also be cool if the situation calls for it, but also to the ground. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie and definitely recommend this movie to watch it at least once if you like corporate spy movies.
