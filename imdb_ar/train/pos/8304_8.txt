I caught this movie late Saturday night / Sunday morning with my brother. We drank. This is one of the best tearing movies. Of the "luxurious" ocean liner that is actually "rolling, rolling", complete with everything from cast iron to doors with adhesive stickers telling staff, then you see the same door used for something else in another scene - the rocks of this movie !! The continuity is very poor and you can not help but notice it, it puts you in your face with openings. In the final scene jumps from the lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. He was confined to his son and his new girlfriend (the public relations manager of the Kung Fu, who used to be in the police but was driven out because she was doing things on her way - real) on the ferry that was moving very fast away from the blast. ...... Then the father there hugging them. What???? Who cares, his charm. There is no single recovery feature for this movie. The casino is a large bedroom size with a single casino table. When the bad guys chase you, there's only one place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the bad guys who, instead of checking down one table, continue shooting at four fruit machines and a small bar in the corner (corner bar at the casino - awesome). They walk directly behind the only place to hide, allowing Casper to wrap around them and "take them out". <br /> <br /> Get some of his teammates and get some drinks and put this movie and howling.
