When you watch a short film you are always afraid that the person making the film will try to throw it a lot. This is not the case with this one. A wonderful story about a girl who has enough other worldly powers that are trying to help make things right. <br /> <br /> Eric Ibari does a great job of representing the twisted spirit of justice and helps convey the intricacies of a clear line of right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Both the girl and the father make great performances in this wonderful short film, but Eric's performance is definitely stolen from the show in this story. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommend this movie because of the complexity, performance and brilliant in every story.
