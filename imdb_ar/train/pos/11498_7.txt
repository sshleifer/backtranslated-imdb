"Kolchak: The Night Stalker" is a heavily armed television series where a cynical, cynical forty-something reporter is frequently drawn into a deadly fight with supernatural powers (and sometimes extraterrestrial). Based on a pair of very famous television films featuring the character of Kolchak, the series died in the mid-1970s in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but still maintains a strong cult of the day. But will the modern ordinary viewer be able to dig up Kolchak and his weekly clashes with Undead? <br /> <br /> This is indeed a difficult question to be answered fairly. Critics of this series tend to say that it is hopelessly equated and dated. On the other hand, fans argue that it is intelligently written, good disposition, and sometimes scary. And I? I have a foot in both camps. I totally enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Kolchak on a DVD recently, although I can clearly see that the series has significant flaws. <br /> <br /> I will address the issue of Kolchak being a fantasy "formula" first. Now, I think we can all agree that most television programs contain formulas - almost every episode of Colombo rings unfolds according to the same pattern, for example. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; in fact, critics have long recognized that the masses often enjoy, actively seek, frequent entertainment. However, the problem in Kolchak is that its formula is simply a static TOO - it's very frequent even by the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak achieves murder and finds that it has been committed. By the form of the beast. Is trying to publish a story about this beast, but its editor Vincenzo always forbids him on the grounds that Colchac does not have enough evidence to support his claims that supernatural powers are working. Unfortunately, Kolchak was blocked by the police. So, in the end, Colchac does some independent research on the beast, and talks about how to kill him ... and then kill him. Without ceremony, reward, or writing a big story about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this tough formula can become tiring, right? I'm particularly puzzled by Vincenzo - if Koleshak always cheers on monsters, Vincenzo never believed it ... Well, why not, then, do Vincenzo Kolchak launch or commit it? This is what any normal coach will do. But the series avoids such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comic opponents. As a result, many of their scenes together are unbelievable - although they are very funny. <br /> <br /> Kolchak's best episodes have been able to overcome the limitations of this formula, but usually contain some kind of unexpected twist. These selected episodes are good enough that I think they are pretty immune to the typical criticism of this series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Highlands - a remarkable episode for being depressing and socially conscious. The Kolchak dialogue has an unusually sharp and cynical feature. Although he closely adheres to the Kolchak format, the script (written by Jamie Sangster, a veteran of Hammer Studios) learns beautifully and deepens in the background of the beast. <br /> <br /> The Devil's Platform - a potential source of inspiration for these films "Omen" stands out to me because the villain - the young Tom Skirt - lures Kolchak with a devilish contract full of good things (revealing so much about the journalist's character). <br /> <br /> Firefall - This episode seems to have a bad reputation among the fans, but I enjoyed it because it enjoys a wonderful red knickle and a creepy monster that is almost unstoppable. <br /> <br /> Although I have identified these three episodes to praise, I say that most of the stories are amusing at least. For my money, there are only two full-fledged turkeys in a series of 20 episodes: Primal Scream, which revolves around the monkey-men who run rampant in Chicago, and Sentry, featuring a cocky makeup looking at the hottest entertainment in the history of entertainment. Dr. Who and Godzilla Lifetime!) <br /> <br /> In general, this series is good. A little repetitive, maybe a little cheesy, but he has elements of greatness. Even during the weakest episodes, Daren McGavin's brilliant performance, where Kulchak glitters the world-wearying and endlessly funny Kochi. He carries the series effortlessly, in a way, for example, Sarah Michelle Gilard never managed the song "Buffy". McGavin was an adult actor, and this series deserves to be seen for him alone.
