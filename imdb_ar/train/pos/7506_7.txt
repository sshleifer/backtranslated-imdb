I will not lie. Despite the interesting consideration, I have seen the notorious "notorious page" because I heard (and it was fairly obvious just by looking at the summary or anything about the film), that Gritchen Mall shame it. I have never been a fan of Mall, but I can not resist seeing an attractive woman take off her clothes. Yes, this may be a perverted, but idealistic and central theme at the heart of the film, and help make the film much stronger than it might have been. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Bettie Page's (Life) from her physical days and sexual abuse as a high school girl in the South, and her new life in New York. She wants to be represented, but she has to pay the bills too. After taking some seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, the page slowly becomes a sense of modeling, and quickly moves from suggestive images to sensational erotic images. <br /> <br /> I feel a short movie (just over ninety minutes) is both a blessing and a blessing for it. On one hand, the film never takes care to welcome it. You get to know the page in a few minutes, then you go directly to her fashion career and do not look back. But he also curses the film, because we never get a chance to understand all that is going on. It's just a kind of jumps between the modeling buds and the controversies they create before jumping straight to the main Senate inquiry that takes a lot of the final act of the film. You just sit there, trying to absorb everything, and more comes directly to you. It seems as if the filmmakers wanted to sum up a lot of material in a very short film. Subtracts for longer sequences, subtracting more for longer explanations. Do not feel rushed. You do not feel the whole thing there. <br /> <br /> There is another bit of grumbling, although more curious, it is the use of colors throughout the film. The majority are in black and white, but often, patches and sequences of colors appear. But although this may be a symbolic gesture early on, it becomes a distraction as it continually emerges later before it turns black and white. Becomes confusing, and becomes more intrusive than anything else with the continuation of the film. <br /> <br /> While he may stumble a bit with the action, the film remains full of themes. The page, which I do not know about, does not play innocently, and its world is exactly the same. With the exception of a few shady figures during her teenage years, every person you encounter is innocent, and everything you do is innocent. I never thought I would look at nudity in front of me entirely as something other than vulgarity and corruption, but here, it's really something to marvel at. Each time, she is beautiful and innocent. Even the most perverted moments in the film (though compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feeling. There is something about how the nude mall's body is portrayed, and it affects such a chord that is different from naked objects in other films. It is a very natural and very wonderful feeling. If there is any reason to watch the film, you will see the amazing images of the mall body as it plays a home role. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the mall itself. As a page, embodies that Southern Belle in the fifties everyone knows (or can imagine at least). Despite her profession, she is still a layman and still considers herself religious. Mall plays exactly the right amount of sharp cleaning needed to make this character feel original from 1950. She plays with such facts that make you in a difficult situation so you do not think that Mall was actually Bettie Page itself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the support team has very few moments to shine, completely overwhelmed by the wonderful performance of the mall. None of them does anything special, nor does any of them enjoy the same strength as Mall. This is not really wrong actors, but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with them. Many of them are recognizable, such as Oscar nominee David Strathorn (in a role very close to one of his best performers), Sarah Paulson (the recent Golden Globe award in Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip) and actor Laila Taylor, You have to put their performance into being anything else okay. None of these characters has really been developed, and they are really mere scraps of characters run by Mol while picking up her strength in her remarkable performance. <br /> <br /> Truly, this film deserves his portrayal of nudity, and the excellent performance of the Gretchen Mall from Bettie Page. Everything else is a little confused and embarrassing than it should be. If more work was done to develop supportive characters and not just an explosion through the story, this film would have been the best autobiography. As it is, it is just a way for Moll to truly rise to the stratosphere as a representative. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
