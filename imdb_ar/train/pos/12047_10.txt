The first and only time I saw a black woman I thought was the only time I learned that she appeared on television in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my father and I watched her in the living room just before we all went to midnight service in the village church. I was very young at the time, but I'm not sure who was more terrifying than walking across the churchyard to the church entrance that night to me or my father! <br /> <br /> There are many factors about this movie that made it very creepy, but I think the movie "One of Them" is the fact that there is not much of a soundtrack that runs in the background of almost every Hollywood movie, Every creak, horror and blow will be amplified in your head as there is no distraction. There is another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories, and there is no jump factor related to things that bounce back on the treasury, so it does not make what you necessarily see but what you hear and think it happens. This is a smart way because nothing frightens you more than you think of running a riot around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A wonderful ghost story, I have never seen anything that can match it and with all the malice that is repeated over and over again on the television screen, I do not think the BBC has deleted it (to my knowledge) just one show!
