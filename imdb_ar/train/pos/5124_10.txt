It's a wonderful film I do not think he got enough credit like Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays the role of a man in love with a girl but he tends to acknowledge his feelings for her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks he will show his manhood. Although it was manufactured in 1980, it is still suitable for the day. Wonderful rural soundtrack. 10/10
