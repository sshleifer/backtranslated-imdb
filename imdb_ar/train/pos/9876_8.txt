The film "Lily Mars" is a real cute little movie featuring comedy skills by actress Judy Garland, along with standard singing moments. The plot consists of marking the night of March on the sign after John Thornway's product for a great holiday. I think comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
