This movie is awesome! Brad Pitt will not be able to represent his performance in this film. Duchovny was first class, as was Forbes and Louis. The four main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic killing sites in one of the finest cars ever built, the Lincoln Continental. Early Grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrush and carnage. He loves his women not to be cursed or smoked, and to wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are two artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are the trailer trailer of the rural suburbs. Although the majority tone in the film is dark, there are plenty of funny scenes to watch. Great writing, directing and acting. If you like road movies, murder, humor and combo, watch this movie. Everyone delivers, and will need more when the credits roll. One of the nicest times I have. "Hey ... shave this dog n teach him to chase!"
