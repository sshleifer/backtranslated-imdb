I watched the detention last night and loved what I saw. It was a great and enjoyable film. Dolph looked great on the bike. He also looked good in this film compared to his other recent films. It is now in very good condition. The story was good and the other actors were also acceptable. I did not call this movie the best it has but it is still a good film. <br /> <br /> But he also had a lot of problems. The first was the way bullets were flying everywhere, and even when they were fired from close range, they missed the target. They should have shown that the ppl would escape from bullets in a better way. Another problem I had was how students swore. I do not know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in class. The third problem is that the bad guys were very few. There must be more bad guys. The last problem was definitely the fact that the group looked like cheese, but that was because of the small budget. Overall the film was a good film. I enjoyed it. I recommend others to watch it. Note Now you beat a dead cop. (Some fonts were also cool)
