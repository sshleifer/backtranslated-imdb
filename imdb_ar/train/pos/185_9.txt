I finally purchased and added a copy of "Show people" to my collection. I can not comment more than the previous viewers and on the characters and plot and the overall quality of this film without repeating their words. Seeing the huge exterior of many silent M-G-M stars is worth seeing. I really like the scene where Marion Davis plays herself and faces her as she plays the main character in the film, Patricia Pippauer. Be sure to read her lips because there is no title card that points to what you say when you see Marion Davis but it is something of the effect of "I do not think I love her!" Emerged from the corn of the pop, pulled the ribbon and prepared to return to more than three-quarters of a century in the history of filmmaking. Enjoy!
