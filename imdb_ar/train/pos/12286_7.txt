I loved the film, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story that I narrated in the film I felt was intense from a much longer story. Since the book is more than 400 pages, this is logical. Spanning from 1920 to 1970s, in a fantastical South American country, and also plenty to fit into the time available. I think it would have been better to have a six-hour series better than a 140-minute film. <br /> <br /> Although it has been accelerated, the story does not go beyond that limit gets confusing. What was said was good. One mistake is that Clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently. Either they appeared more evenly during the film, or they should have been excluded. Two other flaws (they could be spoilers): Esteban's eventual return to good occurs somewhat abruptly, and it seems that Ferrola's curse wears off, although the tone of the story suggests that it must last forever. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Glen Claus, as a feral soliloquy, is wonderful. Jeremy Irons, as a self-made rich man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, the main character of Clara, is wonderful, although she is often better than in this film. There were many smaller roles that performed well too. The biggest mistake is that the film seemed to lack a tone coach. Each representative seemed to speak in a different tone.
