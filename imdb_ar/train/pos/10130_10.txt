The pilot is very good. It determines how characters are associated in future episodes. I do not think anyone could have devised a better pilot to offer this. Presents a remarkable creativity by the book. Although not all was corrected because it was the first episode, many events in future seasons were presented in the pilot program. An example is Ross and Rachel's future relationship. Although the first episode nervous appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and a wonderful choice of actors. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to an uncompromising comedy!
