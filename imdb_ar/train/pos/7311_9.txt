Halloween is a movie that I have to release and watch every time this day of the year. I even watch it sometimes when it is not vacation !!! This movie is very cool. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can not stop loving This movie may be out of date, but the story line is still getting there every time, and the acting was great !!! Although I have not seen the new version, I really feel that it was not absolutely necessary. I think that Rob Zombie should never have reworked such a classic. What kill me, is to know that there are some people who have seen the new version without even hearing the original. I feel angry just thinking about it !!!!!! It was wonderful and will always remember history as classic.
