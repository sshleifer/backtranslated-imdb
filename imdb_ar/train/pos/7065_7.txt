A nice film about three sisters from Switzerland (often watching running in uniform) wanting to bring their parents back together (my mother still seems to carry the torch for her father) - so sailing to New York to stop my father from marrying a blond gold miner who calls him "precious." My father has not seen his daughters in 10 years, and they do not seem strange (odd) and think he is gorgeous. Meanwhile, Precious seems to live a life run by her intransigent mother (Alice Brady), a woman just wanting to see her daughter marry a rich man. The sisters get the idea of ​​paying the "precious" to the Hungarian count of the drunken count, which deceives the two women who stoop to gold to believe that it is one of the richest men in Europe. But there is a case of wrong identity that makes girls think that the number is good-looking Ray Milland, who is in line with the scheme of "why he crushed his sister Kay." <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, light fare. Barbara Read as Kay looks sweet and beautiful , Ray Milland looks very small and happy here (although she, unfortunately, does little to do), Alice Brady is just as good as the planned mother - but she is Deanna Durbin, a real magician and cute boy playing his little sister Benny, With great singing and singing, many songs are sung throughout the film, although I actually wish I could see them More in this film.The plot in this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless, I found that the movie entertaining and fun.
