Spin "My Notorious Home Page" about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous girls in American history. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex symbols in America. The type of modeling that Betty Big participated in the nudity and enslavement that led to an investigation in the US Senate in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> When I came out of the movie, all I could think of was how far we got to the movie. Where pornography since the 1950s. You can access the Internet now and find some of the most disturbing and shocking images ever shot, in which the footage that was questioned in the notorious "The Bettie Page" seems childish and innocent. Most of the footage including slavery did not stand naked when Betty Begg participated so far. We have sick pictures where we can see women having sex with animals. I find that perhaps the envelope has been slightly pushed since the 1950s because the view of this film in terms of current pornography, has been done with great taste. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was very touched by this. "My home page is notorious", I found the film very good and enjoyable. The film is exactly what leads you to the trailer to believe that it will be a very exciting look at one of the first female sex symbols in America. Gretchen Mol looks exactly like Bettie Page and gives very good performance. I also thought that since the film was filmed in black and white, the film seemed realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie was the run-time, there seem to be some scenes that have been cut and seem a little shorter than they should have been. I looked at this and it seems that 10 minutes of the film has been cut since its original screening at the Toronto Film Festival. The end was very satisfying and I expected more of them or maybe some paragraphs will appear on the screen to inform the public about the life of Betty Begg where the movie stopped. Those are my only complaints about the film, except that the output was solid, the acting was great especially Gretchen, and the writing was good. <br /> <br /> Mary Haroun, who directed "American Psycho" one of my favorite films, is the director and author of My Notorious Home Page. I feel that Mary is a very talented director and knows how to create and create great films based on characters like "Psycho", Bettie Page is a personal study and a good study of it. Haroun captures the 1940s and 1950s with ease as well as all the characters. She is a very talented manager and I hope she will be there for many years to come. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: "Notorious Home Page" definitely worth a look. It's an interesting story that shows how far America and the world have come in terms of pornography. The film also provides a good performance for Gretchen Mall, who threw a Bettie Page character on his head. And even with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and have a good film on your hands. Unfortunately, this movie is likely to be floundering because many people who grew up in this era will be interested in the film, but I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final rating for "The Notorious Bettie" is 8/10. It's an interesting personal study of one of the most famous girls and sex icons in American history.
