An excellent film that reveals the extent to which people are associated with the regular beads exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is more than just a comment on globalization. In fact, is working to humanize workers in China, factory owner and bead distributor in New Orleans and even revelers in New Orleans. What stands out most is the director's ability to tell a difficult story with complex details in a simple and tempting way. His amazing arrival to the factory is another intriguing aspect and I wish I knew how he entered. It is a beautiful story without the emotion or guilt associated with it, and the result provides hope without leaving people feeling isolated.
