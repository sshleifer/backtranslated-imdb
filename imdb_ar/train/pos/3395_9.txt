It is a wonderful science fiction film very strange in how men and women show the same film. I talked to many people about the film, and everyone loved them almost, and he said it was wonderful - while most women thought it was disgusting and stupid! This is the only film I know that has polarized views based on sex. Many women may have less tolerance for disgusting conspiracies or depression - but for whatever reason, I've always found this difference wonderful. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. This was set in the near future and was assassinated president of Soylent International giant. When the film unfolds, you quickly realize that this future American society is terrible and unfair. Rich people live in wonderful apartments that enjoy security and all the money they can buy (including "furniture" - a pompous expression about the paid mistresses that come with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor, landlocked and in many cases living in abandoned cars or residential corridors. Population increase and smog have caused heavy losses and the future looks already appalling! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died and the terrible reality he could not live with, I should not really discuss - could ruin the film for you. However, the film has a great plot and very fun to watch. In addition, it features Edward G. Robinson in his final performance of the screen as a strong supporter of Houston. Although it is not easy to be depressed or sensitive, it is a great science fiction film.
