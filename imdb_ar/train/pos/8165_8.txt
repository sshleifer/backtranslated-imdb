The dentist was employed at a time when almost every profession was psychic. We had crazy police officers, paramedics, and secrecy and this was just for beginners. The dentist came in unexpectedly late because going to a dentist is usually a nightmare for everyone. <br /> <br /> The plot is crooked. A very clean dentist Dr. Finston lives a perfect life in his great "white house", has a beautiful blonde wife and a wonderful place to work as a dentist. The dark clouds come to his horizon in the form of a nasty IRS man (Earl Bowen), the dirty pool cleaner "cleans" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seem to have passed through a dark candidate. He goes nutso and begins to care for people's teeth in a bad way. And you do not want to come to his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna has produced horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film "Society" was directed by John Carpenter's They Live. Pierre David is known for films like scanners. The cast was wonderful. I was surprised by Corbin Pearson. I knew him from LA Law and the Major League, but I was able to dream of him recently as a psychiatrist myself. He was wonderful in his role and was a sad person. Linda Hoffman was beutiful and dumbfounded Feinstones wife. Michehel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after seeing him with ladies in the neighborhood I knew my future career. Ken Fury (Dawn of the Dead, Behind) was a nice scene as a policeman in the case. Virginia was an innocent teenager who was about to be the next customer to Winston. <br /> <br /> Final warning: If you are like me and have a problem with your dentist, you may have to skip this. But if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots of bad excavations.
