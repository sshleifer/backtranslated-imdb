Excellent photography of one of the most unusual aspects of that era. I liked the pictures - which fit a story associated with a story. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really wonderful in this area. He was well acquainted with someone who was stressed because of his work (which he did not choose himself) but still wanted to live a normal life for his family. He does his best to see this happen. Do not want to spoil the plot - but you should watch this movie if you are someone who wants more of a film than the usual orchestration / action bands. (It's violent though).
