I do not see what my grandparents saw in the young House of Davis. She is wonderful in this semi-crazy political comedy, which plays the role of Warren Williams as a permanent political act at his expense. Vinene Osborne is as wonderful as his ex-wife and I found myself deeply rooted in her all the time. Williams's character is not at all sympathetic, and he is not even a decent figure. <br /> <br /> Guy Kepe is one of the best in what he does. When a candidate comes out of his sleep at a political conference and is nominated to be a governor to prevent the nomination of a rival candidate, the whole mess is borne by the internal political war in a party called the Progressive Party. If you are a political thinker, you might see a party other than the party you belong to and be reflected in the fictional "Progressive Party" of Williams and Kip. I draw very similarities, but we are not here for that. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie for those of us who love this old comedy. If you've seen any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, the right arm of Williams, who looks and acts a lot like Bert Wheeler. You've deceived me. <br /> <br /> Yes, my wife and I recommend this.
