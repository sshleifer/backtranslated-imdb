"If I want to drool, I'll call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Do not you have enough?" ... "more than enough." <br /> <br /> "I've got a choo-choo." <br /> <br /> "If you start to die, please remove the cowboy hat from my head, this is not the way I wish to remember." <br /> <br /> Some of the brilliant, often insightful, comic quotations of this film are magician and often insightful. Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich. Sir John Gilgod is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. They have a relationship other than a father / father and a son who identifies the man who will become Arthur. Will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth? For 25 years, I returned to this film with joy, amusement and joy. It's a movie we go back to again and again, and remember what's important in life, as important as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
