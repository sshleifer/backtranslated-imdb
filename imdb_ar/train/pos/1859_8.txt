In his debut film, Denzel Washington takes a real story that happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen honestly, which we expect from Washington's acting efforts, but we now see this touch as a director. <br /> <br /> We have recently seen some tragic consequences for children who have fallen into the cracks of public protection. This story tells of a nightmare that leaves terrible scars but indicates the triumph of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We can pick up some problems in the first effort with a lot of confidants and not the best in editing these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that exhibit such power can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the Academy ignores this film, it will be disturbing. This film does not draw punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that does not usually exceed the novel to the screen. This, of course, is a tribute to the manager. <br /> <br /> This is amazing, so go see it and tell your friends to see it too!
