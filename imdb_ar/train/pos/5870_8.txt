JACKNIFE is a wonderful adaptation of "Strange Snow" (also written by Metcalfe), directed by David Hugh Jones with sensitivity, which explores the much forgotten impact of the battle on veterans who have been permanently affected by the cruelty of the gruesome war. It is particularly moving to go back to this 1989 film as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the cruel treatment they receive in veterans' hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam to war together and only two survived: The problem is that while both men suffered in the battle, David Flanigan's "secondary" (Ed Harris) was badly damaged by stress syndrome Post-shock to the extent that it "exists" in a drunken vacuum with its simple counterpart. Martha's sister teacher (Cathy Baker). As David deteriorates, his companion Joseph Jacqueline Mejisi (Robert De Niro) returns to the town in an attempt to help his friend. In the context of the events, Jacknife presents at the beginning of Martha's subject and in the end she must attend the two dates - at Martha's Concert - and at that concert David collapses completely, destroys the school and frightens the city's people and students. Jacknife makes Dave rest a moment in Vietnam when they lose their colleague and in doing so David rises to the point where he can start his climb towards recovery. The long-suffering Martha finds that her needs tend to side with Jackieff, too. <br /> <br /> The three performers offer amazingly spectacular performances: Ed Harris offers one of his full-fledged roles while De Niro and Baker keep the high standards set by their career. More people should help revive this film, but they are forgotten because it is a crisp reminder of the damage our wars cause to the men who fight them and the families they receive after the battle ends. Highly recommended. Grady harp
