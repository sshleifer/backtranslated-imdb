I have seen this recently, after a break of nearly forty years. It holds well, especially the outstanding songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who will buy" a magical cross point, just one of the most prominent positions.) <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the other publication that denounced its G rating. The entirely new classification system at the time, G (general) was never intended to mean "completely free of conflict". <br /> <br /> Describing it as inappropriate for children reminds me of the character I've seen before. Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives at a strange land and kills the first person you encounter. Then you go on a road trip with three of the companions and kill again.
