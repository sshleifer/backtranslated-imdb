Oh, this is great music. There are a few mistakes - Frank Sinatra is a fatal mistake like the Jewish Nathan Detroit, although it became clear only to "Sue Me", a distinctive Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to drop one of the best songs from the show, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with Sinatra's lower style. With these two disadvantages in mind, the movie is great. Jean Simmons shines in the role of Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing the valuable beans, but he pulls them anyway. Stubby Kaye plays a fantastic role in Broadway (written for him). Demon Ronion's language, rhythm and humor come well. This is on my list "See Every Opportunity".
