One of the best if not the best rock and roll movies ever. And it's not just reckless fun. There was already a lot of smart jokes in it. Of course I love Remons. But with all the manifestations of "chaos" and "I hate high school," the film does not take itself very seriously at all, and that is the wonderful thing about it. <br /> <br /> I first saw the film in the spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie does not take itself seriously and does not claim to be much like teen fare in the seventies, eighties and nineties. To speak, they are neither dirty nor disgusting. Only rated PG. This is rare for a film in this category. The classic cult is great and the capsule really incredible time.
