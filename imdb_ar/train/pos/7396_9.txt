Another fantastic foreign film beats the Hollywood never-ending crop! This is the story of life and living. No, certainly not the ideal little life that is often filmed in Hollywood films, but real life is complemented by real characters, each with its strengths and weaknesses, like real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these spirits, tangled inside the walls of this bathroom, especially the old owner, are wonderful, fun in the heart and very thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> Relax, relax and unwind away in a simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to learn in this film if you open yourself only. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
