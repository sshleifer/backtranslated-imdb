A suspicious creative exercise in indoor phobia. A sexy Japanese film poses a challenging challenge by putting it into two rooms. He was not quite successful, but tight and amazing and well behaved. One might find that the film reminds us somewhat of the SAW? Two men besieged in the room and spat against each other ?? But unlike this film, Dare to stay with his premise and keep the hero in his cell throughout the film. It's like watching the lab experience. Some may find that the inherent thrill is embedded, but this reviewer found it interesting. The sound and image of the film are amazingly realized. It's definitely a good movie to use to show a good home video system. Just right for the film festival late at night, when one is in a paranoid mood. He certainly kept me awake that night.
