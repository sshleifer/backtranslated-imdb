It is virtually impossible to describe this film. The alternative title "Do not Look Up" is a much more description. Like most Japanese movies, the story is not as linear as America. The story revolves around a director filming a story about a runaway ww2. The group is inhabited by an actress who died while filming a television program in the 1960s. The director was the only one who saw the show. If you've seen Ringu (the director Hideo Nakata is the same) and have admired him, you'll catch the ghost actress. I liked the ghost actress much more than Ringo. The film is scary and really disturbing. 10!
