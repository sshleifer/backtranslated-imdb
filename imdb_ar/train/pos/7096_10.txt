I was honored to see this film in a preview show years ago, and a camera crew from a local television station came out of the theater looking for comments on the film. At that time, the only words I escaped from my mouth were "wonderful. I like to think that I can express myself a little better, but at the time I was unable to do so. <br /> <br /> The story is exciting and thought-provoking, and acting is the first class of all managers. It was the first film by Terry Gilliam that he had no hand in writing. Once again with Universal after his long and arduous battle with them about "Brazil," Terry achieved what he wanted most: the last story. "Terry is a master craftsman, and every shot is like a beautifully designed painting that has been carefully constructed with determination and conviction. Unfortunately, there are still limitations in such arrangements. <br /> <br /> The DVD Universal Edition of this movie is amazing, although most of the bonus features are not included in the box . It contains among other things, the director / producer of 90 minute documentary audio commentary is very informative and interesting He made a film called "The Hamster Factor and Other Tales from the Twelve Monkeys." He tells some creative hurdles in filmmaking, including the test of wasting when the preview shows are poorly tested, which attracts the team with feelings of doubt and despair. Change a little about the film and release it with tremendous success. <br /> <br />
