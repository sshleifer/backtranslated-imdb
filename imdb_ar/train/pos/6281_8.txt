I have had the opportunity to watch many movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This film remains as a wonderful work and a wonderful story. Although if you're looking for an excellent movie, that's not the case. The absence of this movie on the DVD helped make the purchase easier. I have always enjoyed intense work and excellent acting that is not always in line. In general, this makes this movie fun to watch. Now on the Blu-ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you get either two things. A perfectly clear image without distortion or film with a high resolution granular image. I was disappointed when I made this first Blu-ray movie. I almost started to think that this was a Blu-ray standard. Although after watching other movies I know better. I do not think they spent too much time as this movie should be transferred to HD. This is generally a problem with some movies. For Blu Ray and Blue Ray Discs players, you should get the best picture. So I consider this a useful investment for people who have never watched the movie or purchased a DVD.
