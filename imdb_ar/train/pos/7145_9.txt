This film contains a great collection of adult actors alongside a group of young actors who will remain in films for a long time if there is any justice. The orientation and editing were wonderful. I may have searched for a book that has been modified, and it should be great. (I liked that). Segorny Weaver, John Voight, Tim Blake and Nelson were a blast to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were very happy when they were on the screen. Children in the camp can not be better. (As I said, I liked it!)
