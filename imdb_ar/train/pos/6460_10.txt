If the screenwriter and director planned to open hearts with the film as the musician wanted to do with his music, they had succeeded with me. The familiar human situations became original, personal and immediate, so I personally felt I was affected by every situation. I think I will calculate the power of music with the point of view of the person writing the film. Without spoiling, I can say that I was greatly influenced by the film's approach to life. Did not you really cry of joy? The flex? Just deep feelings? In a very long time. I like to find a way to show it to others. I saw him at the Seattle International Film Festival.
