Wonderful adaptation to the inner monologues largely Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strik in the rework of graininess in Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Blooms Day - a celebrated day - intended for double participation! Director Bravo Strick, screenwriter Haines, as well as the filmmaker and cameraman in creating this masterpiece. Gunter Grass, The Tin Drum by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979), another fantastic film about internal monologue, is a positive comparison to Strick. <br /> <br /> While the landmarks of Dublin are clearly known in the original novel and in the film, there are also known characters, although there are different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, who lives with Didalus, was a prominent surgeon in Dublin. <br /> <br /> This movie is made for each of its richer virtues with additional scenes. <br /> <br /> Bryan invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
