Jim Gentleman is not really a boxing movie. It is a vehicle for Errol Flynn named Jim Corbett. But having said that, boxing scenes are a real opening for modern scenes. There are no decisions on the 12 points here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the role of an Irish banker who won the World Heavyweight Championship. Cork is well suited to Corbett's unpredictable role. However, his opponent John Sullivan is still better, he is a swipe from the old school played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is a man who pays for his big chance. Corbett leaves his earthly life behind and builds a new character named Jim Gentleman. Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and arrogant. The heavyweight boxing champion Sullivan was portrayed as a simple monster, but his sincerity and athletic spirit give some variation to the main character. <br /> <br /> There's plenty of movement, excitement, and a wonderful ending with the recovery that everyone needs. And Erin Flynn gets the girl.
