Sure, this film is fun and happy and full of cliches, but it's fun, and that's what I see. To be entertained. Natasha Hinstridge is amazing, even with short hair. Her smile is bright and her beauty can not be hidden. For Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love him. Two of them seemed to like eacb in this film. I do not understand the comments that there is no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia Depot and Michael Regulley were thrilled to watch, even if the British tone of Albu had slipped into her supposed bronze speech. To tell you the truth that I did not really notice it until I read these comments, but I came back to the DVD and her dialogue now seems more British than American, but it was perfect for her role with this one exception. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two nice people getting married to other important people, but finding soulmates in each other. This may be an unlikely story, but who says that all films are supposed to play like documentaries? Not more realistic than any of the drama that is displayed every hour on the tube. For this reason we watch them, to escape from the moisture of daily life for a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job, but hey, I'm a passionate man who is easily torn. Do not get me, it must be an emotional scene, and the film had a lot of these films. <br /> <br /> I give it only 9/10 because I saved 10/10 but the wonderful movie that was never known will come someday. If you see an ad being advertised as being shown on a movie channel, life-long movies, or anything else, without a note to watch. I think you will like it.
