An entertaining and objective film, non-stop comparisons have been drawn worthy with "Run Lola Run". The film quickly develops into a series of chase, during which viewers learn about the three main characters through memories of the past and the sequence of daydreams. Harassment is not a fast-paced climax, but a journey that makes up the majority of the film. During the "run", we see the characters grow and forget their bleak moments about their lives, the "masculine" roles that they bought, and finally forget why the start of running in the first place. Much like the fighting that has given "clarity" to the characters in the "Fight Club", the streaming provides the characters of this film a way to move away from the wrong values ​​that we all allow society to create for us. Their operation is a way of tasting life from a truly unregulated perspective, and all three find a level of clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and enjoyment were rarely heard at the end of the film, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to come back to represent the erroneous macho roles that I thought they had escaped through their journey. <br /> <br /> However, the only real problem with this film is that it was not distributed out of Japan sooner.
