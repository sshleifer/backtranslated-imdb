I thought the King Solomon's mines were done beautifully. My only reservation was Dodi Allison. Her makeup was wonderful but her makeup and hair was not in that period and she always seemed to make her look out of place next to other actors. I thought Patrick Suizi was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was good to see an experienced and experienced actor in this role after sitting in a film after a movie with actors with fair and fair hair like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, and so on. It was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this film. This version can not be compared with the 1950s version with Stuart Granger. It was a big screen movie and not a television movie. I thought that both Quatermains were reasonable, but the two arguments should remain separate. I look forward to seeing this again, and I hope Patrick Swayze looks forward to this kind of role again.
