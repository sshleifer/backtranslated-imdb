Much has already been said in this film and I want to join those who have praised it. It's a unique film that uses elements of different genres: Drama, Comedy and Gangster without disturbing it. At points you laugh loudly, and at other points you feel the characters who see their mistakes and fail. The genius of Sabo can be shown in relation to some film sequences. One is that the three men who were chasing each other had an exciting day dream about a young woman they had just passed on the street. This sequence is beautifully illustrated and illustrates the characters of the three contestants very well. It's exciting and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabo's genius is part of the film where the racers are tired. The first, the typical loser among the three men, rejoices that the woman she left to another person is back and sees them dancing with each other and in the next shot they dance with themselves as they move deeply. All the contestants have reached this point where they think they have something they lost or are on their way again. In one part of the film, they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing. So, all this is the beauty and scorn of what we call the life run by Sabo throughout the film. His characters fail (are they in the end?) But he does not rob them of their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" dismiss Sabo's claim as a genius. Go see it! <br /> <br />
