It was an excellent piece for the puppet series because this film showed the entire series, from one to seven. This was about trying one woman to stop the new master of my blood because I never had to guess that the dolls would suffer. In addition, she showed some major serials for brides that I have never seen and seen so hard as the second part. I have shown the emergence of a torch that can turn things and humans, which is cool, and showed the master master's return from the first part. He also showed a few foreigners from part 4 which was also wonderful, and showed other people who may be in their favor and have been very successful.
