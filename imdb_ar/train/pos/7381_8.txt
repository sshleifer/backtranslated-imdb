Ivan (Marco Rika) and GILBERTO (Alexander Borges) are partners in a company with Estefo (George Freire), but the first is a professional killer contract, ANISIO, to kill Estefu (the plot, at least initially, no 'to explain why well). The man does so and after receiving his money begins to blackmail the partners, shows up in his company and says he wants a job there (as supervisor or something?). At the same time meets Marina (Mariana Ximenes), the daughter of ESTEV√ÉO, and starts dating her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, treason and extortion go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be a victim, except Marcina, the only person who does not know what is going on and has not betrayed anyone ?? <br /> <br /> This film ironically depicts the sad and cruel reality of a large city like Sao Paulo, where crime is a daily occurrence. We can be cynical but also in the health of characters such as ANISIO (playing brilliantly Paulo Mikulos), and he shakes the players who paid him without any harassment, and even flirts with the daughter of the man who was killed! He really has to be a beast to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him in Brazil or anywhere else? <br /> <br /> It's a very good film, tough but honest, about a sad truth ?? Great acting and soundtrack as well.
