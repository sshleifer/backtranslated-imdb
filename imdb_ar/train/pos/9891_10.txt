I rented this movie for the first time in several years and was totally impressed with it. I recently felt, having felt the strange need to rethink some of the very few films I enjoyed so much in my life, that I would give "Erendira" another look. I'm glad I did, as I soon discovered that even the passage of time did not shine at least shine this film. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a teenage girl (Erindira, played remarkably by Claudia Ohana - in some respects resembling Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burned her grandmother's palace, and then forced the grandmother, played by Irene Pappas bluntly, to force Girl on prostitution on the way to pay damages. <br /> <br /> Looks fantastic and attractive at the same time - although the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is the void of taste of undue sexual sexual content. The story revolves more about the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters they deal with during their stay - which, by the way, is in the rough and stumbling part of rural Mexico. <br /> <br /> The film is very cloudy, very vague in dream-like quality. Sometimes the border is alien, but not to the limit, for example, the film David Lynch. Also note that the movie is very authoritative, read the comments of the previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often the isolated accordion sounds, the silence and the depression are heard in the background, adding only the correct musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. Filming of rural places, many of which are in the desert, is very impressive. <br /> <br /> The movie moves at a nice pace, not too fast or too slow, and after each scene I felt it to return the tape and play it again, just because it makes you want to do it. For me anyway, it's really convincing. <br /> <br /> We hope you will see the movie in its Spanish version, with translations. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was happy to be able to understand a lot of dialogue. Por ejemplo: "El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba." ("The world is not as big as I thought" - that is, a small world.) <br /> <br /> This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon an old bottle of old wine, which, when drinking, is not quite satisfied, I left some sadness when you realized there were no other bottles like this.
