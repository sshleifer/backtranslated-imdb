This exciting documentary tells a fascinating story about an exploratory trip to the blind Himalayan Tibetans; but also of the personal clash between two wonderful people. On the one hand, there is Eric Finmeier, the first blind man to climb Mount Everest, and a group of mountaineers (sighters) who guide children. On the other hand, Sabri Tanberkin, a blind woman who runs the first Tibetan blind school, agrees with the campaign but later doubts her progress. At some level, Sabine simply does not understand the mountaineering philosophy (focusing on the top); it may have been right to determine the mismatch between the goals of mountain climbers and the wishes of children, but her certainty of her authenticity makes her a difficult person to sympathize with, especially since she has an effective veto. In the background of this clash (reasonably good manners), we recognize the lives of the children themselves. I enjoyed the film, although it delivers a clearly designed message to be upscale - although the details of the melee, the film fairly unabashedly confirms how astonished all those who present it. But it is difficult to argue with this assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat incorrectly.
