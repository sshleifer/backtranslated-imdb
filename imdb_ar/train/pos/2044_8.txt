This is a bit good shock. Not perfect by any imagination, but narrow, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea developed in a 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> Setup does not require any bells, whistles, long outlines or a back story. Kate (Franca Ponte), a young German businesswoman living in London, is drifting while waiting for the last train. She wakes up to find the place deserted, but she soon realizes she is far from alone. There is someone or something with them, and their intentions are completely harmful. <br /> <br /> In fact, several other characters come across in her quest to survive, including a corrupt workmate, a homeless couple and a septic worker, all of whom add speed and content to the plot. There is a somewhat improbable change somewhere in the middle of the film when the thriller turns into the Gore Festival, but there is nothing clumsy to slow the hectic pace. For those of you who are weakly inclined, this is probably a terrible journey; for those of you who enjoy some physical chaos that has been well executed, they must press all the right buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film may be less successful than the main body of the film, but interspersed with a pleasant moment of unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some may find themselves feeling somewhat cheated because of a clear interpretation of the specific nature and history of threat that Kate and her allies have faced, yet to me this was not the case. The horror filmmaker should not need to feel compelled to specify every point of their passage, in the same way that the author of political excitement is expected to do. There is sufficient evidence here to give you a very clear idea of ​​why this evil exists, making a detailed and transparent solution unnecessary. A certain sense of ambiguity should be welcomed and reminds us that the journey in this film will always be more important than the precise one. <br /> <br /> I understand that at least the budget of this film was minimal, and in this case, the applause we are issuing to this British horror should be louder, because no one has the impression that angles are cut or that Effects fail to achieve. > If this sounds like your movie type, it is likely to be. Buy a ticket and climb on board.
