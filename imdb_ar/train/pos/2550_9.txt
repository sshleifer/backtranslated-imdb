It's really one of Hollywood's "golden age," the kind they no longer make. It's a unique and fun film that makes you guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All representatives are fully represented and all are excellent supporting representatives. This is the first film I've ever seen with Ronald Coleman and I've been impressed with it ever since. Reginald Gardiner has always been my favorite supporter and adds a certain quality to every film he brings. While he was playing a different kind of characters here, he still adds something to the film that was not the last actor to cast in this character added.
