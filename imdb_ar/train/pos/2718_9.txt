Last year, we dealt with two films about Truman Cabot, author of a book that made this film - Cabot and the Notorious. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine a film like this made in 1967. The loud and powerful drama is a brutal horror. He rose to the level of a classic film by mastering Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Professional, Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Robert Blake, who starred in this film, faced many problems that may be delayed and may be associated with filming a killer in this film. <br /> <br /> This movie stays with you after viewing.
