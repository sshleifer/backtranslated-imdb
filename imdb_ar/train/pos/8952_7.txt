Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she has been attracted to her usual neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She threw a mantra on Shep forcing him to unload his fiancee and fall. Things go well until Gillian discovers that she really cares about this deadly man. She decided to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he discovers that he is "tricked" into falling in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As the lukewarm comedies of the 1950s go, the Bell Book and Candle are good, but nothing spectacular. It is a pleasant enough hour and should appeal to anyone sitting with it. Just do not go to the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced ​​bread. The film is nice, sometimes funny, and finally touched. Kim Novak and James Stewart are doing their best and getting some real chemistry. Novak (as others have noted) seems quite incredible in a kind of understatement. Supporters with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester are often very funny and steal lots of lights from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can not determine the type of film it wants. Is it a spiral comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Quinn had only one approach, the film might have been better and more memorable.
