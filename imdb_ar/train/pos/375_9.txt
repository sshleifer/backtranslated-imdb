This was one of the most I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I saw him for the first time, and whenever I was on television, my eyes were attached to him. The representation and the plot is amazing. This seems to be true to reality and touches on many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama.
