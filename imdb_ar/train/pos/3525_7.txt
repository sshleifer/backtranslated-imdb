Man, this is a hard DVD to come by. I only found it in Area 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Yeah. Not so much because it is a masterpiece in filmmaking, despite Curt Siodmak's credits (credits on IMDb.com reading "Robert" but the credits of Curt), or because they contain familiar characters from other murder mysteries - Elisha Cook, Jr., and Thomas Gomez - but because of my curiosity about a decade about the film, it finally became apparent. <br /> <br /> Basically, a respectable but self-contained architect (Alan Cortis) was placed by his scattered wife and finds himself at the New York Pub with two tickets to the show in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat sits beside him and politely invites him to join him in the musical show. She accepts, a bit of depression. The Moebi waiter gives them both eyes as they leave. <br /> <br /> In the exhibition, the mysterious star notices that this lady in the audience wears the same hat and explodes with anger. The drummer in the band, Cook, yells at the silent lady but does not get any response. Curtis takes the woman to her house and asks her name but she will not remember her, and she does not want to know his name. If she was a fan of Longfellow, she said something about ships passing through the night. <br /> <br /> Well, Curtis returns home to find that his wife has been killed in his absence. Gomez police officer handed him over to Da. His only excuse is that he was with a phantom lady that no one seems to remember - not the waiter, not the Latina star, not the taxi driver ("Alp"), not the drummer - and since the lady herself has disappeared, it is impossible to dig them. <br /> <br /> Curtis was convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez has thought about things and decided she may be innocent because no one has a mind that will make such a stupid story. He joins Cortis' secretary of love, Ela Raines, in re-investigating the case informally. <br /> <br /> They are visiting the supposed witnesses again. The ominous waiter is run by a car, perhaps accidentally, so it is out of the picture. Latina left hot because of the closure of the show and is not cooperating and did not know the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr., is being strangled by the real killer but not before he appears in a scene where he weighs drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweating face assumes an expression that does not suggest intense concentration but rather wild madness and sexual orgasm. Frying pan rolls to the ceiling, gaps in the mouth, and collides with precision. I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Everyone's doing great, but they're all professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. The best performance, though, is Frances Toon. He is the real killer and frowns on his rage. It's reserved and artistic. Even when he is afraid he is decorated. I do not know how to put this thing accurately but it seems that tone is thinking plus just doing its part. Alan Curtis as an innocent engineer approaches zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to the B image. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it is classically considered. It is really the core murder mystery of Cornel Wollrich, not as good as others. But the direction of Siodmak is delicate. A man runs and ends his hat in a gutter with the water being around him. Use it for effective shadows quietly. <br /> <br /> Happy.
