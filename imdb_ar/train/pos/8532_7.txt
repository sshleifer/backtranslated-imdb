Lupine set out for Morocco in search of a mythical treasure. His only guide is an interesting gem given to him by an old man. It is a beautiful location for Lupine, with a desert and a warm exotic feeling. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, usually in a different place than Lupine. On the one hand, their classical dynamics are lost together, but they change in their tempo. In addition, in this way, Lupine can focus on ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rules in this. Throughout the whole feature languine vampires, we viewers. Then there is Lara, the girl of this particular story, and she is very beloved. This person has more nudity than any other anime trully, which is an interesting distinction. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic and very entertaining ninja man who is the best villain in this matter and of course he has some wonderful battles with Goemon as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. The Zenigata Inspector of course is also at war here, well. <br /> <br /> By and large, this is a smooth trip with Lupine. The plot is mediocre and there are some slow points, but all in all this film is a real fun. Enjoy.
