All people who review this film, and probably many professional movie reviewers, do not get it. This film was made in heterogeneous sequences and artistic techniques such as the work of the great Czech director Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I am talking about, I suggest you get any of the Zeman films, such as the wonderful world of Jules Verne, or Baron Munchausen, or a journey to the beginning of time, or the culprit. If you can not locate a movie, read the comments in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one looks at Zeyman's work and tries to compare it to any of the other science fiction films at the time, viewers probably will not have it either. It is not fair to compare any of these filmmakers with today's standard techniques, because both Zemen and Hines "do not count." They have a unique style for them and they must be judged for their creativity only. If you look at this film from a perspective where you know that you deliberately tried to create a collage of blanks blended with live motion, you can easily come to the conclusion that it did a good job. It is not easy to make a set of flowing computer breakers. I thought the creatures were also very good, also taking into account how to make them. Haines took a big gamble, and I think his film will not be judged fairly for years to come. Someone should have promoted the film to the audience about what they would see, rather than let them blindly go to the theater expecting the usual group work. As for the actors, I think Heinz took a page from the Seaman book, where many of Zeyman's representatives were somewhat expressionless at first, but they became more preoccupied with the progress of the film and the movement. It's absolutely refreshing to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for years to come, every three hours a wonderful one of it.
