First and foremost, anyone looking for a meaningful "results-oriented" cinema with a kind of social message with meaningful presentations and self-seeking dialogue spoken by dedicated, enthusiastic and dedicated speakers, please leave now. You are wasting your time and your life is short, go to watch the new movie Brangelina Jolie, or cry well, or go out and buy a hybrid car or get rid of your conflict diamonds if that makes you feel better, and leaves us alone. <br /> <br /> Do not let the door hit you on your way too. The Incredible Man is B minus the regional horror epic in Oklahoma by a friendly young crew and crew on television, taking care to accompany an astronaut with strange radiation effects, wakes up in the hospital and finds his body sinking as he sits there feeling like a squeak. The fusion man is played by Alex Rebar, who is known for about the first four minutes of the film. But as soon as the weights begin to make up the special effects of Rick Baker, it looks more like something you might find in a box of junk mail before you get rid of all the sticky viscous grease. <br /> <br /> The film has zero view and is not reflected in the plot points: there are some scenes that include types of scientists walking on a silly industrial machine willingly read a few mandatory lines about the effects of radiation but the film does not really care. This is a strange and obvious display in a patiently sick sense of humor for those who can stomach. One big laugh comes when a dissolving man stumbles on a young girl in the forest and is perplexed by what one of his eyes does for POPs. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Bohr's film is the role of Port de Benning, a representative of a magnificent figure from the golden TV scene of the 1970s and 1980s, which was an early example of the Kevin Spacey model; a little crooked, nervous, and one step by most everyone in the room Even if he was confused by his order. This film was immediately shown in a strange film about a horror film selected from a television set called HOUSE OF THE DEAD, one of the best films made in Oklahoma, where I suspect this film was also made. Surely the arid landscape of rural Midwest looks similar, and Fisher's unlucky echoes of the afternoon seem to be the same as Cameron Mitchell battling the exotic pancakes that flew without any warning ... sick feeling Of humor, friendly television casts, and some very outrageous gore. I certainly have at least an aesthetic connection between the three films, as well as the silence of the lights that it is not surprising that the director Jonathan Demi is part of the crew MELTING MAN. <br /> <br /> Basically, others have pointed out that this plot of the 1950s movie (B) has been updated for special effects dating back to the 1970s and the breast is inevitable. The film most of his ideas are probably "Phantom From Space" with Peter Graves as an astronaut returning to earth after being exposed to unconventional radiological effects caused by the wave of murder. One of the things I really liked in the film is that no consideration is given to men's melting motives: it simply goes on frenzy and the drama comes from asking whether it will fall into pieces before certain characters fall victim to its madness. The film's budget is also low as every dime is spent on the screen, and Rick Baker's effects are disgusting to get the lion's share of all that has been spent on this. <br /> <br /> Sick, fun, disgusting Enjoyed with a crowd of friends and lots of beer. Why can not people make more movies like this? <br /> <br /> 8/10
