This movie is awesome. <br /> <br /> I was "charming", as I must say, and was surprised by the unique way it was made. Cast, Sequence, Effects ... Everything! Wonderful! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it prominent from the rest is that it was said in an amusing and healthy way. <br /> <br /> To me, it's a modern fantasy story. . It's like a modern Peter pot ... simply amazing <br /> <br /> I will definitely buy a copy of this at the moment it hits the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double movie one must watch ... !!!! 10 stars for it!
