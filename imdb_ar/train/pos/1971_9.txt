I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Stone once again delivered a great figure. They were as good as they were in the first essential instinct. It still has those smart but tough answers. Although Sharon is 48 years old, it looks amazing! I do not care if it's fake like Barbie. It looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the beginning. Sex, violence and a wonderful ending will make you think and talk about it for hours! Half the people who commented on this film did not see it. So do not listen to them.
