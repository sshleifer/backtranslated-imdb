Shore Leave is probably the first real attempt on behalf of Star Trek to produce a more exciting piece of music. One of the main examples of an exciting and exciting episode (in this case, a terrific balance of terrorism) is a lighter relationship. Sci-fi, although the formula is not quite right yet in this entry (True Victory is Trouble with Tribbles, in Season 2), the laughs come very quickly as long as the viewer is ready to allow all absurdity. <br /> <br /> A shift from the tradition of presentation, the institution is not in any proper task in this episode. Instead, Kirk found an ideal setting for his crew to spend time out of service: a break that would be worth three months of continuous work. The Earth-Like Planet (a budget fact) is very attractive, but it only takes a few minutes before something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins by seeing a white rabbit that appears to have come directly from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people start experimenting with similar things: a woman meets a character resembling Don Juan, her solo tour with the samurai, and Kirk encounters a double encounter with the past, in the form of almost love and the man who used to pick him up at the academy. Throw a real tiger in a terrible way, and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to determine what happens before someone gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The idea is a classic idea: the ideal place to be away from the heavenly. The comic approach in the episode was fairly successful, not so for the dark events that do not fit well with the rest of the events (of course, everything works well and ends again) and the unwillingness of the team to show it in general a more entertaining aspect than Themselves (most notably, ironically, the funny William Shatner). Shore Leave, however, deserves appreciation for being another good example of writers who are experimenting with new things that were not already visible: Star Trek's success definition. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
