Farah Fawcett is wonderful in this powerful drama in 1986, playing Marjorie, a woman who managed to escape from the clutches of the potential rapist. Well done for being a Golden Globe candidate for Best Actress. <br /> <br /> When her exorcist (played by James Russo in a terrible way) comes to her house, sharing her roommates (who are comfortable) outside, Marjorie has to play along with the demands of a frightening atmosphere. It is useful for some disturbing pictures and amazing! <br /> <br /> When her colleagues back home, they are surprised (at the very least) by Marjorie's actions, and a wonderful performance by Alvary Woodard, who is desperately trying to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn it into a police force and make the film more surprising . <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scaroid very annoying, but when Joe finally admits he came there to kill them all, he makes the film a very exciting film for drama. <br /> <br /> In general, external actors represent a well thought out and well-represented film and I have to watch it hundreds of times! Well done to everyone involved.
