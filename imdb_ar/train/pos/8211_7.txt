I have never seen the original "dirty Harry", this film has been ruled in a clean list. I must say, I enjoyed it. Sure, some of Sondre Locke's actions made me a bit certain - but hey, it was in the eighties. But even if you can not get over it (and I could not) or retaliatory killings (which seemed a bit exaggerated ...), it's worth it for Dirty Harry. Or at least, the bull dog called "MeatHead" lovingly called: P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
