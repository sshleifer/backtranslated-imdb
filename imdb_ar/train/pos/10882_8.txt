This is not a bad film. The new conventions of modern horror, that is, the film within the film, is the best-known actress in her life in the first scene. This film takes the old traditions of a murderer myself, and he is capable of doing something new and enjoyable. It is also good to always see Molly Ringwald again for attack. <br /> <br /> So this may be an example of what this type has become. Cut hits all tags, which is actually scary in some parts. I love it so I gave it eight.
