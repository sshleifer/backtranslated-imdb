EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must come with the birth of a narrative film about a century ago. This film is truly unique, a genius work. The photographer and montage are wonderful, combine with storytelling stories from the alienation used in the film, and create an unforgettable, cinematic experience. Comet pleasures should be seen and enjoyed. Max von Siddo presents his wonderful voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> A movie of its kind! Four stars (top rated).
