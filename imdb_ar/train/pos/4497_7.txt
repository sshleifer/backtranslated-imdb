I only saw the first part of this series when it first appeared in the late 1990s and just recently got a chance to see the three parts via Netflix (convenient service by the way). All in all, I loved this mini-series full of vitality, sometimes challenging. It seems that the story of a younger man falls with an old woman working and that the actors are fine. Yes, contain some romantic clich√©s from running under the rain or train station, but the characters have a chance to be explored so as not to look like cheese, as if some Tom Hanks cars or the like. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of the isolated Bakula silence at birth, does a great job for a person wearing heels in love and ebbing and refusing to throw the series into a water taxi. Personally, I think it was possible to conduct the series through two episodes, but it is up to discussion. There seems to be a supplement, and this must arrive tomorrow via Netflix.
