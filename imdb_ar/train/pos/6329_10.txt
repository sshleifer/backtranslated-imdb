The film is full of symbols: My favorite film is the brightest symbol of its zodiac (the colloquial Russian word for "destruction", often referring to the period of chaotic lifestyle after the civil war 1918-2020). A dirty door was opened in the wall built of rocks in the snowy wind and the black hole in the entrance His successor. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is played on a DVD with a completely restored image and 5.1 sound. There are also well-translated English translations, although some of Sharikov's outrageous words have been replaced by more moderate translations.

It is the post-Soviet influence: the Soviet people seemed not fully prepared for the media attack on Western civilization. Television producers and filmmakers made the entertainment industry and the media surprisingly aggressive, without spirit, without thinking, and even brought the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among Internet users, everyone uses obscene language in forums and chats because they are surprisingly common in public speaking.
