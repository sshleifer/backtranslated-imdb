You have to go and dig those holes. The holes leaves only troble, making the film very good. I've done this Disney again. Shea Labov should be nominated for Best Actor for his performance as Stanley Yelnets. He has been awarded the Alredy Daytime Emmy Award for best actor in a comedy series (even Stevens). Holes is one of the best films in 2003.
