I loved all the films by Michael Landon Jr., and Michael Landon Jr.'s selection of Dale Medkiv as Clark Davis was no better. Dale Midkiff has ways to pull this character. <br /> <br /> This movie kept me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The death of Missie & Willies and a little girl with Clarks time was the only timing visit of the gods. How they dealt with death and how Clark helped them do it was the love of parents. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 movies before this movie [Love Comes Quiet, Loves Permanent Promise and Loves Long Journey], I feel that you can watch this movie and understand it easily. However, leave it and want to watch the previous three movies due to the date left by all the characters. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to many more movies and movies from him in the future.
