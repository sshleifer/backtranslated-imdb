"All of them laughed" is one of those small films that I always recommend to friends who are looking for something out of the ordinary. It is deeply rooted in the romantic tradition of the past, but it seems more contemporary. Even the atmosphere in the early 1980s does not date much. Bogdanovich keeps the entire project wisely in the light of this, and this reality does not make it crumble on the ground. However, this kind of cute little film is entirely dependent on actors for its continuation, and the film "TAL" is blessed with a style that conveys a dream that realizes the requirements of this story. Colin Camp is screaming at the same time about John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak releases all that hair from under his hat; especially when Dorothy Starrett falls to John Ritter and says: "How ... a stranger". It is a piece of fluff that one does not want to put on it for fear of crushing it, but it certainly leaves one with a slight heart and a smile on his face.
