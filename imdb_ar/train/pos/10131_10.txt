In the first episode of Friends, aired on September 22, 1994, "The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate", there is a song playing while Rachel sits in the window near the end of the show, and the line he plays is: "If you ever need a contract." ... Does anyone know that an artist sings or a song title? Sounds like a great song .... I love getting a copy of it. Thanks for the help I'm looking for the album / CD is running so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have offers to buy and enjoy this offer over and over again. It just seemed to believe ... Thanks for the entertainment hours I have provided over the years.
