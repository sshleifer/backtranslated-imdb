One of the best dramas I have ever seen. We do a lot of work in the church, and this can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. I strongly recommend this, especially for those who have an interest in acting, as a "must see". There are several scenes of note. On the one hand, the graveyard scene when he encounters Hamlet and Eurek (everyone knows about this scene once you go to primary school), and his interaction with the skull was very good. The logic used in this scene was enormous - I suppose Shakespeare's testimony more than anything else. For a second, I enjoyed the scene very much where Hamlet and Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the upcoming fencing.
