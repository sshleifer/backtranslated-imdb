Although Cher and Cage are the two main stations of this story, Gardinia and Dukakis are good counterparts - Loretta and Ronnie 50 years later - in love. The whole team does a great job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real slice of life. Although I've seen this for a long time - I'm happy because he finally took Cage to the place he was famous for in Hollywood because of his talent. From music to opera scenes to kitchen table arguments - this is a very interesting film.
