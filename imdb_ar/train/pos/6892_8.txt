The earliest I came to see this clip was shown at Gerrard Philippe in Paris two years ago. I had no interest in the new edition and having just finished the original after more than half a century, I can only conclude that the inefficient fence was intentional and aimed at an old goal. Hollywood has been fighting Saif since the 1930s, when the greatest of them, Basil Rathbone, broke up with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and left only satire. After a while, do not notice and notice in the dialogue Henry Jenzon who reminds us of Zenda Prisoner, both versions. Gerrard Philippe certainly had a presence to play such a role, and Gina Lolapr√≠gida was probably better than Martin Carroll, the other obvious candidate at the time. The printout I saw was very bad and was completely disrupted at one point, so the DVD version might have improved it.
