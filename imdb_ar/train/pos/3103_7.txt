"Maybe we can arrange a meeting." "where are you now?" "I'm sitting in my office." "I doubt it." "Why do you doubt that?" "If you're in your office now we're going to have this conversation face to face." <br /> <br /> Bourne is still hard on the street and difficult to reach. It is only his inhumanity that leads the film away from the imagination. The conversation is muscular, somewhat with only fragments of Bond-type hilarious humor. It's all about work. <br /> <br /> The feeling that something is happening on another level of the world we live in is something that the triad is well overwhelmed by. A scene in Waterloo with a journalist from the Guardian does this dramatically. There is no meeting of the worlds - you are in it or just an unnecessary body. <br /> <br /> If your camera does not bother you so much, enjoy this movie and hope this franchise continues.
