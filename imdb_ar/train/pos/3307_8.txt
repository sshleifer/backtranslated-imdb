Let's start by saying that the title of this film in English, "Kangwon County Power," is an absolute misnomer. Because it is in Hong Sang Su's film, there are no real shots of wars, troubles and conflicts. So the idea of ​​creating a county authority is neither appropriate nor valid in the context of this film. If we judge this film through its Korean title, "Kangwon-do ui him" will appear as a hidden ad about the emotional turmoil of its young heroes whose minds are not in a state of rest. Hong Sang Soo has also directed a prolific visual evidence of the wrong choices made by people in their lives. The people involved are a couple of girls who are constantly working to display their moods, whims and whims. If a movie industry can be considered as a virtue for a filmmaker, Hong Sang-soo should be greeted as a courageous filmmaker who speaks volumes about nothingness everywhere in human relationships, emotions and spirits. , This is the only fair conclusion that has been drawn from this particular film.
