I can not believe that we are no longer showing this 70s program. I have all eight chapters of the 1970s show !! I absolutely loved it !! I put on the bed every night and watch several episodes before I sleep. At the end of a long busy day, it's good to go back and laugh before going to bed. I was very sad where they showed the air ... at least we still have a restart! I hope and pray that they will return at least reunion ... maybe like when Donna finishes her university studies and finally get to her and Erick get married !!!! Would not be so great !!! It would be better if they continued for several years !!
