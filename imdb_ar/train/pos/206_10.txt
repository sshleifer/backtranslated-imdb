I'm fourteen, so you might think I did not hear about George Burns or Walter Matau or anyone like that. Boy Are you wrong. You've heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Oscar for it. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was 10 years old. I saw the movie, my God, and I loved it recently. This was also very cool. George Burns did a great job. And so did Walter Matau (this is the first time I saw him lead). Although they have very small roles, Felice Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. This particular that they were filming was wonderful if it were really done. Let me say this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matau, you should see this movie immediately!
