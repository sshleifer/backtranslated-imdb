Although I can not claim to be a fan of the comic book, I read my share, so I think I am part of the audience of this film, and I was not disappointed. His strength is nearing the end, and it is almost overflowing with ideas. Lina Olin, one of my favorite actresses, seems to have been left on the floor of the cutting room. Also, a little Raja Hank Azaria Blue Raja can go a long way. However, it is easy to forgive all these mistakes when you have a movie that is very enjoyable. It seems that all actors are facing an explosion with their roles, especially William H. Messi in the role of straight arrow, and Janian Garovalo in the role of Buller. Unlike some, I found the city's design to make humor more entertaining. I also liked how the disco was the favorite music of the bad guys. Somehow, it seems appropriate.
