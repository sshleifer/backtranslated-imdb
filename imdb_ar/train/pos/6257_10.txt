This documentary film of Marian Cooper is very amazing. I saw him tonight on Turner Classic Movie. I think I'll see if I can order a copy of it on a DVD. The movie footage does not look as blurry and intermittent as you might think of a 1925 silent B & W movie. In Iran in 1925, the nomadic tribesmen left their desert homes and crossed a precipitous river, men, women, children, animals ... and then over a snowy mountain that passed over Bervout. They sink, swim, climb or die. In search of grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses and mules. In one scene, a man carries a mule so sick he can not climb the mountain. The children in the documentary seem happy and healthy. They had a difficult life. I wonder if the Bedouin tribes in Iran are still living this way. It makes you appreciate modern life in the USA.
