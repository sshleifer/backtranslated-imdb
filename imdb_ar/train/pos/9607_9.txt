This is a movie that should be seen by anyone who is interested, injured or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an accurate and surprising picture of the sick vermin of a teenage girl and his causes and symptoms. The girl played one of the most brilliant young actresses in the cinema today, Allison Lehman, who was later amazing in the film "Where the Truth Is." I recommend viewing this movie in all schools, because you will never see the best of the subject ever. Allison Le Mans is extremely impressive, and one marvels at her ability to express the pain of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If the barometers tell us the air pressure, Allison Lehman tells us emotional pressure with the same precision. Her emotional range is extremely accurate, and each scene can be measured microscopically because of its degrees of shock, high hysteria and desperation that reach unbearably high. Mary Winningham is considered the perfect choice to play with her mother, and she does so with great sympathy with a range of emotions just like Lehman. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional vibrators vibrate in resonance with each other. This film is a truly amazing achievement, and director Kat Xia should be proud of it. The only reason not to see you is if you are not interested in people. But even if you love nature's best movies, then this is after every animal behavior on the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of the way in which the tormented soul can destroy its body in a state of despair. If we do not sympathize with people who are suffering from the depths of despair, we have died at home.
