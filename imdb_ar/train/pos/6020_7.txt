There is a beautiful remake of "Zabriskie Point" playing in Paris and it seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time to make a full assessment of the film. Let us hope that the new print version means that the DVD contains some insightful "plugins" that will be released in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when it was released and I thought it was a cavity. This time I felt full horror and would classify it as a "miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule from the late 1960s in Los Angeles, and I lived there afterwards, and Anthony did a great job capturing the essence of the place. Glory to the production design of Tavolares religion which found some wonderful sites and did a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> The print you saw lasts for one hour and 50 minutes. Forbidden by those under the age of 16 (or 18, I can not remember that). I think there are a lot of snapshots reproduced in this publication. Spoiler - I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What seems today seems burdensome to current standards. <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack until almost one hour in the movie. Before we hear strange noise such as radio broadcasts, etc. Anthony was very bold to do this. I remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frisht and Darya Halperin. This time I did not bother Frechette. Halprin is weaker but gradually improves with the continuation of the film. <br /> <br /> Many of the students' riot pictures look like pictures of me. One shot in the aspect ratio is different and distorted by the widescreen. Of course, there are shots actually organized, but not all of that. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni made some shots by Fritsch as he lifted the plane. He seems to have already done some flying - there is no blue or double screen in some of the shots. <br /> <br /> I hope to come back to watch the movie again. Highly recommended for Antonioni fans.
