It's one of the best Hindi movies I've seen recently, instead of lyric and dance or poor dog movies. All actors showed the right feelings in the right intensity with the right timing. It's the hallmark of a good film, it makes the viewer go back and look at the subject, which I did specifically in Harilal. I always enjoy Akshay Khana's acting style, and it is interesting that he has a complicated relationship with his father Vinod Khana, though not as dramatic as Gandhi and I wonder how he helped him write this character. I was impressed by the direction and impressed Anil Kapoor for producing such an elegant film.
