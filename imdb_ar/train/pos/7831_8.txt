The story of the German Fritz Lang in the Middle Ages continues in Die Nipplungen: Kreichildes Rush (1924). She wants to take care of her murdered husband, Siegfried. Her brother is too weak to bring the murderer, Hagen, to justice. King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein Rouge). She gives birth to a child and invites her brothers to attend a party. Eitel and other Kyle Kell Hagen must be protected, but protected by their brethren. See the battle of a huge life and death begins, and place the whole place on fire. In the end, Hagen is dead, as is Kriemhild. These films deal with great themes, such as revenge and relentless love. Sure, we later saw some of the best films made of those themes, but this was one of the first.
