Ramones, who is considered the founder of the modern evil rock music, makes their unique voices at the time for a film that is awfully quirky about an encouraging rock fan (PJ Soles) who confronts a merciless president (Mary Woronov) for the right to rock music. <br /> <br /> Featuring an audio track full of amazing music, RRHS is fantastic in concept and implementation. It's full of maddening muzzles (like mouse experience), teen spirit (maybe my favorite film ever opens), and strange moments out of the ordinary (Straits Scenes). If you're looking for a film that seems to be made of pure fun at the molecular level, look no further. But if you're looking for a nice, gracious and exciting epic, you might have to look a bit further. <br /> <br /> "Hi everyone, I'm Riff Randell, this is a Rock and Roll High School!"
