One of the best comedians ever. I've seen this show about 10 times and maybe I've seen it at least 100 again. I quote my friends and family from this DVD a lot, you think we did nothing but watch it. The first part about Alcatraz is a bit slow, but either cross it or press it to the part where Eddie is on stage. See the "Cake or Death" part (flirting about the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Paul Pot" section (hard to explain, just see). The best part of the presentation is Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Maybe help Mascara, Eyeliner, Eye Shadow, huh?) Just Warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw lots of four-letter words.
