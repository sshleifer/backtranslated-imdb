Finally a film where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (Hawk played) will go down towards destruction because there is another place to go, but we do not know how and when until near the end of the film. Hoffman is wonderful, as usual, and even Hawk was fit like a younger brother who does what he was told basically because he can not really think of himself. The hook may be of its little element, but it plays the role well enough. Add to this mix Andy's wife who played a wonderful role by Marisa Tommy, cheated with Hank; Andy's embezzlement of the company's money to pay for his addiction to drugs and sex; and the father who finally discovered what happened on the day of theft. This movie will make you think.
