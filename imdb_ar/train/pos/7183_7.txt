This is the perfect chain for family watching. We gather around the TV to watch this on the BBC America. It is an updated version of Robin Hood and appeals to children and adults alike. Our teenager and young people enjoy sitting with my mom and dad and watching Robin's next exploits. We can not wait for the next episode to air every week, and we're happy with the free "on demand" offer. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe features a modern style. There is a moral to every story. It is amusing. Violence is not too much or unnecessary. The soundtrack is very impressive with John William's sense of it. It is an old tale of the world returning to life again with a new worldview. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of trash on TV from "realist" rotten television to senseless violence. This must take on what it is and this is an updated "Robin Hood" that can not be compared with the movie exploits of Errol Flynn. This gem is enjoyed by everyone. Parents who are worried about their children watching a lot of violence will enjoy Robin's taste of war and bloodshed. It's Robin Hood who tries to explain his way out of a fight. Marian's maid is also an attractive model for young girls. Instead of standing and not doing anything, she takes her part in helping the poor by being a "night watchman." Sheriff Sheriff Nottingham is on top of the bad guys, just as he should be a sheriff and appears as a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Currie. Guy Gisborne plays a very handsome actor, which makes most women wish he did not portray the role of the "bad guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Friar Tuck?"
