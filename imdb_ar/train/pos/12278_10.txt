Well, I've said everything in the summary, I simply adore the film and the film ... I would like to give each actor an Oscar award ... Wonderful movie, wonderful ... I am now 25 and watched it 4 times at different times I always think I will not cry and always do , About 2 or 3 times ...;) Merrells. It was great too, Jeremy the iron too ... just fantastic ... I wish the movie got more awards ... I really do not know anyone who saw it and did not like it ... Also, Glen nearby was fantastic. The story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that despite everything, Clara and Esteban loved each other, and how Blanca was close to her parents ...
