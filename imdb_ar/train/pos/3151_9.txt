I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was a funny dam! When I first saw he was playing on television (Estonian), I started to admire him. Too bad that this offer at a bad time for me. Hyde like a cool man loves singing Frank Sinatra! And comes stupid ideas. He got those glasses that brown h. I love that . There is a win. The perverted group. We all know what he does when he is alone ... wants to be put badly. So he was with the boss in one loop. It's from India. There is Michael, the dumbest person in the whole group, probably the dumbest in the city and has a cop! It's so stupid that I remember the following: Heyd says: Did you call the police? - No Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He's a playboy town. Then comes Jackie, Michael's former girlfriend, and then she's a friend of Hyde. Then Eric is the son of an angry war veteran and son of a kitty housewife. The owner of one big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with the planners of their marriage. Donna is one hot girl. They are what I forget? Hey Hyde live in the basement.
