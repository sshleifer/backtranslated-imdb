This is not a critique of the film, but a comment on how blind we are to our past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a new version or sequel - except for Iraq rather than Vietnam. Like Winter's Soldier, because of its one-sided message, both films illustrate how happy we are to engage in false arguments and allow young and brave (and often na√Øve) people to bear the brunt of this greedy war. Both films effectively demonstrate that the mentality imposed on the minds of young men and women makes them effective killers, but training is largely lacking in the teaching of the diplomatic and police skills necessary to win the hearts and minds of people who are presumed to be effective. Struggling for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and is likely to lose the war in Iraq as well. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is one-sided so that it can easily be passed as left-wing propaganda. It is not mine, I am against you, but by those who aim to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced view would speak to a larger audience.
