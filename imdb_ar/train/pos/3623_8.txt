Disney may be just something here. First, they had "remember the titans" with Denzel, a story based on the truth that includes sports and a small town in Central America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie ... another sports story based on the truth. <br /> <br /> Both films sometimes make you cry, and both make you smile and feel warm after seeing them. My wife and I took the movie The Rookie and expected it to be a great thing. We did not let it down, when we were asked if we would buy this on the DVD when it came out, it was not. Absolutely.
