Although this was not without errors, this drama was appropriate to show at the time of Easter. We reminded ourselves of spirituality and showed that we are behind our facades, often hiding our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was a lot to enjoy in the drama, not least the traveling teenagers who gave a better musical accompaniment to the drama of the poor sound in the background. The excellent acting and Timothy Spal was again wonderful. The peak was very satisfactory, if somewhat simplistic. Timothy Spall's "abandonment" of his dead wife's suicide was credible and well reflected the feelings of despair that existed in the teenage girl who hurt herself. The decision between a graphic boy and a Muslim was satisfactory but less believable. A wonderful drama that left me and my husband and they are afraid that the evening has been spent well. Congratulations!
