On paper, this film seems incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man traveling to the countryside on a horseback riding ranch is not very attractive, but the real power behind the film is its charm and intelligence. The book will not find a better study of what makes the film a "straight story". <br /> <br /> An ideal example of this is the scene where two thousand meet with a runaway teenager. She is pregnant and afraid of what her parents will do if they know about it. Two thousand stories tell about his children, a long time ago. They have made them all take a stick and break it, which they can easily do. Then he made them collect the sticks and try to break them. "This package is a family," he said. Many other movies will feel compelled to continue and make sure we know that someone can be broken but the members were stronger. The "straight story" realizes that we are smart enough to understand this and simply let us think about our thoughts and draw our conclusions. <br /> <br /> The Alvin journey across Iowa is filled with this unfinished character in Hollywood interactions. Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alpine is very nice riding the lawn mower to the point where we can only smile on his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lille, who had a stroke. The simplicity of the latter scene confirms that the real story here is not the destination but the journey. It is a journey in which he shares his life with everyone he meets - for their benefit and for us. It is a slow, simple and convenient journey to remind us of all that we have lost with urbanization in the United States. <br /> <br /> The "Straight Story" is a rare motionless movie "G" that really is not to be missed.
