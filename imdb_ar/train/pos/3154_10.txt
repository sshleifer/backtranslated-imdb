This show snaps hilarious! Jokes are original, god, and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the eighth season, it's no longer funny because Erik and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real Dombas Randy, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can not take the extremes of characters and switch em b "I am a wonderful man" kind of man (Randy). It's not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the eighth season funny, it's still, not as much as the previous seasons, but okay. Circle, Red is a real kind of abusive mental father :) and Kitty is always half high half-circular. Hyde tries to be calm all the time, and he has his moments as well. Less favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. They are wonderful, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> A wonderful view. Stupid!
