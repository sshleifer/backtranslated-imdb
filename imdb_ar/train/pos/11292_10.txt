I once saw this movie as a child in the late show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took 30 years, but I recently found a DVD - not cheap, either - in a war movie catalog. We saw it last night for the first time. The sound was good, yet it was grainy and had trailers between rollers. However, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed by the validity of the play. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you are sincere in finding it, I will shoot an error message and I will see if I can get the information for you. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
