Yakitate! Ja-pan (known as freshly baked Japanese bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pan, for Japanese and Japanese, which will be recognized by the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is only overseas. In fact, Yakit! Ja-pan is not really about bread, but the reaction that comes after eating bread, is punitive that comes with interaction. The series is beloved because of this pun. From famous anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to popular films like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. Everything is there. <br /> <br /> What makes this title different from other titles of the same kind as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike others who use cooking to control the world, YAKIT! Ja-pan is a purely comedy. Sure, there are times when the story turns into drama, or even murder, but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at it. You will be laughing from their own point of view. Just watch it. <br /> <br /> Just remember that this is also a fantasy, although some of the bread made here depends on real bread, but eating at home made from Japan will not turn you into Super Saiyan or turn your body into rubber.
