If this film hits you (as we did, and it seems, others who left the theater) as being disappointingly thin, the reason may be that the subject itself is somewhat disappointing. The film faithfully shows us as Bettie Page as it probably was: an almost innocent playboy from the rural south whose career as Queen of the Pinup of the Universe was for her a natural pleasure. Her ultimate moral convictions, religious transformation, and sudden departure of bare modeling and servitude are biographically accurate, yet difficult to understand because of their harshness in her life. <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to watch this film, however, not least the stunning cinematic portrayal of BMW Mott Hopfel III (complete with old-fashioned wipes and melts), the faithful representation of the 1950s in the direction of Mary Haroun (Including Chris Bauer, Lilly Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Silesak), not to mention Oscar's leading performance and technically difficult for the Gritchen Mall. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mall is full of nude scenes, most of them in stunning lingerie and special costumes (brilliantly compiled by fashion designer John A. Dunn), yet she keeps Pete Beige fun unthought in her fertile body. Watching Ms. Maul as Ms. Beige, an ambitious actress, progressing through degrees of "bad" tests gradually and the representation of the students is a vision of a truly wonderful actress who has full control over her craft. <br /> <br /> The text actually takes us to America in the 1950s, where sexual abuse of children, illegal abduction and rape, and the legal repression of today's pornographic trademarks are a reality. Fifty of New York were brought up with broken news videos. 50's Miami features its super-saturated 16mm colors. The real Bettie Page seems to be cheating, smiling and posing in front of us, yet the lightweight effect of its curiosity is hardly wrong and not dangerous at all. <br /> <br /> How strange is the symbol of great slavery that must be lacking in poison, and that this biography is technically excellent and should have little sting.
