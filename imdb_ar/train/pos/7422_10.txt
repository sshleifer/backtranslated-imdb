As a longtime Barbara fan, any such publication would be biased. This aside, this classic film is classified. Its flaws (emphasized in other publications), but give a glimpse of the time (late seventies) there will never be again, a wonderful watch to unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand fought hard to make this film her own. I do not think they were satisfied at all. But she gives her fans a new Barbara (right now) with direct singing, a young new look, and some very hard work. <br /> <br /> The story is difficult, but exciting, and intrigues you throughout. It is difficult for most fans of non-Barbara to be seated under one lengthened "finale", but he speaks volumes to those who admire her talent. <br /> <br />
