I liked this movie and I remember that there was a very good scene in this film where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) lay in a pot smoking her bed and then started imagining that Ramones in the room sang it with the song "I want you around" ... very cool things. <br /> <br /> It was fun, active, twisted and cool. Yes, I will admit that the end is a highway over the top and bring it away ... but that does not matter because it's fun, it's a very fun film. I read that Cheap Trick was the band that was supposed to play a role in this .. But I do not know if this is true or not
