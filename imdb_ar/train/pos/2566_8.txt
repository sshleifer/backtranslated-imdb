Any film dealing with intolerance in a positive way is a film that current viewers still have to see because the message and ethics of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film is really an old-fashioned love story .. A boy meets ... loses a girl ... Boy brings back the girl .... <br /> <br /> The weakest role goes to the late Kent Smith as Lt. Gen. Webster (Ricardo Montalban in second place) ... My question is how he got to become a 3-star general ... Personal is such a commander in his presence as wife and military subordinates, The wonder seemed to him no respect at all. <br /> <br /> There was little southern dialect of Brando, some scenes with some holes but overall, I enjoy the movie every time I watch it. <br /> <br /> Red Buttons Fantastic ... I always like to see Comedians in exciting roles ... As in the case of Button, a comedian is often able to portray a person's tragedy better than traditional Ramatic music.
