"Kalifornia" is one of my favorite films at all and can easily be classified as one of the best psychological thriller films of the 1990s. The film has a very elegant surface, but behind it there are many disturbing and true images of the horrific killings and violence they commit to others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is the performances, Brad Pitt is amazingly stunning as a psychic trailer named Litter early. A house spoils his frightening personality almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis enjoys equal importance in playing with his naive girlfriend, and her innocence is almost frustrating. California has a very simple conspiracy, which goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but suddenly turns into a horrific wave of murder, where his mental home is called. There are many horrific scenes, all of which rise to the peak of the energy house that will haunt you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that should really be seen as an intense view of human horror, not just violence and violence.
