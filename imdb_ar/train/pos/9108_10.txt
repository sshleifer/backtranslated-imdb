A true story of a real revolution, April 25; a revolt against the 41-year-old repressive regime that imposed a colonial war on its army to preserve the empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cabo Verdi, S. Tome e Principe; Of the largest colonial empire of Europe) 600 years ago, since it began the invasion of Ceuta in 1415; a revolution by the army for the people and for a democratic Portugal; the most surprising fact in this revolution is that no people were killed (except those who died in the hands of PIDE, the state's political police, during a brutal shooting against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of Kara on the day of the revolution, on April 25, 1974, the film offered). She had all the revolutions she had of her heroes, one of whom was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a soldier returning from the war, with their convictions with the rest of the army, they were fighting (since 1961) a hopeless war and that sometimes the soldier had to disobey the country.
