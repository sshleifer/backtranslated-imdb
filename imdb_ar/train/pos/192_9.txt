Before watching Show People, my impression of silent comedy was basically comic and comic. I could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken words or many problems. But this clever film proved to me wrong. In my opinion, perhaps Davis was the greatest comedian actress to come before Lucille Paul. I remember Lucy in the first place because Davis's facial expressions and facial expressions I mentioned so much that I wonder if Davis was not one of Paul's core influences. This comes from a 21-year-old guy who has never seen a silent comedy, and I must say that regardless of the amount of references specified for the period you are already getting (I did not seem), you will not be bored by this film. You will probably laugh more than you did in most comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but easily among the ten favorite comedy of all time.
