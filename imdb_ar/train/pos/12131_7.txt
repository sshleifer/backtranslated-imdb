The film is about Philip (Leslie Howard), a serious but disabled medical student. He falls in love with a predatory waitress called Mildred (Pitt Davis). Leaves him and interacts with others (Alan Hill, Reginald Denny). In the meantime, he was adventurous with other adventurers (Kay Johnson, Francis de), but she returned to a destructive affair. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and first releases of numerous films of Somerset Mugam. Betty Davis, a cruel waitress, won another wonderful interpretation with an attractive and hard-hitting performance, completely hypnotized in her account of the slavery that occurs from start to finish. Davis raised stardom by performance. Her tough and rough role will be repeated domineering woman several times in acting back. Leslie Howard as a good student and cream basically destroys skillfully giving excellent performance and grief. He was a wonderful actor (Gone with the Wind) alongside producer, writer and death in a plane crash during World War II. Both will play again in "Frightening Forest" (1936). The atmospheric film was re-produced in the RKO (Radio Picture Inc) studio. Prepared in 1946 by Edmund Golding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henrid. And in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The animation would like classic movie buffs. Rating: Very good but slightly dated.
