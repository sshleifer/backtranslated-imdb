Leaps off. I must say at first that I was a bit disappointed in the first few episodes, but with my faith in the show, and the unquestioning talent of Abu Forset, I continued to watch. I can safely say I'm happy now because I did it. The story has evolved well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most of them do not have any missing information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can misrepresent in this production is the somewhat ludicrous voice and pronunciation of the Lizzie character. <br /> <br /> Some good behavior along with an astral plot really gets this show. Here's hope for another season!
