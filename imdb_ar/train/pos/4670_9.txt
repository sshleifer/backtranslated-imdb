Those who remember only the late Sir Peter Ostinov as Hercule Poirot or a polite expert would better look for this irony than the late satire of the 1960s. Ostinov is the convicted assassin (we see him for the first time in his last day in prison, where he pays the prison governor's tax return), posing that the future in computers (through a clever theft of identity) is a computer expert and has begun infiltrating a multinational company . <br /> <br /> Austinov (who co-wrote the script) is in his best form, as with the delightful Maggie Smith, which is portrayed here unusually as a cockney prone to narrow dolly bird accidents. Bob Newhart is also in amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden feels satisfactorily confused as director of Ustinov and Nohrt. <br /> <br /> What do I particularly like about this film? It is not only a well-thought-out movie, but it is also a touching little love story; Justin and Smith are very convinced that the two are in love (the entire scene has a particularly effective set of leaves). <br /> <br /> So, what Which do you not like? Well, the script is no more computer-literate than most movies (hardly any at all) although it captures the sense of great business computing in the late 1960s well. There are also some small gaps in the plot that you are unlikely to notice until the second or third viewing, but I consider it a minor difference. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie worth searching, and once you've seen it you'll need to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
