This picture moved away in 1935 from all kinds of Oscar for Best Director, John Ford, actor Victor McGlagen and music by Max Sinner. Gypo Nolan, "Call Out the Marines", "42," performed brilliantly as an Irish rebel who belonged to a tough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time growing poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer of his best friend in order to make a trip with his Gal to America and a new way of living. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), 43-year-old Guadalcanal Dayrie, gave a major supporting role as leader of the Irish rebellion and was keen to arrest his group's informant. Gypo Nolan becomes haunted by his friend's betrayal and begins to feel like Judas. Fantastic film of 1935 and wonderful acting by McLaglen, but frustrating in every aspect of the film.
