What can I say about a story like this? This magical story has followed me since my early childhood, as warm memories have been recalled in my heart. The characters take you to many exotic places that make you want more of each scene. For example in the market there were a lot of different flavors of science. I loved the strange dancers who accompanied the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The story line was great. I desperately wanted Landsbury to keep the children early and stay with them with Mr. Brown, find the other half of the mantra so that the less heroic men could win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a kid inside, and this film appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is definitely my favorite at all times. I hope all children can watch this classic game and move it back to another time.
