Pitt turns into a cold-blooded performance like Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film seems somewhat dated now in 2003. It is certainly worth seeing for film buffs and fans of Bette Davis, but this appeal may not be great for ordinary movie viewers today. It was amazing for me to see how Mrs. Davis looked at this move. Actors turn into essentially sound performances and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well represented as Philip Carey, a medical student at the club. This film carries a powerful message about who we choose love and why. However, "from human bondage" does not seem to have a strong impact on mentally or emotionally. I felt a little detached and separated from the film after watching it. I have the intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going to. You judge! <br /> <br />
