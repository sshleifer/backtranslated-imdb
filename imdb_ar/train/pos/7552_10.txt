Cat SOUP is a short anime based on legendary Nekojiru manga. She won the "Best Short Film" award at the Sixth Fantasy Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Award" at the Japan Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When the spirit of small small Nyaako stolen by the hands of Death, Nita brother embark on a strange journey to regain. In the surreal dreamscape on the other side, they face many wonderful characters and wonderful and often annoying adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've never seen before. It's hello kitty on acid! It is very original and amazingly beautiful and has a great sense of strangeness and lyric poetry. Cat SOUP is very surreal (no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and glory. So it is anime for adults more than children (may not understand at all!). A wonderful trip for those who get a chance to see this absolute masterpiece. Must see!
