This film is the first of six notorious guinea pig movies which is one of the best. At the same time, look realistic and unrealistic, knowing only that the film is fake. The story revolves around a woman who has been captured and tortured in many different ways. A man at the beginning of the story receives a speech without a return address, and includes a video of the manga displaying torture. The men they captured test human boundaries before they die. Some scenes are appalling, like the eyeball scene and others do not scare you like a girl who has been punching 100 times, because you see punches in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of gaps, so I recommend this to people over the age of 17. <br /> <br /> 9/10
