Halfway through Lagos Coltay's "Evening", a woman on her deathbed asks a character who appears in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The line may be an embarrassing play, but the woman you're talking about is Vanessa Redgrave, who offers it quite simply. <br /> <br /> Again and again the film based on Suzanne Minot's new petticoats of passion and moderation takes on interest, offers great performances, and engenders emotional involvement like modern films. With just six months of the year, there are now two memorable, meaningful, and interesting theaters, and the other, of course, a film "Away from Her Country." She may have turned the "evening" Hollywood into a popular car with her husbands, mothers and daughters in life - Vanessa Redgraff, Natasha Richardson, Meryl Streep and Mami Gomer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in the film (with a sister played by Tony Collett), while Jomer plays the role of a young stripe, while the youth of Redgrave is Claire Danis. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Claus, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and a great team - yes, he could have turned into a multi-star platform. Instead, Coltai - the great Hungarian cinematographer "Mavisto" and the director of "Fatlis" - created a great work with the "Ihas Qari" group, the story that takes place in the high-society Newport environment in the days leading up to a troubled wedding. <br /> <br /> Missing links, false choices and absolute compliance with societal and family pressures are soap operas, but the quality of writing, the direction of Koltai and the increased non-egoistic representation of "evening" are higher than that, in the rare atmosphere of the English and French family series Of Americans) a century before its contemporary environment. <br /> <br /> The complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle, everyone encounters a clear and understandable and attractive. Individual tunes are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> However, with all the above mentioned on the collective and non-selfish performances, the stars of the "evening" still shine, Redgrave, Richardson, Gumer (new sexy find, look vaguely like her mother, but very different actress) , The Danes bear most of the burden - until Streep appears in the last minute, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson deserve the price of admission as well. <br /> <br /> As with "Away from Her", "The Evening" stays with you for a long time, invites you to rethink her story and characters, and reacts to her emotions. Within two hours, the film runs for a long time, but the way it stays with you is welcome among many films that cool long before popcorn.
