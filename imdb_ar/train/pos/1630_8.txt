I might be one of the few people who really stuck to this film. I also saw this film when it was introduced, and I agree with the last post that "Up The Acedemy" was too advanced for its time. The humor in the film itself is MAD magazine exclusive. I do not see why MAD stands behind this feature. He was also one of the few films in the early 1980s that had a killer who accompanied the soundtrack with the new bands and new wave bands that emerged from Los Angeles at the time. I own and play soundtracks to this day. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies out there. I do not consider that Burke is as funny as Up The Academy, there are some good laughs all over the movie, and jokes fall on any of the stereotypes or are placed. Hey, no one said that this would be Maltese Falcon.
