This is the best version (yet) you will see and the most realistic for Bronte's work. Dalton is hard to imagine as Rochester announced that Jane Eyre was "un-handsome". But his portrayal overcomes this and Zilk Clarke, as beautiful as she is, is also Jane Eyre complete and credible. This production is a long hour but worth it. There are almost direct quotes from the book in the text and if you want the first real "romance" in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this film and read the original text and read it again. Photography may seem a bit dated now but there will be no such thing before.
