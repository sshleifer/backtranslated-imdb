This film is a short cinematic masterpiece. The film is animated brilliantly through intense images that move sensitive scenes deeply. The film begins during the Spanish Civil War, where a group of children seek revenge from another child. In fact, they act in their world with a copy of what they saw in the world of adults around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults in a sanatorium. Here we see what life has brought to them. One is an isolated sexual suppression patient. Another man is a crook who has become ill. The third child, a young lady, became a nun and worked in the sanatorium. This film is a symbolic story about the impact of violence on the soul. <br /> <br /> This film has a climax that is not limited to the famous members of the audience, but it is logical and moving deeply. The representation is excellent and written well. There is a degree of music that provides a panacea throughout this film. This is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.
