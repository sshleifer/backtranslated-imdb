When I was in my mid-40s, I was not close to any of the main demographics of Nancy Drew, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon; so, I would say, the 60-year-old pair of silver hair was down the row from me. The older man who left the theater in front of me specifically praised the 20-year-old female initiative (she said she saw the movie the night before and loved it perfectly). <br /> <br /> More to the point is that in the row directly in front of me, there were nine girls - nine nine-year-old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn, hot dogs and dessert back and forth. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, they immediately settled to watch .... <br /> <br /> .... They did not start too much until closing credits started circulating. <br /> <br /> This is not an ideal film; it does not pay off well in its secondary plains, nor is it quite confident enough of its own accent, as thugs are just too far felt towards incompetence at times. The adaptation of the source material is, however, fundamentally respectable, as the plot is well arranged to some extent, moving subtly between the sins of excessive cheese and over-modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the film with amazing grace - despite the wonderful timing of Josh Flitter, this is Roberts' film, which she pulls beautifully. Her Nancy Drew is the direct grandfather of Christian Bill Veronica Mars, and the film is also a linear descendant of the early and obscure "Candleshoe." <br /> <br /> In the market today, it's rare: a family movie that respects the intelligence of its viewers. As such, it will not be for everyone's taste - but for what it is, it is the best movie of its kind in decades.
