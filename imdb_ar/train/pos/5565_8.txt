I love C & C, go back to their records, and I loved this movie, but at some point in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose, California, it was broadcast with an alternative plot line that destroyed the whole point in the film. All references to marijuana have been replaced by "diamonds". The "red" bag on Chong contains diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation is still the same ("... worth about $ 3,000 / pound"). There is also a sub-chart in which foreign sections are added aboard a vessel to observe the C & C, and talk to each other about getting diamonds. In the end, instead of "coke," it's something else. I'm not sure he created this version, but it was terrible and clear that they were trying to make it a friend / fit for the kid. It would have been better if this network had not been broadcast at all.
