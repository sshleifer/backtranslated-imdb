This film surprised me a lot. I did not have very high expectations but I was wrong. Mary and Roda were funny and well written. They have not spent much time rewriting the past so as not to depend on the success of the old TV show in the film. Overall it was very fun. <br /> <br /> My friend commented that this could be a regular event a week and I think I might agree with her.
