This movie star is a script. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language and social norms (we do not hurt women) and eye-catching policy. It is a reminder of Kosovo today. The precise pieces of motion scenes are present to the attentive viewer and the sequential choreography design of the process is remarkable. This film may come close to the essence of reality to gain the support it should have. It is like a stairway of escalating violence with a swift halt to peace and serenity between every step. Wonderful movie ....
