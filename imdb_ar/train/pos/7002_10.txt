Will Smith delivers again in a movie about a man of world weight on his shoulders and his campaign to correct his mistakes in a way that touches even their most cruel heart !!! Grant Neburt and Italian director Gabriel Mocheno meet and make a masterpiece that I highly recommend buying and keeping in your movie collection because you will never tire of watching / feeling this movie !!! I have the highest respect for Will Smith because he is not only a wonderful actor, but one can say that he has a real love for people and life which undoubtedly made him an ideal personality (the tax agent of Ben Thomas) who played in this film. You will find yourself feeling his pain, his anger, and his frustrations about his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who was wonderful as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact that their personalities were falling in love. Woody Harrelson also starred in Top Notch. I find it very difficult to write this review without giving up the main points of the plot ... All I can say is, watch it and when you make sure you do not have anything to interrupt, close the phone for the hook, sit down and get ready to start trying to uncover life The mysterious and past IRS client Ben Thomas ... Thank you for the Will Smith on another great movie !!!
