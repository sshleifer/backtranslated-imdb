Deathtrap is played like a play inside a movie about who did what he did to whom, as happens in one set. The hypothesis is that the prominent playwright, whose star falls, receives a wonderful script from a former student, so he plans to ward off his interests and the appropriateness of his play for his wife's (loud) protests. Or so you think, in the first half of the film. After the halfway mark, Deathtrap begins to offset the twists and turns that run its hypothesis on her head, then in the neighborhood, and then in a crazy game, while keeping his nickname all the time. It is an excellent mystery film soaked in wit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caen, a great playwright, plays his part in this film - a mildly British and very playful British. No surprises here - doing his usual good work. He has got the best series of Deathtrap, which he performs ideally: "What is your definition of success, have you gang in a state prison?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, blends comedy and drama into an amazingly powerful performance that plays the role of aspiring young playwright. He also gets to show his highly toned body, which must be kept in Superman films. <br /> <br /> Cain and Reeve collaborated on another film, one of my favorite comedy films - Noises Off. She also revolves around a play also, although Kane this time is the director and Riff is a representative. They were joined by veteran warriors Carroll Burnett, John Ritter, Marilo Henner (Taxi) and Mark Lynn Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they prove the calamities of the influential actors in the bed and the crew. On the surface, it seems that the film is often just a jerk, but when you watch it you find that there are many fine jokes that require more than one watch to catch. I wish this movie would be lightly available on DVD.
