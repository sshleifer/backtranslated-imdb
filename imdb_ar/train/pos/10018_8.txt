This night listener is better than what people generally say. She has weaknesses, and seems to have a gender identity crisis, no doubt, but I think her creepy atmosphere and her distinctive performances make up for it. It all sounds like one of the ghost stories "This happened to a friend of mine." There is a big complaint about the film speed: but the speed is slow and sometimes deliberate. All that unfolds in this film are kept in the range of possibilities, real life just kind of plods along? No? So there are no happy ends or broken signs of the earth, and no scenes of "confrontation". thank God. You should access the area when watching this movie, and forget your reservations and expectations about what produces a good (traditionally) film. Williams is not great, but he easily satisfies the needs of the story, in addition to being supposed to be somewhat generic ("no one") because it is "every man", an avatar that we get into the story. Tony Colette's performance should be nominated for the Academy Award (even if she has not won). Give her a chance. For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is definitely among the top 20% of the films that are being released these days.
