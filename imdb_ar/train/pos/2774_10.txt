For me movies and acting is all about story telling. The story of David and Pythashiba is a deep tragedy and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical narrative. In this film, I thought the storytelling of Gregory Beck and Susan Hayward was at their best. To understand and understand the story of David and his journey to become the King of Israel, this story is made more urgent. Gregory Beck showed the true human aspect of this man who was in his time greater than life. Susan Hayward fear, hesitation, but then obedience to his power as portrayed her beautiful king of her. One can also feel David's anxiety at his proximity to the fact that Uriah spent the night at the gate rather than at home. As well as grief when killed in battle. Raymond Massie's strong and credible conviction made me feel angry. The packages were real enough, and the atmosphere reasonable. In general, I think this was one of the best films of its kind. I gave him a rating of ten.
