This film was set to be better than average motion movies and in this regard it succeeded. This film has a stunning film featuring amazing mountain snow and highlands, as well as a very suitable Stallone also performing well, an intriguing plot, and a superb performance from the main villain because it will really shock you in its evil ways. The movie does not occupy a great position all the time because of the poor screen display. The plot and storyline of this film screams to make Stallone an extra special person, much like the characters of Rambo, Rocky or Bond. They chose to personalize Stallone's character in this character, which is fine, but given the style of the plot, he weakens the excitement factor. The dialogue was also cowardly and at times skittish. The text should have been more realistic and less "chatter". Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes. Filmmakers should have been more careful about how they deal with shootings and schemes. They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequence during the hijacking of the aircraft early in the film. They decided, after that, to loosen a lot of sequence of fire (TV series "A-Team") once the villains were overwhelmed on the tops of the mountains. This film had a lot of great potential time. The work sequences of Crisper, better dialogue and more passion / Rambo / Rocky style design from Stallone have moved this film to a higher level. I know this was not Stallone's fault. I mean the film director wanted to reduce Stallone's character and try to steal the film by relying On his direction which was not all that great if not for the cinematographer.
