In the sea of ​​nonsense that Hollywood (and others) continues to depress, this is one of those rough diamonds. A simple little movie is very fun and leaves you feeling that you have not lost an hour and a half of your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really wonderful in this film. I have never been a fan or noticed before, but I come back and see this early performance convinced me that she is very talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was important in a university course for me so I was skeptical and would even care. I thought, "Boy, dumb mop or silly women ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing many related topics, I will just say, if you have not seen them, do it in your favor and check it out. Sometimes, movies are the best life slides, and these are great movies.
