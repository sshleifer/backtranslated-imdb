WOAH! Is one thing I can say about this film. Personally I'm one of those people who love cats, so that was a big aspect of the film, but I loved how cats were avenged from all of them. <br /> <br /> I loved the film, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Kraus, who played Charles Brady very irresistibly, I think lust got better than me while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I was more disappointed. I saw Charmed by Brian Krause and married Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. In the Sleepwalkers, but very bad compared to watching kissing with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if the reason is that Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe a little more, this was the only disappointment in the film but I think it was up to Brian Krauss In the tight jeans he wore in the film. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing Brian Kraus as Holly Mary Combs as a heavenly couple and her son's father in a big surprise with this film, the boy was not like a corner. Although I am now thinking about it, it would be wonderful to see a Krause character on a charmed that was seized by evil, making him resemble his character in the Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> And I must say that the music was fantastic in this film as well!
