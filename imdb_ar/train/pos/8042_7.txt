**** SPOILERS **** The film "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of the legendary sniper of the US Marines Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. Mr. Mister Rogers, who is talkative and compassionate and looks like up to 300 confirmed and uncertain Vietkong and North Vietnam soldiers, is killed during his tours of Nam. He shows how lethal and effective the military snipers really are. he is. <br /> <br /> Tom Bringer is as calm and deadly as Sergeant Thomas Beckett, who reached the end of his career as a sniper in the US Marine Corps, but later realized in the film that life as a civilian would be pointless. Since there is nothing abroad for him that pertains to his skills in the US Marines unless he decides to become a mob killer. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a life-long professional assassin for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of "Sniper" focuses on Sgt.Beckett with the help of former silver medalist Silver Shooting and client Richard Miller, Billy Zanni, being sent deep into the Panamanian jungle. The snipers will rule General Miguel Alviraz, Frederic Miragluitwa and Colombian drugs Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alvarez, who supports him in a planned military takeover of the country. <br /> <br /> See earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett was a range and directed rebel leader who I feel was the best scene in the "sniper". Because it shows step by step how the sergeant. Beckett with the help of his quorum Cpt. Papich, Eden Young, does his work. There is also a sub-plot later thwarted in the film about the rebel sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who was hunting Beckett, who killed BabiÄ‡ while they were waiting to be taken out of the forest by a military helicopter. You might have thought that the cat and mouse killer was playing out between the two that would peak when the movie ended but the sergeant. Beckett had no problem whatsoever at sending DeSilva early in the film using Miller as reassuring as bait. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the most damaging part of the film was in the last fifteen minutes or so when the story passed from a film they shot on a sniper shooting Rambo. Beckett and client Miller are battling a whole battalion of insurgents by flying as thick as fog in London. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still worth pursuing to see the fact that he tells the story of someone who has not yet been charmed in the war movies: a single assassin who kills accurately and skillfully from the main diamond cutter or neurosurgeon performed and who does so in complete secrecy.
