As of this writing, "Halloween" approached John Carpenter from the 30th anniversary. I have since generated 7 sequences, a remake, a complete mess of tradition and every year around Halloween when they do those "best 10 horror movies" lists are always there. It is very amazing for a film that was produced with a budget of about $ 300,000, and included an almost unknown team of young talent coming. I can continue, but the big question here is: How does the film stand today? All I can say is my imagination! <br /> <br /> Pros: The sequence of credits is simple, but nervous opening that really sets the mood. Unforgettable and exciting to induce impact by director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Hawarth. Great cinematography. Astral direction by Carpenter who maintains a high degree of suspense, gets some brilliant shots, and keen not to show much of his villain. Good performances of mostly unknown actors. Good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary scary man. Lots of strange moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow, but steady and never pulled. Unlike most other abandoned films, this film revolves around suspense and terror rather than blood and a large body. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: They may not have been as scary as they were at the time. Many idiots really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite film in the series. I know this is not a popular opinion, but what I really feel. Yet it is truly an important film that continues to reach new generations of film aficionados. And because it has been renewed for a new generation does not mean that it will be forgotten. No, not how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
