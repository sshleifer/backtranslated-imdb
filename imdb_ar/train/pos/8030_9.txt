This was another great film for Tom Berenger .. But some people are right, it was like other SGT BARNES characters, but it was still wonderful .. Tom Berenger played a wonderful sniper in the jungles of Panama! Billy Zein was at first as he had with Corporal Abham from rescuing Ryan, but then got more anger in the end! Sniper was awsome and action buffs should be watching .. I remind you that he will not have a lot of actions like flick about the procedure reg .. I got this DVD too and it is excellent!
