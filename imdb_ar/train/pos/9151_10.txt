Savage Savage Island will scare the hell out of you! Trust me. <br /> <br /> When some of the tourists depend on a boy from the ravaged Savage family, Bas Savage wants revenge and will not stop at anything until he gets it. <br /> This is a real horror movie with some truly awesome horror moments. <br /> <br /> Also, the negative review comes clearly from someone who lacks proper knowledge of the film. Filmmakers chose lighting and camera work to reverse the mysterious and wonderful mood of the story; in other words, to get a certain aesthetic. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film won the SEVERAL Awards for Horror Awards.
