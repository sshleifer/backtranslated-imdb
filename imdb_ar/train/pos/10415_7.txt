Three of their quick backs present the main characters (Abu, Jaafar, and the Princess) who will interact with Ahmed; three are the songs, each associated with the same characters. Three times Ahmed uttered the absolute word "Time," in his declaration of love to the princess, answering her three questions at their first three meetings. An extremely powerful impression is that the princess will resist three attempts by Jaafar to invade her - through three successive tricks: deception, hypnosis, and erasure of memory. However, Jafar has what he calls the three tools that are inevitable to control women: Whip, power and sword. Three is the number of aircraft entities: mechanical horse, harvest, jackpot and magic carpet. The genie presents three wishes to Abu in the first of three encounters; the Genie laughs three times loudly in the mountain strait, and his three considerations about human weakness, before leaving. Abu overcame three obstacles in the temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant spider, giant octopus). Three are the tools of justice: the magical eye that appears to the future father, and the magical carpet carried by him in time to save Ahmed and the princess, the bow and arrow for the execution of Jaafar. There is magic in figure three, and there is magic in this film.
