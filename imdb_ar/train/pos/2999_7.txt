There were times when this film seemed more complicated than it was, but I think that's part of its magic. Philo Vance's powers of observation seem to be greater than all the Eastern events of the times combined when it comes to the final assessment of how murders are committed. Dropping the dagger in the Chinese vase was kicking for me. I mean, can not someone be just dropped? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had an early line of the film about Archer Ku's "psychic impossibility" to kill himself - I had to think about it for a while. I have left wondering if there is a scientific basis in fact to have this concept true, not after I have studied psychology myself. Sounds logical, but there is always a situation that does not fit the rules. <br /> <br /> As you know, I was expelled from the Criminal Investigation Judge (Etienne Gerardo), who reminded me of Dr. Star Trek. "I'm a doctor, not a witch," McCoy said several times. "I'm a doctor, I'm not an informer." I can film DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and say to himself - "I'll have to use it sometime." <br /> <br /> Once the identity of the murderer is revealed, this does not look like a big surprise, but even then it really is guessing anyone. But aside from Archer and Brisbane Kou, the film did not answer the main question posed by the title, the murder that I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas McDonald's dog Gili?
