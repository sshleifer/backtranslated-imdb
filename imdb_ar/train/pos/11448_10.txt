I first saw this impressive documentary in its first release in 2001, and it really had a profound impact on me, so much so that I listened to many of my friends to see it on frequent shows. Bottom line: None of my friends are disappointed (ever!). The starring film, Andy Goldsworthy, makes some perfectly beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in a temporary state of everything?). We can see Goldsworthy creates many temporary works of art, as well as some of his long-term works at major exhibitions around the world, as well as some pieces in the natural world, too. German film director Thomas Redlsheimer is directing, editing and editing photographs on the creative process, which is a real experience for both the eye and the ear (with an ambient musical score, composed and performed by Fred Fred, which is generally experimental music / About a band capable of musicians). Although this movie has been available on DVD for years now, you can find a cinema that highlights the revival of this wonderful film, by all means, look for it (it's easy to have a big screen, This film is really the right way). There is no MPAA rating, but it does not contain anything that harms it (unless the live birth of sheep on the screen is directed at abuse or inconvenience)
