It's clear that this short subject of Joe McDoux was clearly inspired by all the amazing Warner Brothers stars. Thank you, Lucky Stars, one of those who boost the spirits of stars in wartime. Eddie Cantor played a comedy role and will act as a comedian who wants to break into films other than Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon, who starred in Short McDoux, is himself and McDoux, who is just trying to get a break in the film. Like Thank You Lucky Stars, a few players with Warner Brothers have a free moment wandering around this movie. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon was sent through the central representation of a single small role in a World War I film, but like McDoux gets the message. The poor man feels the intense tension of his moment, and begins to think of ways to present his single plan. It may sound like a real movie star helps you. <br /> <br /> 86 Later on you take the wrath of director Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook who plays the role of a British soldier in finding a film in pro-poor film McDoakes. It's worth watching this very funny short subject that was nominated for the Oscar to discover what's happening to O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
