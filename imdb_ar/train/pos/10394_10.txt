A magical journey coined by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These giants of British cinema have mixed up some wonderful ingredients to produce a cinematic masterpiece! Some of the first of the stunning Technicolor, SUBLIME and the brilliance of the delightful musical Michele Rosesa as well as the young abundance of Sabo, the wicked Conrad Ved, the playful and malignant, the sound and sound of Jun Dobriz as a princess all worked wonderfully. Miles Malison, who plays the role of Dubriz's father, Sultan of Basra, wrote a wonderful ideal scenario. Do not miss this one! Since posting the comments above, I've got a recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I never saw the image correctly until this DVD version is displayed - the clarity and clarity are subtle and the colors so vivid that I was amazed - this can be seen as a stunning classic Again and never fails in the charm and delight of the viewer. Again, you should see!
