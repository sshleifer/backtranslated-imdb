If Lion King is a Disney version of Hamlet, Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a version of Disney's Guildenstern and Rosencrantz. Just like the amazing Tom Stoppard movie, we can view events from the perspective of two small characters of the original: Timon, the Meerkat with a tendency to break into the song at the hat point, and Pompa Pig with issues of flatulence. Following their story - instead of Simba - we get to know why all the animals were curled up as Simba was introduced from Pride Rock. We discovered what made Timon and Bumba decide to follow Simba to return to Pride Rock to take out the scar. And find out how they treated the hyena once and for all. Nathan Lynn has Timon as the best joker, but Ernie Sabella is as capable of supporting him as Bomba. It's also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Bobby Goldberg repeat their roles. Julie Cavner and Jerry Stellar give their voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is a quick start-up device that does not always help advance the story. Having said that, there is a wonderful approximation near the beginning of the film. With more laughter than any other Disney series movie, Hakata Matata is worth seeing - if only for a hot tub scene that is still funny though it is a bit predictable.
