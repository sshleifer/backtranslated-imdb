Other commentators have detailed the plot, social proverbs and comments (or better) that I can, but I would like to share the admiration of this little piece of the film. It is very well characterized after more than 50 years in each category - scenario, representation, photography, sound design, sound design ... It is really a classic of some kind. This was my first exposure to the "young man" Alec Guinness, and it is clear from the first frames that made him so special that he finally got the knighthood. <br /> <br /> I classify it as only "8" because it is a fairly lightweight basis that studies human nature but does not really distort it; and because the plot takes the easy way in the end, rather than resolving the conflict between the inventor and millers and industrialists who chase him All over the city. Also, reveal a few minutes of thinking about the basic flaw in the logic of the scenario - erosion or rupture is not the deciding factor in buying new clothes (especially clothing); children grow up, people change their sizes, gain and lose weight, go with the latest fashions all the time, The woven looms have long been woven. If there is nothing else, the manufacturer will reap the wealth of providing indestructible items for military uniforms (especially BDU units). <br /> <br /> However, this is a wonderful movie. If you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.
