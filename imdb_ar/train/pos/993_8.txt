In fact this film was not so bad. It contains motion, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy from the Green Mile), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jimmy Kennedy, of Scream and The Three Kings. Key characters were played by Jimmy Fox in the role of Alvin, who was both good and funny, but the person who surprised me was David Morse as Edgar Kleinten. He plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "The Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" plays a very sympathetic person, and in "Bait" almost the opposite, Without any emotions, which was good to see. The only really negative thing in this film is the many pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film seem a little dated. Overall I thought this movie was very good!
