Damn good movie! One is seriously underestimated. The children's songs in the film gave me a sense of their pain, as well as their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg performs well here, but the best performance during the entire film is the performance of the actress who plays the title character. I hope you are in more movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give it 10/10.
