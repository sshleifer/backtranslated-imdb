I saw this film for the first time at the Berlin Film Festival, and I have never seen cinema in Hong Kong before. I felt like sitting in the roller coaster: the motion was very fast, and there was not one dull moment in the film. She has martial arts, love, special effects and a wonderful plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks and sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes that emphasizes the extraordinary musical component of the film. This movie is a must !!
