Gina Rowlands plays the role of actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of a lover. She became increasingly deceived by reality, and as a result emotional disorders interfere with her work as an actress. In the sense that they violate all the rules of representation and wear everything, yet still able to engage their audience makes the film interesting (if it is slightly self-important) as a parallel to Cassavet's own struggles as a filmmaker. There are many ideas that have been put forward and as a result have become somewhat confused (I still think about the relationship between the dead fan and the Rowlands among many other things), but the way in which it is presented in its first form makes the film interesting and constantly interesting. It would be fantastic in a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
