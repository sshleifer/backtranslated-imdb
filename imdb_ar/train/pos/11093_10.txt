It's a wonderful little movie. I say "small" because it does not contain a hundred guns or dozens of explosions, as in John Wu's film. Fantastic shows from Roy Cheddar and the Three Bad Guys. It seems that John Frankenheimer has more luck with small products these days. It's very easy to watch the movie, and the yarn story is more than just a washing machine - instead of everything around it, things seem to get worse as the plot thickens. Fantastic end, very positive. I never read Elmore Leonard, but it can not be very different from the film because I feel like I'm watching Elmore Leonard.
