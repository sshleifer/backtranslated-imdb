Three girls (a full female media crew, including rebel actress Barbara Bach, no less) visit a small town to cover a festival, ending up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like a plague. I was a little shocked by the good-made, slightly experiencing some of the excess dialogue scenes and fairly thin plot line (does not succeed in hiding its secrets). One of the main themes in particular is very annoying (as in: the old shock material), and this is the basis on which the film thrives. The cinematography offers much higher level (compared to many films in the late 1970s / early 1980s), but what makes me recommend this film is really the height of the scene to some extent in the basement square. From the moment Keller Junior was introduced, his performance made his jaw open and did not close until the end of the film. A very pleasant surprise to see the actor Sidney Lasik (who was happily laughing in the film "Fly Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and is now completely flipped in the film "The Unseen") takes on a leading role.
