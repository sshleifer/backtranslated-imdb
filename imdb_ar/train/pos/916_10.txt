My Comments for VIVAH: - It's a perfect charming love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film brings us back to small pleasures such as the groom's and the bride's, who sleep on the floor, play games together, joke lovingly and respect each other. Vivah revolves around the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two people. Yes, central romance is naively conceived. But the romantic moments infiltrating between the next couple and stubborn resistance to modern courtship games make you yearn for idealism. The film concludes with the wedding and groom, on the wedding night, telling his new bride, who is suffering from burns: "Come, let me do your clothes" <br /> <br /> VIVAH - presents many good things - the beauty of arranged marriages, the beauty of Indian culture , The beauty of Indian women, and last but not least, an ideal idea for married couples waiting for marriage .... Play according to the rules! Simple but beautiful. This is a simple story .... no plot ... not a villain - as with most Soragat Bargatia films. Souraj Sidi is back to what he does best. I made the film with Confection. It is a very beautiful film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things about arranged marriage and family reunion 2. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good and has behaved very well. It has the most good sights - although I thought that the last half hour was entirely for witness Kapoor - who for change offers a staggering performance. I also liked to act by all the other ex. Shuti any Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Khair, Shahid Brothers. It seemed almost as real and recognizable as possible. Suraj Sidi received another beautiful family film from Maine after Pierre Kia, Haak and Hom Sath Sath-Hein. Chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Things like holiness in marriage / relationship, avoid engagement, mutual respect, care and space, waiting for "formal" marriage, and prayer / sacrifice for your beloved - all these and more get introduced in Vivah. There are still some good attendees who enjoy this film. Some people / the public are already excited after seeing them, and they are thinking about the nuptial marriage: this is a success if you ask me. It seems that AMRITA RAO - Awarded a representative of Vivah {result for a nice performance} Award DADSAHEB PHALKE prestigious for 2006 !! I accept it on this achievement Chalo, although the Vivah or Shahid or Amrita did not get any of the awards and other awards films; @ Least these interesting news !! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO- to show us the pictures of the Indian bride to be in its purest form and of course to Soraj Barjatya for best picture :) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapoor and all the others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today !! Imagine sharing the same legendary statue of Dilip Kumar .......... It's an achievement that does not mean !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - to take her career to another level with this award .... I personally feel - you should continue to make films only with Shahid Kapoor !! They make a nice couple and remind me of chemistry on the screen {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br /> Some of the points that I noticed, Few Items: - # 1 If you notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks very good because always wear traditional clothes. It gives every part of the essence of Indian women - in this film !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapoor looks like most of us - not quite ready for marriage or early marriage ... but PREM listens well to the wise talk of his father - his full confidence in Anupam Khair. In the end, "honesty" and "trust" are the key words he reflects in his first interview with Amrita. Most people may think that this first meeting with a stranger plus a limited time period is never enough to judge someone. But as I have seen in this film, I have a feeling - that two people make for each other they can communicate during his first meeting too, it's possible !!! # 3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or appear to be together. Unlike most romantic / wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine always sing / dance or nowadays - they do cheap things. But the beauty of each of these five chains: - characterized by restraint and innocence and respect for the other! # 4 I really liked the apparent relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH and Amrita Rao. Kinda films should highlight this indifference shown to girls / girls in some parts of India. # 5 romantic scenes between the lead couple is filmed very well - there are no cheap scenes, the songs are beautifully photographed! Words like "Jal", "praarthana" e.t.c. Will be the words of a ton of all the girls who loved the film :) Personally, I really admire the many dialogues in this film. # 6 Last but not least - the whole hospital scene where a martyr puts "attic" to Amrita when she struggles for life - gorgeous. These dialogues between the couple are very touching and u feel loved / I cant do without; it is a feeling of hats - !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness / chemistry of the screen on the LEAD pair :) :) * If you ask me: - Along with films such as Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH ranks among the best films produced in 2006. In fact - I think Vivah deserves the best show / business from Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those movies that pass through time / occult / style / crap !!
