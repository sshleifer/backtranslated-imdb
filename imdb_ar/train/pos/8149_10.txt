I watched this movie for the first time when it was introduced in 1994 and recently watched it was still funny. I do not know if you should have understood hip-hop in the 1990s, but that helps you. In the 1990s when NWA and Public was the enemy at the top, there was internal conflict within groups and members on their separate roads (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There was also the rapper you wanted to reach, who started making the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc.). This film makes fun of it all in a way that looks like a documentary film in fact. Cassie Lemonz plays the role of a year-long hubs in the life of the fictional rap group NW.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / Director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds) and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence), a group of top rapists who reach their world and raise their policy. This film is very clear in its depiction of the hip-hop industry in the 1980s and they make fun of it, but if you know rap music in the 1980's and 1990's, you know how true these things are - still on his own without the knowledge of hip hop , Still a funny film, and for all who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first parody movie, and this in my opinion is funny with the same cod In some respects, better than Spinal Tap, where Spinal Tap is a heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is rap music and hook-out songs as well, from the NWH as a group and solo artists. .
