This can be said to be the best performance for John Tao, where he managed to get rid of any personality traits of his Inspector Morse and bring a perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book to the TV screen. This is a good production that maintains its family appearance despite some very mature subjects such as the outbreak of World War II and the physical abuse suffered by the child. <br /> <br /> However, the relationship between Tom and Willie Young is the heart and soul of this story. It is wonderful to see this bond between the little boy who was evacuated from London and the angry old man who left him with a development - a real grandfather / grandchild. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this story was not painful. It is made with a larger budget with a more solid manager because it belongs to the big screen and is not displayed once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. Due to the correct guidelines, John Thaw will be celebrated worldwide and awarded numerous awards for his outstanding performance in this film. A great actor and a great role had to be honored more than he was at the time.
