This offer is great. I thought the two cases in which Paul died were very sad; I actually cried. But the other offers were fantastic. Kerry was my favorite character, because she was in the Dark Side. I also thought Bridget was funny because it was trivial. I also thought that the guy who played Kyle was really nice. I loved him when Kerry made sarcastic statements about everything. The guy who played Rory was nice, and Paul, who played John Ritter, was really funny. This entire television program is funny, and I hope they will continue to show it on TV. When they showed it on TV, I saw it every time it was there. The next time they appear, I will see them again and again.
