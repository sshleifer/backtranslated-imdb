This film was a big surprise. I did not expect much, to be honest. Greta Garbo first Hollywood movie? So what? It may have been harsh with the usual exaggerated facial distortions in which low-quality silent films often appear. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo must have shocked people in the studio as much as she was shocked, because this movie made her a star, she deserved it. I have instinctively understood the power of standing, or just carrying a meaningful expression for a long time, so that its effect can be felt and not seen only. I kept thinking about myself, how did this modern actress enter into a silent film squeak? It was only years and years before. <br /> <br /> The story was not interesting, it was the usual love story that was found and lost. Garbo's performance is only for Leonora, the poor girl in the village who makes good in the big city and then goes back to get the man who escaped, the one who gives her life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is fit for service, but his personality has never developed and lack of text. At a certain point, he was forced to wear Garbo's clothes, left in a gap, then returned heavily and returned. Let's not even talk about the terrible final scenes with Garbo and then his wife. Very normal, he did not have much profession after this and I can understand why. But enough as a somewhat mysterious object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> There's a perfectly cool line in this movie that says it all. "Leonora, it has become clear." Yes, already clear. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what's going on without seeing the whole movie, just watch the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo's sight alone sitting alone in her luxury car. "You must be very happy, have everything you want" - Yes, Garbo's face says it all about it. I must see this again, Garbo is amazing.
