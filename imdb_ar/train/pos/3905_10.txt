witty. Funny. Clever. Wonderful. I was flipping channels late one night ago years ago. He came across this and started the wildfire. I kept awake every night and recorded it for everyone I knew. Few. Like 3 of the nearly 100 people I watched, I did not think this was as wonderful as I did. The others laughed so loudly that they were crying and thanking me at the same time. Please do yourself a favor. Run does not walk. Watch this and enjoy. Intelligence and humor. It's a win-win situation. I wish I could have tea with him in the afternoon and meet the really rare comedian that we as a community need more .... sanechaos.
