Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of animation. The ingenious and artistic skill that characterizes this binary work is nowhere more than evidence in this cartoon. It is shameful that many people see only the violation in what was, and was always meant to be, a lighthearted piece of entertainment that in no way seeks to distort the image of blacks. If anything is a tribute to infectious humor and music of black sex. I have not been able to see these desserts for many years because the "race commissioners" in England were considered very offensive in a multi-ethnic Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would strongly like to introduce this masterpiece again. I think those who routinely look for messages and intentions that were not intended at all in these cartoons, which, after all, sixty years old, should try to lighten up and remember that the world has become a very different place today, but that does not mean that anyone He has the right to observe what can be seen from the past.
