"Kaabee" depicts the hardship of a woman before and during World War II, raising her children on her own after her husband was imprisoned for "intellectual crime." This film is directed by Yamada Yuji, and as expected, the atmosphere of this film is truly wonderful. Although the historical accuracy of some of the scenes, most notably the beach scene, is suspicious. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is unbelievable at all. I am puzzled by the way they managed to collect this 2008 star-studded film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, Japan's most active actress, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube was in a really nice supportive role as well. Asano Tadanobu was one of the most impressive performers, as he brilliantly portrayed his character and his difficult situation. <br /> <br /> The movies with prewar preparation are not something to me, but thanks to the wonderful directing and acting, I've completely absorbed the story. Also, it was not left-wing nonsense such as "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government persecution and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan. Excellent movie, highly recommended to all viewers.
