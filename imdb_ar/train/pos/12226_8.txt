This is the best dedicated TV movie of all time! I say this because I am a huge Silverstone enthusiast? Partly, but even without it, I still see it. I'm a fan of serial killer genre movies, and I think this would be a fantastic introduction to this category. Also, Mary Giordano is easily classified among Alicia's top five creations. Not quite memorable - like it really exists. I would put it on my side too, if there was a puzzle to solve. She plays the character, as she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. Looks sweet and honest and nice ... just as they are in real life. Is this acting? Yes, in fact, she is rebellious again. This time it's not bad, it's very good and a little afraid of doing things that look above the law. But she does not do the things the average teenager will do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mugs and solving crimes. Cliches abound: It is a kind of revenge for the death of her father, in a different way of vigilance. At the time, Alicia appeared to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a father, alone. This happens here too, but it's a little zigzag this time. It does not matter that she is still cool as a nerd. Check it soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why ...
