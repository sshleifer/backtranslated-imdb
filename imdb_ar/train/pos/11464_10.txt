The most disturbing thing about this film is not that school killings are the ones that actually appear, but the fact is that they are carried out by teenagers like Cal and Andre ... normal kids with normal families. Using the hand-held camera technology, "Blair's Witch," Ben Coco succeeds in bringing us to the lives of friends with some problems in high school, although we have never determined what is behind these issues. They seem typical - so many people hate high school, so what about it? Some of you do not think they will carry out the well-studied massacre on Zero Day. Surveillance camera scenes in the school are made more powerful for this reason. You can not believe it actually happened, and it actually happened. Hand-held camera technology also creates the illusion that this film is not a program film, a great idea given the subject.
