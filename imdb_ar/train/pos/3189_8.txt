This is one of the best comedy and music films I have ever seen. (Since I'm 40 years old now and I only see this now, I'm not an expert but I've seen all the well-known movies out there.) When there are many actors who get their lead for a few minutes at a time, comedy often interferes with the musical footage, and often intersects comedian musicals. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw this on TCM Europe, I was laughing loud! Who threw the laughs for me? Misha Auer gave me some of the wonderful bowel laughs, so he stole the end. It was great! Talk about it, I think the reason behind this movie is that although L & H is a selling point (and why you're hooked to watch this one (they and Hal Roach), I love them early Halach Hal stuff their own), and this keeps In the minimum and stays directly on the adult fare (according to the 1930 standards, not far from today's standards if you read between the lines). Jack Halley is also great to watch, and I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there, as I laughed out loud here in his meeting with the waiter at the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" woman in the 30 films that actually preoccupy me (there's something to tell me she was soaked in real life); the musical numbers have a real professional production quality (Busby Berkley'ish), which stunned me far from what I used to do in this genre . I could have continued, but be assured that I really enjoyed this film. 8 of 10 I saw him on TCM Europe and I will record it to see it again with my wife on TCM USA. Good things!
