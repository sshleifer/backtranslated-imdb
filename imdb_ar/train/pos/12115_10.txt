Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Given that the pictures I spoke were very new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was young and new. You have not yet found her own style that we expected. However, it is wonderful to see her this way - still learning the craft. <br /> <br /> Many of the cliches came from this movie, and this movie seems to set fire to some tracks over the next 70 years. My voice is his vision and remember how young this kind of film is. Keep and open your mind, and perhaps shocked by the extent to which the figures in this picture were disturbed, being in 1934, and how to look at the first part of the last century as tense. By negative others and one note comments.
