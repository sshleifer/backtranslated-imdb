This movie has everything. Visible Gags, Hidden Jokes, and play on words and verses. It revolves around a group of boys from a group of ethnic and social strata that unite to defeat a common enemy. If you see this more than once, you'll find that you're quoting it like Animal House (and yes, I love Animal House too). I put in the best 15 entertainment movies. The Major at the Military Boys Academy feels paranoid because every child is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this film be right). He is sad, indifferent, cruel and must be removed. A group of boys who do not come in at the beginning, end up as a team together to survive and get rid of the pilot through a wacky plan just for Mad Magazine. Must see - you will love it!
