This picture for me is very much admired because it is a spoof and a great fun to infiltrate foreigners invaders of the town and many of its men men. <br /> <br /> The city and all the players are decorated with a sort of 1950 style and the whole film has a tacky and strained feeling to it. Some scenes are as funny as the birth of a strange creature. <br /> <br /> All actors present a full, bloodthirsty and dangerous presentation that makes the film funnier, and special and foreign influences at least seem to me to deliberately rate 3 to add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> This type of film is often worth worshiping: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
