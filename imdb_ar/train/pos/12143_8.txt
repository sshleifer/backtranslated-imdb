The Great Movie is the best television movie about The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS device and I have not seen it in 15 years but it is still as good as it was then. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was worse, but the features that make this movie (and many old Chinese kung fu movies) are fantastic. Wonderful choreography and basic story. I have never seen the 36th room of the Shaolin, but I know it is the same film, but Gordon Liu plays the role of St. T but St. Anton 's return to room 36 is played by a different character. It has a lot of great comedy and kung fu value.
