Although this movie is very old, no matter how many times it is seen, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> A particular quotation mark appears in the movie. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) goes to the office and da gardens in a disabled place, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "Can not stand here, it's for the disabled." <br /> <br /> Danny replies, "I am disabled, I am myself." <br /> <br /> This is one of many lines in the movie that does not matter how many times you see it, I'll make you chuckle. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangrius stands in the top 5 comedy / spoof of all time. <br /> <br /> As an additional addition, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in Cast. So watch this movie and like me and like others who have seen it, you will be hooked.
