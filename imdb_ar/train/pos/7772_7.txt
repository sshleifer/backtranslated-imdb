On October 24, 1955, the geologist met hard at Hadley Oil Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) with Executive Secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of its President Bill Ryan in New York and invited her to go to a conference with alcoholist and son of Koleb Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) . On his way to the meeting, he admits that he traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy Kyle's reckless desire, who is his best friend since his childhood, to eat a sandwich from club 21. The meeting was just an excuse to Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle fall in love with Lucy instantly, and Kyle uses his money to vainly convince Lucy; then opens his heart and suggests Lucy. They marry and travel to Acapulco and Kyle is not safe to drink. Meanwhile, the sister of Kyle Marley (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and has an asynchronous crush on Mitch as a sister. A year later, Kyle discovered he had a problem and could be sterile and start drinking again. Meryl jealous poisoned Kyle tells him that his wife and Mitch have an affair. When Lucy discovers she is pregnant, Kyle believes the child belongs to Mitch and that his mistrust leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is an exaggerated melodramatic soap opera, with characters and artificial stands. There are at least two great films with characters who have trouble drinking: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with stunning performance by Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with a great performance by Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and motivated his character to drink shallow and clich√©. In the end, the forgotten "Written on the Wind" is an amusing feature only and never grants its Oscar nomination. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
