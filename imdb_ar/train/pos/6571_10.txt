<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I have Jake Speed. I've seen him at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies ever. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Cobbins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was abducted in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Along, comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), telling her exactly where her sister is and presents her to find her. Jake Speed ​​Champion. He does not work for money because he only wants help and good adventure. Followed by his partner (Dennis Christopher) around him and writing their adventures in the novels. This movie is a fantastic adventure. It's hilarious, it's full of excitement, it's wonderful. I think it's a cult film with a very small cult following. Crawford is perfect like Jake Speed ​​and expels some lines you'll never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also as good as the girl and his companion, respectively. John Hurt, the man who burst into the stomach at Alien, plays the role of a perverted villain who adds only to pleasure. This film is in many ways similar to the Indiana Jones movie, which is sometimes reminiscent of James Bond films. It might have been called the Indiana Bond, but whatever its title, it's a very interesting movie.
