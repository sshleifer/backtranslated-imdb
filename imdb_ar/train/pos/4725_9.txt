Although there is no logic in the story, Kill Shot is a very interesting film. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly depicts the emotional conflict between a father who works hard and a misguided son. Each member of the support team supports strong performance, highlighted by the clear representation of a young Asian man whose name I can not remember. The shocking dramatic end may make some young viewers angry, but Kill Shot as a whole is really a blow.
