The film begins very slowly, along with the lifestyle of Nabalmus, a participant in a photography service station. His wife was confined to her home with a bracelet in her ankle as a result of a deliberate burn. Wallace is a member of the voluntary fire department and takes fire fighting seriously. <br /> <br /> While watching Wallace's life somewhat boring, suddenly something new and controversial comes up: a carnival commuting to the city. One of her stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> Well Wallace. They are both motorists or "fireworks men," people who can start fires through mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret. Wilder lets his knowledge know what he can do. <br /> <br /> The spoiler: Some of their differences date back to the childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a homeless person. Wallace refrains from using his powers. Wilder wants to be shown to the public on national television. <br /> <br /> To complicate it, Wallace's wife Wilder, both dating back to previous years, wants to. It has become a source of controversy, and has become one of the reasons why brothers have in the end a literal battle. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun, but not loud funny. I think it's enough to have a copy in my library. It's a good good movie.
