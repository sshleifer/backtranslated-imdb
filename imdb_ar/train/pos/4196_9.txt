This crime film is somewhat similar to Noir's, although it changes the context from the post-war period to the Cold War and has something relatively decent about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street," police are good people, criminals are real men, and the only enemies are "Commies", who are ultimately distinguished from the good men in being emotionally elegant, driven by actual care for their own value, as shown In the successive close-ups of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around characters. The characters in this film are unique and fairly detailed: skip a pickup that has the stamina of any danger and sometimes while browsing their personal possessions; Mo Detective who just tries to save an amazing funeral, but manages to capture hearts and respect almost all other characters (And the public); Candy, the infamous innocent girl who only thinks she is doing a government job and does not fully understand the plot in which she is involved; and Joey, her ex-boyfriend, the wicked Commie baddie who tries to hide everything from everyone, Take a look at a group of very colorful supporting characters (like a man with chopsticks and policemen) and Pickup on South Street to give you the magnificence of characters as they look for mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames. <br/> <br /> - PolarisDiB
