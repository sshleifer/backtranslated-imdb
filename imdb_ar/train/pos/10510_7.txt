This is a suitable accommodation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors were fine overall but I found that Jeremy Northam was wet like Mr. Knightley, especially compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow was fine and her English was good but again, I preferred Emma Kate Beckinsell. There are excellent support offers from Tony Collett, Juliet Stevenson and Sophie Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script is often run a lot for laughs, and the book is a comedy, but there are many drama gags here, and also that Frank Stiel is a sub-complete subterfuge. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scene. It's very far from fertile. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans will do this. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed this film but I recommend that you adapt the TV more.
