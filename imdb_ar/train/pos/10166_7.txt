I saw this on an 8-hour journey (presumably because of the pressure and altitude) I found to be moderately amusing (focusing on "light"). <br /> <br /> The real idea behind the film was wonderful: a woman dies, her fianc√©e falls in love with someone else, and decides to make sure they do not meet, but eventually allows them to. Sadly, the actual film was not good. Well, there was some laughter and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning the plot was as predictable as the journey I was in. I think part of gay friends but not gay of the story could have been much better. The modern parrot was a nice but honest idea: it was not really funny. <br /> <br /> In short, the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me, but it was soon a call.
