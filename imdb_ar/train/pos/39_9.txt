This is apparently one of the first Shim shorts with the geeks. (This excludes his previous years with the Vodafone team). But the timing of triple comedy is at its best here. Apart from heavy scenes, there are other scenes that are smarter, but funny. Watch Larry when Shimb asks him to look at the camera for a shot. Or watch the real thing that excites Moe, "Oh ... very polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is in her womb. The camels may look scary, but funny in one way or another. He seems frustrated and confused by speculators like "regular" people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> For Shemp lovers, this ring is a must. Will not disappoint.
