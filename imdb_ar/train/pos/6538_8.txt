I really enjoyed this movie. I have succeeded in doing something that does only a few films; they offer family values ​​while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls. The young girls I was with enjoyed the film and continued to talk about Nancy when we came out of the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families, and I do not think parents will feel bored while sitting in the theater. No, he will not win the Oscars and does not offer great special effects or even provide an awful neurological mystery, but he enjoyed me and was silent to the spirit of books. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a little girl (you will love it!) Or any book lover. You will not be disappointed.
