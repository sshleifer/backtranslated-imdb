Thank God that this was not based on a true story, because it is a story. Full of despicable characters who do not know how to spoil borders, before the devil is a magical journey that falls into the jaw to a perversion that can be laughable (sometimes even with or perhaps because of - the tragic current of tragic human failure all the time) has not been carried out with such a wonderful conviction Overwhelming by its stars. The excellent scenario for Kelly Masterson and the wonderful direction by Sydney Lumette does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> The main flaw here is the nature of the family, with the two illustrious brothers (wonderful pictures from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawk) deciding to steal their parents' jewelry shop, a patently pathetic attempt. <br /> <br /> The story is listed in time intervals (seen on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before the theft", so no one should be confused); some people said they did not like this device, but I thought it Works well, which increases the versatility of the whole case, keeping in mind that the two brothers involved hardly play with full floors - between them can not make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throwing these anecdotes: One of the drug addicts brothers, married to Gina (Marisa Tome, also excellent), who has an affair with the other brother, tossed some huge brotherly rivalry, along with the fact that his drug addicted brother hated his father Albert Finney), who apparently caused him severe pain in the past, and you have a Shakespearean / Greek tragedy on your hands. Advance cautiously.
