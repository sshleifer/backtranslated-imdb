From the point of view of Robert Blauch, of Psycho's fame, four tales of twisted terrorism come in this selected Anicology, which, though not fun or enjoyable, as I wish, still provides some decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is linked to the closing story of the highly skeptical Scotland Yard detective (John Bennett) investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; he has been advised that this case is related to some other cases in the house where they all signed, and our film is on. <br /> <br /> The author of "Method for Murder" by Charles Helierer (Den Dylom Sarl) is haunted by his latest imaginative creations, which appear to have appeared in life. This sequence contains some good and somewhat distorted surreal moments, and is covered by a fairly astounding revelation. <br /> <br /> The horror symbol of "Waxworks" stars Peter Cushing as retired stockbroker Philip Grayson, who, along with his old friend Neville Rogers (Jos Akland) became obsessed with the images of a beautiful woman found in the Wax Museum. The most effective in this episode is the sequence of dreams, although it is always wonderful to watch Cushing. The final images presented to us in this story are quite shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweet Sweets" stars another terrifying star of horror, Christopher Lee, like John Reid, who does not treat an adorable moppet child Jean (Chloe Franks) with kindness, and is left to accompany a new teacher Anne Norton Don Porter) to find out why. The mystery of this special episode is treated excellently. Filmmakers do not make their hands wiser, so they come as a real shock as we get the whole truth of this unfortunate family. The moments of "death" are especially appalling. <br /> <br /> Abaya has the most obvious comedy in the four. John Burtoy, one of the many actors who have played Dr. Ho over the years, is very much fun as a horror film star in horror and temperament (in fact, the highlight of this story), which has angered him from the lack of quality in his latest low-budget films. Happy cloak has strange powers, which I dare not disclose here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a Pertwees companion. One great example of humor here is a blow not taken at all except Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The closing story concludes in a predictable but still effective way as investigator Holloway knows he must have taken all the warnings he gave him more seriously. "The House That Dripped Blood" is a mix of entertaining stories; although I do not enjoy it just like "tales from the cellar" Still enjoyable. Directed by Peter Deauville, moving slowly but steadily towards all his terrifying conclusions, which is certainly a good film of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
