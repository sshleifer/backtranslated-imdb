It's actually a funny show, done in a creepy way, like Tim Burton's film. It's worth a look, because it's more creative than most shows this season. Best of all, it is not a "realistic" offer. I wonder why audiences are willing to accept such performances (which lack creativity) and ignore such wonderful performances that already have creative creativity. <br /> <br /> While some deplore the hypothesis, I think it is really unusual. Much more fun than "Whisper Ghost" and "Medium". I think it's fun on the tube because "My Name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, the combo and the music are great. If you enjoy offers a bit far from the beaten track, I recommend it. This is not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it has become very relevant to him.
