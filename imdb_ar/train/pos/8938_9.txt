A superb film version of the best-selling book and a Broadway play about the life of Sadie and Bessie Delaney, two African-born sisters who have lived more than 100 years and told their story about a century of American history. Robbie Di and Diane Diane offer very good shows such as Pacey and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is as good as Amy Hill-Herth, a White New York Times reporter who published her article on Sisters writers, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many current scenes are very powerful, if not as inspiring as in the book. This is the only real drawback, along with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly presented, such as the interracial background of the mother of the sisters and why their father was staunch. But otherwise, the film is strong, good performance and excellent performance.
