Men and dolls are a unique game based on characters. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-class gambler taking a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money so he can <br /> <br /> run his usual game of play and get a fortune. The bet was that Sky would not be able to move any girl to Havana and Cuba and that the "doll" he had chosen was pleasant. <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons) who was in charge of the missionary. Finally bribe Skye <br /> <br /> Pleasant enough to go to Havana with him. They ended up falling in love with each other, but later accusing him of something he had no role in. Nathan fought the crap game in the missionary the night they went. Nathan Adelaide's fourteen-year-old fiance Nathan Vivienne agrees to gamble Nathan and tries to stop him from doing so. However, when the movie ends, everything ends happily with a double wedding <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are only wonderful regardless of who sings. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no voice to sing at all, and it's true that he could have called him a name, but that was not really important. He did a great job in acting (clearly seen as Brando) and played his character very well. I've seen some movies with Jean Simmons and I thought this film was her weakest film, and she could not sing at all. However, the singing consists of Frank Sinatra, Vivienne Blaine and Stupie Kay. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were in original production <br /> <br /> Broadway from Guys and Dolls. Vivienne Blaine had a wonderful voice and had the perfect Adelaide. If you love music, even if you do not like it, I would advise you to watch it.
