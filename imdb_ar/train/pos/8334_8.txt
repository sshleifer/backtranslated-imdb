It has been an interesting experience doubling. For some reason, the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century was not the main character in the film *. The closest thing I can think of is that the movies with Einstein are a championship for the game Caesar, where (like "deus ex ma-china") the great man hears a point in a radio program, until Ronald Coleman proves the correct answer after all , And in BULLSHOT, where Albert the Great was one of ten physicists and prominent scientists who took cannabis by the wicked and planned to steal some of their machines. It is worth mentioning that in these two cases, in IQ, we deal with comedy. So far, no one has tried to make a serious film about Einstein's life, such as John Houston's attempt on one film on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. I think it is very difficult to introduce the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electromagnetic field theory into an exciting dialogue. But then, just three years ago, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer performed beautifully. Perhaps no one has actually tried. <br /> <br /> (Then, after I wrote this, I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo Serious about 10 years ago, but that's an exception and it was a parody.) <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the actor who plays the role of Albert the Great. He was Walter Mattahow, where he took some time here from his film series with Jack Limon in the last decade of their career. Matthau was a representative of high-powered and talented characters, both in comedy and drama, but his comic characters were often variants of "The Whiplash Willie" Gingrich of The FORTUNE COOKIE. They were connivers and gonifs. Later, they gave up their criminal tendencies because we grew to love them, but they remained angry. But Albert Einstein was really resolved. Kotch looks more like him than Willie Clarke. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Albert as a good Albert. It seems that Einstein of Matthau lives in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and sees a stinking professor named James Moreland (Stephen Frey). But Fry needs repairs and takes them to the car shop where Ed Walters works. Rubens drops to Ryan, who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment he likes. With the help of his three friends (Le Jacoby, Joseph Maher, and Jane Sachs), Albert Al-Saleh decided to offer their help to Rubens and make him an unknown physics physicist. This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan, provided that Ryan is impressed and does not spoil Fry things (as he hopes to do). <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is sweet, as is the case when Matao and his friends manipulate up a super physics test that helps Robbins fool (by switching their body positions). The plot eventually leads to the blatant lie that Robbins created a nuclear-powered missile ship that brings the nation's interests to the figure of President Eisenhower (Ken Curtis). <br /> <br /> A charming comedy, an interesting stretch of Matau because it was not overly as usual, but it was quieter.
