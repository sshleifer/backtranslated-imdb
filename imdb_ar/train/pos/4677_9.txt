I understand that this feature film is debut, therefore, it is very impressive. She has a sense of rhythm of "real indie," but director Todd Yellen clearly has the visionary and editorial vision, leadership and judgment of a mature and experienced professional. The footage is well framed and well thought out and works to convey the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon offer a much deeper story and a lyrical poem than typical "paint in numbers." It is a story that needs the personal talent of Judith Hersh with a caliber to get a chance to work. Wonderful existence as usual. As well as Scott Cohen and Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliott Corti, who plays Adam Groden. Yelen managed to convince the young actor to take out a role that could easily be devalued by stereotyping or overtaking. Anyway, I found the movie refreshing and entertaining.
