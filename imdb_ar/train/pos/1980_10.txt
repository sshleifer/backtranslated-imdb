One of the last great musicals of the 1960s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it has always been a favorite since then. The musical numbers are all memorable. In the 1960s, people who were already represented in musicals had musical talent (unlike the current CERTAIN Music Academy Award nominated in a large Western city). All the main roles were fantastic ... Ron Moody shines like Vagin, as well as Shani and Alice like Nancy. Oliver Reed Bill Six was threatened (who fortunately did not have musical numbers, lol), Mark Leicester as Oliver and Jack Wilde where the Dodger was also wonderful. Mark Leicester just happens to be innocent, which Dickens meant when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers performing "Think of Yourself", "I'll Do Anything", "Who Will Buy" and "Count Soon", many children! This is a great offer for the entire family.
