I watched this delightful Japanese feature film at the Roger Ebert Festival, which was ignored for the fifth annual film at the Virginia Historical Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although this English-language movie is dancing in the dance floor, the film actually shows the world outside Japan how rigid family structures, employment (salary) and entertainment still exist in Japan in the era the talk. <br /> <br /> The writer / director Su Masaki [follows the Japanese custom by introducing the last name (first name) first and the given name [the latter] is used as a subject that is not very popular in dancing in the dance hall to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [Also, I will not use characters in the movie when world readers are not familiar with Japanese official names that may be confusing. I will refer to the actors <br /> <br /> in their professional representative name as listed in the Internet Movie Database.] <br /> <br /> Helping his wife in real life, professional ballet dancer Cusacari Tamiyo in her first country, and so far , Only the animation. She is a teacher of dance in her father's dance studio. However, her real ambition is to compete again in an international dance competition that was ineligible in the past. No, I will not say "why". Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. He is a veteran of about 25 films since 1979, and he performs superbly for a businessman in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> He has a beautiful wife and teenage daughter, and has just bought his wife's house. <br /> <br /> However, there is something missing from his inner happiness. Watch this movie to learn how to become "involved" in hall dance and secretly go to lessons <br /> <br />. Most dance characters are released from the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure. It is friendly, warm and attractive. Of course, this contrasts perfectly with how Japanese society is organized through the philosophy of "the place for all and everyone in its place". <br /> <br /> The movie has many funny moments. The 1,500-person theater pioneers burst into spontaneous laughter during many comedic moments. This proves <br /> <br /> that the comedy does not have a foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant as well as Ericko Watanabe. They are funny people. <br /> <br /> One can buy and read a university book about Japan's life structure, or you can watch this wonderful movie and begin to understand how the people of Japan grow up in a fairly solid community structure. Watch the movie "Are We Dansu?" Is a quick indulgence in further study and watching other Japanese movies <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's magic, it will make you cry a bit, and your heart will warm. <br /> <br />
