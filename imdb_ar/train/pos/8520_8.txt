I thought the film was really good. I enjoyed acting and moved well. The director seemed to be really aware of the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget that will be released today, and obviously they have a lot of money to throw it but they were enjoying it. When you see a movie like that with a small budget, you have to take that into consideration when you watch it. There were some things that could be better but most of them related to the budget. The acting was quite good as the F / X performance was fantastic. He was a couple of the most prominent players who played the asst camera. And the boy who played the child. I've kept this kind of movies working in Los Angeles, and this has turned out to be OK.
