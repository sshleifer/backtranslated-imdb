Henry Bromel has done a great job with his 2000 film "Panic", which includes his selection of William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain and David Duffman. Bromel filmed Ullman and Ritter in unmistakably funny roles, and abnormal selection is a welcome change compared to what we usually see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of a successful man, Alex (Messi) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). However, he and his wife (Ullmann) and their son Sami (Dorfman) are a typical family in the suburbs. Not satisfied with his life, Alex is looking for help from a psychiatrist (Ritter), told his mother only (Pine). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell) who is immediately attracted to her, further complicating his situation. His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he will kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a deep story about a thin and gentle man turned into a murderer by a father's monster, with his mother's knowledge, who kills to please his father but also can not stand up and resign. His anger is so deep that he has lost his emotional attachment to everything and everyone but his son - and finally, it is his son who wakes up with it through lifelong repression. When it comes to the "panic" movement, it moves - quickly. <br /> <br /> "Panic" does not seem scary at all. In fact, moving very slowly. But it moves slowly not because it is badly made - deliberately slow, reflecting Alex's psyche slowly emerging from the fog. By deciding on Sarah, the character of Campbell, and seeing his mark, his psychiatrist, as a living being, a person breathes, Alex begins to establish links between what he does and who he is and how they do not. Belly Dance. The difference between the two can lead to another psychological loss, Sami. <br /> <br /> William Messi offers another wonderful show, like a loving father, a distant husband, and a cold killer, the child of two children. Monsters who have never cared about their feelings or desires, and the man who finally realizes that he has to go up to the painting or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> This is not the type of drama that plays well in the cinema. They are very mature, very small, very hidden, character-driven, and very good.
