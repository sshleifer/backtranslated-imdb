I'm a fan of Simon Bigg's character and I've seen a lot of his films so far and none of them have stopped laughing. You did not do how to lose friends and alienate people. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically about a good man like pissing people. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevent him from doing things that might make him famous. But in the end it ends up doing, and the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of humor, romance, good acting and also a bosom dance. It's one of those movies where you can be happy when you're done.
