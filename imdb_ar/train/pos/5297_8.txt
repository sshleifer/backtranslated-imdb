I went to see this movie with my brother and girlfriend. The place was very crowded, we all laughed hard and it was easy to miss the lines. I knew it looked good but it was funnier than I thought it would be. I loved Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed as strange as ordinary people, if that made sense. I'm fed up with movies showing that teenagers are like cookie cutters, like "jock", "geek," "cheerleader," etc. Both cases were unique but still very human and natural enough to relate to them. I will recommend this movie to all my friends and wait impatiently to be shown on DVD, go to watch this movie with your friends who can laugh at the most extreme parts of life! I plan to see her again in the theater and I do not go to see things more than once.
