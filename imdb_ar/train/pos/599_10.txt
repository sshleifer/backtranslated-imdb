I really enjoyed this film because there was real sincerity in acting. The writing was first class. James Arnes is a wonderful actor and I showed him here. Brian Keith was bigger than Davey Crockett, and could anyone play Davy Vives Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this move was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Ana, a tinker and complex person who led Mexico in turbulent times. <br /> <br /> While some believe the film was slow, it captured the battle as it unfolded, and many of the things that followed a few hours of horrific horror. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this film is that it made you think about an issue and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. In this day and age when no one stands in favor of anything, I found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you felt about politics at the time.
