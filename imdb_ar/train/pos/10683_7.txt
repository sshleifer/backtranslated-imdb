It's a silent film better than average and still worth watching if you're a fan of silence. However, if you are not a fan of this type of game, I suggest you try some other movies before watching this movie. That's because the plot looks so old and hard to believe in the sites. But, though, it is still a good film and kept my interest. <br /> <br /> A sad lady accompanied the wrong man and fled to marry him. The film begins five years after he realized that he was a truly savage thief. However, she tries to make the most of it and does not talk about how good life was before this shiver came to her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She became a personal tailor to a wealthy lady trying to change her husband's business deal. Unfortunately, a lady who was trying to reach a potential client with her for a gala dinner can not do it and is paid to sew generously to be a man's date. Well, like Cinderella, well cleaned and the man fascinated by it! What are you doing now - given that she is already married and that the new villa wants to marry her? Well, watch the movie yourself to see how everything has been resolved. I did not like the way they treated the husband, because he seemed predictable and in words. However, once out of the way, I admire how the film will not even give up a mutual ending and leave the film with a few loose ends. <br /> <br /> All in all It's a very good movie to watch, but it's certainly not great.
