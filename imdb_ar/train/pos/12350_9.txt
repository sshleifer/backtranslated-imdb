I'm not sure how I missed this when I first came out, but I'm glad to see him finally. <br /> <br /> This film is located in and around the 19th century red light district of Okapacho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution and the systems of strong classes and women in a society based on the power of the samurai code in Japan. <br /> <br /> It's Akira Kurosawa is unique! Although he died before he was able to take out this film, he adapted it to script shows. His view of the Japanese world and class system is famous and sheds light on how these systems interact with each other. Characters may rotate around each other, but the caste system remains the same as when each character returns to the world to which they belong. The fight against the Samurai, who is drifting into the world of the good-loving prostitute, goes back to his life, while embarking on another path with a man who is part of his class system. Many believe the Samurai world above all, but so far, it is the lower class who can support each other and who can love without being caught. It turns out that the samurai in this film is a weak film, while lovers of the class that do not classify them as honorable. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves a higher rating. It is the story of women's survival in feudal Japan. During this time frame, men were believed to be survivors ... of the powerful while women were thought to be just weak and sterile property. This film highlights the power of Japanese women, how they did what they had to survive, and how their strength enabled Japanese culture to continue as it was. <br /> <br /> I recommend The Sea Watch to anyone who likes Akira Kurosawa even if he is not impressed. It is a beautiful, quiet, and sustainable film of the soul, a film worthy of praise for any group of films.
