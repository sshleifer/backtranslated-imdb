We tend to forget that the context of Mr. / Slave in the past centuries leads to more than good real estate, run by large groups of bonded people, a lot of money for white owners. This leads to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from the intervention of the slave owners with their slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children became more slaves, while others were free ... but free and colorful, which at the time meant nothing else, for many of their children. <br /> <br /> A class formed around these offspring - the sex of men or people free of color - and that category was able, to a certain extent, to own property, lift themselves from the oppressed to the educated, and achieve the dignity of relativity. This means that they were not slaves, but they are still fairly exploited. <br /> <br /> Often women have lived as mistresses for white farmers and wealthy men who have been held in house ownership with allowances, paid education for their children, and a kind of kindness based on the respect they chose to impose on their families. In essence, they practiced prostitution to ensure their prosperity and their relative independence from work - an arrangement called the Plage. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a beautifully written story about the children of one of these women, the result of such an arrangement with a local man, and people who have touched on their lives, in a negative and positive way. The story was eye catching for me, the New Zealand, without any real perception of the black / white lines, let alone that gray area in the middle where gens de couleur libre was crushed with great caution. <br /> <br /> The characters are very 3D, and have been well presented in this composition of the novel, by Anne Rice. The parts are wonderful, the costumes are fantastic, and the brutal way the lines are drawn, where the blurred areas become more distinct because of the conflicts the Ansar is going through. The sex men could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even those sympathetic, could not face the economic reality of the people who depended on them properly. <br /> <br /> I recommend this story, both novel and series, to everyone without reservation. If you can not deal with the truth, you will be humiliated and dressed in some parts, because injustice after another is met by colored people, whether by white oppressors or by their people. Keep in mind that this is nothing more than a fact, and this story is a way to get to know it. <br /> <br /> I know it may sound harsh, but these series pleased me and pleased me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth as it happened, and I enjoyed it completely. See this. If you do not read this period, there is a lesson to learn from all this.
