Julie Waters is superb and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very warm, very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications caused by gender dysfunction and the cause of sexual transformation in the life of a young executive. At the heart of this film, there is a real truth that you must accept before you wish others to accept you.
