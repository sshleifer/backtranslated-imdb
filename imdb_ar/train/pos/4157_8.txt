Early Anime was a fairly good film I once saw on Science Fiction when Anime was very popular here in America and it was not the disaster of labels that adult swimmers claim to exist on the animation network. I honestly think it's less connected to being less common and more with the fact that people now prefer to buy DVDs watching episodes that are cut online. Although this film probably did not have all of these cuts and the audio work was okay for the Mdbalij film, although I prefer to watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some disturbing sounds for children in anything called a name. This film shows an up-and-coming boy riding a train called Galaxy Express in the hope that he can reach a planet with the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was savagely killed by a robot hunting for pleasure. During his adventures, he became a friend of many workers on the train, as well as a woman like his dead mother, a beautiful woman named Matil, and because she with most women in anime movies have a secret that can really be good for our young hero, or really bad. It moves from one planet to another, where the train stops in many attempts and encounters a space pirate named Captain Harlock who starred in his own animated series, so Galaxy Express occurs mainly in the universe. All in all a very good trip with a strange ending and somewhat unexpected. There would be a supplement to this, but it was not quite as good as this, but the finish was a bit more than it was here.
