Now, many may think of moving away from this film just for the title. If you do not have a stomach for gory movies, what do you do reading this review? Anyway, I raced a video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie right away. This film is full of fascinating gaps, in addition to other usual ingredients that make up a movie that reaches the hell of the viewing experience!
