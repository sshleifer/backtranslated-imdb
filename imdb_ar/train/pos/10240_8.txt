Genre: Dinosaurs, Animation, New York, Travel Time, Circus. <br /> <br /> Main characters: Rex Rex Dinosaur, Elsa The Winged Crawler, Dweib The Parasarolovos, Ow Traceratops, a boy named Lewis, a girl called Cecilia and Captain New Eye. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Willley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stupid Clown), Felicity Kendall (Elsa), etc.? <br /> <br /> What happens: Some dinosaurs (see above) have been fed "brain grain pills" and are now grainy and friendly dinosaurs will be nice with children. They go to New York, with big plans? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this is a nice animated film. Animation of Dinosaurs When you go lovable and friendly it is a bit flexible and not good, but it looks fun the same way. I love dinosaurs when they are friendly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I love (almost) all the special characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like other characters as well. Overall, I love this movie so much! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: People who love good animated movies, people who love dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circus is not always what it seems? Enjoy! :-)
