This is a very light-hearted comedy about a wonderful family that has a son named Pecker because it is used to pick his food. Pecker likes to capture all kinds of people's photos in a small suburb in Baltimore, Maryland, and can attract the attention of a group of art lovers from New York City. Pecker has a nice sister who simply excels on sugar and is already addicted, and takes teaspoons of sugar from a bag. There are scenes of men who brag about the blocks in the knight with the milling movements and the girls do the same thing. It's hard to keep your mind out of this gutter, but who cares, it's just a movie to give you some laugh from a simple picture made in 1998.
