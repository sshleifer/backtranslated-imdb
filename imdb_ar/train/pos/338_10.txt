I saw this film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival and I had the privilege of interviewing both the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of them lively New Yorkers. The title of the film in Amsterdam was "Keep the river on your right", making the love side of cannibals less prominent. Equally important was the loving and gay relationship of Tobias Shennbaum with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. I have not included it in nearly 80 years of age and taking the inevitable is very moving. I can only recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is just pedestrian.
