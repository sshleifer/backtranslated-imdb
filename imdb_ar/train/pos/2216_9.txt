Historical drama and a story of adulthood involving people free from color in the pre-Civil War New Orleans. It starts slowly but grows stronger once you identify the main characters and the real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because they were free. Perhaps they did not have all the rights of the whites, but they certainly had greater control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. In this story, young men and women must make their own decisions about how to live their lives, either to subjugate them to corruption or to live optimistically and contribute to their society. I enjoyed all the characters but my favorites are Christophe, Ana Bella and Marcel.
