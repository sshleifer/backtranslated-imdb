Yes, Giorgio, a wonderful movie. Some romantic music, wonderful music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a wonderful food battle), a little sweet and sour taste are ingredients Yes, Giorgio. No orange movie will enjoy this movie. Those who need huge special effects, should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little escape from time to time, how better to do it, than with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? Must see!
