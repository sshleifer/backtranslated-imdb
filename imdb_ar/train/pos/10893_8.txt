It is good that the movie is rented before seeing the rating of the scenes from this site. It was a great movie I would add to Christmas choices. The actors were well chosen and Ben Affleck plays a leading role. I would like to tell viewers who have not seen the film to go ahead and buy it. I rate it right there with the Christmas holiday. The film was very funny and well written and Ben plays rich rich people very well. The things he says and does are just how I imagine someone who has a lot of money to do. The movie is more entertaining than The Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks. Plus it contains a good story story and teaches the true meaning of Christmas that you can not buy love with money.
