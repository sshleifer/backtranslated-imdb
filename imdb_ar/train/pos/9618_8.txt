I bought this movie recently and I do not feel sorry for its existence at all in fact, I'm very happy to get this movie to add it to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film director, spent less than a month filming and spent about a million euros to produce this wonderful film. This proves that large productions do not only make great films. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie fits perfectly. In the computer language BUG means a program error that causes feedback in computer functionality. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also wonderful moments of beauty. The mundane events in this film begin with the death of an error. A man witnesses "crime" on the other side of the road ... From there onward everything becomes complicated ... <br /> <br /> Point to John Carroll Lynch ("Fargo"), Alice, the man who can not make all Nothing is true at all.
