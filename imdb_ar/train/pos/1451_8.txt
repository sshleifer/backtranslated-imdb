I've seen this movie about 6 times now. Every time I see her, I am more impressed with the story and the acting. It's like watching a train wreck being in motion. Hidden in their approach, but they are very effective in achieving their goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the middle of the story, there is a very beautiful split. On the one hand, our leading deputy, Eddie Calhoun (Kusak) is inadvertently tearing up the old boys' network that is a leading fuss in New York's administration, and on the other hand our mob leader Zapati who is deliberately trying to maintain the status quo by all means necessary. This situation is well crowned in the end when Zapati ordered Silmu to ease himself up by killing himself and ordered Calhoun Papas to do the same, politically. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains some really great fonts. Like (my personal weakness): - You do not summarize a man's life in a single moment - the only new thing in this world is the history you do not know <br /> <br /> All in all A great movie deserves a much higher rating.
