I was reviewing some of my old VHS tapes and watching John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. It made me go to my computer and look for it to see if I could find a copy of the DVD to buy this offer. I was disappointed not to be able to find them yet on DVD. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have a record and a CD but I would like to buy a DVD version of this offer. The tape is old and the image quality is good but fade, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also some other songs that are not placed on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and for Muppets songs, the DVD for this show will be a really good seller. If you do not have the CD, they are a wonderful collection of Chritmas songs taken from this show. The album is also good if you can find it and there is still a registry player to play it.
