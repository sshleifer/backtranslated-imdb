I thought the movie "I Do They Do not" was fantastic. In the past, I saw Rob Estes on "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" as well as Josie Bissett at "Melrose Place" and loved seeing them together again in "I Do not Do". They have a wonderful chemistry together (I think marriage in real life helps that!) - In the film they are both widows with children and professions and fall in love and try to mix their chaotic families together without dropping the ball. Of course they stumble, but they keep them together, which is what work and family-raising are about. Many people have talked about this movie - everything is good! - We left the film wanting more. This would make a wonderful series - attractive to many ages! - It would be wonderful to see a real life, on the ground, showing the family like this, which depicts the reality of much of our lives today - instead of the so-called "Reality TV" which is flooded by all stations days. Someone told people in the ABC family that they had the start of a new series here!
