A romantic romantic comedy about an Irish widow who plans to marry a man who is comfortable with her (Danny Aiello) until she gives up his angry brother (Nicolas Cage). The script is sharp with lots of great fonts, wonderful acting, accents (I was told) are the perfect character and beautiful cinema. New York never looked good on the screen. Sher and Olympia Dokis must be seen in the first place - they are fantastic and deserve the Oscars. Beautiful and funny film. Must see!
