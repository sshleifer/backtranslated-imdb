The first Visconti film features both its elegant visual style and refined taste, accompanied by attractive displays from Massimo Gerotti as the perfect drifter and, best of all, Clara Kalamaye as the frenetic Giovanna. He made it several times as "The Postman Rings twice" but never improved. I can not believe that this was the first movie for a man! It shows someone's trust at the height of their career.
