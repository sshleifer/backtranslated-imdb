As a Pokemon fan I enjoyed this movie very much. Pokemon introduces a new mythology (as every film does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. However, I do not expect to be enjoyed by non-Pokemon lovers (including most adults). Some lines were anomalous, but this is somewhat inevitable when dubbing into an English film. The animation was beautiful, although the parts did not look good. Although the villain is kind of a riot, I think movies have done a good job of cycling across different kinds of bad guys, and I guarantee you that they are not all like these. Those who do not like them, I say to each of them, but Pokemon lovers will love him.
