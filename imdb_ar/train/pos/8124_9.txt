Apart from the big film METROPOLIS, this is about the oldest pure science fiction film. While the film is sometimes preaching and representation can be wide, it is a wonderful film for two reasons. First, it is very original in terms of style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films I can think of as similar. Second, the special effects at this time were very spectacular - using heterogeneous panels, models and massive crews to create stunning scenes for both the post-apocalyptic world and a vast tomorrow city. Sure, you can sit and film modes because, according to today's standards, the effects are just that. But, you should be aware that this was the latest that happened when the film appeared in 1936 and must have really surprised his audience. In many ways, the groups look very similar to the "modern cities" that appeared at the World's FAIR exhibition of 1939. <br /> <br /> I think the film is also interesting because it seems torn by the question "Are they really stupid or are we destined for greatness? "The end result seems to be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> Last note: I saw this twice on TV and shortly before the video. All three-fold sound and print quality stank - especially sound. If this is available on a DVD, we hope it is cleaner and will provide an optional caption. Due to the continued sound in the video, I really appreciate this!
