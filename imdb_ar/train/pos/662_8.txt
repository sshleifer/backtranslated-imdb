A second part of the rotation axes can be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, the choice is great. I love the way that the first and second episodes are only involved in intelligence and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The second episode is very funny, very silly and very fun. It's the first Christmas episode, about a woman tormented by a serial killer wearing a Santa costume after she killed her husband. Just like the first episode; Karma. <br /> <br /> The most spiritual scene is a tie between her husband's death and her phone call, first to frighten her fear to become real.
