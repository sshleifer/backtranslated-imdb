Normally I do not like the series at all. Everything is predictable and tend to become boring and boring very quickly. <br /> <br /> However, this series played well, and the story follows all the episodes, and even if you miss one, the story will keep your mind in mind. <br /> <br /> All episodes are filmed in a hospital and take you to the secrets of old and ancient secrets that lie just below the surface of the great hospital.
