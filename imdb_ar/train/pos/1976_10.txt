The man who brought out "The Third Man" also produced a sequence of "Who Will Buy" in "Oliver!" Now this is the talent. <br /> <br /> I raise my hat to Carol Reid. <br /> <br /> I know there are "second units" involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> He had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> < > I assume that the quality will end. <br /> <br /> (In the final scene with Nancy, you must see Oliver for the first time at some time.) How many lines do I need to write? <br /> <br /> Encouraging people to write too much should not be encouraged. I hope this will be a "line X".
