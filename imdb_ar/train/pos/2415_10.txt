I am totally addicted to this show. I can not wait until the week passes to see the next show. It's a great story and has the best actresses and actresses at the show. I will watch every week to see it even if I'm not at home. I always set the video recorder on the monarch cove video. Simon Rex is the best actor in the show. It's interesting and exciting. I think this show has to be kept on the air and I think everyone should set it to watch it. I saw the first episode, and in fact I did not see it but I was watching life one day and decided to watch it because it was running and I loved it completely, and now it's my favorite program. I really mean it.
