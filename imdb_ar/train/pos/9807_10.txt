I remember this series well. They have been excellent - strong and convincing characters, elegant and exciting ... and different from everything else presented at that time - and now ... I'm sure they inspired the excellent Canadian drama "traders". <br /> <br /> Season 1 and Season 2 are available in the UK's DVD 2 area. It's fun to watch the series again. <br /> <br /> The first season is 13 episodes and the second season seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to be over after two seasons. <br /> <br /> This was a very enjoyable series. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, you can get them specifically on Amazon.co.uk
