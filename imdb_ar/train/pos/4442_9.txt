Ogre is a film produced for television in Italy and was not intended to be a complement to demons. Even Lamberto Bava mentions it in an interview on Sheirk Show DVD, but Demons III called it part of the Demons series. The music in Demons and Demons 2 was rock music in the 1980s, while the music was more creepy, while the first two were evil horror. Devils III: The Ogre is an architectural horror, so Devils III was not a suitable sequel to the demons but I still like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is creepy and adds a tone to the castle that is set in the movie, The Ogre is another thing why I love the movie. Two other films have been classified as Demons 3, Demoni 3 and The Church (Demons 3). Devils III: Ogre is a good movie as long as you do not compare it to Demons and Demons 2.
