This film is one of the many Kung Fu films made in Asia in the late 1970s - early 1980s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue, and fast martial arts movement. But unlike most movies of this genre, it also contains a decent plot and lots of great comics. When the dyeing factory workers are forced to leave their jobs by Manchu, they employ a fake artist (Gordon Liu) to try to intimidate them. When his attempt fails miserably, he spoils his way to the Shaolin Temple to learn to fight for reality. Instead of making him a student at Kung-Fu University, the teacher instead ordered him to build a scaffold to cover the roofs of all the 36 rooms. Well, it turned out that while doing these inferior tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles), he learns skills to become an expert in Kung Fu! The command is similar in karate kidd when Mr. Miyay teaches Daniel the basics of karate by making him do routine household chores - "wax, wax" and so on. There is a lot of great comics from start to finish, and a lot of work in the end when Gordon confronts again his Manchu torturers. "This time it's not just tricks, it's the real thing!" Leo announces, proudly hit his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you do not want to miss this movie!
