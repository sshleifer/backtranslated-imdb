I really enjoyed this episode which was a big surprise because of the bad reputation I gained. From the perspective of exclusive writing, the "16mm mausoleum" is a wonderful treatment, with a wonderful dialogue and analysis of characters, a sterling model. In particular, I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgence of the episode, dealing with the themes of existence and reality, balancing with more psychological subjects such as denial, pride and desire. The "sixteen-millimeter mausoleum" is an episode of how these ideas, based on the unwillingness to accept change, can alienate someone from the rest of the ever-changing world. It is also a wonderful example of the Twilight Zone of the brain; one explores the mind rather than the outside world. All these elements combine very well together to create exciting and impressive thinking for 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, the ring is free of its flaws, which lie mainly in the shoes of Lupino and Leisen. Ironically, I felt that Lubino was not convincing all the time, with only a few sights that could be considered memorable. This of course is an absolute disgrace given how well a sterling character is in writing. Moreover, it seems that Lizen does not know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes making them stand by and not doing anything - which probably explains why he accepted the poor performance of Lubino half the time. Fortunately, Balsam does a good job of covering many of the weak points, helping to recover the offer from a representation perspective at least. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, if you are a fan of classic film and sci-fi, this should not be bad that sometimes happens. In addition to the writing I mentioned above, the episode also shows some wonderful photographs (I am still amazed that the show looks good after almost fifty years!) And a sufficiently adequate design. Overall, the "16 mm mausoleum" is a wonderful episode, and above all, certainly an event to think about.
