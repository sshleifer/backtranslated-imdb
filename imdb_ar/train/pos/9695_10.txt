Some people may describe the film "Paulie" as a children's film, but I would like to stress that it is more than that. Perhaps more than anything else, this film stunned with great success to show the plight of immigrants in the United States - topical in the light of recent discussions. The film depicts a parrot telling a Russian immigrant concierge (Tony Shalhoub) about how he is looking for America for his original owners. The film tells several stories. There is the elderly woman (Gina Rolandz) who endorses it, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin), and others. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a very good movie. I usually do not expect much from these types of movies, but this one is fun. Definitely recommend it. Starring Jay Moher, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Halle Eisenberg and Treni Alvarado.
