Perhaps the closest to the Dickens storyline. Although I find that young Ebenezer is difficult to monitor (who was the idea is that poetic period, surely they could have done better!), Scott does a great job like Scrooge. Directed by the delivery of some lines of Dickens finally to life for me. Edward Woodward is all we expect and more than the current Christmas ghost. I find JC Scott Scrooge much more credulous than the current version of Patrick Stewart. The scene on Christmas morning when Scrooge realizes that he "did not make a mistake" is enough to convince someone that Scott knows how to act against hyperactivity. It's huge here. Almost an incredible cast. Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is hard to look at, it's almost too sweet. Still music and landscape make this a whole holiday watch. Enjoy!
