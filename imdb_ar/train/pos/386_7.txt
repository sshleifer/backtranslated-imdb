The art of Tsui Hark is visible in this film. Unfortunately, the terrible representation of Echin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt like strangling her while watching it, it was bad) made it difficult to see it at times. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real achievement in the visual section. When I saw it for the first time, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought to myself that I had not seen anything as far away as that, but so should be done to achieve full justice for the legendary world of Chinese Kung Fu novels! Without a doubt, this is one of the best Chinese Kung Fu epic ever achieved. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Tari Hark did not improve much in the writing section, and the story and the dialogue are rather events (not his apparent obsession with the mysterious and exaggerated portrayal of the wicked). To make matters worse, this film is a very bad cast. They decided to use Hong Kong's "hot" popular idols as prominent figures, but unfortunately, Ekin Ching, especially Cecilia Cheung, was not well suited to the historical Kung Fu drama because it lacks the nobility and ambiguity that these characters are supposed to embody. Adam Ching Siew Chao and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 best version without borders. <br /> <br /> I hope that Zhang Yi Mu and Tsui Hark will be able to unite and produce a film with visual art from Tsui but with mature poetry and the story of Zhang ...
