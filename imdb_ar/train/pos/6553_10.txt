It's a refreshing psychic when a film actually gives you a story story with a beginning, center, and end, a beautiful, intelligent puzzle, with an attractive heroine of all ages, who wins us with her intelligence and charm. Andrew Fleming's film is actually a modern marvel, and a return to the good old storytelling that was the norm in Hollywood. He puts too much reliance on the special effects that are now undergoing entertainment and gives us a wonderful film, with a highly capable young actress and talented support team. However, the props may be different, the heart is still a good mystery, and there is a clever puzzle here, linking the traditions of youth and contemporary nuances. Emma Roberts is an old-fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are largely missing from today's movies. They are still good enough to get the boys interested but they also know how this balance represents self-esteem. She earns her medals through hard work and does not fear showing a little guilt when her goals are needed. <br /> <br /> While on holiday to California, our heroines are drawn to the mystery of the Hollywood actress who was the victim of a foul play; suddenly "visited" by her ghost and this triggers a series of events that may solve the mystery or lead to something appalling to herself. What makes the movie quite enjoyable is the small details, where it discovers that its customary world is nothing compared to the California scene, and is well presented, without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or sexually explicit. In the end, the director has sufficient control to make him palatable to all types of audiences, from young to adults in the audience. It's a movie worth watching, appreciating and enjoying, a rare and sensitive film, and it's not afraid to be rated as fun! five stars
