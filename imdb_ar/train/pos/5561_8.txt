Well, needless to say, this film will only attract a certain audience; especially people who are similar in thinking. <br /> <br /> However, if you are one of these people above, this movie should be. In fact, I think it is necessary that supermarkets sell a copy of it to anyone who buys the first pong. What is the holy grail of Monty Python is the morbid and the morbid, as well as the film to the rude. I saw this movie for the first time in 10 years or so, and I still watch every time I watch it. Jokes make fun of vulgar lifestyle, much better than the last day's crucibles such as half-baked bread. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, so to speak; the film is more than a set of different plays. While the film heroes are walking around Los Angeles in their legendary fog. However, the film enjoys an excellent sense of speed and never draws. Many people quote "Best in Smok" as the best work for C & C, but I must say that "The Next Movie" is the best. <br /> <br /> So, if you are in the mood for an hour and a half of eastern laughter, light up, adjust, let your mind float away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, TOMMY CHONG FREE!
