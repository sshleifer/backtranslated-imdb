This is not because, since her days in Clarissa Explains It All, she has been very shocked by Melissa Joan Hart, who was popular at the time in her twenties, but still capable of the roles of adolescence. "Sabrina, the Teen Witch" was the next big hart jump after the days of "Clarissa". Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spielman is - I guessed it! - Teen witch trying to balance her exotic magic with the requirements of daily teen life. She is assisted by her aunt and a wise black cat as she moves from high school to college, and finally to her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is a heart-soul show. "Sabrina, the teen witch" is very moving and very funny, and it's a shame that I took a long time to realize how wonderful she was. I wish there were some newer episodes that we can all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
