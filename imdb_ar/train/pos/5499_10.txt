I had no idea what the facts were. As I remember this position, I accepted the information provided in the media: a confusion about a questionable personality: Mr. Chávez. The film is revealing many facts, and I wonder if anything of this caliber has been made at all. I assumed that the protagonist is Mr. Chávez, but everyone who appeared in the photo <br /> <br /> was important, and in the end, the fact was that entelechy: the people, overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
