I really enjoyed the fighting girl. It's something I can see again and again. The acting was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film. Very convincing I might say. The film shows how women should defend what they want to do in life. She had a lot of sympathy and hatred at the same time. Dealing with Abu Jahl did not really help her. Although he loved her, he was really hated. Her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in this role. The story of love was a part I really enjoyed in the film too. I felt the passion that y had for each other. Then the drama sits again and then chooses between her boyfriend and her long dream. I thought it just ended right. It was the end type where you have to decide what happened in the future for them. And all of you people who love a movie based on a sport with a good plot, I suggest you check it out
