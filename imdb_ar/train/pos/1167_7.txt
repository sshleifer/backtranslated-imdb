Alan Dillon is in a quick and confident retaliation from the cruel crime family he used as a successful man in the film "Big Guns" by Duchio Tessare after they accidentally killed his wife and child. Tesare and scriptwriter Roberto Gandos and Hugo Libertour are taking part in the film "Minute of Prayer and Second to Death" and Franco Vercucci from the film "The Ring of Death", which is armed from a professional gunman to the mob and down to the wire. In fact, "big arms" are fairly predictable, but they are still eligible for strong entertainment with a lot of brutal and often sudden killings. Alan Dillon of "The Godson" is nonsense because he systematically treats death to the heads of mob families who refuse to allow him to retire so he can enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" plays the role of a Sicilian crime manager who wants to bury the grudge with Dillon, but the rest of his fanatical colleagues want to die. Like most crime novels in the 1960s and 1970s, "big guns" support cinematic ethics that are not driven by crime. Interestingly, a man who has nothing to do with killing a wife and a hero's son survives while betraying the other hero with extreme prejudice. Tesari is not wasted again in these 90 minutes. Regardless of the death of a mother and her son in a car bomb dedicated to the father, the worst thing happens in the yard of saving cars when the hero's partner is crushed in an annoying car. Ostensibly, "Big Guns" is a fairly bloodless walk, but has a large body of the mob's Milodrama in 1973. At the last minute only, the protagonist left his guard, and so the false morality of the eye remains intact. Tessari is chasing several hunts from the decent car and the death of the Don in a train running through a tunnel of bloody trains as this violent yarn gets. Photography and compositions are excellent.
