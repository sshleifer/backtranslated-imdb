The beginning of the mid-1990s was a high point, in my opinion, for historical drama. Rob Roy - Last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - has a special passion and intensity in their respective time periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and wonderful taste for a time and place rarely seen by the film. It's really everything - interesting story, great representation, wonderful dialogue, and scenic scenery. I was particularly impressed by the apparent real dialogue. I can imagine that this is the way people spoke in the early 18th century and acted there. <br /> <br /> Another thing that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it more disgusting and shocking, although often more accurate, than most of the films in modern times. The film had a lively and sexually charged feature, which was unique and likely to be in the context of the times. <br /> <br /> The speed was too narrow, barely a dull moment. There were a lot of conspiracies and political subdivisions that complicate things a bit, but did not detract from the main story. <br /> <br /> The work was also very good and overwhelming. What I will find wonderful forever is that during the feature piece of work in the film, there is no soundtrack at all. It is a very sequential and exciting series, where we have no musical evidence about the direction of the scene and the accuracy of clarity. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be at the top of the list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
