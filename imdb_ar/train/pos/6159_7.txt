This place is in England during 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want them, but they take them reluctantly. She seems to be studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Magic. (Well, I realized that this is a family movie, but - College of Magic ???? !!) before she could finish the course despite the closure of the college because of the war (???) and she seeks down Professor Brown's head (David Tomlinson). She and her children are walking on the bed with the help of a magical bedknob. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time when I was nine years old and I remember his vagueness. Definitely do not hold up as an adult! The story is silly (even for the imagination), the children are horrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly hateful. Also Roddy McDowell is the third billing and shows only in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the island of Naboombu run by moving animals. I thought it might be fun but the animation is bad (for Disney) and it has a very violent and long football game among the animals. There are few sincere graces: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just wonderful. The songs (while forgetting) are enjoyable; the long dance sequence on the Portobello Road is colorful and full of energy and the Oscar-winning special effects are still impressive at the end. But the weak line of story, the weak animation and the unwanted children pull this out. I heard the extended version is even worse! I can only give this 7.
