This wonderful little movie contains all the elements that made Spaghetti Western very exciting and fun: great music (by one of the few ... if not the only composer ... working in this genre, Nora Orlandi), exciting thriller series (and very vicious rings) For today!), Beautiful scenery and collections (everything in Almeria, Spain, of course). She also has a very good story with her tragic romantic edge. Actors perform wonderful functions - with a truly outstanding performance by Laurence Dubkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most important roles for females in Western macaroni .. outside the cardinal in Leonelio "Once in the West in the West"). Without posting any spoilers, let me say that this movie contains one of the best endings for any movie I've ever seen!
