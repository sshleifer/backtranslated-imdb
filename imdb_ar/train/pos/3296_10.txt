Mina Kumari offers more elegance and grace as soon as you move from standing to sitting on the floor more than you can find in most other movies. The director produced more memorable scenes than the beauty of touching more than seemed possible. Music and dance are of the highest quality possible. You may notice in the first scene of the dance that the director has all sorts of things happening in the background: another girl dancing, drunk on the stairs, a lot of activity, but he knew we would watch Minna dance and I'll bet unless I saw this many times, you did not notice. All in all, perfect. JQ
