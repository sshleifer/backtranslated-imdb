It was a coincidence that I was scanning TV channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful people who were attracted to each other in a way that was innocent and innocent. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV series (Nicole). This man and man will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts with a man or sat in your depths and loved him over the years. Jesse and Seline have a wonderful conversation, and a deep eye connection with a big magnetic explosion between the two. I look forward to SEQUEL for this film in 2004 and if you have watched this movie, you will feel the same way.
