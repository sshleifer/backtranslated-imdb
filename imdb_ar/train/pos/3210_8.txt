The soldier is not as bad as many have done. I found that the film contains some sarcastic humor such as those in the Paul Verhofen squad of space forces. The lack of dialogue and excessive overwork is deliberate and adds to the atmosphere of the comic book. <br /> <br /> The game featured certain idiosyncrasies for me - Todd bears the names of several tattoo campaigns for the space war. D on his chest One of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For those who forget there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the elegant lines of Roy Batty in the Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside Android forces like Roy is at least puzzling. Maybe the scriptwriter David Bibolins was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I'll give this one out of 5.
