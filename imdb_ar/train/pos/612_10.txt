This wonderful film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while comparisons with Princess Bride are inevitable, it is futile to do so. While both films combine great intelligence and humor with a fictional background, Stardust is quite different from any other fantasy / science fiction I have ever seen. It is a hybrid mix of these types, but its layout and text are very unique - along with specials, special effects, cinematography and result - the final product is not simply anything comparable to anything that ever appeared on the silver screen. Second, the result is extremely effective in attracting us simultaneously to the story and the imaginary world in which it occurs and pushing the story together, creating the appropriate amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters are present. Thirdly, I did not find the film remotely difficult or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main sub-points made them actually more exciting to watch. The cast was superb and acted superbly in all areas. This fantasy adventure (with elements of science fiction) was the best adventure I have seen since the "Return of the King" (not that I compare the two at all). Well, so it's not easy to summarize it, but do not let any fifth review and / or heartless and farce or pathetic public relations in the film prevent you from sharing the best time you can spend in the movies this summer (or even maybe long time ago)!
