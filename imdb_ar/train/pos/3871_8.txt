Esther Khan is a young Jewish woman living in a Jewish quarter packed with Jews in England in the 19th century. It is surrounded by brickwork architecture, looming, bleak, uncluttered, worn, narrow sidewalks and streets, dark windows, hordes of black and white crowds. <br /> <br /> She lives in a small apartment with her large family who run a clothing store inside the apartment. When she was a child, she was working, she had no privacy, dressed in colorless clothes, shared her bed, and remained silent to avoid the irony of her mother and brothers who mocked her for simulating them bored. <br /> <br /> A young woman, whose life remains the same, has no privacy, lives in a state of mental and physical palpitations, inertia and inertia. She exudes an empty expression, unmatched, wears casual clothes and is constantly persecuted. The gray buildings, the mundane, the huge, the narrow streets, narrow passages, narrow entrances, her mother and her brothers loudly, and the lifestyle of her family. <br /> <br /> Her only form of mental escape is the Yiddish Theater. Sitting on the porch, the front row, leaning on the rail, there is a vast space between her mind and stage, an area that allows her to breathe, think, feel and yearning. <br /> <br /> Despite the freedom of thought offered by Esther's open stage, her face and body remain sleepy, violent and emotional. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix's simple and brilliantly shared appearance on Esther's magnificent appearance - Summer / Esther - reflects a desire to want anything or expect anything. <br /> <br /> After an extraordinary explosive encounter with her mother, Esther finally decided to be free of the gloomy life that besieged her. <br /> <br /> She is eventually in small parts in a few plays, and meets Nathan Kellen, portrayed by the ideal British actor Ian Holm, who begins to teach Esther the artistic skill of acting. <br /> <br /> From this point forward, Esther begins a double arduous journey to learn how to act and learn how to feel. <br /> Experiment with emotions you have never felt before, and begin to gain the experience you need to fully understand and enjoy the technical aspects of working. <br /> <br /> Nathan walks through the theater through physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-hatred, etc., and then begins to walk through these emotions in her personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three facts, Nathan says - the reality of the personality reaction, the fact of the actor's reaction, and the fact that the character and actor are not the same person. <br /> <br /> These three technical steps and three realities slowly break up Esther's defenses and lead to two adorable experiments at the end of the film, which marks the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement and passion. <br /> <br /> Esther Kahn is a technical film that is difficult to see because of the camera's strange and narrow portrayal of the camera, the blurry direction of the mysterious setting of the Jewish neighborhood, and the Phoenix summer, which does not characterize an irrational and unattractive portrayal of the mental, physical, . <br /> <br /> A movie to watch for people who want to learn the art of acting and people who appreciate illnesses and personal studies.
