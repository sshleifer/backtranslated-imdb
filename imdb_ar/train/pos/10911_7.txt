I enjoyed this film in 1936 with many veteran classical actors, especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mr. Roberts", who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was married to Jean Arthur, (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and got divorced and still able to live with each other as well as fighting all the time. Paola wanted her husband to investigate a murder and did everything in her power to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a very strange thing, there are a lot of comedy movies of 1936, and the killing method is something you will never believe, especially with the knight on the California racetrack. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) "King Kong" gave a great supportive role in the role of the teenager with James Gleason, an investigator who needs help from Dr. Bradford to solve the very strange murder mystery. If you watched this movie, just remember that it was produced and released in 1936, and people in the audience in those days thought that this was a wonderful entertainment and really was in those days!
