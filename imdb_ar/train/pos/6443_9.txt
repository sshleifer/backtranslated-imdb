Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. I was recommended by fried several weeks ago. I have not seen or even noticed it before, because it usually falls into the category of "Swedish film" and those who tend (like me) to produce Hollywood tend to doubt any foreign films. What a hell of a leap! The film, because it keeps my hope, makes the human race a better way. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all the regions on earth where people live together - dominated by religion, misunderstanding, lack of courage, predictability and savagery, but also the ability to enjoy, meet and sing ... It takes a move from outside to break everyone's masks To feel that we are all human beings only with the desire to live our own lives. I can not stop seeing stories like this, because it keeps my hope as described above. The five minutes of Gabriela's song, including her performance, is one of my most memorable films ever! Thank you Kay Pollack for these five minutes only, which made me happy!
