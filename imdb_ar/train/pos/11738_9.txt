Elvira, Sir Al-Darrak (1988) <br /> <br /> Directed by: James Seniorelli <br /> <br /> Starring: Cassandra Peterson, The plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) left her television program and headed to the small Christian town of Falwell to collect the legacy of her dead aunt, hoping to get large bucks to open a program in Vegas. Unfortunately for her, all you get is a creepy old house, a dog, and a magical cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira is trying to make money, breathe some teenage life, win the heart of a nail (Daniel Green), avoid being burned at stake, and keep the cookbook from her scary uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard), who plans to use this book To end the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love Xandra Peterson and I am the Egoer. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman and as Elvira she is all very turbulent and na√Øve, not to mention that she has a wonderful pair of ways. In this film, its charm is used well. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie "Out of Water" as a whole. I've got Elvira, with her short black dress, her big black hair, and her huge twins, in a Christian town where most girls are not allowed to wear make-up. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Green) more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is just as great as Aunt / Elvira Vincent, to steal the book for its use in evil. He has a lot of presence, but he is still unable to track and steal scenes from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What makes a film a reality is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything from the usual jokes to the horror trick here, makes me laugh more than anything else from the sequel of SCARY MOVIE. I hear that there are about 56 stupid jokes in this film, and any fan of watching the films of Roger Korman B - horror will love the deception in this film. <br /> <br /> If you like Elvira, you'll love this one.
