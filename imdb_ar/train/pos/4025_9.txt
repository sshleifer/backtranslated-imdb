Wonderful. At first, I thought that given Amrita Pretam's communist tendencies and the national film of Duyevi Meul would be more explicit than the novel, but when I read the novel I was surprised when I found it to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Marita Pretam for not being a second lie and Dr. Doevidi to be objective. This film touches on a sensitive subject in a sensitive way. The victims of any war of women as some poet said this film embodies. It is also a sad comment on the Hindu psyche because they can not stand up against the kidnappers of their daughters or the Hindu brothers who can only burn their fields of torment. On the other hand, it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact the reason for the abduction of girls in the first place. I think the hijackers thought they would kidnap the girls and they would become legal owners of houses and thus the new government. They will not be able to ask them to return the houses. This is apart from his greetings to the bravery of Boro and Bahai, two young girls in a simple village who are not offended by the outside world and risk every attempt to try to return after being abused. Since there were many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that women need to understand the pain of other women.
