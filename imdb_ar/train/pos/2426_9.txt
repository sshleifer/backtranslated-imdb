"Once in a lifetime" is a very good film. However, they are not good for everyone, because of the intensive use of vulgar language and violent attitudes. The film is able to represent "life" in neighborhoods near New York City where drug problems are unexpectedly important. This photography, in turn, is used as a decoration for the most impressive and disdainful dramas supported by powerful dialog boxes (however, I have struggled to understand some of them because English is not my native language.) There is some exaggeration at times, but I think it fits well with the general direction it has given Vishbourne's film, which gives more importance to reflection than just a good practice of style, especially in time management / animation. Marsalis If you are not very proud, you should enjoy watching this movie once or twice or three times.
