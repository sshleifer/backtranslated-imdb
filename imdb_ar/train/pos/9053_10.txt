1.) This movie was amazing! I saw it while I was in the town next to the town where I grew up! I went and saw the buildings where the story took place. In general, I loved this movie, one of the best Jake Gyllenhaal !! Also, my favorite part was the Science Fair, and at all times with his father. They were very sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream, and apparently his father did not care one way or another. This tag line is correct. "Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to light the sky." 2.) The way this film was filmed was impeccable, it was reasonable to have been recorded during the 1950s. The dress was delicate and they had a colloquial down too. Definitely recommend this movie!
