Some players thought that the sniper was not good since it was not good enough. Well, if you consider it a movie, this view may be quite real because the movement part of this procedure is not really exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama and not an actual drama. <br /> <br /> The film basically told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely have different characters and different experiences. Thomas Beckett, who was a veteran of 74 people, seemed to be very hard-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his dream today in Montana, we can see the softness clearly at home. It was the cruel war and sacrifices of his partners that made Beccket become called the Cold Heart. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Millar was a newcomer, a green hand, and was not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zannie did a very good job of showing the hesitation and fear of Miller when he tried to "put a bullet in his heart" for the first time (as Becklett said). What he thought of the suicide task was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely return and receive the prize. <br /> <br /> These two characters were quite different in their personalities and I think the film showed the difference and impact they had successfully brought to each other because of their different personalities. These two snakes fight, suspect each other and eventually reach an understanding through communication and what they do to help even save the other. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good film but a good psychic one.
