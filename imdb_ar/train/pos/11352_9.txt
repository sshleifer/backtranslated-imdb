This is a great story about the search for the first serial killer known in the Soviet Union. I had been caught, just expecting an inappropriate TV movie, but I found myself experimented in a convincing way to tell the story. As others have said, there is much to admire here and unfortunately lacks many large versions on the screen. <br /> <br /> Much of the credit should go to Chris Girolamo, who attracts the viewer with an intelligent cinematic script and directs it, impossible to not feel emotional involvement. The cast by the entire cast is also impressive, especially actresses, Stephen Ree and Donald Sutherland. Their disguised images give their personal arches a great credibility, and the scene where they hold their first meeting of the committees after Perestroika touches honestly. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your crime films a little deeper and slightly less than gloss, I highly recommend searching for "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
