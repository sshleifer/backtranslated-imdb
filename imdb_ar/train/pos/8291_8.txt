"The Lady in Question (1999)" The Jane Wilder Championship is a good mystery drama. Remember me, I remember the old Black and White Black and White. Both Perry and "Cash" kept me guessing until the end. There were a lot of suspects who had a motive to kill, but I had no idea what character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has his own magical intelligence, even in his facial expressions and vocal distortions. His perfect part. The parts of the film that depict actors acting very well were done. I'm sure this is an additional challenge to withdraw the team. I'm not surprised to see that he did some writing for the film. So singing was a joy. I like this role more than his previous "nice" roles such as "Young Frankenstein" and "Willie Wanka". I hope that A & E will continue in this series. He should call it something like "The Secrets of A & E Gene Wilder". <br /> <br /> Music fits in with this period. I enjoyed the cool live combo and alternate tunes. I was not at first clear whether we were seeing a return back or whether the procedure was going on in that time period. I do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary for script flow. For me, this always distracts me. <br /> <br /> In general, my wife and I completely enjoyed second place at a good start in what we hope will be many others - just like one of our other favorites: Raymond Sizzling Perry Mason.
