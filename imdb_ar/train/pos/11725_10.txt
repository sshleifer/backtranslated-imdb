I suck in Boob's unexplained references, so I'm just going to write a clear review of the apartment (not intended as pun). I love Elvira, not in a way "I'm going to shoot, just to convince Judy-Foster-fanatic", but enough to say I think it's rock. The movie is a horror film in the 1950s just more fun, and look for the "stroking the ankle" sign to see what I mean. What a sequel to the film is the magic of Elvira (or should be Cassandra). I saw this film for the first time at the age of eight, and I have seen countless times since then .. I really have to go around buying a copy, look like the video shop copy even worse. If any of the other fans of the film wish to send me an email about it, feel free. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful show by Chastedy Pariah, an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
