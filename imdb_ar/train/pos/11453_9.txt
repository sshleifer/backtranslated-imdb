The director inhaled Andy Goldsworth's art, searching for his proximity to land and water, feeling proportionately - very gently, inhaling it again to be filmed for the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and joins it as a time-conscious event and human presence in a flowing world, a world that hides its power in the sight of everyone. Watch this movie!
