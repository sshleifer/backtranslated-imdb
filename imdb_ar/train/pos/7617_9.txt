A series of highly addictive. I have never seen a precise mix of drama, movement, suspense and science fiction that has never been seen before. I admire every chapter. Very clever scenario, I do not know how inventors invent all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, troubles, stormy relationships, it gives the show the human meaning necessary to create intimate characters. <br /> What is most true is the fact that all the characters are interconnected: the numbers they have met before without knowing it, and so forth. Other elements, the mysterious security system and the Dharma Initiative are elements that do not let us lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what do you think of creating this amazing story?
