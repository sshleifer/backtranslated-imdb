Well, I've come a long way from Houston so far, but whenever I watch this movie, I'm brought back to the dream of a small cowboy riding the bull one day in my generation. (I burned before I was drinking.) <br /> <br /> If you grew up in East Texas, you know that this film is an accurate portrayal of contemporary life at the time. If you do not trust me then watch the movie. Either join many of those who love her (and at the same time be strangely repelled), or at least you can make fun of their red necks. (There are many articles for entertainment.) This film does not try to be P.C. (Which was not in the 1980s) or hide the white trash element is honest in time and place. <br /> <br /> I must be 10 to me!
