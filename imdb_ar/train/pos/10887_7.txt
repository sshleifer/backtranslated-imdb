Horror film is filmed and things are going well. It's about a masked killer. The director tells the killer in front of the crew. He's crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the film never ended. Twelve years later, a group of film students decided to try to finish them - but there is a curse. People trying to finish it kill themselves. Students ignore this. Guess what will happen next? <br /> <br /> The plot is an old hat, but that's not bad ... because it's (a budget low budget movie). They are well made with talented young casts to some extent. No one is great but no one is terrible. It also avoids naked female scenes (and unnecessary). Moving quickly, the cute and bloody gully and the text does not insult your intelligence. Molly Ringwald spends a lot of time in her life playing a trivial role. <br /> <br /> It does not vibrate significantly but it is not bad at all. Give it 7.
