Here is another beauty in the beautiful film series directed by Ethan Fox. The film shows the story of star lovers (Israeli, Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only from its portrayal of inter-ethnic conflict, but from personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups as well. For example, there is a moment when one of his friends visits a secondary figure, openly gay, bringing flowers and kissing him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of embarrassing discomfort being washed through the room. It is clear that the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family does not accept him as he wants them, while the friend is confused and refuses. A great deal of complexity is filled in a transient moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is an expert in filling psychological and psychological complexity efficiently in short sequences. The film is also effective in the fair way of exposing the mutual brutality that Israel and the Palestinians inflict on each other. If you are not heartless, you will scream in the last third of the film. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is cleverly written and acted to remind us of the satisfaction of good melodrama.
