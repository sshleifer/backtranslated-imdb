Well, was Morgan Freeman more bizarre than God than George Burns? Surely this film was better than that, "O God." I was completely engaged and LMAO all the way through. Carrie was as perfect as the talented wannabe musician of some kind, and Aniston spent her role as a frustrated friend in her usual performance. I, on the one hand, do not consider her either ugly or uneducated. I think my favorite scene is when Curry opened the file cabinet thinking he could never carry his life history. Find out if you can locate the file in the cabinet that is carrying the Humor events of your bathroom: You've turned this file over. Well written and played out by the best, this comedy will go down as one of the best this fun guy.
