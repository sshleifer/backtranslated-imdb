BABY FACE is one of the best "forgotten" movies before the code. It was released last night after 1931 WATERLOO BRIDGE on TURNER CLASSIC, so I was able to watch the movie as it was restored an additional four minutes. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where he may have known his drunk parents "Myra" - Mae Clarke - at WATERLOO BRIDGE). Her father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with him since the death of her mother, and (in the regenerated dialog) he has played since she was 14 years old. She is now a resident waitress who works part-time in his frank conversation, and her closest friend is Chico (Teresa Harris), an African-American maid who continues to barit. She is one of Stanford's two good points. She keeps standing with her father about Harris, threatening to leave office if Harris is fired (and because he is a brave worker like Nat Pendleton, who enjoy seeing Stanwyck serving them instead of the flavor of the fillings he gives them) Obey them). <br /> <br /> The only person who comes regularly to Stanwick is shoe maker and educator Adolf Craig (Alphonse Etier), who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she leaves her to leave home. It also drives the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and the idea of ​​will to power. Learn more about this later. <br /> <br /> After she overthrew the great local political figure (Arthur Hall) and has a dispute with Barrett about this, a powerful explosion still kills Barrett, and Stanoyak can leave her home town. She and Harris travel to New York City, and we have access to free rail transportation by sleeping with a man from James Murray. They arrive in New York, and after walking around, they see Gotham Trust (founded in 1873) and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office is. <br /> <br /> Slowly Stanoyak sees the company ladder climb up, resembling (but shabby) of Robert Morse daring in how to succeed in business without really trying. But Morse was a man in a company dominated by a man. Stanwyck knows that her sexual attractiveness is her weapon. You go through John Wayne and Douglas Dumbrell (a piece of the film I always felt was the most shocking - curious enough - when I saw him), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and George Brent. Each of which ends up falling for it, or being pushed aside when it is no longer useful, or destroyed. Brent, the new president of the bank that his grandfather founded, eventually married her, and the film crisis is when the economic situation of the bank is shaken (especially after Brent buys a wealth of jewelry and gives it valuable bonds). Brent is accused. Will you stick to it? <br /> <br /> Out of the spoiler: <br /> <br /> The only thing in these films that is not accepted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictate the ends. The original end paid Stanoyak on a ship bound for Europe to give up Brent to his fate, but realized that she could not do it, go back to her apartment house, and find that he shot himself. She is taken to hospital with him at the end. Now before finding the footage that has been discovered, the film has apparently ended up giving up all their money to the bank to save it, and go back to East St. Louis, to live happily if it is poor. <br /> <br /> These are good ends. Stanwyck must continue on its devastating course, with Brent another victim. But even without Bryn's office, a screenwriter (one of them Darrell Zanook, by the way) saw it as a moral center. She has nothing - at least nothing for the mighty men (who hate them). I do not think the depressed public would tolerate this kind of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, due to changing public opinion patterns and changes in society. He was a corporate world scientist in 1933, and Stanwyck has shortened its business. Wood admits (when he will be fired because of his rudeness) that he does not want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck was finding a woman everywhere. In the film, there are bad and wary remarks (some of which are clearly jealous) toward Stanwyck of other secretaries and employees during her rapid rise. In 2006, many women faced presidents, and she would find her cutting off her legs very quickly. Of course, if you find one or two lesbians, you might try that route, but it's doubtful. She did not seem to meet any man like me. They have gays executives in business, who have not been given a curse on her legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there is her teacher, Mr. Carg. Carg is again in the "roaming" version in an attempt to make her seek a moral position. In fact he pays Nieztsche, but the way (in a broader sense) push the Nazis Nieztsche - find your way to power and pay. While Nieztsche March strength of pressure at times, was not his whole theory. Otherwise, no one will read it today in college courses. It is clear that Cragg learns herself by herself, but she is only half educated. In short, if someone who has studied Nishchi has come across very well, he may seem like an uneducated idiot. This is a Stanwyck teacher! Good movie, and his day is worth 10 ... but seriously flawed.
