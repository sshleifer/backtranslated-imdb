Dr. Murdered, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did this again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordred has been on the ground for 100 years waiting for the arrival of Kabal, the evil magician, to kill him. Meridor and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mardred knows all the tricks of Kapal. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit confusing at first, but soon you will feel that you are part of the movement. I will not give up on the end, so go and see the doctor Murdered! <br /> <br /> I found the movie very interesting because it does not have too much violence or sexual scenes. The film focused on the plot and that's what I like! I find that the best movies are those that seem to be flying times. This is because you are immersed in the film. Dr. Murdred is a very cool movie! I give it 20 out of 10. Worth watching! <br /> <br />
