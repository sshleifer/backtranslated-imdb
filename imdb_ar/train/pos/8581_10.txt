This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. All of you who ever consider this film are not smart enough to understand all the nice humor this film offers. It shows us that real life and "fantasy" work can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most intelligent ways for two people to find each other. Name me another film where you can see all this as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They'll go to find your anus on a mountain on Mars."
