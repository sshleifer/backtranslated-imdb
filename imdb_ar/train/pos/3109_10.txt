The third and final film of this trio is finally clear. It's a political film more than a simple entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he is and will discover and remember the torture he was subjected to in order to kill his old identity: he really killed a person who had become his body. But the film finally reveals that all this was organized and planned by the CIA under the program Blackfriars, which also clearly appeared in this film that aims to eliminate all American citizens who tried to prevent the control of the entire community by a limited list of people. Who was a key CIA officer until 1980, when he became vice president? This is in line with what is said on the Internet. Then comes the truth thanks to Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who will be able to present this fact to the public and the only authority that can make a decision on the CIA is a woman and the woman participates in the Senate in the General Investigation. Woman and Senate; read my lips. In the United States, politics is fought in the media and two media are necessary for any presidential campaign: music and cinema. At present, Hollywood and beyond are using intellectuals, academics and film intellectuals in general, and this film in particular, to build up an idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So go and watch the movie. It is very pleasant and has a sweet smell at the end of the period and the great change that some expect and others are waiting for, but no one can pretend it will not come: the only point is knowing how deep and dangerous it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Colardieu, University of Paris Dauphin, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University of Versailles Saint-Quentin en Evelyn
