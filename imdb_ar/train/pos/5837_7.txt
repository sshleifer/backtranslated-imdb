With Oliver Hardy sounding horns, bells, telephones and Trombone, his doctor advises Finlinson to be calm, calm and dieting from goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a wonderful solution, living on a pier boat, so that the salty sea air can help you get the full comfort it needs. It is a wonderful introduction to all the crazy crowds that will ensue, where the boat is placed close to the hungry goat, and the fugitive convict (Richard Kramer) runs along the ride. <br /> <br /> I got a kick out of all the gags in the movie, starting from that label at the Century Test Factory - "Silence While Men Work". The early story of the boys' apartment is characterized by a number of plumbing accidents and mixed tools, with bananas in bananas. Laurel has a few fantastic lines in the picture, such as "We Must Be Unconnected", but that prompted me to move his response to the offender on board - "Self-preservation is another law of the averages" - specifically! <br /> <br /> I'm not a great student in Laurel and Hardy films like this one. All I know is that I enjoyed them as a child and found them amusing today as they were once again in my youth. In this regard, Saps At Sea provides a decent hour of fun with the Horneyk, on its way to Hormania.
