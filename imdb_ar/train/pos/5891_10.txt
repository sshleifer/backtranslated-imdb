The Italian film is an amazingly accomplished film in its time. Stunningly shot, with truly brilliant lighting effects, it is an early gem that clearly reveals REGINALD BARKER to be a leading director of the same position as Griffith and Maurice Turner. It's hard to know how much Thomas Ines has mastered production, but this film still has extraordinary power. A simple story about an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York, a very moving story. The issues of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are fully relevant today. The use of superb telephoto and power performance GEORGE BEBAN electrifies. What we need now is a really good print that has been transferred to DVD so we can really appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema.
