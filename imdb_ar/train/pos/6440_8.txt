I do not seem to write a review on IMDb unless I'm very surprised by how good the film is or how damaging it is. This film falls into the first category. I try every year to see all the candidates for the best foreign film at the Oscars, even those who I know I will not love them. "As in Paradise" seems to fit the bill. The plot seems sugary, emotional, and slow ... For my tails, which go more towards original, dark and / or bold foreign films (Michael Hannick, Francois Ozon, much of the modern Japanese / Korean cinema) "as in heaven" does not seem particularly interesting. ... was not released in the US, so I sat down to watch the VCD I found in Singapore, and prepared to "drop it off the menu". After a boring start, "As in Heaven" becomes this rare film where it really inspires what happens on screen. The characters in the film are pure "stock" characters - the wounded wreck, the town of thugs, the battered wife, the sad woman she learns for love, the repressed secretary ... Fortunately, they are a beloved bunch, well written and well represented. Angela Olson, as the wife of Minister Inger, was nominated for the Academy Award if she were performing in English. Strong points: beautiful music, the main song, which Gabriella sang, really exciting and memorable. Stay tuned for the tight 87-year-old actress who plays Olga, who keeps pace with the dance steps as well as the younger ladies! I will not discuss the end, but I will say that this is logical. She talked a lot of emotional things in the last hour of the film, and I'm not sure why it happened. Although nothing is explained in words, all this makes sense because the films are on the right track. **** Away from the place *****. Probably the most powerful Swedish film I've ever seen.
