I immediately fell in love with "Push Daisies". This exhibition can put a smile on my face by telling wonderful stories, intelligent dialogue and wonderful acting. But that's not all: it's also able to keep you to the end. The basic idea behind the presentation - bringing people back to life with a single touch, ending the second undead state - is an interesting idea and could remain in later seasons. But the suspicious killings, the unique appearance of the show and the highly efficient narrator add to the experience. But "push daisies" is more of the parts. He has a certain charm that I really enjoy and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for the second season.
