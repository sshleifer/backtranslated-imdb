I saw Q. Q. again tonight and forgot how much I love this movie. It's a wonderful entertainment and lets you feel that everything is fine with the world. Mozart's hints all the time from the opening with Einstein were played by Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star for violin for Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during Ed Walters' intelligence test. I like to portray women as smart and encourage them to get a career, a particularly unique situation in the 1950s, when the film is being prepared. (I myself am a teacher, but I stayed at home to raise my children, so please do not believe that I am a strong feminist.) It is wonderful how a man of "grease monkey" is finally seen as important and worthy as Kathryn Katrin, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are defined much more - there are no labels. There are a lot of small gags and linings that are almost ostracized if you do not see and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> Some things have been taken into the movie not included in the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters speaks at the seminar, there are 3 tools (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right edge of the chalk. In the next shot of the camera, there are only 2. In the credits on our video, Tony Shallop's personality is included as Bob Waters, not Bob Rossetti because he presents himself in the film and is listed here in Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film. Fluff pieces may be in some estimates, but they have a lot more substance than many give. Not only that, what is collected here. Watch it and enjoy it!
