Witches are a wonderful journey from start to finish, thanks in large part to the magic created by the stars. Alan Arkin is wonderful in one of his best roles in decades. Like any truly wonderful film, it is a journey in which redemption is the outcome of a dream. I can not believe that this movie is very difficult - I buy it on a heartbeat DVD but I have not found an outlet yet
