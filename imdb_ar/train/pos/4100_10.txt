The film "La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Merimée.Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heir to the impoverished son of Marquez, who arrives at the dilapidated family palace and is allegedly learning that the legendary ursine monster is wandering through the forest It is a legendary dream that a former lady at home (Sirpa Lane) was involved in having sex with the creature and Lucy finds herself consumed by the dreams of the accident. "The Beast" is a mixture of surrealist horror and overt and pornographic corruption. There is the beastliness, the assault and the implicit impersonation of the priesthood, the profanity of the profane slander that was cast on the lucky breasts, masturbation in the cold, and most of all a named monster playing with an incredibly large rod. This film is still filmed really erotic and taste wonderful. The women here are amazingly beautiful and they are nude most of the time. Generally "La Bête" is a visual feast. Attention to detail, or visual decoration with holder information, Borowczyk masterpiece must be carefully watched and cared for. Must see for European cinema idol worshipers.
