I came in the middle of this film, so I had no idea of ​​any credits or even its title until I looked for it here, where I think it received a mixed reception from commentators. I'm on the positive side with respect to this film, but there is one thing that really caught my attention while watching: the beautiful and delicate result written in Copelandco Americana style. My surprise was great when I discovered the result written by none other than John Williams himself. It is true that he wrote dozens of sensitive and influential Schindler's list but usually associated his name with words such as Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams wrote about this film far outweighs anything I have heard about his tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, in full accordance with the fine and beautiful plot of the film. A final mark, Catch Me if You Can, shows more intelligence and sophistication. For Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was my valley and Konrack, a film with John Voigt and his young African-American in South Carolina, and Danny de Vito of the Renaissance, etc. They tell a necessary story about spiritual awakening, a story that can not be told much. This one is an excellent addition to this genre.
