This is a beautiful story of mania driven by guilt. <br /> <br /> Matisse, a single night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. Pass without a word. Just splash in the water followed by a cry for help to make it act. And then only very few and too late. <br /> <br /> The film lists his efforts to find out more about women. In the windows of local pubs, she found her pocketbook. He cut more and more of her life together. His "look" changes with the growth of his obsession. He has to make things right. In a beautifully filmed interview with "her ex-boyfriend," Alexey is forced to face the guilt he feels. <br /> <br /> It takes a long, bold soundtrack to show dogs barking guilt. linear. Beautiful Noir film with beautiful twist. Endi good end.
