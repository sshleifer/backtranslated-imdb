I have no idea how IMDb is rated for revisions but I know that, as is often the case on Amazon.com, there is an astonishing number of very negative reviews of this film repeating the same somewhat ambiguous talking points, almost literally. campaign? Only IMDb is known. <br /> <br /> As for this film: it's fine. It is a funny film and very nice and direct. <br /> <br /> It has been more than a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited my relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing unreal or exploitative about these children. Is Grandma a strange character? Yeah. Does dialogue and conspiracy recognize this? Yes, thank God, they do. Are other films shown in LES and include children from Dominican / Puerto Rico? you betcha. Does this make the film a crime? As some comments suggest (to my eyes, astroturf)? barely. Allow for a thousand plastic flower. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of JR Degrassi. High or High Degrassi. He ridiculed the comparison, but I never did - and I was touched, even to the core, with the humility of the film and the spirit of giving. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to know the dramatic background. Behind all this backbiting! :-Dr
