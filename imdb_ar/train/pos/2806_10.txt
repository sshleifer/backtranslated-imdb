Well, first, I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand in this movie. Many people criticized her and felt that people who might want to see him should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not supposed to be the deepest film in a hundred years. If that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean that it must be a technical. It should make you feel good and you should enjoy watching it and these two things are easily accomplished. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the acting although not "Halle Berry in Monster Ball" is still good. The movie does not need to be so frankly represented, so do not look for it. It is a family movie. Whether this is what you want or not should even consider in this film honestly. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a really nice story. I think it was well thought out and fun to watch. This is also true in life for the most part of that culture, so if you want to sit and watch a movie you can enjoy it and feel good when you're done. If you're looking for something with deep plot lines and great dramatic scenes this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Yndsay
