This film is so misunderstood that it is not funny. If you're thinking of seeing this one for shooting .. keep clear. Addresses the impact and impacts that survivors must bear. Even investigators are seeking the answer we all do ... Why? A wonderful representation of two adorable ladies where we see how those who ignore them ignore the same things we are affected by. Yes the language is sometimes harsh, but it suits the characters well. There are some loose ends to the left or unanswered, but all movies have these. The main issues are dealt with and this film makes a big statement about how each of us deeply feels after these major incidents. Highly recommended for young people and adults.
