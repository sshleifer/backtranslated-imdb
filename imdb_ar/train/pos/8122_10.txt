I never saw this movie until I bought the tape last year. I felt charmed and entertained. Contains all the elements that I like to see in a science fiction story, in a book or on the screen. There is social commentary, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something strange and fun watching a 1936 show about the "distant future" of the 1960s and 1970s. I think it is a must, not just for science fiction.
