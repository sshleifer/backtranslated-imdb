This is not "loose", but it is an accurate and faithful remake of the 1958 classic film "Soliti Ignoti" with Toto, Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale, etc. That's the good reason. He copies all the funny characters and the plot, even in details (like the scene where the cameraman steals the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I've seen the wonderful old version several times, and I've known all the bands and the end by heart. Still enjoy the "Welcome to Collinwood", which is characterized by its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the life and methods of young thieves in Italy adapted in 1950 with the USA in 2002. Things have not changed much. 10/08.
