This may be one of the most original love stories I have seen in the ages, especially for a war-based film (briefly). It is basically a story based on two worlds, one clearly real, the other fictional, but the filmmakers initially say it is a coincidence if it is a real place. In any case, Peter Carter (David Neven the Great) was on his way to a plane crash, and spoke to Jun (Monkey Planet Kim Hunter) before being rescued and said he loved her. He was supposed to die of jumping without an umbrella, but somehow survived, and now he sees and loves Jun in the flesh. This other place, like the sky, is unhappy because he survived and was supposed to come to their world, so they send a French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to convince him to leave, but obviously in love. Peter suggests that he ask for his life to be resurrected before the court of the other world. It is clear that love reigns when the lovers declare that they will die for each other, until June is offered to replace him! The film starred Robert Koot as Bob Tropshaw, Kathleen Byron as Angel, a brief (not yet known) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as a pioneer in English and Abraham Suffer as judge / surgeon. David Niven was ranked 36th in the Top 50 Best Actors list. The film was ranked 86th in the list of the 100 best-selling movies for the happy ending. He was ranked 47th in the 100 best war films and was ranked 46th in Britain's 50 best films. On 100 Greatest Movies. Excellence!
