SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film of my life because it is the first film I remember seeing in the cinema in my hometown as a 4 year old. The story is based on Sheila Bournford's story, which makes it impossible to write this film as a lassy clone. <br /> <br /> The main story: A dog and a cat are happily living in the Sever family When the new husband gets the mother of the three children, they have a job in the city and have to move temporarily to inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a farm to live for two months. The strong ties between the animals and children you watch are particularly strong, and the Golden Retriever Shadow and the Sassy the Himalayan cat are as shattered as children, although the lucky young American Bulldog, Chance, is a little less anxious and somewhat cynical (partly because of his voice) Who explains that he was abandoned as a puppy, picked up in an animal shelter, and bought by the family), although his growth as a character during the story provides much of an important narrative narrative. <br /> <br /> The three pets escape from the farm and head to the vast and dangerous wilderness (wonderful wildlife settings by the way), driven by Shadow's instincts. They face many risks along the way, hoping to go home, while the family and the farm hosts are suddenly worried about the disappearance of the animals. There are funny moments along the way, a great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and the touching companionship that grows among the main characters during the narrative story, interspersed with moments of sadness (eg when it causes a sassy arrogance to try to cross the river Falling in the river and washing it in a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss experienced by the viewers deeply). <br /> <br /> In a way, he failed to see what the inclusion of saving the lost girl in the wild adds to the story and the journey they are making. In a way, it seems partly unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> The end ends in the bets when the shadow rises to a hole in the train yard and hurts his leg, and it is hard to get out of it and give it exhausting, exhausting, followed by a chance to convince him to climb, tell him how important it is to him and how he pushed them so as not to get rid of them. Of them with ease. <br /> <br /> The way this scene does not end brilliantly leaves a mystery that extends to the last scene when Chance and Sassi return to their home, but the shadow can not be seen anywhere. Then as everyone seems lost, slowly emerges, family reunion. The conclusion of Chances in the end speaks of the companionship that arose between him and his fellow travelers, and the realization of what is truly home of his long journey to get there, leaves a fascinating finale to show how his personality grows, but also how two others have as well. Wait a second, I think I will cry ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I have not read Sheila Bournford's book, so I do not pretend to know where the differences between the book and the cinema rested. But this is a movie that the whole family can watch, and while the Tots will love talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot better (as I found when I saw the film again several years later without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema, and I suggest that if you do not see it, you will come out and get it! <br /> <br /> Please avoid the version (see Homeward Bound II!)
