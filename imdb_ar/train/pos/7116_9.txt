No one argues that the 1945 war film was a masterpiece. (How can any 1945 war film be a masterpiece?) However, this very effective narrative of a real story, the story of the Shamit, blind about Guadalcanal, also played by John Garfield, who spent days wearing a bandage to get the nuances of a blind person's actions. Robert Leakey, in "Helmet for My Pillow," criticizes Schmidt's popularity for his fox colleague, who was killed, and wrote that "the country needs to be alive heroes." <br /> <br /> Well, I think the country did that. They had one here. There is one fighting scene in the movie, linked to the studio group, lasts only ten minutes or so and occurs less than halfway through the film instead of keeping it at its peak, but it is the most terrifying and realistic picture of the men under fire I can remember watching the screen, Including those in Save the Soldier Ryan. The men shout with fear, yelling at each other and at the enemy, bleed and die, without the help of color, or holographic sound, or the sounds of sticks, or gore. <br /> <br /> Simply from a technological point of view, the movie is fantastic. Not only can you learn the complexity of a 30-caliber machine, a browning sprinkler with water, or it should be fired in bursts from just a few rounds, or it is not waved like a hose fire, as in many other war movies. Technical accuracy adds to the installation quality of the scene. The need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of enemies burst out screaming through the 50-foot creek with the sole aim of annihilating you and your isolated companions trapped in a small position of firearms. <br /> <br /> The performances are strong, if not courageous, including support offerings everywhere in the 1940s, John Ridgley, and brilliant young Eleanor Parker. Love framing story is spare, but it works, and eventually moves. A striking dream sequence is included. It is not Bunuel, but for the film Routine 1945, it stands out as original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have replaced the text, or it may have been changed by someone else. This type of pruning could have been used which may have caused some much needed mystery. However, there are strange verbal punctuation that have a sudden effect on the viewer - "Why does not God hit me dead?" And, "In the eyes, me. The depths of distress in a few words vulgar. And an amazing amount of bitterness expressed by veterans in the 1945 war film. <br /> <br /> Notes that may seem wrong to contemporary scenes but should not be: the ancient language dated and hard to believe that many children today think it Already speaking - "Private Gap," "Psychedelic," "Drip," "Gee," "You're a stupid idiot," "Lady," Puffy Man, "and" Sorry for yourself. " Let us think about the historical context and be good in our judgments. At the time, some of this nice language was at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Real weaknesses? Old warriors meet together and argue together about the amount of their collective future. The argument is overly resolved with the conclusion that "just having a silver plate in your head does not mean that people will think you are a bad person." Sometimes, there are a large number of silent voices and prayers that can not be unambiguously imagined. "Please God, let him come back to me," and this thing. <br /> <br /> Well, filmmakers were working under the constraints of their time. Perhaps that is why the recent fading appears in the Independence Hall and the beautiful "America of America" ​​inspires swells in the back. <br /> <br /> None of this retraction of the virtues of the film, which is great, especially the impact of that terrible combat scene. It's not on TV often. If you have a chance, catch it by all means.
