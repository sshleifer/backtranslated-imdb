Now I like American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was just great for Seann William Scott as Stifler but then the quality dropped. Band Camp maintained reasonably high standards with the characters it really cared about but Naked Mile was the same jokes and recycled sketches (the sex problem Erik Stifler looks like Jim). There were some interesting moments like the football game against the Pygmies and "Punishing" Coozeman but in general they lacked originality and Mile was just stupid and adventurous. Not to mention the annoying niece who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway enough about bare Mile. I watched Bayhouse with horror as I thought it might reach a new level but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest there is no real plot but it is full of hot girls (Ashley Incredible) and many sexual jokes. Yes, it's a mild formula and jokes are old but Dwight Steffler (Steve Tally) raises the bar. The Greek Olympiad is a special pre-recent pleasure and recent events while Christopher McDonald's Farhan Hijab. There are weaknesses, though. Kozman was annoying as he was at first, I'm still puzzled how ever he got a part of it. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse. John White made the Naked Mile a pain to watch, but at Beta House, he took his performance to a whole new level. First of all, lacks charisma, a prerequisite for Stifler. You really can not care less about him. The only reason I was bothered by his relationship was to be Ashley on the screen! She shines on him as does the rest of the cast. Seriously John White is finally in bad behavior and has a lot of charisma like a dead fish. <br /> <br /> The saying that the film is entertaining and that Cozeman's fear that his daughters are not exactly a funny girl is brilliantly. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie deserves a lease, get a few of your colleagues at the event and enjoy the laughter at the vomit festival, and vent your anger from Eric "The Loser" Steffler.
