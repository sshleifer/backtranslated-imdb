The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children who are exposed to violence and isolation in their remote society develop into troubled youth who need certain psychological tools to deal with the fragility of their hidden mindset. Whether they are a religion that has been followed at the fanatical level or the care of others or just a covert image while engaging in prostitution, Villaronga creates a successful study of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. The three witnesses witness double annoying death or their friends before they are a teenager, thus burying the emotions they feel with their peers to vulnerable bodies until they meet again in the hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The cinematic style of the text is usually as visually rich as you expect from the Spanish author and reminds us very much of the work of his Spanish colleague Pedro Almodovar on topics of sexual desire, of different sexes and homosexuals. One of the different elements of the filmmakers is that Villaronga prefers a supernatural streak interspersed with the weary realism that opposes the use of Almodovar for surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The piece gives insight into the turbulent. Psychological youth and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this movie because it contains elements that will stay with the audience for a long time after viewing.
