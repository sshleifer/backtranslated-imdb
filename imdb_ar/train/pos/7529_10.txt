Two years have passed, and everyone seems to be different, some forever and others worse. I still enjoy as much as I enjoyed with the original. <br /> <br /> Some of the flaws she was experiencing despite changing the joker, now has no red lips and looks like blacker hair and black pupils, Mark still sounds Hamil, a plus I think. They made Poison Ivy more suggestive to eggs that they became plant-like and that Catwomen looked quite different and not as "attractive" as they were originally. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow look poking, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> This view is not as dark as the original because Batman does not work alone as it does. Most of the time he works with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to the rescue often. Batman has given up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems to have become a little bigger but still kicking a lot of ass. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original due to most of the characters that have been renovated but the stories are as exciting as they have always been and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the Edge" may be one of Batman's biggest rings ever, so be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> Generally 8-9 / 10
