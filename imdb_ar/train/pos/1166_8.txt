Tony Arzenta, the deadly and deadly killer (a leading inspirational act by Alan Dillon) wants to end the assassination, but the dangerous gangsters he works with will not allow him to do so. After the murder of his wife and child, Arzenta announces an open season to everyone responsible for their deaths. Director Doshio Tesari connects the story of absorption with steady steady steps, maintains a serious tone meaningless in all its stages, initiates sensational shootings and car chase with great snoring skill, and intersects the narration with explosive explosions of bloody violence. Delon's gentle and attractive presence adds an extra category to already arduous procedures. The film benefits more from popular representation through outstanding actors, with commendable contributions from Richard Conte as the leader of the wise mafia, Nick Gusto, Carla Grafini as Arzenta's supporting friend Sandra, Mark Borrell as Domenico Maguio's pro-Arzenta, Anton Defering's account of Capo Grunwald, Troisi as a poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. Silvano Ippoliti boasts a number of wonderful pans. The result of Gianni Ferrero's terrible hit is a wonderful place. Erika Blanc and Rosalie Neri pop up briefly in elegant parts. Better yet, there is no filler to talk about, but we get a generous splendor of undue female nudity. The stunning conclusion contains a medium wall that extends to the gastrointestinal tract. A strong and satisfactory winner.
