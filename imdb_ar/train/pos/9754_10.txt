This movie Rajidy Ann and Andy are very adorable. We love watching Ann and Andy singing and dancing, along with the camel with the crepe knees. This film is what made the camel with the knees rolling very common, and sang his song, "I do not love you." If you like Raggedy Ann and Andy watching the movie, you'll see why it's a movie that kids and adults love!
