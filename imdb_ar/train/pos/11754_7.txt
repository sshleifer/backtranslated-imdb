Robin Williams is doing his best to combine comedy and cipher, but it explodes a bit. Donald Moffat is the very one as his father-in-law. Excellent Jeff Brides Despite being a quarterback, Holly Palms and Pamela Reid are wonderful, the film carries through most of their coarse positions. It fills the time well, but it is a little more.
