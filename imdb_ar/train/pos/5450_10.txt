Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Bowers. She is a waitress for her tongue and her father is in a trivial little mining town. He also sells them to men. She flees to New York and sleeps on the way to the top. At present she is a beautiful tame. The film moves very quickly and contains a lot of sexual innuendo - some of which start today very absurdly (but fun). It moves so fast that you can easily ignore that most of it can never happen - even in 1933. There is nothing classic or huge about this - it's just a quick, very funny little movie. It only collapses in the end with a small "moral" end demanded by censorship. It looked stupid and unreasonable (I saw it in the theater and the audience laughed at it - one of them said rightfully "no escape"). I only saw the polished version that was not filtered after 75 minutes which is different, somewhat tragic and much better. It was thought that this version was lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! I think this is the only version - but be aware. <br /> <br /> The acting is good - Stanwick jumps into her role and plays on the top. It makes you believe that she enjoys being harsh and sleepy. There are also strong support offers from handsome Donald Cook and George Brent. Also look for John Wayne before stardom in a gay as a witty and mild office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. Give this 9.
