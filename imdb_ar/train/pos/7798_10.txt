I can not begin to describe the magnificence of this film. Suffice it to say, at any time I feel depressed about how unfair or useless things appear, this is the film I rent to put me in the right frame of mind. Background music makes you aware of the ease of existence and how it provides simplicity to the greatest happiness. The Indian girl that sings is just one example of a character in this film who is not trying hard, and is happy as a result. Percyvina, Washie's colleague in Robbie (Ashley Judd) is another game = her eyes and smile may be harder on a day. Watch this movie and dream of better days to come or a good conversation with friends, and realize that loneliness alone - Ruby is often alone - is not the only unit. Recommended for anyone who enjoys the thoughtful calmness of a movie.
