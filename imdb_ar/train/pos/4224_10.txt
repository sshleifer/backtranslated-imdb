I love this episode of Colombo. Perhaps the reason is that Ruth Gordon is there and she is wonderful as a successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, a US version of Mrs. Agatha Christie. It is delicious to see her as a gay, playful author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames her niece, her niece. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police abandoned her. I loved someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I really do not like Hartley in anything personally. And of course with Colombo, there is some laughter when Veronica asks in the belly dance class. Ruth's Abigail is intelligent and matches the intelligence with Colombo that Peter Falk always plays.
