The choice of making this SNL has been transformed into a much better film than other modern ideas. The humor involved in the personality is not an unpleasant humor, but a personality driven enough to extend it for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> It is strange that sexual content seems to be avoidable, but it may avoid it. It was because of the restrictions on direct television broadcasting that I did not expect that. I think I was thinking of more of the Larry Entertainment suit than the producers ... <br /> <br /> Certainly PG-13, which is likely to hurt him from reaching the heights of his most successful predecessors, Better than hypothesis and writing more than those gloomy. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt it would be a great blow ... (This is sad, because Tim Meadows is not inclined to do characters that bother me exactly the frequency with which other SNL graduates tend)
