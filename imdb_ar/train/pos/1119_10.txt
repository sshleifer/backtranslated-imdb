Sandra Bernhards Without You I Nothing, the 1990 film, continued following his production outside Broadway in 1988 ... what she and others in the film refer to as "one woman shot by a broken woman." <br /> < There were many changes in monologues and vocabulary, and the release of the film visually recreates the story, where Sandra took a wonderful presence as a successful playwright in New York, during what she calls her "supernatural summer," to an almost hallucinatory, almost desperate presence in her home in Los Angeles Los Angeles - The fictional director in the film points out that she is returning Sandra "to its roots, ... prestigious dinner clubs such as the bar room "<br /> <br /> There is a point that needs to be mentioned here. Sandra tries to attract her liberal view of the world and her sometimes harsh criticism of American pop culture to an audience she does not quite see. In L.A. Play with mostly black audience, trying to link her thoughts when it seems that all these people want "Shashonna", stripper Madonna. Even so, with Shashonna dancing to ring similar tones from "Like a Virgin", there is not much to be said for the public to enjoy the show. The scene in the club throughout the film is drier than bone. A funny scene to catch is a round man from the audience helping Shashuna get out of her pants. <br /> <br /> But, if she descends, Sandra does so elegantly and forcefully, and moves everything from corrupt trust to weaknesses holes ... right at the point where she is naked (literally), demanding acceptance and still swimming in some way In its transparent stellar group. Her images of interactions with the likes of Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and What We Do Believe. <br /> <br /> Sandra begins her program at her most critical moments, performing a quiet and puzzling performance of Nina Simone's "Four Women" while wearing a moustafa and other African dress, singing lines like "My Black Skin", "My Hair is Angry" and " "They called me Sweet Thing." <br /> <br /> She revived and celebrated the ghosts of the lower art in a very funny description of Andy Warhol's frantic real estate auction: "Leave it to Andy for wisdom and sensitivity in hours and hours of hard work and effort in the Indian product ... so much so that they were very lucky to take advantage of everything that was happening in Santa Fe. "<br /> <br /> She reveals Hollywood hyperbole, a pained friend's sympathy and then his passion Saying, "Sir, if it's about Ishtar, I'm getting up at the moment and out of your life forever because it's self-indulging even for me!" Sandra explains the expectations of women in the age of the women's movement. Sandra, who was dressed as a Cosmo girl, wears her little imagination to become an executive secretary and marry her boss. "I will never be statistically, not me, I am under 35, and I will be married!" <br /> <br /> Sandra paves the way for the opening of sexual activity in society: "When you touch it at night, do you feel it is fine, or is it real? I say it is a real feeling ... a real great." <br /> <br /> Finally, she cries for the gradual change of American society by directing the disco to the greats of Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and declaring, "In the end everyone will make fun of it!" <br /> <br /> All of this comes in the form of shiny, Shamaltze shows, but great performances of the theme parks of songs written by Billy Paul, Bert Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nero, to name a few. At the same time, Sandra exemplifies the idealism and fantasy of Sandra - her self-generated mirror image - throughout the city, a beautiful black model with flowing dresses and tight bustiers reading Kabala, studying chemistry and listening to NWA rap music. In the film "Without You I'm Not", Sandra Bernhard explores emotions and presence that, until then, only plays as a regular guest late at night with David Letterman. Her child-like enthusiasm for the shock, which was introduced throughout the 1980s, is thrown aside in the face of a more attractive attraction, her confidence in the face of materialism and American fame proving to be refreshing. This approach in comedy would change Sandra's direction forever and would distinguish the most mature and elegant artist. <br /> <br /> If you like the kind humor to engage in jokes in jokes about joy, fame, sex, loneliness, despair, and shallow expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you in stitches. It may not be meant to be funny in all areas. This may be a bit annoying or even a modlin for some. But think about Sandra's world-wide vacuum, and you'll understand how funny and wonderful it really is. <br /> <br /> But look without you I'm not with a friend "in the knowledge" because it is definitely funnier this way. Before you know it, two of you will share Sandra's criticism and confuse the hell of anyone else.
