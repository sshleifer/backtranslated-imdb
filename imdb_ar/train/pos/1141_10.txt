No one was mocking this movie. I have seen it at least twenty times and still cry in many scenes. Sally Field is just as perfect as Celeste Talbert, the faded soap star whose support crew is trying to replace in the hope that her star will rise. The fields, 45 years old, still have a wonderful passing quality, a beautiful, and an ideal personality that lied to having three children. I am biased, I am in love with her. <br /> <br /> The band "Soapdish" is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, as is Robert Downey Jr., the creator of Elizabeth Shwe, Wobi Goldberg, and Terry Hatter in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as a well-molded director who experimented with a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as a hapless fashion designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Nana's nurse who leads the plot to remove the character fields from the show is hilarious. <br /> <br /> This movie should have won the Academy Award for Best Comedy, Best Lady of Comedy, the best leading man in comedy and the innumerable best of the best, including writing, directing Supporting representatives and actresses. Get a DVD so you can watch it over and over for twenty-five years. You will still laugh at it when the disc disappears.
