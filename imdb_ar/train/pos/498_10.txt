That's what I was expecting when the DS9 star flight began for the first time. No slight DS9. This was a great show in itself, but it never gave the fans more than they wanted. Enterprise is showing up. Although there is a similarity to the original journey, it is different enough to become original in its own way. Makes exploration ideas exciting to us again. That was one of the basic ingredients that made the original very popular. Another element of success is the relationships that have developed among the crew members. Viewers really cared about the crew. Projects have a lot of promise in this area as well. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel that tensions in the organization can lead to much more and say more than usual. I think that when we deal with such large-sized characters from different races or even types, we get some very interesting ideas and television. Also, you must note the presentations, Blalock is very convincing because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula has a really fancy and personal power that offers a wonderful performance. The rest of the cast also made good performances. My only control is as follows. Subject. It's good to be different, but a little light I like. We need something a little bigger. You do not have to be an orchestra. Maybe something is enough with a little more electronic sound. And my other complaint. They sell a lot of additives. They can fix this by selling fewer ads, or making all offers two parts. Otherwise, we will end up concluding the final offers of offers very quickly as was the case with Voyager complaints.
