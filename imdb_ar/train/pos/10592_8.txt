Sarah's story to the Pimlico community in London, after an unexploded WW2 bomb, found a royal charter stating that the area in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This film works because it appeals to the imagination of many of us about drafting our rules and not having to listen to them. There is a strong group of British warriors, especially Stanley Holloway, that makes this even more believable. <br /> <br /> There are some very nice moments in the movie, such as the lack of supplies and other London residents on the other hand. The side of the barricade begins to throw food and other objects at them. <br /> <br /> Although you always know that Pimlico will become part of the UK again, people in PImlico will therefore not mind the viewer when this happens, leaving a happy feeling happy. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to think that these low-budget films from a small studio in London are still very popular for over fifty years. Producers must have something right.
