It's a great movie and all actors and actresses are very good! Although some actors and actresses were not very popular in the show, they seemed to be acting since they were one year old! It was funny, gross, and a very good movie. In most parts, I did not know what would happen next! You like I think this will happen, wait and I think this will happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I could not stop laughing, it was very fun, but in some parts I was totally crazy and could not believe what I was seeing! I will definitely see this movie again! It's one of those films where it can not be boring. Every time you see it is impressive I would definitely recommend seeing this movie !!
