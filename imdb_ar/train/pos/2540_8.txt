While it is not as famous as some of its other collaborations (like THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), it is a little horror film though the seduction decisions were a little strange. Boris Karlov plays the role of Dr. Janus Roch, the strange world who lives in the Carpathian Mountains - near the hometown of Dracula's characters. Bela Lugosi plays the role of Dr. Bennett - whose nationality has never been discussed even though the name certainly sounds French. I really think it was logical to have a turnover in the switch, where the role of the Carpathians seems to be designed specifically for Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual development, the two still perform excellent functions. Karlov certainly was the leading role, but Lugosi had treated himself well as a relatively natural person - something he did not play much in the movies !! Dr. Rukh seems to be outcast, as other scientists (especially Bennett) believe his theories are strange and illogical. However, throughout the film, it turned out that Rukh was right and that Bennett was particularly generous in his new praise to Roch. Unfortunately, the wonderful new element discovered by Rukh has a bad side effect to turn it into a crazy kill machine (do not you hate it when it happens?). While it could have been just a cute world turned into a crazy story, the plot was well built, well-developed characters and the crazy Rukh was a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie must be enjoyed by anyone except those who hate old horror movies. You can really say that Universal Pictures has stopped working and produced a bigger budget film instead of the cheap fast films that Lugosi and Karlov unfortunately attracted in later years. Things are good.
