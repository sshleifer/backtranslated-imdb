Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri - directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya Nakadi (with Goyokin and HAra Kiri & Rebellion) for the best existing chambara films. <br /> <br /> It's the story of Shinto Katsuo (who plays the role of Okada Okada)) working with Nakadei, who wants to become a daymio. Okada, being "the cleanest" for Nikadi treats like a dog - and after a long time realizes - what is really for Nakadi. <br /> <br /> But there's plenty in this movie - all Japanese movie lovers should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means Heavens Punishment)
