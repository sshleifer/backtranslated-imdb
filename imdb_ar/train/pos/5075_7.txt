A film made of a well-made mill with a tragic ending. Pros: The way the story moves - starts with Soorya struggling to live, followed by a long idea of ​​why he is there. Music. Look is not interested in the life of the police. The negatives: violence and injustice, but I think they add to the real effects. However, it was possible to avoid having the heads of people sent in boxes and bags. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
