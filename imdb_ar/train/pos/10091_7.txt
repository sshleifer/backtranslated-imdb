I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in nearly 30 years, and I was struck by how similar the story line to Rebecca is. As others have said, a young thing has been swept over her feet by a charming and diligent manor, finding her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of larger and deeply complex relatives. You have a tough server and an opponent, a crisis that binds the couple together or irreparably ruptures, or culminates in the firefight of a luxury house. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Elephant Walk also owes him some of the fearsome jungle atmosphere in The Letter, the love triangle Bette Davis on a rubber farm in Singapore instead of a Sri Lankan tea farm. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars, and IMDb readers are no more pleasant, but I enjoyed it though it is predictable. Elizabeth Taylor has never been likable, and Peter Finch does a reliable job as a basically good man unable to get rid of the influence of his arrogant father. Dana Andrews - the favorite in Laura and Best Year in Our Lives - is lost as an admirer of frustrated Elizabeth. The real star is the Bengal, one of the most beautiful internal collections in the history of the film.
