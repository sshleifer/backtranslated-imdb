Not really pulling the box office big, but I was pleasantly surprised <br /> <br /> with this film. James "I did some things for Phra Phoset" Orr <br /> <br /> He co-wrote and directed this film about a mediocre average man <br /> <br /> Larry Burrows, who thinks his life would have been " > <br /> would be incredibly different if he hit a player in a major baseball game <br /> <br /> when he was fifteen. But thanks to the mysterious and magical waiter <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry gets his wish, but quickly realizes that his new life is not exactly as he had hoped to be. <br /> <br /> I must say, this film has really impressed me. Critics have given it a mixed theme, and I must say that the concept is really interesting. <br /> <br /> Well. Yes, this is a few standards, but enough packs <br /> <br /> Funny moments, drama and excellent acting to make it really good. James Belushi (I think) Oscar was worthy of his role. John <br /> <br /> Loftz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton as well as Rene Russo shine their roles. Michael Kane is perfect as a bartender. It's just a good movie with a good lesson. If you've never seen it, I highly recommend checking
