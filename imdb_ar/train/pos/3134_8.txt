This was a well-written story entitled "Making Batman the Comic Game" and reunited our heroes in a great endeavor, as the history of their television shows progresses. Unlike the Brady's and Family Partridge films, we do not take a look at the life of Adam and Bert in the past and the present, but also see it at work. Batman is full of Babu, Katywoods and Rider (s), Batman is back in a good story, not only gives us a satisfactory closure of the Batman series, but fills the current fans with all the Hollywood stories about them that are not appropriate "were heard 35 years ago. <br /> <br /> Glory !!!
