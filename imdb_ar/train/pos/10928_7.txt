The deceased Kung Fu sends his last student to trace what happened to the five former students who were members of the banned Poison Clan. It is to see if they are acting for good and if it is not him to stop them. Master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who has fled with clan money that the master wants to use for good. All students were taught early in a different snake style, centipede, scorpion, orchid, frog, while the last student was taught a little in each pattern. All the students in one city end up looking for the old man with all the money, and soon everybody struggles to get the money. <br /> <br /> The classic martial arts film has a title so many non-fans know. I spoke with two unusual fans and it seems that this is the only film that sticks in their heads. It's a very good film, although I'm not sure why this movie will stay with people when my money is better than the Shaw studio (the Swordmen series or the Brave Archer series, for example). This is not to sell the film in short, it is not, since the film is structured like ambiguity, our hero has no clue about the identity of any person and the toxins themselves know only at best what is the other. We've got four IDs but we still have to determine who is V really. The film is also strange because for a martial arts film, unlike the initial training sequence and the killing of the old man and his family for money, there is really no activity for 40 or 45 minutes. It's a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and performance draws your attention. (The film is also strange in his first martial arts film, and I think I've seen him anywhere where there are no women.) I do not think there's a role to talk and I'm not sure either of them will appear in the background. It's a good little movie that may not live up to the reputation it enjoys in some circles, but it's still a really good movie you can enjoy on the couch. <br> <br /> About 7 out of 10.
