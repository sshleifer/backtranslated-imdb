I loved this small chain. Tara Fitzgerald has done a wonderful job of portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding with her little son from the mysterious past. As a lover of romantic love ... this movie was just a cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours in England in 1800. I must also mention that Toby Stevens who depicts the Gilbert Markham magnet is very meaningful is reason enough to watch This wonderful production.
