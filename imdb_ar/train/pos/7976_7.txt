Revenge is the theme of Denzel Washington, which offers its share of action, chaos, murder and bloodshed. The basics are the search and destruction mission of a bodyguard, where young Dakota Fanning is abducted from school, which is exactly what Washington has been set up to prevent. The Mexico City sites are chaotic as the story line moves towards its violent end, predictable as the plot unfolds along the way. Washington, a former CIA agent suffering from a drinking problem, gets a good signal from a former colleague who puts a planned scheme. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after an annoying start, the personal guard becomes his best friend. Christopher Walken, Rachel Tikotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke are good actors in supporting the two stars.
