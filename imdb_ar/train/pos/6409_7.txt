I did not hear about Berchir before I saw this. This is the story of the man who trained and helped him to become the first American-African diver. The story of the will of power. The plot is well written and develops well throughout. That's what it looks like, the usual underdog thing, and does not carry much surprises. It's also absolutely Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the actual guy, maybe be close to the fact of what actually happened. However, the task is accomplished, with dramatic scenes and tribulations along the way, and this is inspiring to anyone who has ever heard the words "No, you can not" talk about their lifelong dream. Performance acting is all excellent. Both DeNiro and Gooding Jr. When they are on the screen. Rapaport is awesome, as well. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is good editing, and features a good cinematography. The production values ​​are high, and this leads to a somewhat convincing task in our transfer to the 1950s. This is the only film I have seen before this director and writer, although I may now consider looking at more of their responsibilities. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise no offensive material. I recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting and / or fans of those who made it. 10/07
