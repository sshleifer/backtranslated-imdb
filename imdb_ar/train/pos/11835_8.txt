While I wanted to watch this film from the first time I saw the trailer, I was very surprised by this film. While some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a bit cartoon, the dark nature of the film makes this experience quite different. Instead of a happy feeling, this film takes you in another direction that proves to be flamboyant but also troubling. Most children will not understand some of the darkest moments in the film, making this movie popular with adults. I was also impressed with the cinema, using animation and digital animation to create a smooth grid of pans and tilt. The musical result was solid again, proving that Hans Zimmer is the right person when it comes to scores of animations, and I never thought I would say I really enjoyed Bryan Adams music.
