I really like the Star Trek Hidden Frontier, a fantastic fan series, and I can not wait to see more. I just started watching this series of movies last week and I can not get enough of it. I've already recommended watching other people because it's worth seeing. I've seen each episode already many times and I'm waiting to see more episodes coming out. I have rated him ten, but I think he deserves 12 congratulations. My greetings to Star Trek Hidden Frontiers staff on an excellent mission. If you like Star Trek I highly recommend watching a fantastic fan movie. The details associated with this series of films are excellent especially the ships and planets used in them
