"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his film "Beverly Hills Policeman". And although it's not as good as "Cop", it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy's stars play a role in discovering the children who have lost their most unusual condition. His mission: to find the title character, a child with inner powers. This film can be titled "Beverly Hills Cop and Temple of Doom" because parts of this movie play like Spielbergian Adventure, a somewhat Indiana Jones comedy. She got a comedy with laughter, and adventure with special effects. a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
