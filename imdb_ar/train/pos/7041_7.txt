WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomey, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Eckroyd, Serge Trivonovic, Ljubomir Nikov, and Nad Bellamy (voice: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> " STRANGELOVE "of the 21st century" Miss "<br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? Who co-wrote the script with Mark Lenner and Jeremy Bixer ?? The stars as a successful man named Brand Hauser are burning but he decides to follow him on one last mission to freeze a Middle East oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, not Omar Sharif, but you get the tone here from this imbalance) for laughter) (Read: Iraq / Afghanistan) to the American private company Tamerlin (read: Halliburton) (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) ). <br /> <br /> While the brand is surrounded with clarity when bold journalist Nathalie Higusin (Tommy) confronts her and finally falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Tamerlin is nurturing the unlikely union of teenagers in Eastern Europe, Unica Peppia (a warm and surprising duff, recognizing her familiarity with the tongue through the cheek) and a foolish son of the country's leader. <br /> <br /> The following is a bold attempt at a black comedy of the 21st century, "DR STRANGELOVE", but for all purposes and purposes, there is unfortunately much more loss than blows in this vast attempt of laughter amid a political message Fairly being outsourced by American capitalism, check out! <br /> <br /> While Cusack follows Martin Blanc from "Pointe" above, he adds some nice touches to his leg in black (he shoots Tabasco sauce to take the edge Distant), hunting for the rest of the actors (except for Sister Joan, who was a rioter as a high-camp helper Button and has one of the most laughable lines in the film: "mass communication skills" and finally bear fruit ") for the most part. <br /> <br /> Kozak visited the Iraq war earlier this year in 180 different degrees" Grace Is Gone Despite the general admiration, the rhythm of the film and its rhythms did not come thanks to the great director Joshua Seftel for the first time in making his first film (notable) except perhaps the huge battle designed well, Hauser shares with the fiancÃ© Babyyeah Fathi . /> <br /> A nice attempt after a misguided failure; perhaps next time Cusack will not try hard and let the crap of war speak for itself rather than do the heavy lifting itself.
