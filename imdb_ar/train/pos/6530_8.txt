I last read a book by Nancy Drew about 20 years ago, and perhaps a lot of my memory of the fictional character was wrong. From my collection, the books were presented to me in an era when teenagers were popular with children who grew up at the time (for my case, the 1980s and early 1990s), Hardy Boys, Fife Five, and, of course, Caroline Keane Nancy Drew was among the most famous . I still remember those books that contain a very dated illustrated cover, usually very heavy (for the child) to hold on to, and the thickness of the book may be due to the fact that the words are printed in large lines. <br /> <br /> Well, some updates have been given to the character along the way, as I remember Nancy Drew's sister-in-law following my sister has become less rich, with a soft cover, updating and updating Nancy more clearly on the cover. I can not remember whether these stories are the same old stories, but I think these books, which are being written in a subtle way, have their fair share in modernizing themselves for the times. <br /> <br /> In this version of Nancy Drew's Warner Brothers, the character is updated to suit the age, but writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Poulsen kept their sensibilities in their fifties and thus retained some of the magic and flavor they evoked. Her sense of fashion, primacy and suitability, and even some of the peculiar little behaviors that make her, well, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> Her family background remains the same, with her only father, Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who moves his daughter and himself to the big city to get a better job and to keep his daughter from smoking in River Heights. My mother is only a distant memory, and the maid makes a veil. But what made Nancy Drew work, is picking Emma Roberts in the leading role. Her famous niece Julia, she also possesses this gentle behavior, unshakable red hair and a megawatt smile. Her Nancy Drew, while initially appearing to be stuck in the wrong way, will actually grow up on you. In what I thought could be an ominous scene from Pretty Woman, the characters were entering an elegant shop with almost opposite reactions. <br /> <br /> Dad Carson Drew is trying to bring Nancy to her narrow fortune. The environment and assimilation in the lives of natural teenagers, Nancy felt to find herself living in a house whose owner, a Hollywood type, was found dead in suspicious circumstances. Resolving the mystery is her comfort food when she finds herself pariah for the local fraternity, not long before we drink it with her on her big adventure on the screen. <br /> <br /> There is nothing too black about Dahlia crime and mystery, instead it is a simple and direct piece of Nancy's solution, between the friendship of Corky (Josh Flitter) a full friend of the school, and calm her jealous boyfriend Ned (Max Thieriot) , While hiding the fact of her extra study activities from her father. The story unfolds with the fun and passion of the old that embodies its magic, and together, the game of Scooby Doo becomes somewhat famous. With minimal violence and the absence of large gun battles or explosions, this is a dangerous thing that has been clearly identified on the alert "chick flick". <br /> <br /> I think the film will generate a new generation of fans, reviving the memories of the old, and probably, probably, igniting a new fashion trend of shark shark sports.
