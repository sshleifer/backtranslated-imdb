Immediately after the end of World War II, Powell and Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to remedy the growing rift between the United Kingdom and the United States of America. At that time, there were a lot of comments "excess, sex, here". Somehow they came to this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie at all times. I've got everything. Romance, poetry, passion, religion, drama, and very strange. <br /> <br /> I can never explain why, but he presses all the right buttons and although I've seen him hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still sure I'm crying at many points. <br /> <br /> Was it wonderful acting, wonderful collections and inspired text? Who do you know? But * DO * watch it and you'll see what I mean.
