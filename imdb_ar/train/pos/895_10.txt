I saw this movie. This film is the best as needed today. Pony in marriage is the main problem at present. In mentioning this problem, this movie is the best. In this film, Indian values ​​are well mentioned. Young people today must understand this problem. There are fewer girls. Because of the problem of this dowry, the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, the day when there is no child is not far away. Therefore, bear in mind this statement, young people today must understand that we can not take the dowry in marriages. We have to learn from this film that the dowry should not be taken. If we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in society. This is a major change in society.
