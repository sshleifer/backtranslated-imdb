How can you make a mistake with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them have already died. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's joke about the great musicians who die in kitchen fires while others are useless forever. I'm redrafting here, but you got that idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disadvantaged children fighting against the management of their oppressive secondary school. They are very silly things, but there is optimism about this refreshing (even if they resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students all over the world? Rock 'n' Roll High School is a time capsule of the era people still think that music is important and that it can make a difference in a larger society. It is full of children who know that power does not have the right answers. Instead, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But more importantly, this is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Do not take any of them seriously. Just go and have fun. If that was not what high school life was like in the 1970s, it would be.
