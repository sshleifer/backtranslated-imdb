It's very silly for all the 60's look to the film. The humor was very nice, but it grew much more than I expected. The cast was first class and seemed to pass by a wonderful time. Ostinov walks around in the film, mumbling some very funny things under his breath, all of which makes no sense; I will buy the movie as soon as it appears on the DVD. The plot is that Ostinov was a freak who was released from prison pretending to sizzle the computer and embezzling money from an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, watching them expel from many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is himself the usual deadly, and Karl Malden enjoys the heavy and corrupt executive director who runs the London office. The end is funny and cynical.
