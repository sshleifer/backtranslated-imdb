I was not always a fan, but the show grew on me. It was not until after the fifth season that I began to see the richness of the show. Finally, they ended Daniel Jackson's search for his wife, and finally killed most of the Go team, Lords System Lords were killed by Lords or SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> Towards the fifth season or Stargate SG-1, it's getting old. With new writers and close attention from Peter Deleuise Produer, the show has become more and more solid. <br /> <br /> The characters have become old. Colonel Jack O'Neill was a stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting incident with O'Neill, he decided to end his life by going to Abidos for a confrontation with Go'ould RA. This character offers little growth to any actor, and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play directly with lifting emotional barriers to protect himself. Just let his close friends enter. <br /> <br /> Amanda joined the cast on behalf of Captain Samantha Carter. She was feminist on the edge and ready to fight any man who doubted her ability to perform her job. Although this character has little room for growth, eavesdropping has done a great job of focusing on Carter's strengths. It took some time to get a basic understanding of some of the things that Carter talks about so you can make your personality smart. <br /> <br /> Christopher Gadg joined the cast in the foreign film Teal'c. Teal'c was a foreigner named Jaffa. Baby Gold (like a snake like creatures) will put himself in Jaffa until they grow to a point in another life. Jaffa will die. Teal'c was the first president of the Abovis army. Knowing that Apophis was not God like Golold, he realized the genocidal nature of their armies on the galaxy. Finally, having had enough, he and Jack O'Neill liberated their team with a fair number of innocent people. After reaching Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, and that he would help him fight Go'ould. Christopher Gadg did a simple job with a limited personality. Teal'c is a wise warrior, most of whom he was taught by master Bra'tac. The show will not be complete without Tony Amandula's Master Bra'tac. It is also a rock. In the end, he became an advisor to most SG-1, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Deville There from the beginning played Major General George Hamand. Davis did a great job with Hammond making him sympathetic and natural. He does his work and has a wife, sons, daughters and grandchildren. You can really say, it's the base anchor. Simply put, I will die for this man. If his superiors do not allow him to provide troops to support teams outside the world. Will go himself. He does not leave anyone behind. <br /> <br /> I saved Dr. Daniel Jackson for the last time, because this personality, I think it has grown more than others in the last ten or eleven years. In choosing Shanks, I do not think the product realized how powerful Shanks are. Now when people talk about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, the character of Jackson came out whining. That's why maybe I was not impressed. As the seasons passed, the personality became stronger. This gave him confidence. In the end, beginning in season 10, Jackson's personality grew so mature that he became a hero of self-sacrifice. Still watching the ethics of groups. Is still the leading provider of information that can advance any task forward. Psychology, history, culture and exploration are part of his very existence. It is designed. Although a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to resolve the dispute. <br /> <br /> Other characters include: Val Mall Duran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Broder), a new advance to the SG-1 team. Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they are compiled are any of the guessing corpses. I see a slight difference between Mitchell and Crichton (the character of Versace). The personality of the BlackBerry is simply outside the wall. Certainly different from her soldier like the character of Arin soon.
