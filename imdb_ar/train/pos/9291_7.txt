An exciting look at Japan before opening up to the West. John Wayne is the first consul of the United States to go to Japan in accordance with the agreements resulting from Perry's armed boat diplomacy. It is not welcome. Win eventually wins his meeting with Shogun after the cholera epidemic, introduced by a US ship, is under control. Followed by a colorful motorcade to the capital carrying gifts for Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. Meeting with Shogun, the discussions between the Japanese nobility and assassination during the shooting exhibition provides an interesting insight into politics in this period. All in all, a fairly fun movie, along with the number of times you see the Duke losing his fight with a half-size man.
