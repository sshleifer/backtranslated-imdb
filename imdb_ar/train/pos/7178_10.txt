PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a cute and deceitful movie. It is in fact a complex overview of children's psychology and offers interesting insights into adult development and artistry. On the surface, this is a nostalgic look at some of the home movies produced in the 1980s by a group of upper-class neighborhood children. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, managed to access a video camera and soon became the artistic leader of all the films. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But, this is also much more. This is a look at some of the momentary moments where children struggle with a number of confusing issues that we all face in life - fear, awakening, unwanted love, loneliness, and just trying to understand the adult world that seems to explode everywhere around us. As we age, we tend to forget how the realities of life were overwhelming when we were young. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie more relevant is watching a young man, Darren Stein, turn into a small general for a film director. It is clear that Darren runs this show and these small films are his vision, but they are all aware of his friends and their problems, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children produce home movies, but I have never heard or seen children create "small" films about the Holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war, and the inability to make friends and make friends. These children face and deal with some heavy stuff! <br /> <br /> The power of this film is how Stein and Shell combine different scenes together with interviews with children --- all of whom are now adults and are still friends. This adds a new angle to the movie. How many of us stayed in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. Many of the issues she was dealing with still exist two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - recognition of crushing reveals the heart is still broken, a very natural sexual experience in childhood is still a subject of "sticky" between two men, some constant resentment of the dynamics of relations and there is still a member of the This team is still largely responsible and in the lead! Making you feel perfect when you watch these home movies go on for two years. Darren Stein is the director. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell are chatting with each other from time to time, and one can only imagine the embarrassment of allowing us to be reassured about the lives of these young people. This is especially true of Stein, who was a great success in the entertainment industry as producer, writer and film director. From the very first moment to PUT THE CAMERA ON ME, we can see the appearance of a gay little boy trying to discover everything. We also see aspects of the artistic and personal mind are not always "nice" or "care" --- a bold move for any artist to share with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are many obvious moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments include a film in which we see a victim of a Jewish concentration camp tortured and murdered by the Nazis. We discover through interviews and narration that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and that the victim's part is played by a jealous child. It is a painful and painful moment that hints at the dark side of fear and the way children work through the horrors of the adult world that far outweigh the understanding of adults. <br /> <br /> This is far more than some home movies. This documentary embodies pain, beauty, joy and sadness. Strong things --- worth watching! <br /> <br />:
