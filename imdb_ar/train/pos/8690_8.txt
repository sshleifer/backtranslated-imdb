Alain Resnais' films are strange in a way that they are not really modified for continuity, but instead it seems that the snapshot ends correctly where the memory has been freed. Love to death is sometimes a quiet existential drama and a totally magical virtual reality film, in both cases treating the audience to a completely new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps creating a new relationship, the Agape / Thanatos relationship. <br /> <br /> The beginning is like a strange Surrealist horror film. A woman running desperately around the house while the man dies on his bed - have you killed him or what happened? Tension quickly melts when the doctor arrives and announces his death, but from there begins a new strange drama: the man wakes up, and after his death, the woman and the man fall in love with tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, both priests, are watching and sending their own discussion to the nature of love, faith and devotion. <br /> <br /> It seems that Risenays always has a way to make these types of novels work and amazing in his movies is that these devices are always working. In this case, Resnais intersects the viewer with the fall of snow footage on an exciting orchestra score, fading and bleeding to the subsequent footage that continues the story. Stylized in this style periodically, the film develops a rhythm that is no different from an epic poem, and got strange memories of the Divine Comedy film of Dante from this film, although there is no direct reference within the film. Riznies knows a very poetic film director, but it extends beyond a film structure to something that requires a degree of introspection in the viewer, which has the potential to show some strange memories. Recall memory, creates a messenger. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
