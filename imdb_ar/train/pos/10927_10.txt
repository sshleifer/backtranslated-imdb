This is one of my favorite films of Kung Fu, and is considered one of Xu's most famous brothers from the late 1970s. The plot is interesting and twisted, cool characters each have their own style - frog, snake, orchid, etc. The procedure is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but what is interesting with different kung fu styles is on the display of various characters. I recommend this film to those who think that all Shaw Brothers films, especially Chang Cheh's, are the same. Most of his films focus on the ten tigers and the Shaolin and Manchu conflicts. This film is the breath of fresh air in comparison.
