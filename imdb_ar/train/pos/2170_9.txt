I think that this creator (or creators) of the concept of this film deserves much more accolades than ever before. Of course, it is not an Oscar film, but for me at least this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think this (and I hope it is not) is corrupting, but: imagine acting on your motives. The first thought that comes out in your head, with the first words on your lips ... No restraint, no conscious, nothing hinders you from saying or doing things that, like intelligent adults, know that we should not really say or do. If anything, this film only scratches the surface - it does not go too far. <br /> <br /> While Hollywood seems obsessed with reproducing the old "classics" to try to make use of it today, is not it nice to see them recreate an old film of modest success, to move it to the next level? A little further, or even to explore what the original crew had dealt with or had not dealt with for 20 years? <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion anyway. : s)
