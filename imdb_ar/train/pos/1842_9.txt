Series 2 started a wonderful start! I do not think you need to watch Series 1 to get an understanding of what's going on, but like any series, it's good to feel a sense of personalities and care about what happens to them. This exhibition makes you think this way! It seems that these thirty-four women are living a brilliant and exciting life, but the hypothesis is reasonable and realistic. So the shifts and turns that come with their love and sexual life are exciting to watch, but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women as well. It is about the decisions we make as women and how we are sometimes undermined to certain paths in our lives rather than consciously taking those choices!
