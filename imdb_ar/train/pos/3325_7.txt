Well, I will not usually watch the Varelli Brothers movie. I can not remember ever watching one. I also do not remember watching Jimmy Fallon. Well, I saw a taxi, but I said atonement and forgave me for this mistake. But, this film had Drew Barrymore and I just think it's the best thing. I do not know what it is about, but I smile the whole time I see it. It just captures me that way. I mean I even saw Adam Sandler just to see it in the first 50 dates. How sad this? This was not the greatest baseball movie - it was not supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy who stuck to the one thing he never failed to find something worth abandoning. It had a predictable end, but there was plenty on the way there making it worthwhile.
