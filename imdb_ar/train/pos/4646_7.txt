I did not know what to do with this film. I think that's what it really was. I have never seen a film like it before and I doubt I'll be back again. Glover puts something unique to him. I think I appreciate reading some of his poetry and maybe watching one of his slideshows. I really love this man, he is very strange and I can not help him. Note: I watched this movie before it was done during the final editing, so maybe what I saw and what others saw was different. I know, if you choose to play the movie again. I think I will have to properly influence drugs ...
