This is an excellent fast-paced film by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which is left aside for 85 minutes by supernatural and offers us something more terrifying - evil humans. We are likely to face the benign evil of Jackson Ribbner of Freddie Krueger, and Silian Murphy (Batman Biggins) is doing an excellent job of providing a social killer, friendly, even charismatic. The performances by Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, of The Wedding Crashers) are fantastic. Most of the film happens on a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is a small-scale measure, not a sweeping sweep of cloth, and no less compelling. Cinematography is not something special, although of course one can only do a camera with a passenger plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the story is distorted. There are no deviations, and no sub-schemas confuse the case which is essentially a battle between the main characters. By maintaining his focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to take what is the minimum of the plot and turn it into a fast-paced thriller.
