Eddie Murphy Delerious is by far the most extreme thing I have ever seen. When I first saw her for about two years I was stitches for several weeks afterwards. So far I've seen it 17 again and I still laugh my ass every time. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy was a great comedy standing in front of the Hollywood star. There is no single boring spot in this genius piece unlike Eddie Murphy Rao, which was released in 1987 and has become flat during the middle. If you are not the kind of person who can not stand up, I would not advise you to see him because you will probably hear every 5-10 seconds. This was given 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of all of them at its best.
