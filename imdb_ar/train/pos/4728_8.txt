After watching "Break a Leg" in Vancouver at the release ceremony, I thought it was a very enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> I had a few laughs from the abdominal area and some successful (Eric Roberts in particular) were screaming. I did not hear anything about the actual release date, although I heard it close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but basically a way for characters and attitudes. The script is seamless and smooth, the plot evolves effortlessly and the representation is comfortable but new. This film has received at least one award from each of its film festivals, ranging from 10 to 15 years. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend "Break a Leg".
