No wonder that this movie got 4 prices, it's a movie still standing, no wonder why Paul took 20 years to finish it and talk to Peter Falk finally about his idea. I can understand every part of it, this film will make you cry only tears, or thousands. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman gets a message from his wife about leaving him to find something else, his son takes him out on a road trip to find him, and as they do, they find something lost, a friendship, a loving family Some. At first, you know what will happen, but nothing at all. The story is not so easy from start to finish, it's a journey between father and son, between husband and wife. No wonder Paul Raser took 20 years to write this romantic / beautiful comedy. <br /> <br /> REPRESENTATIVES: 10/10 Well, you can not say anything else What I'm saying, hey is with Peter Falk in it, is the legend All he does in films is magic, when you use Peter Falk in Romance / Comedy What do you think you get it? As a perfect result, it is no wonder that this film is perfect and won many prices. Since Paul Reiser does an excellent job, although he is not always a great actor, this does not mean that this has not actually worked. Peter Falk While Paul Reiser plays the ideal father and son, the rest of the actors are good enough but you do not see them Destiny, just say they are doing what they have to do to get more brilliance. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 does not always work when you use music sometimes, not quite fit but this is not the thing in this movie, perfect music in tune, it makes the film even more convincing. This part of the film will be as good as the other parts, a great soundtrack for a romantic / comedy film of course. <br /> <br /> In general: 10/10 there are lots of romantic movies / comedy tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and what not, but this movie is one of those special ones. It does not happen every day that you can create a story like this, but it takes years of thinking about it. The truth is that what you really need is a wonderful piece to be bought and kept in the human soul and seen when you grow up and see it with your father in old age. That this film will ignite as never before.
