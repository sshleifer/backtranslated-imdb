How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show even before I see it. For three reasons, 1. I was interested in the story, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and please watch the entire first season before deciding that it is bad because I know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy the first season as well as the second season on the DVD and then join the campaign to get season 3 made! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure that many of you "Dark Angel" hate them too. They have something for canning good offers! Do not you all agree?
