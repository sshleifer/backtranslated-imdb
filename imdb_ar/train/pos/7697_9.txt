It's another great movie he first saw on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al). In the late 1980s, I was a relatively newcomer to this genre and I was new only to the big three companies JC and SH & YB. I was not sure what I expected when I paid my hard earned money to see it in the Classic Triple Bill in old Scala. No need to worry, I left this movie without a fuss. If you're a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and do not see this movie, do it now!
