First of all, I will not pay tribute to IÃ±aritu's short film, so I am Mexican and proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I think most reviews focus on their films. Favorite short films (not so); but we forget that there is a hidden recapitulation that revolves around the whole group and may not be very enjoyable for the American people. (Even if that is not the main aim of the producers). <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that most short films do not show the suffering people experienced in WASP because of the September 11 terror attack, but the suffering of other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need evidence about what I'm saying? See, in the short film of Bosnia, the message is: "You cry because of the people who died in the towers, but we (the others = Eastern Europeans) have been crying for a long time about the crimes committed against our women. <br /> <br /> Although the story of Burkina Faso is more in comedy, there is the same idea: "You are angry because Osama bin Laden threw you into evil but we (Africans) have to be more angry, Because our people are dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS for a long time, and no one cares about us as the whole world did with you. " <br /> <br /> See now Sean Penn In short: The fall of the twin towers happy single man (and stranger). So the message is that power and greed (symbolized by constellations) should fall to allow people to see the sunrise and the flower of flowers? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom was suggested by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to vandalism. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (well known for his anti-capitalist ideology) is more rude to go directly to the point: "You are angry because your country has been attacked by the forces of evil, but we (Latin America) A similar history is a worse thing, and no one remembers our grief as the whole world did to you. " It seems as though the creator of this project wants to tell the Americans: "Do you see now, America? You are not the only one who has become a victim of global violence. You are not alone in your pain. Incidentally, we (other = non-Americans) "Only the Mexican, Mexican and French films showed some empathy and compassion for the American people; others like a slap in the face of the American state." "We are suffering from a long time, so we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... By the way, we are sorry because you have tasted your own medicine." , Not equal to the American people.
