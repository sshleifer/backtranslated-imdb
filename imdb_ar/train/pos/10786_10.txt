My sister and I used to rent this every time we get movies and our parents will get so angry (but they leave us anyway) and I like it ... I can not find anyone living near me who knows what I'm talking about ... I'm happy to see I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find this on a DVD somewhere !! I like to see this now only in BC, I loved him very much as a little boy ... I am 15 years old now !!! I remember so much about it ... so I got a fufu little rabbit song from all my friends know the song but not the movie !! I think the little girl got there by moving the slide on her small playground
