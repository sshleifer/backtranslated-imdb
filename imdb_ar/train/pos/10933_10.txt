Be careful with this. Once you have a silent jump, the way you look at it will change to kung fu clicks. You will crave the plot of all the kung fu movies now and you will want a personal depth and sophistication, you will have a desire for mystery and unpredictability, you will need a dynamic camera action and incredible backgrounds. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in one movie of Kung Fu, except 5 deadly poisons! <br /> <br /> It is easy to find a better film than Kung Fu movies at all, and Fynomas blends a rich scheme, full of transformations and turns, with colorful characters (and developed), along with some of the best photographers who came out of the seventies. The success of a loved one depends on the ability of viewers to decode any personality and anyone who specializes in any name. One is Centipede, two is Snake, three is Scorpion, four is an orchid, and five are Frog. Each character has different attributes, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Here lies the hook, learn with the character of the student, and find out who these different men are. We are in his shoes (so to speak), and we have to choose who we trust, and not trust him, just as he does. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot, characters and the great Kapuruk, it's also fun to watch, making it in my book more valuable than any other film of its kind. . It is worth a few hours to capture everything that is going on. Poisons are a lesson about what Kung Fu really can do ... just do not expect other Kung Fu movies to rise to the level of its power.
