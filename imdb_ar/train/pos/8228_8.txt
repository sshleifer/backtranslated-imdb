It's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it. I enjoyed it because I did not expect what I was seeing, but a very ordinary sexual drama .... It's an exciting sexual story, apparently nothing. He presents Emmanuel Sinner, no stranger to the kind (and nudity) that her husband Polansky had ordered her. And creepy performance (I said creepy / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (representative of Bernard Tavernier). Pascal Brockner seems to be meeting Roman Polanski (better than Peter Merrier), such as the loss of Chabrol or Clouzot (I've seen someone like Les Diabolics), but closer to George Frangowe, Yo Sanz, Phage, Dr. Phipps, and more. Jewel! I'm just afraid to blow this up in a remake of Hollywood as they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
