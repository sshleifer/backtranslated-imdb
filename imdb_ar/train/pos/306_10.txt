Well, I saw "They all laughed" when I went out in Europe around 1982 and kept a mysterious but dear memorial. I have just seen her again on the bar, after almost twenty years ... Bogdanovic has a genuine affection for his characters and a gentle sympathy that is also hard to be felt. Excellent actors and actors, good lines everywhere for everyone and very good editing, too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just as we all do, sometimes. Go and bring it.
