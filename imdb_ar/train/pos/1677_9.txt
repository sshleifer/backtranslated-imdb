La Coda Dello Scorpione (known as the Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was a follow-up to director Serrano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the ideal Giallo, which includes all aspects known to lovers of this genre and their love. Twisted twisted plots, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp cuffs, and a bit of loopholes to make one of the pieces of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A collection of gialli favorites, in front and behind the camera, make this one of the best non-Argentine games. There Martino mentioned above adds to his touch as a director, Ernesto Gastaldi the great Giallo as a writer, Bruno Nikolai creates music, and a group of stars and stars Giallo, such as George Hilton, personal representative Luigi Piestelli, and Anita Strindberg. br /> <br /> With all this talent behind it, does Scorpio offer? She defies. The film works on many different levels. It is an exciting murder mystery, a horror film that is tense, violent, and exciting. All in all one of the best gialli around. <br /> <br /> Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. At some points in the film, he appears to be directing Argentino in his approach. For example, there is a direct intrusion into the scene at Bird With the Crystal Plumage where the killer tries to break into the door, which actually outweighs the same Argentinian. <br /> <br /> Are there any problems with the flick? Hmmm ... only minor of them. First, start any scenes that do not follow the murders or romance emerging between the two. But before he falls asleep, the killer will come out of nowhere and return to his rightful place. <br /> <br /> And also, in the end, the fluctuations become a bit strange. I mean, what purpose do scorpion pins really serve? If you do not pay close attention to dialogue, you can easily get lost in the story of knitting and weaving. <br /> <br /> But these minor quirks aside, La Coda Delo Scorpioone is tense, impressive and elegant and everywhere is an entertaining movie for giallo lovers. Looking for!
