Alexander "Sacha" Lozine (John Tortoro) is a former chess player who is trying to return to a tournament hosted by Italy. There was no doubt about his brilliance but his obsession with chess stopped his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who came to the same resort with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James) to identify potential marriage partners. Vera is leaning toward a handsome count, but it is surprising that Natalia is more impressed with Pascha, whom she met on a walk. Sasha, too, is taken with Natalia and proposes to marry at their second meeting. But, with Sascha's focus on chess, and with other events in the past still causing problems, will he win Natalia's heart? Oh, can become a chess champion, too? It is a beautiful film, based on a novel by Nabokov. The representation is amazing, with Watson very well like the rich rich little girl and absolute Turturro perfect as an excited, embarrassing chess game. James gives a great turn because the arrogant mother and other team members are also wonderful. As for the appearance of the film, it can not be better. The scenery of a variety, exquisite classic costumes and cinematography deserves a lot of applause. Yes, the story is unusual and is recounted using memories of the past, making it a film that everyone will not appreciate. Then, too, the end is sweet and bitter. However, if you love romance, or old pieces, wonderful acting, knockout scene, or fine art to create animated images, do not miss this opportunity. You will be unprotected in many magic resistance.
