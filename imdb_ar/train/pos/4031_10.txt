I have been a fan of Indian films since I was four years old, but I have never seen an influential film in my life, especially as an Indian film. In the last few years, she stopped watching contemporary Hindi films and went back to watching the classic films (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.) But this film is not all. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen. I found that not only did I move, but I found it very instructive for someone who is the first generation of Indian women who have worked in America. It helped me to understand my family's history, which was always something too abstract for me. But, "seeing her", her sense and understanding, helped me to empathize with the generations before me and the struggle that the Indian people suffered. The film helped put a lot of things into perspective for me, especially given the current global events. I never thought the film could change the way I think like this before ... It happened. The plot is wonderful, the representation is wonderful and the direction is flawless. Thumb thumb high!
