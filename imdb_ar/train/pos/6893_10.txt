Gerard Phillipe is perfectly ideal in this film, funny, tender, brave, and loving. It gives a wonderful dimension to a film that represents a masterpiece, as represented by other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) as in the story or rhythm. Never dull, and always create new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
