I just love the Malle documentaries. They are effortless and simple but still charming. I have no idea why this documentary works. It is located in about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5,000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But Malle still managed to make it fascinating and interesting. His love of humanity, even of racists or homosexuals, is so overwhelming that you can not only help but also fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle's photos are mostly in 1979. He returned after 6 years to see what had changed. This was a good film without the material after 6 years, but this little addition makes it wonderful. Malle may have been doing what was done in the Up series, but in fact it was not. About People. Malle's focus is not on what happened to everyone but on what happened to this community. And the change is wonderful. 1985 is the reign of Reagan and the farmers suffer. Once a proud community, now no one sees much of the future at all and parents hope that their children will teach them themselves and do something else from agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very relevant today. Our financial crises began today because of what happened then. Just look at these final words in the film, spoken by a senior lawyer from the town (in 1985): "Well, I have high hopes in this country because things are going right now can not It is only in my opinion that it is obsessed with greed, and the nation does not live long with this obsession, especially the democracy that ... good - there is so much - good in this country and lots of good people will not be - they will not participate in this philosophy of greed that occurs Now it's terrible. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately it took more than 20 years and hell a headache before that happened.
