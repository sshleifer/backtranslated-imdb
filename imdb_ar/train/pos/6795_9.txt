One of the most murderous series of intelligent films in modern history. ZODIAC KILLER presents a creative look against the background and history of one of the most famous series killers. Filmmakers create an unexpectedly good vision in the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers the Zodiac will interest him. Others will want to find out more about this mysterious criminal. Unlike many hacker killers, the zodiac was not crazy at all, but was very systematic and self-promoting. The director here plays the viewer's expectations and pulls him. The film is based on a mysterious mystery, or "cool case". It is a clever investigative / procedural horror film that will delay hunting dogs in search of cheap excitement. <br /> <br /> Some people dislike any film being shot on the video. This attitude is very old style and provinces. It's a stand and a film show that places technical issues above the value of entertainment or artistic value. These positions are on their way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low budget film, no doubt, but the discerning viewers will look further and find a carefully designed gem.
