Overall the film is fine. I think it is better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of his story, his emotional value. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that make me touched. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his very good job. brilliant. I can say that his representation is almost normal. <br /> <br /> However, the song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" by director Nina Simon is really "menaikkan" my "bulu" "roma". <br /> </ i> I love the song. Both song. "Ni Mei Kit Pass" and "Hogan". I just downloaded the song. Nice. <br /> <br /> I salute Yasmin. Credit end of the film makes me touched again. We can see how much Jasmine appreciated for her parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 of the 1o stars.
