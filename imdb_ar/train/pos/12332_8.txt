After seeing the shortcut several times in the marathon in horror movies, I think it would be a humorous parody that forms a slash to the main point of its repertoire. <br /> <br /> Although the themes are a little meaningless for today's viewers, it is not a waste of time at all. <br /> <br /> While being a student film is not a lot of an excuse, the evidence is that it shows very carefully with a limited budget. <br /> <br /> As one of the reviewers noted, less than 10 minutes is enough time to clear the viewing palate with joy, sitting and bathing in the thumb position during the film. <br /> <br /> I think this short film should be enjoyed as an entree to return to the title, and the viewer must relax and wrap around.
