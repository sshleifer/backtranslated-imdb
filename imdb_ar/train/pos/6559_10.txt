Roses ring. "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> A mix of West and old hip-hop, all mixed together. All styles of clothing, scenery, and plot are all suitable for what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> The plot - within five years, they stole twenty-seven banks and then disappeared without any trace. Now, a small western town is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. Rose ring is ready to ride again. This time personal. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), chastity (Lil Kim), Maria (Lisarai), Zhang Li (Mary Matiko) and Kim (Stacy Dash), five women kiss fire even after five years of riding together. When Rachel's sister is killed, she ends up assembling her friends again and riding the path of revenge. <br /> <br /> Well, the mud around the western version. (If you've seen "bad girls", it's a bit better in the ways of female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave him 10/10 because the characters, plot and scene made him me.
