I love geebies, the great British Hammer Studios, which made one of their greatest films with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), proved to be more capable of this horror. This is the tenth episode of the short television series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980) entitled Guardian of the Abyss, an introduction to the series. Director Don Sharp, who previously enriched the hammer with "Vampire Kiss" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Monk Monk" (1966) and directed two films "Fu Machu" starring Christopher Lee, His Highness managers, he delivers here as well. Antique jeweler Ray Lonnen stumbles on a mysterious old cry glass. The scream of glass happens to be the object of the devil's worship that you want to use in their satanic rituals. When a beautiful little girl called Alison (Rosaline Landor), who has to be sacrificed by a cult, is confronted with Michael's deeper problem with worship and their evil leader (John Carson) ... While this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of "Hammer House of Horror "(most notably the wonderful seventh episode," The Silent Scream "), it is a very creepy and atmospheric episode. The plot contains many interesting twists, and remains suspicious and quaint throughout the film. Ray Lunen progresses well, and young Rosaline Landor is disguised as an innocent beauty, and John Carson is truly creepy as a demon leader. In general, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and frightening tale of HHH, and Hammer fans should not miss it.
