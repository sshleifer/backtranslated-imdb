I love this movie. Noir's photos along with Spillane's impersonal figure, Mike Hummer, work wonderfully to create a mood and feel rarely found in low-budget detective films in the early 1950s. It may not be the Maltese Falcon but this film makes a strong contribution to this genre. Spillane often criticizes the alleged hatred of women, etc., but his "ladies" outperform their male counterparts in terms of intelligence and intelligence. Poor Mike Hammer, as Biff Elliott played effectively, blinded the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he met when investigating the death of an army friend. When a penny finally drops his face is a picture. It is good to see that censorship in the 1950s did not force filmmakers to delete the famous last line. Good intention low budget classic.
