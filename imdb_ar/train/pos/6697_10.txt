I remember first watching Sabrina when it came to UK TV on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I am now 24 years old and I still love her now as much as I did when I first saw her. I get a small stick from some of my friends because I'm still watching a "children's show" but I do not care! Lol Caroline Rea K "Hilda" is my personal favorite, and Morgan later became my favorite character. I remember spending a lot of time watching many special events that Sabrina honored on Nickelodeoden UK. I love Melissa Joan Hart, she was fantastic in the film "Clarrissa Explains All" but much better. They were gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope to be released soon on DVD here in the UK - I'll be first in a row! Lol s
