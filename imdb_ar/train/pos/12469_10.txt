it is a wonderful movie. I assume that some people think that this may not be based on a true story. Regardless of this !! , The film is wonderful, and all you can think of is not why the balloon with the mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town etc., instead of thinking that "the wish of a little girl has become a reality" means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if We trusted it, and we did everything in this world to make it a reality. The little girl (Desi - in the film), her mother, was the best actor I had seen in a long time. Good for them, for all actors, all for the director. If someone can tell them, please tell them, "A 25-year-old from Romania says thank you for making this film."
