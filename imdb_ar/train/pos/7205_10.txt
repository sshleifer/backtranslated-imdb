Deathtrap is not whodunit. It is he who will do it to whom first. It is very difficult to describe this film without giving up anything until I mention nothing more about the plot. As far as acting goes is the role of Chris Reeves the greatest Clifford, a young playwright. You really see the scope in his acting abilities in this film, ranging from "exhaling the cheese" to the frankly scary. Clifford has a difficult role to play. In the first stage, I did not see Clifford well on both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him as a small puppy or a maniac. Reeves is the only person I've ever seen who has the right personality all the way. As for Michael Kane he is ... well Michael Kane. One of the best actors in the past 50 years and in this film was as good as it ever was.
