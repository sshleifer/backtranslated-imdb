A wonderful documentary, giving a vivid picture of a country deeply divided within itself (for more evidence, check out some comments on IMDb ...!). Compares very positively with "Comandante" to Oliver Stone (who is essentially an in-depth examination of Fidel Castro's nose hair). I do not know whether Chávez is all he is offering, or is he another thing in a long series of Latin American "bristles". I also do not know whether he will be able to meet the enormous expectations that have been clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is hardly reasonable to expect such a film to be able to answer such questions - but I certainly have a vivid idea of ​​what is at stake and how you feel at the center of the coup. Someone says in the film, "We make history," which is exactly what the film seems to embody. Outstanding stuff.
