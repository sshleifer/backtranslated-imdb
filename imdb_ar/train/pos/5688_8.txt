Open Credits: Great. Music: Just right for this movie. Cinematography: embellished to great effect. <br /> <br /> The train wreckage is appalling. This is how some spirits can become out of control. The brutal "wonders" caused by drugs (and their consequences) are not a deviation, but it shows how it actually happens in our society. It is better than shooting another wild group - Manson - because all of Manson's films, books, etc. focus too much on the crazy mind of Manson rather than on the overall picture of cheap fame and randomism that pervades the present. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "acting mode" in the movie, watch Kilmer in this movie. Shows how the "way" can be placed in the right place. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers here succeed in upgrading the "out of control" level to an artistic format, not just in order to give us a thrill cheap.
