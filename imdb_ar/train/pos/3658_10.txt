This film is like the story of the gospel. It has such a direct honesty and innocence that you can not believe it took place after the World War when Italy was devastated and destroyed, and it was filled with large numbers of displaced and poor populations. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human soul, as well as to the endless creative resources of this land of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Tutu is a character like the "idiot" Doestoevisky, a modern Christian who finds his way into a big city. It is good and purity, fortified with love, and his actions change the people he faces, such as the dove of miracle work. The story is recounted in a natural way and a simple style, yet it is saturated with charm that is almost an obsession with surreal fantasy villains. It is one of the most inspiring and sophisticated films ever.
