Makers chose the best people for the job, and set a fantastic scene. Each interior is full of details that tell you everything about the people who live in it. Whether the period is the 1920s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) of the middle story, or the twenties (the latter), the fashion and settings are lovingly monitored and created. I love the sexy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - the wonderful lace that is covered by the most beautiful Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but do not mind young fans, Raymond Huntley is the man who displeases his wife's health and independence that disturbs our emotions. He used to play copious comedies, but here he is clever, persuasive and very influential. The Sea of ​​China (a superb film in the 1930s of the Gabel and Harlow starring) plotted the episode of Mr. Null's episode (also warned the story of Kepling). I wish to see more Naunton Wayne as a jealous husband - although he enjoys good moments in a Mexican hat. I love this luxurious bird that also plays his wife.
