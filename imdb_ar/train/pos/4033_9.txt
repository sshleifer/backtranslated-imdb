Many reviewers have pointed out that Pinjar is not like the films of mills produced in Bollywood. Although this is true, Bollywood films in general are directed to a specific audience and should be appreciated to achieve their goals in this regard. <br /> <br /> However, the Pinjar is an excellent movie for those seeking a change from the usual Bollywood-based equation. During the period of separation between India and Pakistan, Bengar focused on the Punjabi girl who became a victim of social and cultural attitudes towards the timely treatment of women. Barro, the hero, is forced to choose between life with a kidnapped man and the quick hope of life with her family in Punjab who ruled India. More than a case of Hindus and Muslims, Binding describes the role of women as a daughter, wife, and mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike the typical Bollywood films that survived in nature, Bingar makes his audience think about these issues during and after the film.
