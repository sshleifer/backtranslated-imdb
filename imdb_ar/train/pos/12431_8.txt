Well, frankly, I saw previews of this film and I thought to myself, What do producers think? Houghton, Julie and Duchovny? How can a monotonous actor compete with Jolly's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, the two had a kind of chemistry that showed intense care without kissing. Even the spirit of humor invented by David was suited to Julie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played the role of psychic well, in contrast to David's pacific presentation of life-threatening situations. Overall, I was very impressed with writing and personal development. I gave it 8 stars.
