2000 was a bad year for Indian films because of the lack of quality and imagination from directors. Unlike the frustrated and Kaho Nea Pierre Hai did not stand anything. CCCC faced a lot of irregularities because of the financing of the film, and this with no real knowledge of the theme of the film, resulting in the emergence of good publicity and ticket sales for the film developed around India and abroad. The only information provided is that it's a suspense story. The film was released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The main plot is to do with the wombs and are handled well. Salman and Britti offer good performance where Salman does not really take a shirt at all .. Must have special effects !! Rani plays the role of Salman's wife, but she plays a less demanding role compared to Pretty playing the role of a prostitute who eventually becomes a mother. The three main evidence, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, confirm that they have a solid substance on the screen and outside the chemistry of the screen (apparently). Salman Khan plays a serious role in the film as a successful businessman and it is regrettable that he is being used as a comedian in his other films because of his exploitation of filmmaking in Mumbai partly because of the films he chose. Rani's character does not know that Britti is a whore until the end ... that's what's left of her and the rest of the family ... the rest you should know because she will destroy the movie if I tell you. All the songs are well filmed especially dekhne walon and title song title. Other supporting actors are making a very simple effort, such as Salman's loving family. Abbas Maastan produced a success and handled the theme of the film with elegance .. I say go and see or rent it as you prefer!
