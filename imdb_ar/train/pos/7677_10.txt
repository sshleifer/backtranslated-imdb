Wow, this film has had a big impact on me. It's an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia who was sold in the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The movie was realistic, the film was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone going away from it wanting to help make a difference with this terrible problem. <br /> <br /> The content of the movie was very, very moving. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The girl <br /> <br /> playing Holly is doing a wonderful job with her character. Ron Levinstone gives a wonderful performance. The film took me to tears, telling an important message to be heard all over the world. Everyone should go to see this movie. I think this film will make a difference, I loved it!
