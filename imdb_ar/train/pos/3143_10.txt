If any display in the past ten years is worth 10, this is a rare gem. It allows us to escape to a time when things are simpler and more enjoyable. This hearty and laughing show makes you laugh in three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and even the medicines were acceptable. Feather hair, music was accompanied by skis, and as Merle Haggard said, "The Joint was a bad place" taking the journey back to the greatest time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and the essence of a good town feel where people were nicer to each other. This classic on TV as much as "full house". Do not miss it, always remember "get rid of your groove !!!"
