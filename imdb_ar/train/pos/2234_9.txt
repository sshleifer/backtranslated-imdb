Although the "special effects" and technical features of this film may actually be funny to some, I was never able to erase the images that this film dug in my small and weak mind when I first saw it at about 8 years of age. The story of the survival of this girl and the experiences that she carried with me throughout these years remained, and I thought again on more than one occasion about how the girl got out of positions that go well beyond anything I saw. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was a child only when I saw it for the first time may be the reason for my high rating for this film. Every time this movie is broadcast on television in the 1970s and 1980s, I will be preoccupied with television, and drink alcohol in every scene with interest I can not explain. I suppose to see this for the first time as an adult (with a shaky vision of the world) may not be fun for some. I've already come out of a way to get a copy so I can view this movie on my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you're a great fan of survival, partly in Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazon, I think you might enjoy this movie as much as I've enjoyed it for the last 30 years.
