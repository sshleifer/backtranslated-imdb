I am only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five years old and saw it continuously until I was 7 years old. Then I grew up thinking that Full House could wait and I had "more important" things to do. In addition, there was the fact that my younger brother, who had faithfully watched her for all these two years, began to hate her, thinking he was "girly". <br /> <br /> Then I realized every afternoon at the age of five that he was 23 and became addicted to it again. Full House made me laugh and cry. He made me realize how nice it would be if our world were like Full House and Mom. I have heard of people saying that Bean House is cheesy and unreasonable. But look at the big picture: Three girls My mother was killed by a drunken driver. The sisters fight and move their feelings. The three men who live with the girls can enter the race at times. What is more realistic than that? <br /> <br /> If anything had lifted me into the gallery when I was at the bottom I grew up when I thought I was in full happiness. She drowned like a hyena in the show and gained a great obsession with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hillary Dove has taken this point now but she was really the best child I've ever seen.) They are great actresses and seem to be very nice.
