This movie shows the type of work the group wants in each movie. Barbara Payne and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are chillingly positive, discussing "family business" as if they were grocery stores or dry cleaners. Messi, Campbell, Ullman, and Ritter are also fantastic. They play with each other like members of a first-class theater group, realizing that a good product requires each actor to support others without selfishness. Finally, there is Sami (David Dorfman). What an amazing performance of a child ... and what a stranger is like with Ullman, who plays his son! <br /> <br /> We have dealt with a unique story in "Panic", and these are rare these days from Fatigue Formula Crap. The dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and this relatively short film has the ability to devise a full range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to shock, to terror, to sadness, to enthusiasm, to anger, to love. It's not a movie that lets you jump for joy, but when it's over, you're more than happy to know you've spent the last ninety minutes in a good work experience. <br /> <br /> More of us go to the theaters if we are treated with a quality fare like this. When will the forces in Hollywood wake up? It's a real shame when something like this fails to get beyond festivals and families who are lucky enough to own a cable.
