Watching "The Fox and the Child" was a scary experience. The lush images, the integrity of the point of view, the absolute beauty of the setting and the characters left me in an atmosphere of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The plot is not complicated. Simple and deceptive. Inside that simplicity container, a world unfolds and leaves you without a soul. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I have learned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can trust in yourself - give yourself more. I dare say that it is a loving act dedicated to any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the viewer - at any age - and reveals the world through new eyes, as if viewed from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that real art attracts the viewer beyond the point of view of ecstatic participation in reality. I feel fortunate to see - no, to participate - this film, a real work of art.
