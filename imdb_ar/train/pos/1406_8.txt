Do you remember ah? C. Wales "Invisible Man"? Well, here's another movie like him, just more extreme. The "hollow man" does not resemble a single story about the secret as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastien Caen, a scientific genius who goes into the underworld and makes it useful for military purposes. Initially the serum was made the easy part, and the person making the back was not. Most of the first attempts ended with unstable. So one night, when the formula is perfected. It is another, but Kane will be a laboratory rat. The gorillas were first and almost dead, so when it came, they were very close. So when Ken did, he decided to use it for fun. Then when he was tired of not seeing him, the team made every effort to bring him back to the flesh. However, the vision formula does not work the way it should work, and Ken will accept the madness. So he ends up being an invisible and insane killer. It would be better to get out of the city instead of killing the lives of people close to you. I care less about people who have made a mistake. Fantastic movie, lots of fun. 3 of 5 Stars!
