I entered this excellent program in about the fourth season and since then I have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on the DVD and continued to improve and improve with seasons 9 and 10. Richard Dean Anderson may not now have the addition of Ben Broder and Claudie Black, Strength is even greater and more authentic after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, now the sci-fi channel has gotten rid of this amazing show without any hope for season 11, there are two direct DVD movies and hopefully more. Atlantis remain strong in their fourth season. There is a third spin in the works, where the Stargate franchise is no longer near death. This TV show is a must for all science fiction lovers and people of the species because it contains a wide range of things that attract all ages and all kinds of people saw IT !!!!! 10/10
