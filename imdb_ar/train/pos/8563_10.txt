The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni", written by Marin Breda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that has become something like the Bible or Hamlet's story, very popular and difficult to obtain Because of its satirical content on the communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual, human, man in a "red" world. A film full of passion, fear, sex, and all the wonderful ingredients of a great movie title. One of the greatest Romanian films, despite its psychological load (after all, it is a European film).
