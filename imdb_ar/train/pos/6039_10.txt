He was lucky enough to be an extra in this wonderful film and loved every minute of the film. I went to the prime minister in London and had a wonderful conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin and John as my wife did. Then a few weeks later he made a trip to the cinema with members of our cycling club. What a wonderful movie, it's worth being there with all the great biker movies. Now we have a DVD Su my wife can not get enough of him and the kids can not. I get a little stick from the club that seems to think I'm a movie star right now, well, one can only dream. I think they only feel jealous. The only downside in the first part of the film was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we were in Wales. Hope there will be follow up so keep me posting John. Danny Beck
