The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of two, we get the final installment. Here's my article: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the coats of those who know everything. He has been working for a very long time. This time, it ends. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum has a fantastic plot, brilliant writing, a wonderful direction, suspense and some of the best events of the summer. Matt Damon probably delivers his best performance so far. He has the conviction and desire of the troubled killer. <br /> <br /> There is some smart humor and some good suspense. Reactions to certain events will make you either laugh (in a good way) or rejoice. (Or both) I heard a lot of smart laughter in the theater and a lot of applause. The audience loved him. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum offers everything in a beautifully wrapped package. All goods then some. This, in my opinion, is the best film this summer. <br /> <br /> The last word: an excellent conclusion. Best trilogy. This is how the summer thriller should be done. I love the Bourne trilogy.
