Having just seen the A Perfect Mini Spy series at one go, one can do nothing but one hat - a wonderful masterpiece, compared to other Le Carr√© minis about Smiley, having quite different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the short story about Smiley, Alex Guiness, like Smiley, is the one who steals the show - and the rest of the actors support it only, one might say. <br /> <br /> Here, the group and an important story, as the main actor, played by Peter Egan in an excellent way in recent episodes, is not attractive at all. <br /> <br /> Egan plays the role of someone called Magnus Pem, who loves lying and tells him and tells people what he wants to hear, very well, big and small. The only person who seems to understand himself is Alex's interior, his Czech treatment. <br /> <br /> The machine was never told behind the spy and / or the traitor at all! After pursuing his life from a very young age, we fully understand what makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and falsify everything is what makes him "an ideal spy," as he calls his Czech treatment. <br /> <br /> By following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to return to the straight and narrow path once it has deviated from it. It's about him, even if he does not get anything economical from him, except for promotion by MI5 spy masters. Everyone is happy, as long as the flow of false information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father, played wonderfully by Ray McNally, is a good-natured man who always dreams of schemes to keep people away from their money. In subsequent years, his son must save him repeatedly. But by the example of his father and uncle, who takes over as a guardian when his father goes to jail, and his mother is sent to asylum, Magnus quickly learned early that lying was the way of life, not telling the truth. At first he was a little overpowered, but he soon learned to say the right lies, to be steady, not to change the stories from time to time, because he tells those who want to hear about himself and his father. <br /> <br /> Alex, played by Rudiger Weijang, has been developing a network of non-existent informants, with the help of Magnus, which has been providing the British MI5 with false information for years and years, just as the British did with German spies who were active in the kingdom The United States before and during the war - continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the clients themselves had turned themselves in, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> The young boys who play with Magnus in the younger years do so beautifully, most of them are more attractive than the older ones, and a little more ironic, tired, Bim, played by Egan. But you buy the difference easily, as that is the way we often change life, from enthusiasm to sadness or indifference. <br /> <br /> Already worth the money!
