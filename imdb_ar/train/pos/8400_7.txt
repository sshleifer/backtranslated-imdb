I picked up this film in my local library. After meeting the director at a film festival late last year, I was intrigued to "check" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film takes a fresh look at familiar themes, love, infidelity, friendships and jealousy. It can be "fresh" a little at times but not as much as the movie drowns perfectly. I enjoyed seeing a love story with characters from CLEARLY together and watching it make conscious decisions rather than randomly "falling" into something as important as love. <br /> <br /> The contrast between this film and the average low-budget black shoot film is quite distinct. check it out. If you are lucky, your copy will be available with a copy of the soundtrack as you did to me. Good things!
