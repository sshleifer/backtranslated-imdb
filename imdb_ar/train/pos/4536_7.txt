Written by the writer who coined the excellent Murder Rooms series that recounted the adventures of ACD with Dr. Joseph Bell, I was looking forward to this and was not disappointed. The move was very slow, with a great focus on Doyle's frustration of Sherlock Holmes who was very accurate and excellent. It has been an interesting personal study and has been filmed very well (on digital video, unusual for a while). The acting was great in all respects, especially Tim McKinry and Brian Cox, although the actor who filmed the Asian Cooperation Dialogue, whose name I can not remember, did not impress me. An excellent personal study has the same degree of volatility as any normal state of Sherlock Holmes. Do you see this if you get the chance
