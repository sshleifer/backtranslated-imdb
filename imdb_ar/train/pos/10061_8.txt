One of the most disgusting foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The young girl has amazing talent. Her star shows (Doggie), The Old Man (Masked King), and Liang (the Boddhisatva Live). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The unfortunate treatment of children, especially females, is worrisome. <br /> <br /> I loved music. The original Chinese dialogue increases the intensity of emotional presentations and stories. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you should see fun, although it is not for very young children. A DVD version would have been rated higher if the sound was transferred better on a DVD and the transfer might have included a widescreen version.
