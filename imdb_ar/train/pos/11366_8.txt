A fascinating and compelling drama about the search for the famous Russian murderer Andrea Chicatello. A remarkable performance by Stephen Ree, the forensic scientist in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress being the Russian government, particularly the old Communist Party members who wish to maintain a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film contains a fundamental theme about the deterioration of communist society, and the progress made in the search for the killer is reflected in the progress of social and political change in Russia, which was subtly put forward. There is a conflict between the old ways and the new roads, these are represented by the two views of the head of Ria (played by Donald Sutherland), and the same hypocrisy. These are initially polarized, with Sutherland "high" in the system down, and Rea "low" on the ground, looking for. However, they have a common reason? To catch the serial killer. <br /> <br /> The relationship between these two films evolves throughout the film, and the tension gradually eased until Rea, Sutherland, Rea and Sutherland receive mutual respect at the end of the film. The killer is captured, and Glasnost comes symbolically. Excellent script. <br /> <br /> More credits go to the performance of Sutherland, a wonderful and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as a murderer whom we despise but can not deny, and Max von Sido, who completely convinces that he is a humble psychologist who risks his reputation for help.
