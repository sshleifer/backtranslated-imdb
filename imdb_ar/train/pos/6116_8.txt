This film is like a mermaid. Either love him or hate him. If you go to this movie expect an appropriate film with good production values, this is a good plot and wonderful characters will hate it. If you go to this movie expecting a budget drop, you'll probably hate it. <br /> <br /> If you go to this movie you expect to see one of the most crooked characters that you put in the Harry Russo movie you will love. John Giancaspro is very cool in his portrayal of the best image of Crazy Coke Crazy Killer. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very bad at best but who really cares? If you are one of the people who are willing to watch the movie "The Whore Mangler", I have seen dozens of horror movies full of holes. Through the budget, this film was produced even if they tried it, maybe it would have been better to have done it at best. I would rather be able to laugh at something bad than not be influenced by the medium. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, you might hate this movie but if you are one of the few who decide to see it anyway, it would be the best thing since the # 2 bread slices I hate the marmite.
