Ride with the Devil, like Brokeback Mountain in Ang Lee later, is a film of aesthetic and historical significance. Cinema lovers should see it at least twice because technical differences deserve to be understood more. <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of art, an amazing depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, I'll shut it up, it will change your current concept of history and politics, and will restore your faith in humanity. After seeing a lot of killings, a lot of suffering, you do not feel drugged; instead, you cherish the bond between humans more. The performance of the actors chases your heart, and the music is moving your mind. Some buds, not just images, they transcend themselves, become a vision of the soul. This is the true meaning of the film being a kind of art. <br /> <br /> A film like this does not need long comments or comments, everything that it says itself. A tribute to actors including Toby Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Joel Kilcher, cinematographer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, What an Accomplishment!
