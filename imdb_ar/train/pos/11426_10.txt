I think this film would be more fun if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 1950s and 1960s rather than a story. Because there is no real story here. Just one small plate above the other like small light dots that do not mean much until you have enough to draw a picture. The first time I saw chocolate, I did not get it "until I thought about it for a few days and then realized that there were a lot of things to be" acquired ", including the decolonization that was just around the corner, not just a conspiracy. The scene at the airport with the short shower and the beautiful music is the huge hair.If you like the "dramatic" movies, you do not see it - you'll feel bored to tears ... but for some of you ... you can thank me later To recommend it to you.
