This film is not a kung fu movie. This is a comedy about Kung Fu. If Sammo Hung before making the film did not spend time watching movies by the great French comedian Jacques Tate (for example, Jour de FÃªte), he is definitely on the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the movies come hilarious. But it is not for all tastes. Some told me they hated his work. I have never found out why, but I think the reason why the character he plays usually is completely dead, and is not affected by the events surrounding him (which is usually caused) so many of them lack the most spectacular comic bits that occur around him. <br /> <br /> In any case, the main idea - or at least his famous fame - is to take a small bourgeoisie that is perceptibly upright with nineteenth-century sensitivities and put it in France in the twentieth century where it must confront a society that is defined Largely through the gradual erosion of those sensitivities. He usually experiences serious difficulties with small things such as record players or radios. It's dangerous in a car, but the world is not safer when riding a bike. But through all this, he has never lost his likeness, and derives from his internal recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the character played by Sammo Hung himself is a rural boy coming to the big city of Hong Kong, quite convinced that what makes the city interesting is that Bruce Lee has filmed Kung Fu movies there. This puts him in trouble in small ways, because he takes a big step that can never be observed in a small but inappropriate city in a big city - like the moment when he seems to urinate in the street, a policeman stops him, only to discover that Hong is actually just water pressure from His shirt, soaked during an occasional dip in the bay. The interesting thing about this loophole is that Hong does not understand what the policeman's fuss is about - in a rural town, as long as you do not look for anyone. In other words, Hong is not really urinating on the street - but he will certainly do it - and what is responsible for the problem? Of course Hong's obsession with Bruce Lee makes him face great problems as well. Knocks a gang of thugs who refused to pay his uncle the owner of the restaurant. Of course, in Bruce Lee, the thugs will be considered defeated, and they have learned their lesson. But in Hong Kong, unfortunately, the thugs come back when he does not exist, to overcome his uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hong finally wins in the end, just as he always does. Such characters must always win (at least in comedy) because they are completely innocent, and on this, despite the comedic flaws and misunderstandings, they truly represent what is best in humans whom we admire and wish to be. Do not really want to be Bruce Lee (who has to lose all his friends' loss before he gets a chance to beat the bad guys), we in our innocence really want a world where my tournaments are possible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this world exists only in the film. <br /> <br /> "Ah, but what if ...?" - In this question we find Sammo Hung in his best comics.
