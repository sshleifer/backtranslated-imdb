First of all, do not call this a new version of movie '63. Although this version is harder to play theatrical, it is very long. It was good molding with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good choice for casting. She was about 30 years old when she did this film, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while, he gave me a headache. Tyne Daley overcame her role as Kemmy Peterson. George was witty and funny like Harry McAfee, and showed that he could hold a melody. Like '63, they made an unknown play for Conrad Birdy. Mark Codych enjoyed the role played by Birdy. I even have soundtracks and I love listening to his songs. So what made this flipping on TV flounder? It was long for anyone. They put new songs and scenes. Although some new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), were they really necessary? Now do not get me wrong, I loved it, but I prefer watching the movie '63 (see my review). This was just a case of some actors over-doing roles, making some changes, and again, LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. They do a good job with the role and the music. Give her any words and she can sing them. Here are the tips from someone who produced a couple of Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to watch an armed show on stage, watch '63. If you want to see a healthier version to run, see the "95" version. Just take it in moderation though. Do not be a hero and try to see them all in one session.
