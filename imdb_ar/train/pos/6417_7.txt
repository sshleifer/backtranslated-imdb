The inspirational story of Carl Bracher (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, aspires to be the first black submarine in marine history. We have shown a series of childhood struggles that must be overcome by Bracher to realize his dream (and thus keep him alive). No less challenges is Master Bell diver Sunday (Robert De Niro), the main instructor in the send diving school sent by the Navy to Brashear, who does not particularly sympathize with Brashear's goals, but eventually becomes a friend and supporter unlikely. <br /> <br /> This is a good film; fast paced and with lots of work, although PIC does not "work" in the natural sense of the word. There is also a very human story here, and an interesting study of racism and conflict to overcome; there is also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers ("Old Navy" versus "New Navy"). The offers are very good - especially Goodings. I thought that DeNiro was probably a little higher in his portrayal of the one (though, who knows, Sunday may be that kind of loose gun) as the filming of Sunday's wife Gwen (by Charlize Theron) made me wonder that these parts were also "shaken" to provide value For entertainment. <br /> <br /> Although it is a good movie. I never wondered whether it was worth pursuing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
