Overall, I enjoyed this movie and recommended it to film lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I would really like to refer to the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols Clauser. One scene, especially where Adrian Greener's character wonders about Rosario Dawson about her sexuality during her absence, is very similar to the scene in Clausur where Clive Owen interviews Julia Roberts, although she acts less harshly and intensely in "love." Also note that "Anna" is the personal name of Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer relies on the play by Patrick Marber. This film is supposed to rely heavily on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen", so I'm not sure how to make that connection. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
