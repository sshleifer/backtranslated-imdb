Well, let me go and say this because I love history and I know that the film is the most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed and Julia Stills became the first favorite actress after seeing it in the '60s. I own this movie in my video box containing many films and I suggest Search for new movies in the future and try to enjoy history !!!!
