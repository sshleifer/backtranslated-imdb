Varelli brothers, Bobby and Peter, in it again. With "Fever Pitch," other filmmakers who dealt with a lot of serious subjects abandoned the tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby to the screen, which was difficult to do. The novel, of the same title, dealt with man's football obsession, where it was placed in England, where the sport is consumed by most British sports enthusiasts. The writing team of Lowell Ganz and Pablo Mandel is credited with turning the book into a language that will attract most Americans when they make their hero, a Boston Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" is a movie featuring Hossa's fan, Ben Wrightley, who lives in Red Sox, an eighth grade teacher who has strange ways to involve his students in the subject he is trying to teach. When he takes four of his best pupils to tour a local company, he meets, and loves the tragic despair of Lindsey Mix, a young woman who goes to her place, but in her 30s, she has no life of her own. <br /> <br /> The story follows the lovers during the Red Sox rites, at home games, at Fenway Park. Fans of this team are likely to be the most loyal people in the world, holding on to a team that does great things but until 2004, has never won the World Championship title. In fact, the end had to be changed, as we heard, because that was the year they finally won the event that they had escaped for eighty-six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are idealists as a couple in the middle of the film. Ms. Barrymore is a natural woman who is always surprised by her appearance in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, the famous television comedy actor, who has turned into a film actor, has a better chance here than his recent appearance in Taxi, in our humble opinion. <br /> <br /> The Farelli Brothers movie will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball story.
