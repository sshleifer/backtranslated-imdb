Just imagine the shape of a school in a world like this: children are a big gang with good taste in music and unite against school principals and bad teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" is taking place in this world. It's like a Ramones record coming to life. All characters are silly, innocent and charming like Ramones songs, and the music itself, of course, is fantastic. Secondary comedy movies have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" with classics in the late 1970s, where you do not make sex jokes that are tasteless at all. With a seemingly new remake in the works, he is likely to lose the charm of the original along the way and will be replaced by half-funny cliche jokes, as Bill Hicks used to call her. However, the main problem is that Ramones can not be replaced. They were the perfect band for this film and no one else was able to approach their place. So, the best thing to do is to leave the original alone, strange and magical as it is. Gaba Gaba Ya!
