All Kira Reed fans should watch this. The introduction of the film assumes that romantic novelist Kira is unable to come up with any new ideas. She also gets a divorce. However, this man meets in a restaurant and helps her out of her skin (and her clothes). They go to the corner room and do it. Luckily, Kira gets the condom (now never tell me that these Playboy movies are worthless piles of fine fuzz.) Later, she was amazed by how wonderful her publisher was, but she did not get his name. The guy continues to play their strange games, but in the end he gets tired of his hiding place and wants to know more ... When you do, all hell breaks down, and I'll leave it at that, this is easily the best of these soft Playboys movies I've seen.
