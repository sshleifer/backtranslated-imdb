"Cry Freedom" is a film about the extent to which people will go to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting portrayal of an unexpected friendship between activist Steve Pico and editor Don Woods (dizzyly played by Washington) and Kevin Klein. While the second half deals with Woods, who is looking for answers to Pico's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people prefer the first half of the film focusing on the unlikely friendship between Pico Woods. I found that the second half about the struggle without WDS in order to hear the story of Pico all over the world more interesting.
