I simply can not overcome the versatility of pairing between Walter Matau and Jack Lemon. It seems like the film does not need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon was already present in several well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment Matthau was new after winning the Oscar for "The Fortune Cookie" (Another Billy Wilder with Lemmon). This film was not designated as big as this film because the story could not afford a long run time (I think about two hours). However, this happens in an hour and a half fast, although the rendering of events that led to Lemmon that ends in Matthau's apartment is a long boy (so this sentence was). This is a simple representation but for the rest of the runtime, you have a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> I have already written a comment on how to absorb the follow-up to this movie and will not be deeper into that. Perhaps the reason for this joy is that the film has been produced just as the innocence of American films began to fade quickly into oblivion. There are some sexual references, but they are treated in an innocent way so you can not even get "Well, I've never ..." of the most cautious people out there. It's fun to see a film from a long lost era, and that's why the sequel did not work because you said Matthau and Lemmon say a few words and that does not suit them. <br /> Of course, both are now gone and you can be happy because no You can still enjoy them in such a great movie. I think the only actor in this film that is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So there you have it. Simply one of the best comedy movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Add: I just learned recently that John Fiedler has died even with all his fans. I did not mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful than I am next time.
