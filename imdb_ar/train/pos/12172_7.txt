This film starts quickly, has some slow moments in the middle, but it moves in general, has very good moments, and then comes out at the end of chapter 3. You've been able to see this in Los Angeles Premier twice (with 2 different ends). Jason Lee star, but tomorrow is not driving the man. He is humorous and self-supporting, but it is better for him to be a supportive representative. "Julia Steeles" is quite a role as a comedian, new to her, but she does not "steal" this film, as she must be a star of her caliber. For the actress who has a lot of potential (10 things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to watch as she continues to play "medium" roles, so do not let her take the role and escape with a movie (like Daniel Day Lewis doing " ). Selma Blair is a good young actress, doing a good job. I did not expect her Academy Award performance, and she did not offer one, but her performance was enough. Chris Koch presents another film "Above the Medium". Maybe the problem lies in the script more than anything else. I've done such a movie! But it's not a movie that says, "It was wonderful!" ... This story has been accomplished many times before and there was not much new here. The rehearsal dinner scene may have been the best in the film, and Larry Miller has a great performance in a supporting role (perhaps the best surprise in the film). If you want to go to see a movie that will make you laugh a lot of times and enjoy an enjoyable evening, I can still recommend this film, but unless they have changed the end ... again ... I leave during church scene or you will be disappointed Definitely hope.
