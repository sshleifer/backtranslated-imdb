This is one of the most spiritual films I have ever seen. I went with about 150 people to St. George and we saw this film in the center of St. George's visit. Also, there were some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were influenced by attractive music and re-represented the story of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about Yusuf and the difficulties experienced by the pioneers. After all, it is far from American history.
