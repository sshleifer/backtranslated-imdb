This is a strong documentary about domestic violence in Cameroon. The "sisters" in the law are lawyers and magistrates who were successful in 2004 in the trial of husbands for abusive treatment of their wives and won one woman divorce strongly wanted by a Muslim council. It's fairly long - about two hours - but fantastic in terms of prosecutors, individual defendants, and lawyers who successfully represented them in courtrooms headed by female judges. He will leave you, as he left me, with many questions about exactly how this change happened. How and when did women come to power in Cameroon? Did many of the cases in this film have a significant impact on the general treatment of women by their husbands? Was the granting of divorce by an Islamic court, against the explicit wishes of the husband, a one-off event? I do not suggest that filmmakers have answered these questions. They made the film two years ago and not yesterday. The film they made deserves a wide audience.
