In the ten years following the Wildside broadcast, nothing came close to its quality in local production. This includes two series of interesting but exaggerated Underbelly, which brought events in the recent criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne. Exceptions may be Blue Murder (which also starred with Tony Martin, but as a person on the other side of the law). <br /> <br /> Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on ABC. Having not seen the show for a long time, I still admire the unmatched lines of story and the very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as an estranged investigator of the disappearance of his son, Rachel Blake (who later linked with Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Demetriades as a young policeman and his vice-gambler. Good supporting roles are provided equally by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Costas (yes, Effie herself), and Abe Cornish young. <br /> <br /> ABC has inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD for a couple of years ago. The logic of this type of marketing goes beyond me, but I think it may have something to do with licensing differences with the original producers. <br /> <br /> A great series has been a great success. Here is the hope that the DVD section of ABC works together. <br /> <br /> (According to the ABC message board administrator, another version of the DVD version is scheduled for December 2009)
