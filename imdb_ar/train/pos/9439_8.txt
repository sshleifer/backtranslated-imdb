Before watching this movie, I heard a lot about him and certain scenes in the film, but listening did not do that for me, so I planned to watch it wow! Ned Betty, Ronnie Cox, John Voight and Bert Reynolds make an interesting group of individuals who intend to hell in the Cahulawassee River and a series of unfortunate events that all appear on them. It takes a bit of time to develop your character in covering the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but in the end you know these people as if they were your friend. Representation, dialogue is very real, as close as possible to the reality of Hollywood representation. The character of Reynolds "Lewis" was impressive as a man coming out very harsh but under the men's crust is a man very soft and broken (I was impressed by his performance!) It seems that John Voight is the character that stands out on the lights, the unfortunate circumstances that appear in every corner of his legs fluctuate and encircled To a different man in the end (his personality was excellent). It seems Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really like silly lunkheads that just want to joke and do not seem too serious unless they also have, they did ... I was really amazed by the sight of Borman's director of Dickie's novel, very impressed. You can not go all your life without watching this movie. I give it eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
