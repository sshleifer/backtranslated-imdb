I first saw this film on my way home from Paris to Newark on Air France in August 1996. The film itself I think is a wonderful masterpiece. It is the type of film that people have to produce. I still think that Daniel Otwell is one of the most attractive actors around them. In this French film, he plays the role of the divorced father and businessman who lost his enthusiasm for life until he reached a Down syndrome man living in an institution with other Down syndrome patients. Actors including the actor who already has Down syndrome create a friendship and a reasonable relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and our changes forever with Man Down syndrome. He realizes that life is not just work, not play, but living and loving, and that's what life should be like. The end is kind of silly but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. Just bring your eyes.
