I saw this film at the BIFFF festival in Brussels, Spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, which is considered to be a beautiful and creative shock, is one of the most horrific films I have ever seen. Be careful: this is not a joke! The terrorist has a wide range of good actors (for example: Peter Martell enjoys a strong European presence), excellent direction, superb production design, very good soundtrack, and many heavy sfx movies such as the Italian horror films of the 1980s. The flesh is torn clean to the bone ... And the blood explodes ... This brutal cruel plug will catch you ... And give you some dark dreams ... It must be seen !!
