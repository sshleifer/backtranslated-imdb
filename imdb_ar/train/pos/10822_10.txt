I was lucky enough to watch this film several years ago in England. I have seen hundreds of films since then, but I have never forgotten this film. Although Sinatra played a very popular role, he was excellent in this role. Many people seem to think that he did not really make his own role until his role in the movie "From Here to Eternity", but in my opinion it was wonderful in Kunshu. The other role that remains in my mind is the role of William Conrad. I did not see him or hear him before this film. Conrad plays a great role in this film. I remember his deep voice and gravel and he uses it beautifully to reinforce the few words he speaks with a threat that determines his tone of voice. I also remember the music that Conrad makes and seems to surround him whenever he appears. It was a wonderful film and the only disappointment is that I never had the chance to see it again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I find in the headlines that the film is in black and white, but when I saw it in full color, I remember the blue Sinatra shirt.
