When I started watching these games for the first time, I became one of my favorites. Melissa Joan Hart was very funny and talented, as were the aunts and other characters and Star Actor Salem Cat, it was very funny. The first season in my opinion was the best where Sabrina was a high school teenager adapting to the charming life. They were funnier, funnier and more amusing ... good. I'm not a fan when they started offering Brad and Dreamer because I loved Valerie completely, but they were fine, the problem was that they were only in one season. If you get new people, at least keep them. I did not like Josh, I had the tw * t type, preferred Harvey but then disappeared. And get rid of Libby! It would have been great if you had been arguing his thesis for seven years. Mr. Craft as well, if he and Zelda married it would be gold! Sabrina then moves from her aunt's home to the Roxy / Miles / Morgan house. I did not like people either, they did not seem to like our Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and things, and the aunts were avoided from her life and in her own stupid storyline. I stopped watching it for a while, and the old reruns were back and I was like whoo-hoo! Haha. I must say that the past few seasons have been very awful. They got rid of the amateurs who absorbed the reason for being a big part of the show. Then suddenly, these two independent workers were allowed to move to the nice house when they treated him like dirt. She now works in a magazine store, so she puts famous stars at the show, if in every episode they spoil him. The program just really went down and lost its luster. I saw the last episode. She had the aunts in it (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and she was about to get married but fled with the end of Harvey. I'd like to know what happened after. Well, this is my assessment, and the only thing I can say is the only thing that remained is self-attraction during the seven years was Salem Cat.
