I have seen this film in the worst possible circumstances. I really missed 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, I thought it was a movie this week, but soon became stolen from the performance of the leading actress playing the role of a kidnapped young woman. The premise began to twist the turns and turns that I did not see coming, and by the end of credits I was scrambling through the flight guide to see what I had just seen. It turns out I discovered late Do-yeon Jeon who won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema but I'm heading to a DVD store to find out more.
