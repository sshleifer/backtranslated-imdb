There are many words I want to use to describe this film, but I can not really do it? This movie is a movie you can watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then urinate. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you feel easily insulted by profanity, sex, nudity, homosexuality and everything else related to nature. Being a woman, may not be a factor, I can watch this movie again and again. Terry Parker and Matt Stone are so wonderful. Along with all their other appearances, I think Baseketball is the winner of the award. Now I'm just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the film. watching the movie!! That's all I'm going to say. It's hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a damn word in almost every line blurs out of their mouth when they talk. So I kept him a professional. the best movie. Heck Yes!
