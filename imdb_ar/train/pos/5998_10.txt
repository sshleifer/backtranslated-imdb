The treatment is amazing film ... disgusting and just real! I was lucky enough to watch the movie "The Cure" at the premiere of New York City and it blew me off completely! I also heard that she won an award from this festival and she definitely deserves it. The first thing that surprised me was cinematography. Eric Geoffon did a great job. The style of shooting the scene of love in the middle of the film was amazing. The scene of love was necessary in this film, and Jeffrey got the idea but kept the scene good. Geoffon and Jaffray are an excellent creative team and have to work together on future projects. Judy Meyer's novel was very surreal, but at the same time I felt a heart attack, made me feel what the main character felt. I'm a very difficult critic but I have to say that therapy is one of my favorite movies .. I just love it! If you have not seen it yet, check it out!
