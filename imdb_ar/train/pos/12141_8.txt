Among the three new versions of W. Somerset Mogan, this is the best, not particularly for what John Cromwell brought to the film. The movie is worth watching due to the penetration of his performance for Davis House, which showed Mildred Rogers film industry that she was a star. Finally, her struggles with Jack Warner and his studio were bearing fruit. <br /> <br /> The film has dominated Mildred from the start. From the beginning, we realize that Mildred does not care about Philip and will never care. She does not hide her contempt for this good spirit that fell in love with the wrong woman. Mildred will be insulted again, and again, because she does not make bones about what she really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, in addition to being disabled, is a weak man. When he tries to hold onto Mildred, they reject him. When Mildred returns to him, when he is fragile and defeated, he rises to the occasion, overcoming his dependence on this terrible woman who stole his will and his manhood. <br /> <br /> Pitt Davis gives a terrific portrayal of Mildred. This was one of her best roles and I ran away from him. Her disgust of the Phillip type is evident from the beginning of their relationship. When you tell him to wash her mouth after he accepts it is one of the strongest moments of the film. Leslie Howard reduced Philip's performance and made him appear weaker than he is now. Francis de, Reginald Denny, Alan Hill and Original Owen, are seen in simple roles. <br /> <br /> This is the Bet Davis program, and do not forget it!
