I wonder if there was a follow-up to this documentary to follow the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others who have lost ... there must be a second part .. and real. It was great ... The film was not long enough ... I would like to know why the filmmaker did not follow up !! This is very important for the community period. Well if you're reading this, please think about making another documentary of this kind ... I'm really fed up with hearing na√Øve writers how AIDS and men get together when they do not; Different that we need to consider this film. This movie did not bother even mentioning HIV or AIDS and I was very happy for that ... I really appreciated the flaws and definitions as well. Thank you very much for making this movie available.
