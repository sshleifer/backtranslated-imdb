I enjoyed the cinematic entertainment in China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older artist wants to transfer his art to a young man even though he has no children to live. The faces of the actors are fantastic to see. The story reveals the children's dedication and gratitude to those who are treated well and eager to be treated well. The opera in the film reminds me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more complicated and complex. The story here reminds me of the Dickens tale of the days when children were almost chatting. This plot is a bit predictable and a bit emotional for me but it deserves time to showcase the tournaments, humanity and history that was filmed.
