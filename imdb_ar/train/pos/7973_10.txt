Maybe I sap but this is the sweetest movie ever! I first saw him when I was about 4 or 5 years old, and I cried. Between then and now (embarrassed at the age of 15) I have seen it more than 25 times, and each of them has been defeated. Do not worry they tears of happiness! And it's not all sap! There is a lot of humor and comedy in it. Usually everything about animals is a big draw, but in this film, it is not. My only advice is: So if you like this, do not see the sequence ... NUNITY! I suggest that everyone check it out ... you will not be sorry, regardless of your age or your children!
