I think you should be from the United States to get a lot of jokes. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you're interested in this movie. You can not compare the quality of photography with the quality of photography of course, but it is clear that the photographer's journey was intentional. Tomato killer is the best hundred times of the Nepalese dynamite. My only opinion. I am sure that people from France will not appreciate the cartoons of the French. So this film is not for a global audience. Although I am not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing through the whole movie. My side and my jaw were hurting me at the end of the film.
