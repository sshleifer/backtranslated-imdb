This was a wonderful movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this film, including me. The music was fantastic as well. No, do not speak horses, but instead, tells the soul a story. And to hear a story told by a horse if it was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "spirit." This film really gives you a sense of family, home, and friends. I would say that my 4 year old son and a 5 year old girl were really touched by this film, and even so, they laughed hard and chanted for the soul in the end. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and get your soul through this painful story. Your children will love. I think you will too.
