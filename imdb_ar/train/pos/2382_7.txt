For a long time, Menagerie was my favorite Star Trek, although in recent years it has been deleted by City on the Edge of Forever. What I used to like best about "Menagerie" is that it's a stricter Star Trek with this wonderful background story to the current Trek story. I still think they are somewhat ingenious in the way that the original pilot Jenny Roddenberry merged into a two-part ring. Although the "new" part of the story is largely a pretext for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of ​​being a Spock in a military trial is a smart idea. You can poke holes in the plot if you want. For example, due to the Talosians' abilities to control the mind and the condition of Captain Pike, why is it necessary to even re-pike physically to their planet? There are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... It's better not to think too hard about details and just enjoy two parts of ST.
