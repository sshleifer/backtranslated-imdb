Dr. Murdred is one of the rare films under the radar entirely, but it's worth it. It really reminds me of the old series of the 1930s and 1940s. That's why I loved watching the movies follow-up ... but looking at the rest of the Full Moon output there was not enough breast to please the ordinary audience. Unfortunately, thanks to the extravagant sacrifice scene, there are too many scenes for the family audience - and this is unfortunate, because without a bar, it could have been a Harry Potter-style festival where the children ate it. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are fantastic - I was not sure if Mrs. Nipar did not walk around in the picture from Menu A on this film, it was very reasonable. Not seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they did not have the dollars to license Dr. String, because I think this could have been completely apparent.
