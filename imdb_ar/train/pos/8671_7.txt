Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> Last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> Next match results ******** <br /> We started the show with the Inferno match. Kane vs. MVP. It was a good game. Nothing about wrestling here. This was about the pictures. Overall, this was not bad. There were a few nearby locations where Ken approached the fire, but in the end, Kane beat the MVP to the fire first. <br /> <br /> The opening match is beautiful. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long is announcing a new match for the team's tagline: London and Kindrick will defend themselves: Regal, Taylor, The Hardees, and multinationals. Let's move! <br /> <br /> The second game: a deadly quadrilateral ladder match. This was a complete massacre. If we judge through three of the four teams here, you expect chaos. The spots were amazing. The total spot of the festival. Jeff went to one point in the film Poetry in Motion and moved London and Jeff was hit by peace! Soon after, Jeff was set on the upper rope with two nearby stairs where the MNM would kill Jeff, Matt making the save, and Jeff hitting a "see-saw" shot of Joy Mercury! Mercury is infected. His eyes were quickly closed and the hard road was seized. Mercury is removed from the game and Nitro is still present. He will fight alone for nicknames! Regal and Taylor hold London in front! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro is in a killer place, and falls through the ladder to throw Jeff! Wonderful! In the end, both London and Kendrick retain the tag team title. What a game !!! <br /> <br /> This was crazy. I can not tell why WWE has not announced this yet. The Buyrate will increase dramatically. I'm sure the reboot value will be good. <br /> <br /> Mercury has suffered from a broken nose and bruises in the eye. He is in the hospital now. Be well. <br /> <br /> There will be nothing else here that will top it. <br /> <br /> Next: The Miz v. Boogeyman (Ugh) This was a misunderstanding. Will the Bojeman wrestle? Miz also absorbs. After a crazy crowd, this kills them with bullets. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit against Chavo. It was a tough game. I enjoyed it. Shavo hit the superplex killer at once! Benoit hit eight German footnotes too! Benoit wins with a defender. Good things. <br /> <br /> Championship match Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight. It was a good game. Unfortunately, stupid fans did not care about this. why? Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestling well. I agree with JBL. He shouted at the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or get out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy's match against the Undertaker. Not much here. This was a swimming festival, with a few exceptions. Kennedy simultaneously threw Tucker from the top of the stage to the ground. The place was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The end point was the Taker, who was knocked out by Kennedy at the cemetery and won the game. Not real. Kennedy needs this win. Both are working hard. Still, Kennedy needs this win. The Undertaker must have lost. The design is screwed back. <br /> <br /> A stupid singer thing is next. I love women. not this. At least Toure was not here. This is refreshing. Out of the crowd, Leila must have won. WWE wants Ashley. Consider this your bathroom break. The following event. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also an unparalleled match. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Poker can not work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The failure has been completed. Finlay beat Batista's knee with a chair shot and Batista was not sold dead and the game ended. Lame. Not the main event caliber at all. Overall, Armageddon had a lesser record, but the ladder was the same as for the main event here. It was worth enough money there. A few others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: The PPV is good with the match of the ladder with the savior. Smackdown is not a bad offer, it is not convincing enough. Smackdown needs to stop leaving Cena. Let Smackdown stand on his feet. This demo proves that Smackdown can be.
