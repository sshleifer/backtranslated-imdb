Representation This film is a good acting film. I will say that the performances are a bit weak at times; but for the most part, acting is very good. The only actor who amazed me with his performance was Jude Law as Harlin Maguire. It was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed unsure at some points throughout the film, but it was also incredible. Paul Newman, as good as always. Cinematography This is what made the film a masterpiece (rarely used this word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If you pause at any time in the movie, you'll see the exact work of that guy. He puts every shot so nothing is ignored. When the camera is still, there is a postcard like quality on the screen. When the camera moves, each shot is planned to minimize perfection. But it does not stop there. Conrad's choice of colors and contrast between light settings and darkness is a work of art. The way the group shines is some of the most amazing lighting work I've ever seen. Make his work in this film what it is. This film is at the top of the list for best cinematography using LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. A story People will say that this movie is the flick of a gang from the 1930s, but I think they lost the film's destination. It is a love story about a successful man who failed to try to protect his son from the life he chose. It's a wonderful story set in a beautiful bond between two people who have only one another. The screenwriting is worth Oscar. The music of Thomas Newman is sad, but it gives hope to intensify this sad but hopeful story. The music is some of the nicest and scores of degrees I have made. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with an experienced appearance. The icons he uses and the performances he receives from his actors are rare in the world of filmmaking today. I will be looking for Sam Mendes next film. 10/10 One of the most beautiful and impressive films I've ever seen.
