"Man in the Moon" is a very good film. It is very impressive at times and is very well done in all respects. I can not say that the film was terribly original, but what are these days? <br /> <br /> All the team members have done a great job with their roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at an early age and doing a very good job. Jason London does a good job as well. The only other person I knew was Sam Waterstone, who did a great job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trent) very much. Sometimes he seemed to be the sort of father who terrified him, but in the end you liked his character. The rest of the representatives were also very good. <br /> <br /> If you touch movies about growing and dealing with life, you should watch this movie. I suggest reading the plot summary and if this sounds like something you are interested in, look for it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
