I was a bit skeptical if I should have seen it when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in New York City that day and I was going to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the deviations and massacres again, but like many, I was curious to see what was going on about it. The tears came into my eyes as I watched this documentary. All my memories returned and only the intense photos were incredible. I bought a DVD in memory of one year and watched it several times. How these guys were able to capture these footage was incredible. If you have not seen this documentary, do it in your favor and check it out. It is obviously frustrating and will bring tears to mind, but it is unbelievable document from these most distressed countries.
