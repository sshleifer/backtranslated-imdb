The famous radio storyteller Gabriel No one (Robin Williams, screaming and intense in hypnotic ringing tones) meets and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin called Beth Logand (Rory Colkin), who wrote a book describing the sexual abuse of his parents. To take off, a home is infected with AIDS and this makes Gabriel still more, because his partner Jess (Bobby Canaval, good) happens to have survived the same HIV. When he decides to meet and talk to two of them personally and go to Wisconsin, he discovers some secrets that were not (in the form of) Normal) ready to find them. <br /> <br /> Based on the real events of Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stettner, the film moves much faster (90 minutes, perhaps a few minutes longer) than you might think One would have to run a movie of that kind. This is good because it keeps the movement and story line lean and clear. It's bad that he leaves the various holes in the plot and does not sew any of the plot holes or the back story. Better not go into any big details except to say that if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's work or personal story, you feel a bit out of the loop here. However, the performances by Williams (I would like to hear more of his novels, personally), Colette, Cannaville, Colkin and many other supporting actors (the waitress at the Coltins Donna restaurant does a great job with a small part of it!) Are first class and the mood here - two, the only dark cold exteriors in Wisconsin and New York - give a wonderful framework for this story. It may have ends that are not well connected, but they are still compelling enough.
