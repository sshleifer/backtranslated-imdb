This stunning little British film plays as a kind of pre-emptive antagonism to The Great Escape after about 13 years, and it is directly devoid of any excitement or daring to make large sums. The first part of the film is the preparation of our heroes and their subsequent escape, while the second focuses on their survival while trying to reach Sweden. The film relies on pure characters through a simple, effective and sincere dialogue that is believable to carry, and achieves its goals smoothly. There is little suspense that keeps the film going, and as an adventure story, it works perfectly for the timeframe it adheres to, so the big thumb of the movie may be the first of its kind. <br /> 7/10
