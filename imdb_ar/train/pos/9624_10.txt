The movie which I thought was excellent, was supposed to be about romance with a little thrill between them. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a great actor and I do not know why people continue to give them bad rap music. For Mel Harris, she is a wonderful actress, and for those who think she looks so old to Rob, it did not exceed five years. <br /> <br /> Rob had a leading role in his own TV series as well as one on Scifi. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat, also known as Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He has also starred in several television films and is now producing a small television series. <br /> <br /> Need to give him more leadership roles and that is the best in.
