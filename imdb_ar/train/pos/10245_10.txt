This was my favorite when I was young, he had everything that was wonderful with the 90s children's movies ... pet dinosaurs, cute kids, eccentric eccentrics, some wonderful songs (not a small mermaid / Those that are entertaining atually)! I have encountered this film again recently and I still love it more than ever before! I recommend that everyone of all ages see this film, and I think it should be presented to younger generations! Sorry not the most helpful, I'm in kinda rush ... just please, trust me. All those who oppose this film kill their inner child!
