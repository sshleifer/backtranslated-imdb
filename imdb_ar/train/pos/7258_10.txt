I was lucky enough to get a copy of this movie on a DVD recently and have now seen it for the second time. It was the first time on television late at night in Australia for more than 20 years, but I could never forget this strange and grim film .. <br /> <br /> Many people do not like this movie at all because it changed Traditional - the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move - we only hear the ideas of the characters - is but one facet of it. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this movie I discovered that the product was dead, the main actor dead, was not retained in any British archive or television, or that it was never published on video or DVD, All over the world, it was brought down after its copyright expired in the 1980s. When it was first introduced on television in Australia, there were no recordable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> In the second show recently, I was able to see why I did not forget it. Sometimes it is very stressful and highly undesirable like the Harold Pinter play. <br /> <br /> Again, if anyone wants a DVD copy of this please e-mail me and I'm sure we can do something with my regards to Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
