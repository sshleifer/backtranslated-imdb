When Sabrina first appeared on our screen, I was about 12 years old, so I spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch enter all sorts of strange problems. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite shows, the charming feeling of the 1960s comic "magic" but this time the character was cooler. I've always loved Sabrina because she was smart. They were also friendly and walkable which made it pleasant to watch. The characters at the beginning were wonderful. Harvey, Jenny, Lippi, the contest, Salem and Mr. Paul (my personal friend, the shame he left too early) Hilda and Zelda started their aunt just fine, but then it became annoying. <br /> <br /> I also loved Mr. Kraft because he was always closer to discovering the secret of Sabrina. What I liked in the first three series was the original ideas, the discovery of family secrets and the learning of new mascots, but as they progressed it became more predictable. She came and left a large number of characters, such as Valery, Drema and Brad, and then decided to work Sabrina in the college that destroyed me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina became self-absorbed in college, magic was less, there were no spelling books, no cousins, Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring, and I watched only to see what happened in the end. The lack of Hilda and Zelda seems somehow wrong and went a mile like this perfectly. The last episode made me feel much better even though SPOILER after Sabrina ended up with Harvey on her wedding day to Aaron dardard was great! Overall, a great program if you forget the last two or three paragraphs of the poor series that reminded me of many teen programs. Magic.
