This is a wonderful movie called "Call Me Anna" because it shows how a person has suffered for a long time without knowing the error that happened with it. In order to come out Patty Duke in the eyes of the masses and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from the disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not get it on tape, I've tried searching for it but without success. Does anyone know how to get it?
