I came to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who posted here. I am relatively new in Bollywood films and have been born and raised in the United States. So I do not have a broad basis for comparing Bingar with other Indian films. Fortunately, there is no need to compare. <br /> <br /> Benjar stands alone as a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line, I can tell you that Bingar is one of the most important. Movies come out of any studio anywhere at any time. On the scale of the mass appeal, he could have been an Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if he had been promoted sufficiently in the United States. Maybe this is the film that put Bollywood on the American map. The American cinema audience has a long-term love affair with "Gone With the Wind," and while Pinjar does not borrow from the plot, there are some similarities. Not least is lost time (according to US standards) which takes 183 minutes of operation. <br /> <br /> The dramatic background of the Indian-Pakistani section of 1947-1948 is a strong human drama for a young man. A woman imprisoned conditions and penetrated into problems she had no hand in creation. Put in an untenable position, they somehow manage not only to survive, but to grow - and even thrive. <br /> <br /> If the story is not in any way, it is in the gallery. It is better to explain the growth of Boro (the protagonist) as a person - at least for Western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture - if the "back story" of her character is fully developed in the first part of the film. But that would extend to a 3-hour film to 3 1/2 hours or maybe more. Because one minute of the movie is not wasted, it can not really reduce anything that make it out of editing for the time. It is better for the public to fill in some of what has come before leaving whatever remains. <br /> <br /> I use many words to describe Pinjar: "influential", "disturbing", "convincing", "heart sorrow" come to mind immediately. But "uplift" may be like aropos like any of these. Any story that suggests that the human spirit is invincible against the worst difficulties must be considered as such. The victory of Boro - although perhaps not immediately clear to those around it - is nothing less than my inspiration. For the power of the story alone, I can not recommend this film enough. <br /> <br /> Equally inspiring is the portrayal of Ormila Matondkar to Boro. Often overlooked by a group of younger actresses, Urmila has a unique ability to present a fully reliable character in any role it plays. She does not just act on the part of Boro, she breathes life into the personality. The selection of Manoj Pajpaye Kershid was inspired. He runs something very little for Indian film heroes: precision. His leadership of expression and nuances are essential to the role. He brings more danger to the first part of the film with his piercing stare than all the hooligans who use the sword together. <br /> <br /> If you see only one Bollywood movie in your life, make it a Benjar.
