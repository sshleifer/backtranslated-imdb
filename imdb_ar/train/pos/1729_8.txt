In 1943, a group of Royal Air Force officers, including Eric Williams, decided to flee the POW camp using a horse gymnastics in the courtyard. In 1950, he decided to photograph his novel, and began a strange story about the British film - the military prison camp reached its peak in danger within (1959). <br /> <br /> The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest movies I have ever seen. There are no wonderful dramatic moments, but eventually a steady story is created to heighten the tension because the story does not allow drama, hopping or music (which is about to happen!). It is quite time and works beautifully. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson are leading a very small team of additions and non-suspects. Without exception, they are all always monochrome and calm. They keep the passion of their roles. As many, until recently, in the previous service, I think they have reintroduced their wartime roles as "officers and masters". <br /> <br /> This non-emotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most wartime war films, the story does not end with barbed wire; this fact alone keeps me in the end.
