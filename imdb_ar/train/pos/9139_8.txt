The movie is fine, has moments, and music scenes are the best at all! The sound is a real classic. It's a perfect album, starting with Let's Go Crazy, Take Me With U, The Beautiful Ones (a fun song, maybe the closest to R & B in this album) And the Darling Nikki (one of the most extreme songs of all, it is very mysterious of Appolonia), when Doves Cry (the climax for this masterpiece), I will die 4 U, Baby IA Star, and of course Purple Rain (real classic, end very suitable for this classic album) The movie and album are very good. I highly recommend them!
