There are many reasons why I really appreciate the soprano, one of his biggest victories is building personalities and characters. Each character unfolds more and more each series. Each string also contains a set of different "small time characters" as well as the main ones. A good example of personality (which was only in three episodes) that you can feel is David the compulsive gambler who Robert Patrick played brilliantly. Every little detail builds the perfect television series. The show is about mob leader Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who tries to balance his criminal life with his role as the father of two children. The show is not afraid to be bold and strong through dialogue and images, which makes it reasonable. While Tony manages things with the nightmare of Pauli (Tony Serico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant) his nephew Christopher (Michael Empirioli) is looking for an upgrade. Each episode also features Tony's other family in a way that includes his children and wife Carmela Soprano (Eddie Falco). On top of these problems, his uncle Junior Soprano (Dominique Chianese) tries to get what he can from Tony's work although he is under house arrest. All actions are strong and complex, but the two most distinguished are: James Gandolfini, who is Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli, who plays the role of Christopher, represents the younger generation (20-30) in crime. If David Chase did not create such a great modern television drama of this kind, such as The Wire and Dexter. So the Sopranos are definitely Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp of TV
