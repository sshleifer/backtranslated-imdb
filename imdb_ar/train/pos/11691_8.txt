A wonderful movie when I saw him. I must say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw him like 8 times in the theater and got a DVD. As I grew older and saw him again, I realized that the film was average. Compared to the well-known comedy advertising films, this is something. I mean, Rock was a joy in the film. The whole shift with racist things breaks some big barriers. Also think about how the film goes is a nice way to think. It's like most thinking about a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch. I like the movie in general, so I introduce it ... <br /> <br /> I'm still good 7/10 for me.
