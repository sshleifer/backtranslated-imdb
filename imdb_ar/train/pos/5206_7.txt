This film, "The Breeding of Evil": The myth of the sage contains little thought or effort. It is ironic with the specifications of death super fast "slant style" and disgusting death acts. The actor received a rating of D where the actors showed very little ability, and their stupidity in the film is very doubtful. The way they portrayed people who are acting at their ages was unbelievably different. The strange division of pornography fits in with the fact that it does not really offer much, and any respectable area but rapidly decreases with the absolute death of death. For example, the poor man is removed from the anus, and the scene lasts for 5 minutes. It is terribly clear how little fighting children have fought. This movie is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some horrible deaths and practical torture.
