I have no idea how Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow have ever done this, but seeing this again will remind you of everything that made Mrs. Paltrow's fuss in the first place! I've long since ceased to be a woman and I still feel somewhat boring in her Oscar-winning performance, but she gets all the tones here - she's close to perfection like Emma Woodhouse. You may have won the Oscar for Shakespeare, but you have to remember it. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by a wonderful support team including Tony Collett, Greta Scatchi, Juliet Stevenson and others ... Jeremy Northham is very attractive as an interest in love, even if the text falls slightly in his declaration of love for Paltrow The process, allowing all the tension to get rid of their relationship); several years ago, Iwan hair became a little easier than it was in 96, and I personally find Afrata Alan Cumming present in nothing at all these days. But the lead is undoubtedly Sophie Thompson (the sister of Emma Thompson, the daughter of Felida Lo) as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene in which Emma reconciles with Miss Bates, because she is the character that paints our destiny. The movie is worth watching (even again) for its performance alone. <br /> <br /> In general, this age is superbly presented with the charm to spare and more than enough accuracy to sort out the British class system. Well worth the lease (because it's unlikely that this Paltrow will be good again at all - but we'll always have Emma).
