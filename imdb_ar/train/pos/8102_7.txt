The things that will come are historical film. Along with Metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first great sci-fi glasses. It is also one of the first movies on the Day of Resurrection. It is striking how filmmakers predicted the start of World War II in a year, even in a subtle way, the year that would end in the real world. But the film comes out of reality, depicting a war-devastated world (only the poisonous alternative gas of nuclear weapons, which of course did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half of the film's incredible sight hour, taking advantage of leading models and non-glamorous paintings - later to become the staple food for this type of science fiction. Sadly, after the things that will come, Sci-fi is associated with cheap b movies, a stereotype that will not be broken until 2001: A Space Odyssey after more than 30 years. If you stick to the quality of the effects in this film, things would be very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his stars play multiple roles in this film, resulting in a good impact. Massey plays a big role in the role of Dr. Ho as a pilot of advanced civilization (1970) trying to win over the people of a devastating country ruled by a simple warlord (a very effective display of Ralph Richardson). In the end, the story covers 100 years. But this is a big problem in this film - there is really no coherent story. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in such a casual film - which reminds us somewhat of fanaticism, in fact - it is hard to get a traditional plot, but I felt that it was possible to make more material, although the images in the third The latter of the picture is already amazing and worth the entry price ... The plot is not present and the film itself ends abruptly as it is getting interesting. Perhaps producers were thinking about creating another science fiction in the future: a sequel? <br /> <br /> Things to come are a movie that must be seen by all those who love science fiction at least once. Unlike Metropolis, it may not tolerate repeated views.
