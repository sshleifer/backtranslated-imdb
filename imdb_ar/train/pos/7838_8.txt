If you are a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I would recommend that you review it. It's a strange aspect of Mark Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, and he seems to be having a good time filming some scenes that are not part of the concert, but it's fun to watch, which makes you feel just like people. When the concert is a talented musician, Playful and professional rock that seems to impress girls screaming. By watching it at a concert, you will never know that being a rock star is a work, but having fun with some great songs with some good friends, such as Elton John and Ringo Starr appear in some live performances. True, there are some missing songs that I would like to see there, but like any album can not contain everything. I just bought this in 2006, but if I knew it was launched in 1972, I would definitely buy it years ago. It is sad and strange that a man has a lot of songs about his love for cars, he will never learn to drive and die in a car accident!
