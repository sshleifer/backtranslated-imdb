In this first episode of Friends, we met the six main characters in the series: Monica Geller, Voi Bovai, Chandler Ping, Ross Geller, Joey Tribiani, and finally Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discovered that Rachel, a wealthy girl friend of Monica from high school, left her fiance, Barry, on her altar, because she discovered she did not like him. She also decided to live with Monica and independence from her father, and get a new job as a waitress in the middle of Burke. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife was a lesbian and had lost her because of Susan, her partner. (We see him move to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica (in this episode) (and sleeps in the end) with Paul "the man of wine", who gave her an excuse for being helpless because he divorced his wife. But in fact, he was just fooled. <br /> <br /> Note: I just adore Joey and Chandler hair hairstyle in this first season! =)
