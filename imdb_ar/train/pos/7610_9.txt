Just watch Season 1 so far but this is awesome! A wide range of people are stuck on an island. Apparently no one seems to have much skeletons in their coffers ... Melrose Place seems to be meeting with the Crusoe family and why is this great? Probably not then, then the announcement of a spoon filled with X files, a dose of "what?" The big "hey" and the island are all you ever dreamed of - in your freaky nightmares you will be lost to. The story got a lot of transitions and turned out to be unbelievable. Wonderful setting, acting hard with liberal acceptance that at the end of every person being a person (almost well ... I think ...) with good and bad aspects. But strange, very strange ...
