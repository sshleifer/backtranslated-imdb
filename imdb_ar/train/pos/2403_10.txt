I have to warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it up, I got the Spanish Judges in February I think. It was mentioned as the last version, but as I see it, it has not been rearranged. But in both cases, I have. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised that no one on the scar notes is small) although it's low budget, only to get enough money to make this movie worth spending. Man, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story about a con artist is known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have goods called Spanish judges. If you do not know what the Spanish judges or did not see the trailer for this, this is the first review I read, I will not even say what they are. I think it would be a big shift from no one knows what it was. He needs protection, so he also rents a couple of scammers, Max and Jamie (Vincent Dionovrio and Valeria Gullino) as well as the fraudster named Pace (Mark Bon Jr.). He has a girlfriend who will not tell anyone her name because she is from Mars, she said. So they (Jack) call it "girl Mars". Everything starts to go well, but then it turns into one big game. A game involving some lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There were some who acted there (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, not one). There were some scenes they could have done better and the result was a bit better too. Some points were already good. The subject they used at the beginning and the end (before credits) was a good choice for the song, that's my opinion. The theater of fighting could have been a bit longer and more violent, but what could you do? There is one other comment on Matt: Damn, playing a smooth and wonderful man. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I need to correct for NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not the newcomer. According to this site, it has been operating since 1983. For me, I hope to be for others, they are well known to love Italian attention to Charlie Shen in "Hot Shots!" Movies. But a good review. <br /> <br /> Although I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good (that's why I give it 10 stars above), I'll only give it a degree I thought when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
