I saw this movie, when I was traveling in Brazil. I found it difficult to understand Brazilian culture and society, because it contains a lot of regional and class differences. To see this film in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something of the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, it is sometimes somewhat exaggerated. This is the only negative comment I have about this film. It's sometimes too much, having too much sex, lots of murders and a lot of irony for one movie. The director can shoot some things more accurately, making the film more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I like the film and the way the story unfolds. The characters are complex, and very much resemble the real lives of people. American actors and actors are not nice with lots of cosmetics, but people who can be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film realistic, even when the story is unconvincing.
