This movie is a fascinating and exciting piece of action. I saw him in the theater when he came out, but I was 13 years old and did not really "get it" ... I saw him again when I was 20 years old (on the video course I own now) and was just blown away. Steven Spielberg has created a wonderful film that will end you from start to finish. I've read this book too, but there's something about the film that makes it really alive. Casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, is just wonderful. You laugh, you cry, you rejoice ... it highlights all the imaginable feelings. It's one of his coolest and not to be missed!
