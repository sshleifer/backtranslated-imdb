When I was head of our college cafe, one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. Groove Tube was one of the best things that appeared in 1972. The original assumption was that it was being shown outside Broadway in the theaters where television screens were placed around the audience, so everyone had a big seat. The premise was that the small play would change on a regular basis - Saturday Night Live, while preserving something new. They decided to turn it into a general distribution film. <br /> <br /> I think the developers said this is the first time Chevy Chase has shown the film. Watching him run naked even though the forest was howling. Like many reviews before me, Saturday Night Live was like this thing. I highly recommend this vid. I told my 13-year-old son about Coco the Clown - he can not wait to get a copy!
