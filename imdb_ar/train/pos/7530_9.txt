That means saying Batman's sequel animation is pretty good and for all the same reasons she has a lot of action in her story so it's good to voice more than really good actors such as Kevin Conroy like Batman, Mark Hamel, Kjoker, etc. The bad guys are really good like The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed by the new Batman adventures because they are really good. So be sure to watch it on TV or rent or buy a copy of collectors because it is really good. <br /> <br /> Overall result: ********* ****** ******** ******** ******** *****
