I was eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he could turn into Suss Grinch and make his own character. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film was a pure magic. Carrie is a master in his business and no one can play this role to perfection as he did. There was a lot to enjoy for both adults and children alike, and it is sure to become a classic movie for everyone to enjoy in the coming years. I already have visions for my little girl sitting year after year to watch this new version on the video, and I will see it without a doubt and laugh as she did the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Clearly, this film was written by Jim Carrey everywhere, and I do not think he would have met without him. However, the support team was enchanting and enjoyable in itself, most notably Taylor Momsin the granny who was the perfect chip for Curry's exotic. The cut design, the musical score and the costumes are all lent to a fascinating and wonderful final product and I think all concerned can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to turn a 22-minute classic animation into a full-length motion film, but Howard succeeds with the flying colors. For those critics who disagree, your hearts may be small.
