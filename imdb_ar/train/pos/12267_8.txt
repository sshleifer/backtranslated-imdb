Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I used to borrow books from the school library at every opportunity I got. My favorite film was "Sharks in the Red Sea" - a lot of movement and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a great rendition of Herge's background story and its evolution from Tintin. The personal experience of the film director in Herge's interview and the story of his relationship with the artist who inspired Chan's character were very moving. <br /> <br /> A wonderful documentary film for a very talented and very talented artist. A wonderful example of a person who has become internationally renowned and has raised the joy of millions of children (and young people at heart) all over the world.
