Yes this film is predictable and certainly not an award material. But then do not try to be something that is not. Fun fun with real funny characters, a wonderful and very funny performance by Peter O'Toole, a wonderful performance on the ground from Juan Blaouette. The band performed immediately, each playing its part in a clever and comic way. The music was good although it was not wonderful but it filled the film well. From some negative comments I concluded that the accuracy of some humor went over their heads. A good example of this is the comment about "a strange game like baseball," dear American, which was cricket - from any baseball game derived - and its explanation of the ignorant American band was very funny to those who knew cricket. Also no, he was not supposed to excel when Carl broke the window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said "Oh yeah!" For more money to break the manager said at the same time "no" also refers to money. Jeez, seems to have to explain every joke to some people ... All in all I enjoyed it and I had some great laughs! worth watching.
