I saw this film for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival this year, but I was a teenager, and I found the film very attractive. These children are out of the ordinary and are very unlikely to be in a movie of this stature but with the right and unwanted dialogue they made the movie quite successful. I enjoyed this film more than others but I strongly recommend that this film be released and watched. It is a combination of brilliant comments and a funny reality. Pick up the core of high school, topped the high school record my favorite list and hope to have a chance to be released in the theaters. I really thank all the children who have done hard work in making this film, and it has helped me cry in my eyes in laughter.
