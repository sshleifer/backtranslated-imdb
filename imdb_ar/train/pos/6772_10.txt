Unlike another user who said that the film sucked (and that Olivia Hossey was awful), I do not agree with that. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia is a wonderful maniac in everything related to her! Yes, you may be older now, because many remember it from Romeo and Juliet, but it's great! <br /> <br /> This story line may be used a lot, but it's a unique film and I'll answer anyone who's different! I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed any movie Olivia Haci. Olivia is my "girl" and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with her. Not only is it Olivia's film, but because it's a unique story line and a wonderful direction.
