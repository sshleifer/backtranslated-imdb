Japanese Indie film with a sense of humor and philosophy where the three main characters almost literally work throughout the entire film, chasing each other because of strange circumstances and comedy coincidence. As they walk, we see what is going on in their minds and how they got to where they are right now. Running is a metaphor for the lives of these lucky people. One way or the other, what they are really looking for is not what they were originally chasing, but the meaning of their lives and escape from their own personal problems and shattered dreams. Jogging makes them all feel really alive. The big running adventure that changes life when it collides accidentally with something so big and so ridiculous that it's funny is clever. One of my favorite movies of all time is by the genius director Sabo.
