The film "Dressed to Kill" (1980) is a mysterious horror film by Brian de Palma, which really works. The atmosphere is really there. The atmosphere that makes you scared. This is not what a horror film is supposed to do. In the right place. Michelle Caen is perfect like Dr. Robert Elliott, shrinking a small secret. Annie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated mature woman. Keith Gordon in the role of her son Peter is wonderful. Nancy Allen as Liz. Marino is one of the most colorful films in this film. There are many scenes crawling in this film. Scene elevator one of them. Comparisons between this and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. All these movies may cause some sleepless nights.
