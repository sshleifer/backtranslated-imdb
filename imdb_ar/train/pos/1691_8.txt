This film is funny and suitable for any age. It is definitely family entertainment. The cast is doing a great job of playing people in Big Ben, Illinois, in the center of the country. Where we must not assume anything ever happens because the excitement (pre-invasion) of the contract is the new (and only) ramp of the highway. The site appeals as appropriately dull and completely unlikely to invade Earth by Mars. But these Marsons are not fully qualified, even though they are well equipped with a arsenal of deadly and deadly weapons appropriately ... including one set to eliminate Mars too! The Martians wasted their lines and threw their correct dialects to make us viewers and locals want to help them ... to leave the land. J. J. Anderson played a Halloween duck very small eaters has only large lines. Watch this movie for laughter and entertainment. Thoughtful is not. But hidden and fun is it.
