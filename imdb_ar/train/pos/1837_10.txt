Simply wonderful film no doubt. Great story and great shows, whether Amitabh, Akshay, Chevali, Priyanka, Bowman or Rajpal. Indian filmmaking goes rude with Malika & Co., this film is completely free and therefore addicted to Indian society. But the message and concept of this film is very cool. It was possible to avoid Anu Malik (a boring version of the cat) and it was possible to use Ismail Darbar or Hamesh as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should have given a special Gujarati touch to the music as well. Ano Malik is the worst musician around him and he thinks he is a music star, but this is not the film where the audience was wanted - he looks good only with Govinda songs. I felt some pretty serious music with two good gazelles or sad songs that could make this movie more memorable.
