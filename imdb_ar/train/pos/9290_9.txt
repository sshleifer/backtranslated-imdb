This is not the kind of film John Wayne is famous for. Playing a diplomatic role, a man accomplishes things through words and persuasion rather than physical action. The film moves with calm realism through its non-dramatic story. <br /> <br /> For an open, patient and thoughtful mind, this film is a rich depiction of an interesting part of history. <br /> <br /> There are two intertwined stories. The big story is Japan's inner isolation, and the US external expansionist conflict when their interests collide. The small story, human, is a barbaric story from the outside (Wayne) and the enemy of the first civilized army and denies the shift to mutual respect and love. The human story is a reflection of the great story of the two nations. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good and all actors play their roles well. The two leading roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne is as excellent as Townsend Harris, where he achieved the right mix of strength and negotiation in his dealings with the Japanese. Eko Ando is similarly excellent as a title army, charming and delicious. The interaction between her character and John Wayne portrays well. This is exactly how these two people will behave (as they were filmed in the film). <br /> <br /> The text is well written. He lacks all the wit. It is a realistic description of how the photographed events occurred. The characters are real people, not great "figures" of history. Moreover, Saddam depicts cultures and interests with great skill and precision. In fact, the clash between traditional Japan, traditional strong isolationism and a new strong emerging nation from around the ocean is summed up very well in one exchange between John Wayne and a local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that the seafarers who sank the ship had their heads cut off if they landed in Japan, and that the passing vessels could not even be put in port for water. The Baron states that Japan just wants to be left alone. Wayne says that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads for international shipping, and that if things continue as before, the nation will not be considered more than a gang of brigades that invades an important route. A very real summary of the way each sees both as right, and the other thinks it is wrong. The ensuing clash between two straight peoples with conflicting interests has its ramifications throughout history, an ongoing theme that is now and in the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and photography of Japan in the mid-nineteenth century, before the rapid growth of industrialization that had to be followed later in the century, was excellent. Visual experience, insight into the ancient civilization of Japan. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone, whether you like John Wayne or not, to watch this movie if you have the chance. Just be aware that it is not an action movie. It is an interesting place and time in history, and a story of slow-boiling love that (to a surprise) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this movie based on its merits, without preconceptions, allow yourself to be immersed in his story, and you will enjoy it completely. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent movie.
