Great British indie movie! The brilliant chemistry of the three main characters makes some of the fun-filled drugs that Cich and Chung are proud of. It's great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he has shared the sides since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and fun for the ladies! I love the scene of the last battle with a reference to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after I set fire to Top of Pops! !!! You do not need to be a biker to enjoy this, which is directly in the post-pub watch group for Friday. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance and you will not be disappointed.
