Ah, sailor Kelly / Sinatra musical suit. Very familiar, right? Yes, but this is not what you usually hear. On the city this way. But if you're around you, you might learn something. Well, maybe not. In any case, the anchor tells the story of two sailors on vacation for three or four days. Joe is a "sea wolf" and Clarence, the biblical type, pleads for Joe to get him "lady". Now, after being picked up by the helicopter companies, they get a little Donald. This is where they meet Susie, that glamor, those Jezebel. I'm just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he does. Is it right? Or is he a moron? Or is it just misleading the community? Discover all this and more when you see {tumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see that Kathryn Grayson be sweet and deadly, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
