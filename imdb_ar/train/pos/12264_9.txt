If you have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin .... Prefer to yourself and watched this beautiful documentary about Herge and his life as he creates two tints I have very wonderful and very wonderful production. The story of the full background about Herge and the people and also the different attitudes that affected her, for good and worse, is amazing. There is a good and clear link between comic books and just that. I will definitely be in my basement who digs the Tintin albums again. Also, the film itself is well told and has a great surround sound. I really hope people find this interesting as I did!
