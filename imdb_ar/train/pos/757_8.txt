I need to be honest. I saw and enjoyed this show because it was blatant, humiliating, funny and wonderful. Yes, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. If you are a kind of humor that deals with the irony of people falling from skateboards, for example, you will have a great time for it. <br /> <br /> Or, if you enjoy people in sharp, severe, bad work, you will also have a great time. If you enjoy humor and extreme circumstances Oh, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I enjoy all three types of humor offered by "Dirty SÃ nchez". I love to laugh hard with the show stands. "Jackass" is like walking in the garden compared to this. So if you're tired of the usual American stupidity in Jackass, try trying English idiot in this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has no taste or class. Not recommended for those who are insulted or easily inventoryed. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys need to see a psychiatrist. Specially Baku personality.
