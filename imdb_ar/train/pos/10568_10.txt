I loved this movie I saw this evening on the big screen! The audience laughed loudly at some very interesting things, and the pace was very fun. <br /> <br /> As a singer and a music director, I ask one section of Roby Keeler's voice "By a Waterfall." "The modified key, which was suddenly sung much less, with a very mellow voice that bears no resemblance to the high-pitched tin-like voice you used in all her other songs. <br /> <br /> This was exaggerated by another singer? I would love to know. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot.
