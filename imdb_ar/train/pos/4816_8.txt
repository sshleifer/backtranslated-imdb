I enjoyed the film very much and will definitely leave the audience wanting to know more, and there are really a lot of historical things to discover! <br /> <br /> Has the production team been tempted to over-dramatize, especially the shooting incident? There are tons of interesting minute material to hint at? Contribution of Prince Albert's contribution to the UK and ownership of the film on his own but was granted was not apparently part of the intention here. <br /> <br /> The costumes and collections are particularly good but I am alone in thinking that this production (which ruled the length of the titles in the end was certainly not a cheap one) was strongly wanted for the expert of the British court etiquette behind the Duke of York? For example, did Princess Victoria really secure the whole truffle (?) In her mouth while she was talking to the Prime Minister with His Majesty the King full of her mouth? <br /> <br /> 'I never felt sympathy for Victoriain for this film, or already in her shoes at all. However, I liked the casting of directors, whose representation was convincing, did the text really allow us to know them well? I always felt like I was a completely separate, out-of-the-way external observer and much more with Mrs. Brown or even the Queen. However, to be honest, I could not get my eyes out of the screen, except for some of the more extreme camera techniques that distracted attention from time to time.
