It has been around 50 years since the film was produced about romance and mysticism. The only two films I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films used great actors rather than stars. In both films, all actors presented their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" revolves around four English women after the First World War unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy during the holiday. It is amazing that "April the Enchanted" was made in 1992. It stands out as a fun classic.
