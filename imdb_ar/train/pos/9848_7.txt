I looked at this film with my child's eyes and did not feel disappointed. The story is known, some orphaned orphans must be brought to their parents by an unlikely trio (musty - tiger saber and lazy animal) ... and I do not want to forget to mention this little angry animal that is incredible to him hazenut. This made me laugh a lot during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> In short: it works, it's funny, and it is "a must" with your children (they will love it).
