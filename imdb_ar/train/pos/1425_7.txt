Just like Al Gore, we shook his faithful and cleverly filmed documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," as directors Alistair Fothergill and Mark Leinfeld remind us that the time has come to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has dire consequences for all living beings around the world. Al Gore showed us the gloomy future of the planet by providing strong facts backed by documented examples through long and always interesting monologues. Creators in this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to accomplish this. They do not give us a future representation of what might happen to our planet if we do not radically change things, but they show us the real beauty of the planet with all its amazing glory. We see places we knew existed but did not think they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide range of the most exceptional places like deserted deserts and giant forests full of animals, plants and glacial landscapes as far as the eye can see. In all of these very different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the kind of film that was necessary to make, in conjunction with a film by Al Gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is precious to interfere with. The sound of Patrick Stewart's voice is always very comfortable, so it was done well at first, even though I was watching X-men instead! Perhaps cinema is the highlight of this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that the guy who has a camera had it actually filmed all those exhilarating footage. <br /> <br /> In short: this is definitely a must for everyone. Because it matters to everyone on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I did not think our planet was amazingly beautiful!
