The use of the "demons-clergy" trend in the late 1960s / early 1970s, which featured prominently Rosemary Baby, The Spooker, and The Omen, was equally important (albeit the most obscure) In quantity). Somehow, he combines the best elements of those films and sheds in the dash of the "tenant" Polanski (released in the same year) for good measure. A new model in New York is unable to abide by her lawyer, her boyfriend, who lives in an alpine-looking country house that initially looks like the perfect place; meets an old angry game from one of Burgess Meredith's neighbors, as well as other tenants outside the center. After waking up loudly over her apartment, I soon discovered that a silent priest was herself living in the abandoned building. From there, director Michael Weiner ("Desire of Death") kicks in this supernatural excitement, and there is a satanic joy of the hallucinatory delusions of the heroine. With the help of a wonderful collection of characters, a wonderful story, and an excellent FX makeup by Dick Smith ("The Spooky"), "The Ranger" is a flick about horror.
