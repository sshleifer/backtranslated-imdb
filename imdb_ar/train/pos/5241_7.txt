An excellent film from Thaddeus O'Sullivan presents strong performances from a group of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny theme, capturing the atmosphere of despair and gloom in Belfast in the 1970s. Surprisingly, he does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. On the one hand, a young Catholic father is trying to raise his family without drifting into trouble. On the other hand, it is dealing with a loyal gang bent on spreading violence. Very interesting, thankfully, amusing. Do not expect any laughs. 7 of 10.
