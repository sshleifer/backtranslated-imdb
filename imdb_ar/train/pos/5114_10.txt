Although Urban Cowboy has not absorbed the same testosterone that you may find in Rodeo, it has provided an accurate glimpse of that day and age in urban Texas. I also think that to critique this film really, one had to live in the time and place relative to which it was made. There was good music, fun times, and yes, a few "rough and falling" in the honeys of Tonky roadhouses. The relationship between Buds and Sisi, like "two ships pass at night," was well designed. When Pam ripped the note by Sissy into the buds, he echoed the tragedy of many real romance. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the staff did an excellent job. I thought the screen play was well written and directed. Scott Glenn must have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
