I saw this small Belgian gem after two days of seeing the American Teen. Make no mistake about this, as a teenager is a roller coaster ride, be it American or European. "Naissance des Pieuvres" (or, as it is called in "Water Lillies" in the United States) is the story of a 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Aquart, sometimes a young Scarlett Johansson) In the swimming team at school, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Hanil). It is more obvious that Mary is attracted to Florian. Among all this, Anne, Mary's mysterious, unattractive friend, wants only her boyfriend like any other girl of her age. Along the way, we showed the usual group of teen entertainment (broken hearts, shop lift, alcohol abuse and / or drug abuse, casual sex, etc.). It's a quiet little movie that takes time to get to your system (fans of Michael Bay, take note: speed here is s-l-o-w, very clear), but if you do not have a problem with this, Water Lillies is enchanting. There is no evaluation here, but it would fall "R" hard, because of language, nudity, and adult situations.
