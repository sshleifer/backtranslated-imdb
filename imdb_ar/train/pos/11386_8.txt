The American In Paris is an integrated music, which means that the songs and dances are perfectly mixed with the story. The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestration by George Gershwin. <br /> <br /> The story of the film includes dance-based dance numbers designed by Jane Kelly and set on famous Gershwin tunes. Songs and music include "Got Rhythm," "Fantastic," and "Our Love is Here to Stay". Has set a new standard for the sub-content known as the songbook with dozens of Gershwin tunes buried in the lower cops. "The American in Paris", an 18-minute dance that includes Kelly and Caron to Gershwin's An American in Paris, is characterized by the daydreaming of a different artists' period, one of the longest-running dance sequences in any Hollywood film. Ballet alone costs more than half a million dollars, a staggering amount of time. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to think of such a billiard-based piece of work between producer Arthur Siddin in the rain, the Wizard of Oz, in the city, met me on Louis and Bandon Street) and Ira Gershwin. A unique idea is to buy the title so he can use it if in a film about Paris and the idea of ​​Gershwin she will only use Gershwin music. <br /> <br /> The original photographer was supposed to be Cyed Charis but discovered she was pregnant before the shooting began. Principal Kelly Kelly suggested to Leslie Caron to be a leading woman because he felt that this film needed a "real" French girl playing Liz, not just M When she got the call for the test, she said, "Who is Jeanne Kelly?" According to Sally Caron, her preliminary sequence of dance, which included an attractive dance With a chair, was considered highly suggestive by some censorship.Jean Kelly directed the short fictional dance sequences that appear during Lise's show. <br /> <br /> Vincent Minelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in George Gettyre's part and Celeste Holm "In the" Nina Fuchs "part. <br /> <br /> Manele was a leading music director with Meet Me at St. Louis (1944), American in Paris, and The Band Wagon (1953). I've used colors and songs in ways that have never been used before. He used space and time creatively. Best of all, though, he has allowed himself to abandon the long ballet chains that end all his films. Ballet in the movie "American in Paris" may be his best work. <br /> <br /> Although Vincent Minelli is considered the only director, he was sometimes linked to his divorce from Judy Garland and other pilot projects, leaving Gene Kelly to take over directing. <br /> <br /> Other highlights include Gokic's delivery of "A Stairway to Heaven"; Oscar Levant's fantasy of conducting and performing a "concerto in Wau" for Gershwin (see why he was the favorite of Oscar Levant). <br /> <br /> <br /> Ballet sequence, now that we've learned it was successful, everyone now wants to count on it, Fred, Minelli, Kelly? But before the film was completed, MGM's New York office said "No" spending half a million dollars on ballet. So, Fred went to the studio chief Louis B. Mayer himself had to agree. Finally, Gene Kelly showed the New York office how the British film The Red Shose used a long series of ballet and became a worldwide success. It is still considered an excellent example of a successful film. Well, the financial players finally surrendered checks and signed checks. <br /> <br /> There was a pause in production after November 1, 1950, when Jane Kelly started practicing ballet. By the time this final production was resumed on December 6, Vincent Menelli had finished producing another film - The Little Father for the Distribution of Profits (1951). <br /> <br /> Erin Sharaf designed a style for each of the ballet groups, reflecting many of the French impressionists: Raul Dufy (Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (Flower Market), Maurice Otrillo (a street in Paris) Henri de Rousseau, Vincent de Gogh, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (Moulin Rouge). The construction took six weeks, with 30 non-stop artists. Roger Ebert after watching the recent renovation: "An American in Paris has many qualities, not least the famous ballet number, with Kelly and Lizely Karon symbolizing the whole story of her dance." "SINGIN" in the rain makes me happy and "American in Paris" makes me feel good. "SINGIN" in the rain makes me happy and "American in Paris" makes me feel good. " The ballet represents the imagination of Kelly as portrayed by the great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Duffy) whom he admires. Arrange the screening of the film Patient Raul Duffy, actor and producer come out to the end. There, they felt relieved, they found the artist, moved to tears, and asked for a second helping of sumptuous finale. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Musical (Comedy or Music). <br /> <br /> Jane Kelly received the Oscar for that year as "Actor and Singer" Director and dancer, and specifically for his remarkable achievements in the art of dance design in the film. " He was his only Oscar.
