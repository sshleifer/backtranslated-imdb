Despite the title, The Sword Bearer, and a DVD cover (Action / Herioc in The Sword Bearer), it is not a great hero. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) It follows the story of Sasha, The Sword Pregnant, cursed with a retractable sword in his forearm. Gorgeous says, but no, this is real life. If you have this power as a child, can you control it when a crazy man says it or when your mother's friend hits it. If you do not control it, how do you deal with being a 12-year-old killer. <br /> <br /> This is the foundation when Sasha is when we meet him. Wander aimlessly after another murder (much like A Bout de Souffl√©). Then he met Katya, and the couple fell in love immediately, providing Sascha with a real reason to live and try to change his ways. However, his past continues to haunt him, in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is basically the story, and there is almost no work on the screen, although it has been suggested a lot. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. Unlike many of Hollywood's "Great Hero" films, we return to a very small story, there is no bad person (unless you count the Sword Bearer himself) there is a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> Worth checking out if you can find it.
