I like this film. It is a wonderful film that brings together English and Indian cultures with gender issues, such as girls who want to play sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows the struggle of an Indian who wants to break down cultural barriers in front of her and women who want to get out of the gender constraints found in sports, especially in England at the time. I feel that cultural conflicts are more focused than other issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike other comments, I do not think this movie is anything like dirty dancing or any other chick flick. This move is loved by many people, men and women, young and old alike.
