It was a wonderful time! Although there were only about 15 people including me there, it was fantastic! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom enjoyed it up. There were two middle-aged women there who were 20 years old and seemed to enjoy them. I like the part where both Corky and Ned like Nancy and the nice things. And when you get her Roadster and Ned there. Yes, it was such a wonderful film that people thought he did not dislike him. Go see it I bet you'll enjoy it !! I really enjoyed as well as did my friend. <br /> <br /> People were very tough in this film and did not even see it. I bet next time they will give the film and the actress a chance. They did a great job in my opinion. But if your young children still fit. Maybe I'll take my 7-year-old niece to see it too.
