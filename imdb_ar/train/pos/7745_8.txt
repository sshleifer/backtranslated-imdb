"Life strikes us in the face of ........ We must try to stay beautiful." <br /> <br /> A film by Belgian artist Tom Barman, one of the best Belgian artists. A long-awaited film and --- Farah Saeed Said Farah Flemish Filmmaking --- worth watching really and a promising piece of work! Takes us to the life of 8 of the main characters who live through Friday and night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float as they do at a Friday night party where they meet with each other. <br /> <br /> It is a rhythmic style that has been "thought". Great use of music. Sometimes it takes the top to the pictures and then feels its strength. Gainsborough! QOTSA! The concert scene (20 minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience of the way it is filmed. It really keeps you in a small place with lots of people at a big party ... it's hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Thank you menij√®r Barman for producing this bold film in this, already some of the current years, and bad times for Flemish filmmaking. you just made my day!
