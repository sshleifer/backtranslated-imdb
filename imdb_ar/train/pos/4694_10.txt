If you are a fan of movies this type of aircraft is a must see! Johnny Dangerley was appointed in the 1920s and 1930s with not only fantastic actors, but also fantastic lines. "Demolition of dat wall, demolition of dat wall and demolition of dat # @ $% # @ $ wall." "You should not hang me on Johnny's hooks" or "sounds like putting Johnny in a position". It is certainly a parody of James Cagney's old films and refers to it a lot. There is a wonderful scene when Jonis walks in the death row and there is a priest ready to escape. Listen closely to the fake priests readings, her very funny. Another wonderful sight is when Dom Dilawi plays the pope. He saw his reaction to Johnny after he looked at the pope, was said a lot without making a sound. I recommend this movie to all those who like to laugh or old movie buffs.
