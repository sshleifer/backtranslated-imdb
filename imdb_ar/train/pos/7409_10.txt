I was expecting to see a "cute little movie" from mainland China, I was not ready. The dynamics of family and society have rarely been explored and the inevitability of change is dramatically in the film. Each character is solid and fully attracted to the story. The organization is much more complex than the American public. However, there is no difficulty in following progress, even while reading translation. Jiang Wu, as his underdeveloped brother, is a steady shining light. Leave your irony in your closet. There will be when you leave.
