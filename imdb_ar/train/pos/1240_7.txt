Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Garrell, the man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When you enter beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis}, tell him that he is the chosen person and must find the golden child. Conspicuous and completely driven by lust and intrigue, Jarrell shares without realizing that he is about to embark on a fictional journey, a dangerous journey and, worst of all, Satan Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is the golden child the product of his time? , I mean, was Eddie Murphy's popularity as the child's golden child exclusive in the late 1980s? The box office was $ 79,817,937, making it the fourth largest source in 1986, but since the 1980s faded away, the main thing that has deprived Eddie Murphy of Honoring the comedy they actually once. The Golden Child is not with the most popular Murphy photos of the 1980s, such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but when I re-examine the film recently, I personally find Murphy in the best of his wise, charming and charming images! <br /> <br /> Money in the form of a fictional movement activated and temporarily installed by the Raiders of the Lost Ark In 1981, the golden child hits all buttons of the required type. A beautiful girl, daring heroine with hesitant irony in her quagmire, wrecking the villain {Charles Dance so English, I am I love you me}, gorgeous color and cute child with inner powers, the film asks you only to participate in fun, not to dissect and extract it as a fantasy skull . Yes, the CGI demon seems to be difficult now, and yes, it had much better images in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but in fact if you agree with the shameful assessment of 5 here on this site, you might take this kind of a bit too seriously. 10/07
