"Sweet is never sweet without sour." This quote was essentially the subject of the film in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who handed over everything in his life. Take things as a foregone conclusion and come in full swing in this wonderful movie with a wonderful twist. This movie will keep you in the plot and you will not be able to pause it to take a bath break. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really makes you retreat and look at your life and how you live. You can not really appreciate the best things in life (sweet), like love, so you have suffered from the bad. The theme will really make you "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted points and really hard to understand. I think the end is perfect though. I advise you to see it and see it yourself.
