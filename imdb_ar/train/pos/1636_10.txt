This is one of the greatest eighties of the twentieth century !!! She sticks it out like "Stitches in the punchbowl" !! I can not believe Mad Magazine denounced it or whatever. However, they proudly put their name in a show with Stuart, a Chinese speaking English lady and a UPS man in speed. What's up with that? I love Ron Lebman - he's a fool! I wonder why his name was removed from the credits? He was the most extreme role I know. Of course, it's hardly like Norma Rai's. But, in my opinion, this movie exists directly with the National Lampoon Vacation. If you like movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or any other teen-focused movie in the 1980s, you'll love this movie !! Rent it and you'll see what I mean!
