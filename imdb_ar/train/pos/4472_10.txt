From the very beginning you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a wonderful comedy. Jane Kelly and Frank Sinatra make a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Catherine Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the best child actor I've ever seen. If you're fond of the piano, you'll be surprised by Jose Iturbe. It was the first film to bring together real animators and actors and did so beautifully in an unforgettable dance. Be sure one of the most extreme films of Kelly.
