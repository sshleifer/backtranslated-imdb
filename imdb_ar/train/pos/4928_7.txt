By the time it was released, the story of the 1950 film "Panic in the Streets" was no surprise. The body of a mysterious illegal immigrant was found and died as a person until no further examination by the public health inspector who claimed that the carcass bore a strain of bubonic plague. But with the current drama in the world today, this film helps a stranger to appear credible to my viewers today. The cast and her crew were flawless. Richard Widmark in his first role after his stunning performance in "Night and the City" and Jack Palance in his film Cold, which also participated in this film are Paul Douglas and a young (and somewhat attractive) Barbara Bel Geddes. A full range of non-accredited and non-professional actors (typical of Kazan) fill out the remaining vacancies. Elijah Kazan releases Joe McDonnell (he will later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953's Pickup on South Street) and Alfred Newman. Almost all participants here have done a better job, "street panic" is a rewarding hour, however. Especially for film lovers Noir.
