I will be honest. I got this movie so I could make fun of it. I mean, come on, "dead hood alive"? What other reaction can I have? The thing, however, was that the film (and its makers) decided he would not make fun of it. Instead, she would do her best to be a good film. <br /> <br /> And you know what? She came terribly close. A little cheese in casual music, and more professionalism in photography, acting, and bards (like props - I love Best Buy bag) ... Well, it's not a classic kind of zombie movie, but still a very neat little film of its own. The representation, writing and speed are surprisingly better than I expected. There is even some decent humor, with two of our leaders discussing how to determine if the dead zombie has already died. <br /> <br /> If you can overlook the low budget (which, in all probability, leaves its mark, unfortunately) almost static, this can be a very fun time in movies. No, not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the manufacturers, actors and crew all tried to produce a good film (instead of the classic camp) and that's very important. The zombie movie line is a mile long and thank you, guys, for not adding them. <br /> <br /> Glory to the Queiroz brothers. I like to see what they are doing next. Oh, somebody, give them a budget!
