I loved the film because it beautifully analyzed the Italian bourgeois society, how the leftists of the seventies abandoned all their ideals and reached a happy arrangement they did not want to disturb. For example, an old psychoanalyst who is jealous of his son, does not want to be reminded of his most extreme youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time he wanted to buy the video after watching the movie a few times on the big screen and television, but it seems that it has completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy, no one in bookstores knew about the film. It is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> The one sex scene, which everyone seems to be moving on, does not hurt the film.
