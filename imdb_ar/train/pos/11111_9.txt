Perhaps Sopranos is the most open-minded chain that you might want to see. It's smart, it's weird, it's funny - it carries the mafia so well that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, who are in the underground world of crime families in New York. Most of the time, you do not really know whether wise men will stab someone in the back, or buy lunch. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realistic approach of the characters in this show, there is the depth of their characters - these are dangerous men, most of them murderers, but of God if not loved them too. I laughed at their wise release, and was torn when they erred in judgment, and I was afraid of the extreme cruelty of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban setting in New Jersey is perfect for the subtext of this show - people are not always the same, and the blatant contrast between wetness and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals are even more likely. <br /> <br /> If you do not already do so, you should definitely.
