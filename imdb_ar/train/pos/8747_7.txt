* Potential spoilers * Although it has been done before (and better) in "Midnight Express" and "Return to Paradise", Brokedown Palace still strikes a chord with me. <br /> <br /> Here we have the story of two young girls traveling across Thailand, arrested for drug trafficking. Was Claire Danis Alice? Was Kate Beckinsell Darlin? Was he the odd stranger who met him on their trip? None of this is really important, this is the story of friendship and trust and the limits to which it can be extended. Bill Bellman is thrown as an enthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride (and a lawyer better than him) and we have a nice little story that draws the attention of the public. <br /> <br /> The Brocadeon Palace is not unusual, or infamous for any reason - it is not an original concept and does not show an exciting violence that leads to an audience that speaks of "bold realism" or "blatant truths" - it's just A good story with some beautiful shows. Bill Pullman was weakened by his slow pace and brilliant manner of speaking - I was very bored by the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsell, despite being decent, is nothing amazing. It works well, but it's not an unforgettable performance at all. <br /> <br /> However, Jacqueline Kim is in good shape, making a character that is gracious and specific where, in fact, there is little to do with it. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake - this is the movie Clear Dance. I've always admired her work, and that's not a change. She captures every scene in which she appears, and otherwise, the film will likely turn into a boring fare. I pay particular tribute to her performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a great track. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
