I recently rented this document, having remembered hearing it from IMDb.com and fascinated by the idea. I did not know much about any of these teams, but I remember hearing "Not if I was the last addict on earth" by Dandy Warhols since ages and enjoyed it. However, this is my view of the document: <br /> <br /> One thing I found incredible about this film is that there is no need to know ahead of time about either of these teams. The director Ondi Timoner does not waste any time in engaging the audience and introducing them to the people in this film. Soon it became sad for both Anton and Courtney, as well as their teams, the massacre of Brian Johnston and Dandy Warhols. I think this is part of what makes this document very good, and what makes Ondi Timoner such a major documentary. <br /> <br /> I also liked how the "story" of these teams was told. Most of what you see is from bands on tour. Both teams start playing in small places and struggling to make it into the recording industry. Throughout the film, each band seeks to remain unique and unchecked by Al Qaeda. Although this is what makes the two bands so similar, and thus the glossy perspective on how two strips of badminton move in different directions. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the movie in general. You do not need to have special love for documentaries, or any of the bands. The appreciation of the music helps, but the music itself takes the back seat of the love / hate relationship between the massacre of Brian Johnstown and Dandy Warhols.
