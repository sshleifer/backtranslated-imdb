I'm a man, I do not give to women's movies, but this is a really good private story. I do not have any personal love for Gene Fonda as a person but she does one good hell job, while DeNiro is the same as usual. Everything is fine: representation, output, images, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy the story of real people and true love - this is a winner.
