The film itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. It was very funny. Angelina Jolie was as great as Juliet. The parents are Farhanan. They serve food as well as enemies. Children play Romeo and Juliet in the play of the Church. They fall in love and their parents try to distance them from each other. After a party do this. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the film. If you do not like stereotypes and do not see classical literature. If you do not mind getting a blast watch this one.
