For those who are not familiar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "lesser" films of his career later. Although it is not a great film compared to many of its other images, it is not bad and passes a decent time - but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and inexplicably decided to throw a mantra on poor Jimmy to make her fall in love with her. Over time, Ms. Novak starts cold and separate in love with Stuart - and apparently in the book Rules of the Witch, this is definitely not, no !! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its sensitivities about magicians. They do not represent the sacrifice of their children or the mighty ones. Most of their charm is very limited and meaningless (like using Jack Lemon's powers to extinguish street lamps). Curiously, all witches seem to be bohemian lounging in hip ribbons where you might find people wearing hats and listening to crazy jazz. Given my opinion of jazz, you should be really stingy to be a witch in the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is very romantic and comedy to say the least, but not something I'm quick to see. The acting is very good, but the script does not offer enough reward to make this film an extraordinary film - in fact, I have recorded a film almost 6 - it was very close.
