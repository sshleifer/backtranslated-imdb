I studied Charlotte Brunate's high school novel, and left me a stunning impression. There was a beautiful novel about a young struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman, Jane Eyre, was a poor, ordinary, strong-minded person and her own will. Her story, which Bronte told her through Jane's eyes, was sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we saw the story change in 1983, and blew me away. The mini-series did not make an effort to preserve the original text of the protagonist and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were wonderful. Zila Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, on behalf of Rochester) have captured the essence of their characters brilliantly. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (Other versions of Rochester in other versions, such as the 2006 version, lack the passion, the energy and the tenderness to film Rochester accurately.) Timothy Dalton is in the forefront because he has all these characteristics in his portrayal of Rochester, not just Clark Jane Eyre, But she is also characterized by firmness, ambition and passion, as she carries her emotions, like Jane the Book, at the right moment in the story, but allows her to shoot Jane. .) Well, the representatives are calling Men also fit with their roles perfectly, and fit the Gothic nature collections of the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before, you can see this production as a true introduction to this beautiful story.
