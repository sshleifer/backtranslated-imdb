This is the first film Michael Vartan I've seen - I did not see the nickname and I was curious to see if the guy could act. Surely he could be loved in this film. Usually in the physical roles and excitement, so I found her very well and loved in this different "beautiful" role of the school teacher. Some of the negative comments I have read are true, and the film is full of clichés, and the story does not appeal at all. Well, although every character in the film shows how good they look together, I do not think there's a screen chemistry out there. However, I enjoyed this movie. The languages ​​are beautiful, the characters are pet and good-looking and the actors are good supporters. If you expect to see a great love story, that's not true. But if you want to watch a beautiful innocent film with good grainy characters, it is very good.
