I'm a fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed off my ass during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also love him in his serious films, especially Truman Shaw. This one is the intersection between his very funny side, and his serious side. It's of course very funny in this film, but there are very serious parts, and it draws it a lot. He is already a multifunctional representative. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the actors, I was happy to represent Jennifer Aniston. I think it's more than just a couple of nice tits and a big ass. Morgan Freeman makes God very cool. As for Steven Karel, his limited scenes are very funny, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to set this up by 9. Good behavior, funny script, and some very dangerous situations make this a very good movie
