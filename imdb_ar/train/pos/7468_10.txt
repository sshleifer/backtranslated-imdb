As the one-line summary says, two such words left me when I came out of the theater. The film was "Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and leave the movie fast wherever you want ... Going out of the cinema was a bit strange The thing, such a feeling you feel when you are sick and you can not think of anything. One of those movies that I became one with the man, and feel that nothing else moves you from the things in the film. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure. The actors are fantastic, the audio track is excellent, and everything in the movie is 9+. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the best movies I have ever seen, the movie that has made the best and most famous wake up my life and my goal in this world.
