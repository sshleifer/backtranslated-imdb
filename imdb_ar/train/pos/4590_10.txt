Maybe the film itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone will agree with me that the Battle of the Mall was one of the best fighting scenes ever. There were also some memorable stunts, which were so wonderful that they made this movie a classic. This film has influenced many other motion films, and I believe that motion picture makers should now learn from this film (like they can reshape this chase scene, and I am proficient in modern techniques that they can improve). There were also some scenes The funny thing that made this movie so enjoyable was when Jackie was not fighting. I think you could put more fighting scenes in this movie.
