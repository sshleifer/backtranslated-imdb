The girl from Missouri arrives in New York City to fully understand what she wants: to somehow reach through the millionaire's marriage - without losing her virginity. With her wonderful courtly looks, I quickly caught the attention of a playboy son of a pole, but by staying faithful to her virtue, would she also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow enjoys this excellent little comedy. With her platinum hair and fabulous sessions, she is dazzling. But her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was a very good actress. I've really gained its place at the top of the Pantheon in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The distinguished cast of Harlow offers a good support: Lionel Barrymore as the old depth leader, wise in Harlow ways; handsome as his son Frank, son of his son, fond of love; the loud Patsy Kelly, stealing her sights as Harlow's owner; Debuner Alan Mowbray, English Good attitude; old Clara Blandick as a brawling secretary Barrymore; hearty Hill Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for ladies. Nat Bendlitton's muscles were saved as Kelly's flirtatious eyes; Louis Stone, a small role as a bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was produced shortly after the Hollywood Production Act was passed. The comparison with the red-headed woman, two years ago, would be fantastic - Harlow's character follows the same goals, but uses very different means.
