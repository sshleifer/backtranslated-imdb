I remember seeing this as a child in the UK, fascinated by the story and by Lawrence Oliver. We were talking about anything else in school the next day. I imagine that the ratings for the premiere were huge. This is simply the best comprehensive documentary film series despite the fact that they had to cut the story to the point where they managed to catch a lot. Interestingly, the battles between Britain and North Africa were central but not widely recognized by the Americans. The series reflects the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of German troops on the Eastern front, and the ill-treatment of Japanese prisoners of war by US forces. The images of the Holocaust made me, a non-Jew European, feel guilty forever about the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one in the IMDb classifications. They may show their bias against documentaries. The spoiler - we won.
