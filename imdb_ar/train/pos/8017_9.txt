This time, Kermit, Fawzi, Mays Peggy, Scooter, Rolloff, The Electric Maime, Gonzo and Camilla have all graduated from the University and are performing a musical drama they are trying to get on Broadway. Having failed miserably to produce it, are all divided and go in separate ways. I love the characters and the veil. The songs in the film are "Together Again", "Look at Me, I'm Here", "Say Goodbye", "I'm Always Going to Love You", "Jazz Rat" and "Will Make Me Happy". Frank Ouz plays this film excellently, and all actors do a great job acting like a real Muppets game. Look! 91 minutes. Category G. My rating: A.
