This is by far the most wonderful film I've seen in a long time. The actors gave great pictures of the characters in the film. The story was filmed accurately. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles, her father traveling on a steamer to Nauvo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and did not. He thought it was silly to make the trip and disappointing. She encourages him to read the prophet Joseph Smith. This is where the story of Joseph Smith begins. The film accurately depicts his life and some history of the LDS Church at the same time. I had drawing sometimes, but there was a need. The emotional expression was very reasonable, causing my feelings to subside. The photography was wonderful. The way in which the story was presented was impressive. After the film ended, we sat there unable to move. I was astounded. For people who know little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I encourage you to see this. If there is nothing other than gaining some understanding of his life. For those members of the Church, I encourage you to see them. It will increase your degree from this most incredible man. This is a must see.
