First, this is the most entertaining movie I have ever seen. It includes a timeless distraction, a sense of sexual humor, and intelligent intellectual attitudes. But it goes deeper than that. The Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we do not see often) that gave me hope of having a love there; that two people love each other can work through their ordeal and that such a comedy takes life (something I think we should all) Really important people. Chris Meloney performs a convincing performance like Barry Singer that he should have won the Academy Award. The film is brilliantly written and I hope to see more films from all concerned in the future.
