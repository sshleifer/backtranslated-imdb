My favorite type of film is the West, it's really the only kind of film that is of American origin. Despite Sergio Lyon, no one does them just like the Americans. <br /> <br /> Directly at the top of your favorite Ten Western list is Winchester 73. The first black-and-white film was only co-directed by Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a historic film in which Stuart chose a percentage of the profits instead of a direct salary from Universal. Many of these deals have been followed for players, making them as wealthy as the wealthy who used them. <br /> <br /> So far, Anthony Mann has made B photos, and Noir things without real budgets. Before Winchester 73 Man had worked well with Robert Taylor, Devour's Devils, who did not get enough praise. I'm sure that James Stewart had seen it and decided that Man was the person who decided his partnership. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mann also developed a small stock company as John Ford was legendary. Along with other Stuart team members such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Prodi, Dan Doria, John McIntyre, and Jay C. With a man named Dutchman Henry Brown found and killed. Why would not I say, but so far we have not seen such cold anger from James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann reached the soul of Jimmy Stewart and took out some demons, and we are all afraid that we have. <br /> <br /> Hatred appeared appropriately at a great moment towards the beginning of the film. After Stuart and his friend Millard Mitchell were disarmed by Will Geer's White Earb because firearms are not carried in the Dodge City Airbodge. There is a shooting competition for the Winchester Gun in Dodge City and the favorite bet is Dutch Henry Brown, who played a threat from Steven McNally. Stewart, Mitchell, and Jerry go to the salon and Stuart and McNally are at each other at the same time and can access weapons that did not exist. Look at the close associates of Stewart and McNally, say more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Stewart's other character in the film is Waco Johnny Dean, played by Dan Doria, who almost steals the movie. This may be the best moment in Duryea on the screen. He is a mentally challenged murderer drawn from the left hand although he has six pistols. <br /> <br /> There is another person Stuart is meeting with Shelley Winters, whom she periodically kidnapped into confrontation and killed. The best sights are with Duryea who takes her fancy. They play for a while so you can escape it safely. Guess who will end up in the end? <br /> <br /> There are some great performances in some small roles, and there is no trivial observation in the cast. John McIntyre, as an attractive Indian trader, and Jay C. Fleben, as Army Sgt. And Rock Hudson, received his first real notice as a young Indian leader. Even John Alexander, known as Theodore Roosevelt in Arsenic and Old Lacey, has a short but impressive role as the owner of a trading center where McNally and Stewart stop at different times. <br /> <br /> Man and Stewart made eight films together, five of them Western, and was ready to make a sixth western track, a night pass when they quarreled and Man came out of the group. The end of a beautiful partnership produced some good films.
