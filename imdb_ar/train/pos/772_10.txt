The most beautiful love ... in all its manifestations ... wonderful, very wonderful ... Theodore Cheryla, Maria Pobiestaso and Ioan Barbo, a truly exciting story about love in all its forms, a story about the irrevocable ways of the hearts of youth, Skilful of Theodore Giurgiu. With the wonderful soundtrack of Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, it surprises us in all ways, leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love ... Really wonderful ... Am I or is Roman photography slowly but steadily gaining respect? This is a wonderful movie ... thumb for all participants.
