I'm not a commentator on this website, but I see how weak this film is, and I'm trying to write some comments and observations about it. I enjoyed watching this film, perhaps because Cat is all I wish to be. I will not publish spoilers or uncover plots, but there are things I've really discovered that are amazing, the way you treat people, it's just divine. This film is a little underestimated, I lack the arguments here, I usually go to enjoy, then I talk a bit about it, when you go to the cinema to enjoy, and I really enjoyed the 51 hour that I stayed in the dark room. You must see again and again until the joy disappears. Let's try not to be critical in that. thank you for reading.
