I enjoy watching people dance, especially if they do it, as well as in the best scenes of this movie, which takes you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas time, because it also shows "MC Santa Claus". <br /> <br /> Even if this was an old film, and even if you had filmed it by video from the TV, when the film archive in Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their big screen, I went there to check it out. It's more fun on the big screen compared to the TV. <br /> <br /> Even if many people here think that watching this on the big screen is a waste of money for the cost of the tickets, I do not agree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the value of money by seeing this, because it On the big screen, especially in the first row of cinema, the experience is memorable, much better than the video only.
