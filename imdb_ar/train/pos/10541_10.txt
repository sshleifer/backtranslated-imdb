I think this was a great movie. Song theme sweet! :) Anyway, it was the only thing that bothered me somewhat at first, when everything should have been normal. It was very strange and unreal. The big cable company is what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the film was very creative. I think that all the actions were well done, and that the representatives behaved very personally. Everything works well together. It is truly shameful that this is not a soundtrack. This would be great! Because this is a Canadian film and because it's one of my favorites, I give this movie 10 out of 10!
