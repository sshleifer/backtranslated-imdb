This was a great show. Not only did the children have what I thought at first, they were all for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mostly about the father who took care of his daughters and son. He died in the second season, and I believed it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I'm an apostate that they followed the show because what will really happen in life really and I need to mention the farewell ring has been well made and it should be very hard for them to portray this, you can say they were real tears in their eyes. I am 24 years old and this episode has led me to cry and I know how they felt that my father died when I was 13 years old just like Roy. <br /> <br /> The second season and the third season were a great comedy in the third season as well. I had some favorites like Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think the show was strong enough to follow, I was disappointed because it was over, it was the best without it was the best family comedy show since home improvement, and could have been friends next. <br /> <br /> It was not supposed to end, but I still love watching daily duplicates.
