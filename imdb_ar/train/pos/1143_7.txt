I do not watch the soap. My grandmother is still watching that clock with the glass of the clock. I ridiculed them when I was 10 years old (it was very easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie takes a parody and illustrates it in a new way. I found a beautiful damn funny story. Fashion 1980s - shoulder pads, sequins, polyester - tops. Huge hair, high heels and history - what a mix. <br /> <br /> All the actors go to the city and chew their pieces and spit it into a large, well-written pile. Sally, Kevin, Elizabeth - Fantastic! Woo - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him again when he had such a potential, before the newspapers. Gary: Why do we have to wait a long time to see him in the film? Lisa Gibbons - I did not miss her, but it's good to include her as a real entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for a job, anyway?). <br /> <br /> Surely I would have done that without Sally climbing the drain. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times? , As did every comedian from Carroll Burnett because I do not know who I am and I did it now, and I can spit peanuts if I have. This seems to be what you do when you're funny in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful that they did not pull the flagpole. <br /> <br /> But he was nice, he was funny, he had sketches, and he had the end credits before he was common, clothes deserved second look, she had a wonderful crew and she had personal memories. Really, what more do you need?
