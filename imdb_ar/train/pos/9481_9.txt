Xiao Zhen Zhi Chun wonderful film, not only the year in which he was filmed but also now. It is an art film that is no longer in the 21st century. The director kept a good narrative skill, and thus made the story very smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the new French Wave film "Femme d'a cote" written by Fran√ßois Tropot, a similar theme.
