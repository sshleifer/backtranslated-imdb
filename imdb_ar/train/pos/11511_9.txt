Sometimes weak scripts? Yeah! Special effects cheesy at times? Yeah! Fun guilty most of the time? Yeah! More about Karl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yeah! I always enjoyed science fiction as a child, but I found a lot of things like Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / Horror just as it was nonsense. Abbott and Costello required me to give us a new view of the classic Universal Monsters, and it took Carl Kolchak to win me on the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had a Maverick, Rockford, Selleck, Magnum, Darren McGavin and Carl Kolchak. Combining all those weak texts, special cheesy influences, that Baroque group of supporting characters, actors and guest stars, there was Darren McGaven as Karl Kolchak. He had a sense of irony of humor despite the danger, and was perfect in his pursuit of truth, and realistic when it came to accepting mandatory incompetence and final coverage by government officials. In addition, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was prepared to put out his neck and do what he had to do, even if that meant his death, the end of his journalistic career, or the time of his imprisonment. Despite all his mistakes, including his lack of taste in clothing, Karl Kolchak was a man of charm and intelligence. He led a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (an old used car at the time) on his way to save humanity's day. As good as any imaginative hero Carl Kolchak was the hero of every man who comes alive every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that it has been shown and displayed on DVD, I hope to enjoy watching it and enjoying playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
