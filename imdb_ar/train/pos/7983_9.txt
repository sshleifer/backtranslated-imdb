It is difficult to lead this film in several ways. Everything works really well here; acting, photography, cinema and cinematography are all first class. For the film director, it is an emotional and violent story of love and human salvation. For the film critic, there is a lot of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical errors, and as discussed in the boards, the end lacks realism if one is strictly formal with the CIA training angle. However, I have ended up being more motivated by the fact that instead of following the practical approach of the CIA agent, Creasy is essentially praising his spirit to Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, becomes a miraculous miraculous through his sacrifice, be it logical or not. In any case, I appreciate the fact that Crissy ignores traditional bourgeois morality and puts only the bad guys one by one in his systematic quest for justice, which in fact leads to salvation for himself and the innocent. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is worth watching if you are attracted to this genre at all. Make excellent soundtrack, brilliant writing, flawless casting, and powerful performances in all areas of the best 100 films (or better).
