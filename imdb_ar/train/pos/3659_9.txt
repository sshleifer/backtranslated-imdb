This film was my first contact with Mr. Sica, so I did not really know what to expect. But what I saw just shattered all my expectations - in a good way. <br /> <br /> The story of the story is not complicated and show us the life of an orphan boy and especially found his relationship with the poor community who meet together built themselves a cover of simple metal plate houses. This small city in another city lives a special life and things are going well. But one day, a water source and a wealthy gentleman were found interested in buying the place. But as the movie title suggests - there is a miracle happening. Our character gets a wonder pigeon from his dead mother. What will he do to protect his friends and all the built cities as well? <br /> <br /> It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy. It shows poor behavior and how money and property can talk and play with people. Many laughable moments and scenes are also included - initially with the spot where the sun shines and many more. <br /> <br /> So by the fact that I'm not a comedian, you should watch this movie because I liked it so much
