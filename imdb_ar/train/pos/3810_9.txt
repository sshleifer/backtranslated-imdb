This is my first evaluation on IMDb, I did not really want to write one, but since there are only two films for this wonderful film right now, I feel compelled to add my point ... No, I'm not affiliated with filmmakers in any way Yes, how many times have you been here before ;-)) For my information I am in my late twenties <br /> <br /> First of all I must admit that I really like animation films, because what you see is limited only to creative imagination and they were creators Very in this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a new and very unique visual style. The characters look good but they are far from reality and they work well for the film, after all this is a fantasy-like world. But backgrounds and the world in general are full of terrible images dropped by the jaw several times while watching this. The little rabbit-like blue dragon directs the show and easily enjoys some of the most beautiful moments of the film, it's actually a fast classic, like Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not very surprising (a group of heroes must come out and slaughter the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds well ;-) 1 thing to point out, imo the movie is not suitable for very young children because it has some scenes The darkest, it might be scary for children under the age of 6-8 and I would say that these are very few sights but it is worth mentioning IMO. Anyway, I've spent a wonderful time watching this and can not wait until I reach the shops on high alert to see it over and over again just for its sheer beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 For me
