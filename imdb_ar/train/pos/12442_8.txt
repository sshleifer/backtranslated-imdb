The movie was shown on an impossible schedule and there was no budget to talk about, it was much better than you would expect, and certainly more honest with Peter O'Donnell's books and the comic strip of the previous two films. You can read the tape currently in print from Titan Books, or Comics Revue per month. It's one of the greatest adventure videotapes of all time. The movie is not great, but unlike most low-budget movies, it gets the most out of what you got, and it interests you. On DVD extras, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, which is obviously stoned, is a gas. Some people in Tarantino had made a mistake in associating his name with the film, but without it he would never have made it. He is a humble admirer of Belize and has chosen a writer and a good director. All things considered, worth 8 stars.
