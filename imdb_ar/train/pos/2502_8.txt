This movie surprised me! I have never heard of Hyde Gakt I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie is that one of them mentioned that the movie contains some scenes of serious traffic in John Woo's style! I am usually very careful when you ask for it! There is only one John Woo, and this day there was no one way out approaching his luster when it comes to work! The fact that the "baby moon" will be a vampire advantage convinced me more! How can you make a mistake with a fire gunner blazing! It looks promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this film was that the pace was pretty slow! It takes time to adjust the mood! This movie contains some wonderful scenes of Hong Kong style! But "Baby Moon" is not a motion picture! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! Focus on characters and their relationship to each other! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do good acting, and can be believed as friends! The only problem I faced was with the plot! It seems that the film goes beyond a few years without explaining what happened and why he had to skip! For example: when a gang member dies (a very exciting moment) Alexander Wang finds that Ki (Hyde) is drinking the blood of an attacker! Without warning and explanation, the film skips nine nine years and most friends did not come back together! Also without proper reason a certain son (Alexander Wang) and Shu (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know that this is to add some serious drama! Because of the actors, they are very effective but sometimes they feel forced! Apart from the flaws in the plot, this film has the ambience and softness that makes it hard to dislike this film! It's hard to explain why this wonderful movie! But only it! The overall experience you get is intimate and sincere!
