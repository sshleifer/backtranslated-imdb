Since the godfather's epic was the mafia's view of the executive wing, this series is a complex story of the mafia from the point of view of the working man. If you never see this show, you're in a fun place. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but this is absolutely unjustified. There is a need to compare Tony Soprano, the gangster who thinks about the reality of his life, and frankly, he would not even leave knowing how many of his colleagues ended up. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his treatment, then hit a man to death with a pan in a fit of rage, and while cutting the body and getting rid of it with his nephew, take a rest, sit down and watch TV while eating peanuts butter outside the jar, Brother about his next marriage like they just finished on Sunday afternoon to watch NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when given an opportunity to come out, finds that she really favors life with Tony and the privileges that accompany her and looks the other way about his ambitions for life on her own. If you follow everything, you know how it ends. If you are not, trust me that you have not seen a TV show that ends this way.
