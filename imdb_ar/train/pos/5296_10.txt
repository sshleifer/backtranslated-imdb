Absolutely hilarious. John Waters' tribute to the people he loves most (the Timorese) is a bit of boredom and a lot of things to be seen and laughed at. It's like turned loose in the Art Gallery! I have not laughed much in the theater since my mother's series. I loved seeing old friends from Dream Land, Sharon Nessip and Susan Lowe, in front of Waters Camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plympton). Uses the best elements of past water horrors (especially underrated polyester) and many new surprises. He made me sick, in a wonderful way. Thanks John!
