This film looked like a classic in this kind of italian of the eighties, which is my favorite type, so when I saw it was free on demand, I had to watch it! Starring Caroline Monroe, from Dr. Vibs (his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, the golden trip to Sindbad, Captain Cronos - Vampire Hunter, the spy who loved me, Manic and Vasilis. <br /> The people behind you Do not open Til Christmas and Pieces, Heres My thoughts about this ... <br /> <br /> It begins on April Fool's Day, where a group of children played a neat joke on the school, announced his sex in the bathroom, and gave him public insult and face in The toilet (all this while Naked!). The coach puts an end to this, but both sides swear revenge. But, in the end, the nice children are burning alive. <br /> <br /> Only the future, secondary school reunification, or so they think (with which?). The only ones who have received invitations are the gang that burned the child, the April Fool's Day (or, in fact, before April Fool's Day, but the fun begins at midnight), yet they fail to see the chance and hang out in front of the school until dark. Then they finally rush to school and begin to break into. <br /> <br /> Inside, they find food / drink and a small mansion for each of them, each with their own closets and possessions, in addition to the Marty (manicured) wardrobe and a yearbook. They also find an old black guard / guard who spends his time saying, "Oh, I'm glad, I'm going, I do not want any problem, sir!" Then kill immediately. Beautiful figure is meaningless, but still is my favorite. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a page from Alien, in a wonderful and delicious way that you just have to watch! This is when everyone realizes that they are there to die and start to panic, except Shirley, who decides that it would be better to shower in the old school baths at such a time. Of course, spills blood and acid and melts her face (very cool, keep in mind) the rest of the night goes as usual and sex and drugs and Marty kill everyone while wearing the clown mask .. What is their plan? "All we have to do is stay awake and wait until noon, Marty will not kill us during the middle of the day!" Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently you can only kill at night. But will they stay all night? Who will live and who will die? Why do all the bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal this great movie to see! The movie is very good indeed, full of clich√©s (the car will not start, DAMMIT!) And just a simple fun. Not to mention they all have names like Carroll, Nanny, Frank, Joe and Susan. I highly recommend it to you all! Not to mention that it contains Spin Off! 1989 Cut Class is a separate part of this gem, and this film begins the life of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: two people have sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl does not. "Tell me Dirty Frank!" She screams "ah ... boobs!" "Dirty"! "Uh ... breasts ... F * ck .. breast breasts .. F * ck." It seems to work for it and at its peak, the killer is both shaken!
