John Voight plays a man named Joe. The atmosphere was shaken by a terrifying childhood. He has strong fear and hatred of religion because of his painful baptism. He left his job as a dishwasher and went out to become a fraudster for the rich. He meets as Ratsu (Dustin Hoffman) and the two have a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. Both grow significantly and soon can not live without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratsu has not told him by atmosphere, and can destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together. This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a tragic and devastating picture of a single, very lonely man who has nothing to lose but the other. Their story is devastating to watch, but it is ultimately important that people see it. It is one of those films in which characters are very similar to the crazy people you sometimes find on the street. The difference is that this film is from their point of view. Their lives show us and it is devastating to see pedestrians in this film treating them like dirt, especially if we were one of those people. However, the film does not try your fault. Instead, it shows you the harsh side of the hustle lifestyle. It's not a nice and comfortable lifestyle like many Hollywood movies like MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of the hustler is a dirty, courageous and ugly life, and sadly people have deteriorated like Joe's character in this film. What surprised me most about this film was that it came out in 1969, and has stood the test of time perfectly. Today's fans will continue to get a great meaning in this film and will continue to love and cherish it, just as critics and audiences everywhere did in 1969. The film was rated X, but what I have noticed in this film is that sexual activity is portrayed in a more honest way Realistic and effective. Anyone who has been fucked by will know how to be humorous, awkward, and scary as hell and this movie is not ashamed of anything of this. Sex in this film may not be as graphic as it used to be. Movies classified as X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, Orange Clock, GREATINGS, LANG TANGO in Paris, and Fritz the Cat, all look great compared to the horrible things that people can get through the R rating today. The sex scenes at MIDNIGHT COWBOY will look very powerful but certainly not exciting. It's not graphical, but realistic, and that's what people should consider when watching this movie. The language of the session used in the film, especially the word "fag" used effectively and not free. Violence is very shocking to watch the day, but again it is necessary to plot to portray the world of a fraudster. I am really pleased to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is undated and continues to affect as much as it was in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope you continue to find an audience because it is really a memorable special experience and will not be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> - John Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both horrifying and amazing to watch. They have not played such roles before or since and they are quite different from the usual. You'll forget who plays with them in minutes! <br /> <br /> - Pretty degree <br /> <br /> - There is no history at all or like many movies in that decade as it is today <br /> <br /> - A great and fast editing function < br /> <br /> CONS: <br /> <br /> - For mature audiences only <br /> <br /> - The opening scenes are well done, but they may be a bit stronger.
