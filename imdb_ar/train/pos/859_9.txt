It is very rare to find a film that provides an unimaginable plot at every turn. Surprises around cheer. <br /> <br /> There are some things that I could not fully understand, although you have a leading female character here who plays the role of "good girl, hard worker", but eventually ends up being a risk against society. It was not enough to make me do not like it, but it did not stop me. <br /> <br /> The other thing I could not get was the old man who was dismissed by the police at the end of the film. I never got who he was or what she was. If anyone has any ideas, I would like to hear what may be. <br /> <br /> The movie was exciting and enjoyable all the time and always left me guessing. deserve watching
