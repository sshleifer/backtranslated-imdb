I do not know exactly how to explain a "dark room", because summarizing it will not really benefit. It is a short film of Linchian with two beautiful girls in a strange and mysterious position. I would say that this shortcut is definitely more at the end of the Mulholland Drive than the Linchian spectrum, rather than the Elephant Man or the Straight Story. It's hidden on the Lynch site, and worth searching.
