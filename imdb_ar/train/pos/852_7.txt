MATADOR is a successful film for Light .... if you can say that about a successful movie. The violence did not really appear but was often presented. At first I was afraid of entering another movie for the mysterious comedy series in the mid-1990s, but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that this was just a sweet story and a sense of humor about friendship. There is nothing shocking about this film, but every part of it keeps me smiling. The three shows have the best chemistry from the big screen in recent years and seem to have spent a wonderful time making this film together. The writing is sharp though it is sometimes felt as if the text has been adapted from the play because of the scenes of one set of dialogue. It's a good movie I may not remember for a long time but at that time it was a complete joy. New Movie.
