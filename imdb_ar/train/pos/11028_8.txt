To be honest, I did not like this movie very much when I first saw it. But I think the problem is that I have not seen it in the theater. big mistake! Because the # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and # 2 is the cinema. Try watching this movie on the largest possible TV and sound system. The music is good and puts the film at a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I saw him, the more I liked him. <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of the best movies of Rene Harlin. This man knows about work. Die Hard 2, Long farewell kiss, ect. It is particularly good in this film. Your effect is great and amazing. Stallone really needs to recover the movie successfully. Still good to see it!
