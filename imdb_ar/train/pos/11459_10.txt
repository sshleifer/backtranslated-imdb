On one level, this film can bring out a child who just wants us to build sandstones and throw things in the air just to see him fall again. At a deeper level though, it explores a deep desire to reconnect with the Earth. "When I'm not here for a period of time, I feel like I'm not rooted," he said. <br /> <br /> Andy Goldsworth is considered one of the greatest contemporary artists. I am familiar with his work mainly through his books on the coffee table and the facilities of a couple art gallery. But his vision of action during motion, which was ideally captured by the Redesheimer lens, was a revelation. Goldsworthy's creations have not frozen in time, they hover, rotate, dissolve, collapse and break. <br /> <br /> That's exactly what it's about: time. The process of creation and destruction. Of appearance and disappearance. From out of the void and become the universe, back again. There is a shamanic quality about him, about to madness. You feel that you watch him watching him at work, that his art is the lifeline of him, and that if he does not, he will go and die. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the means of communication for photography. Otherwise, except for a few walls and walls, they exist only for one person.
