It should be illegal to not try this very funny show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like this. <br /> <br /> Murphy continues for about 70 minutes around the Dix, the camel and the breast and assaults many famous people including his "family". Among the people they got through Murphy: Elvis, Mister T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandros and James Brown. I have never seriously laughed at anything in my life. I mean that when a person does not know who Mr. T is, but he still laughs hard at Murphy like Mr T, there's something about it. At that time, I watched the show that I did not remember who was Mr. T. But he was still laughing. Now I know who it is and that just makes it more funny. Because this is what Eddie does - he can make these impressions so good that it does not matter who the hell he tries to do, it's still our joy. Moreover, we learned that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please see it ..
