In what should be one of the most bloodless films ever, a transsexual kills people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. One can see how Bryan Dibalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and objects. Michael Caen plays a more thoughtful character, while Angie Dickinson is essentially a bored woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who starred in "Christine") may be the most interesting character in the film. But you can not really understand this film without seeing it. After seeing it, you may never know who you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Denise Franz.
