It's a good show, and I find it funny. Finally, bad Latin stereo types ended up! Â¡Gracias, Senor Lopez! I loved this show and started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept of a Latino family television program really surprised me. I am surprised that Latins in the end have a good chance of television. This is probably the best show I've ever seen, it's funny, very intimate, and it's funny.
