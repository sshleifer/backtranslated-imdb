I am a fan of Kung Fu, but I am not a fan of Wu. I have no interest in gangster movies full of fireworks. Now, martial arts. *this is beautiful! John Woo surprised me here by producing a very enjoyable kung fu movie, which is almost too much fighting, if this thing is possible! These are good things. <br /> <br /> Many of the fighting scenes are very good (some are less quality), and the main characters are amusing and lovable. The bad guys are unbelievably wicked, but the entertainment is less than that. You should see the Sleep Wizard! He can only fight when he's asleep - he's hysterical! <br /> <br /> When you see it again, the Last Hurray For Chivalry can tend to get some boredom and long wind, especially since many of the fighting scenes are not really good. Hence, I set it up "only" out of 7 out of 10. But it is actually "nearly 8". <br /> <br /> All in one of the best kung fu movies, which is made in your heart by the Kung Fu President Cinema. All the really good kung fu movies from mid to late seventies, with some notable exceptions from the late sixties and early seventies (and early eighties, to be fair).
