After seeing only two of his photographs earlier, I reached an agreement with Altman. Before that, I always described his style in filmmaking as "boring." You just have to be in your right mind to appreciate his crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is somewhat underestimated, and very questionable. In fact, I do not think it was even issued to the VHS. why is that? When all these crazy movies get DVD releases every day, is this movie left without good reason? Frankly, I had no real problems with this film. It was, for the most part, amusing and constantly funny. All the scenes are almost mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it wonderful dialogue or hidden presentations. There is real skill here. <br /> <br /> The task of Paul Dolly at the bottom of the pool in the middle of the road is fantastic. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most sludge that gets DVD versions. Hell, I'll be happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> They are often on Fox Movie Channel, so look for them.
