Hayao Miyazaki's name became prominent in Spitied Away, but what is often overlooked is the director's first efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg took a duel or George Lucas took THX 1138? I remember seeing the fragments of this film - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late 1980s and what was stuck with me is the visual oddity of the design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known shop for 9 pounds, I could not resist buying it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the film do not correspond to my memory (memory is funny this way). <br /> <br /> This movie is now showing with all the knowledge gained from the portfolio of artists is how Jean Moubios Gerard like some works of art. I can only assume some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu takes possession of a girl who falls for a Chita, his adventure begins - looking for Labota - in reference to the part of Jonathan Swift that has been overlooked in Gulliver's travels. With the health signals of Jules Verne, it's a good basic film versus a bad chase with the final part that the heroes end up in Labouta. <br /> <br /> This is the strongest part of my memory - "Pastoral" The environmental side of Labota returned to nature - many robots covered with algae under the giant tree. This, in my opinion, is the highlight of the film - the views of the surface of Labota, unlike the underground mechanical. <br /> <br /> Although this is a split in this movie - to show that even technology can not overcome nature - another irony robot sponsors the zoo and animals. The end of the Silent Running movie is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly stylish, and I do not say "spot" - very beautiful and organic and a huge amount of detail in buildings, air platforms, design and appearance of almost everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is the true teacher of this type of Japnanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.
