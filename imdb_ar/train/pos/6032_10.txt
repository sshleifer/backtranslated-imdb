Anthony really showed some "fans" when making this film. He went to America working under a contract from one of the most prestigious studios (MGM) and made the most devastating image of the American society I have ever seen. After seeing Los Angeles directly, this is the most accurate image of the busy, hectic and impersonal city. If Anthony had met Bill Hicks only ... <br /> <br /> The subsequent burial by the studio is understandable, after such a huge investment and a dismal return. It is sad that people have not been able to see this film anymore as I think Anthony has proved to be right. Here he predicts the end of the Hippie movement / civil rights in American politics. Everyone is more interested in what is going on in their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space in the hospitable desert (but beautiful) and beyond. How I would like to see interest in this remake and a fancy DVD. <br /> <br /> Ask people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique film attached to a turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet, and we have forgotten that. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
