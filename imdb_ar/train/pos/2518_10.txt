This, through all categories, is the best movie I have ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their movies have always sucked - this is art! The Moon Child story begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who hates what has become and lives in denial. His desire for ultimate death leads him to Maleba, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here, he meets Basho, an orphan living in the street. <br /> <br /> Here, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the film. She has everything to laugh, cry, get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never did a movie touch me like this movie does. The actors are amazing - I have never heard anyone speak many languages ​​without seeming strange. From the great praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> A final comment on this wonderful film is that it was succeeded by Gackt (former singer Malisse Meiser) and Hyde (singer L'Arc ~ en ~ ciel). Excellent roles like Sho and Kei. I am amazed at how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting based on the age at which he acts. <br /> <br /> This is a must. If you do not see any movies at all, watch Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. All in their native language, of course!
