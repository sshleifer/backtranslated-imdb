"Save Grace" looks like a small film that does not offend your grandmother, and appears to be carved from the same cloth that has been shown in half of another British comedy over the last two years ... The underdog faces adversity and finds the strength to challenge him and learns something about himself / Here's the process. <br /> <br /> The widow, and thus broke, Grace is the main gardener, and was recruited to help her friend / employee Matthew plant his plant. He was doing everything wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize that they are the ideal person to harvest the pot, which they can benefit from. He enjoys smoking and needs to raise money to pay for her. <br /> <br /> Highlighting Grace travels to London to deal with some of her goods, wearing something like the white suit worn by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, and then stands out as a painful thumb. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always viewable, and you can not say that about so many people..well, I can not, anyway. Ferguson is very good, and the Czech Carrio, who I liked in the film "La Femme Nikita", is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Do not move deeply or insightfully, but very entertaining, and in 90 minutes fast, it sounds like walking with friends. 10/08.
