I am amazed at how this film is portrayed (most other films are average 5 stars and less when there are poor movies ranging from 7 to 10 stars on IMDb.) The fanboy mentality hits again. , And years later, I sat down to watch this movie and found myself enjoying it, so I laugh a lot ... I do not see how most of the films in Fukuoka are smarter than anything that Michael Bay has reached, and anyway ... <br /> <br /> Alvin Sanders (Jimmy Fox) is a former conviction used by Undersecretary of Treasury Edgar (David Morse) as a pawn to catch a murderer named Bristol Hutchinson), every two thousand movements are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident.Rest Bristol after the gold bricks taken in the robbery went away. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fox is as funny and fun as Alvin Sanders. More intelligent than he allows.Dog Hutchinson is as good as Bristol.Not be too often in his behavior John Malkovitchesque.I've been better here than in the Lonnie Ben Jim in Punisher: War Zone.David Morse is good Treasury Treasurer. Even Mike Ebs is funny like the brother of Stevie Alvin. He and Jimmy both had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only drawback in the film is some of the attempts made in an exciting film. The scenario in the race track is better than that, but I could not look away. The manager went all out so he gets points for that. In addition, the sight of the bomb with the treasurer was tied to a chair while the bomber was on the door very elegant. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Pitt" was not a bad film from a long shot. It's never boring, it's always funny and I did not check my watch every minute. You must count on something. Bait is one of the most unreleased films in 2000. <br /> <br /> Note: The reviewer claimed that this movie is too violent .... Since when do you live under a rock? I'm sure you've seen Die Hard and EVERY for Quentin Tarantino. But those films are not violent properly? weird.
