This is a great movie. From reading other reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who threw a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction. In the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene seemed vulgar and interchangeable. One never assumes that this film was made on a limited budget. Cinematography is fantastic and there are a number of big-name actors. The script is very cool, I can see why they all wanted to be. If you see the long and long list of credits in the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii is ready for this film and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is very beautiful and adjusts the mood throughout the film. My only complaint is that I did not want to finish the film.
