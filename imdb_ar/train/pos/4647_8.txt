It takes a very special kind of people to produce a very miserable film, naive, disgusting, disgusting, but it also makes it great and compelling for personal film editing. Crispin Glover, with all his instincts and interests abroad, has done something truly unique. In a world that has become a blatant party, it seems that this film avoids the standard lines of creativity and art and surprises everyone effectively. <br /> <br /> Directly, off the film, the film takes a fairly faraway model (if there is already a model at all) and is initially crafted in parchment by Shirley in front of a swastika and a naked woman's man with cerebral palsy. These are rather horrifying things, but if you have the opportunity for question-and-answer sessions after presentations, they obviously open a bag of worms that leave you wondering if this art or denominator is inferior. In either case, you feel the thrill that this film will eventually make. This will never be accepted, not even by the supposed world authors who speak of boredom about the humanitarian situation. You may not like it, but it is definitely worth watching.
