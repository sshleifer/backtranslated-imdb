From the real anomalies in French cinema, that this desperate act is unparalleled in contemporary production. One must consider the side of "le feu follet" from Louis Lewis (1963) (Fire Inside) to find something not quite different from the effort of Harel. After losing the hero, the computer scientist, who ridiculed all his illusions, no longer has reason to live. Absolutely nothing. Far from the human race, he seems to be living his life as a kind of insect scientists, studying his colleagues. One of them draws his attention: Tisserand-Jos√© Garcia plays the most humiliating part of the decade. Tisserand will become a kind of prey: all his pessimism will be based on this poor man. The club reaches its climax with an exotic relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life will not always be achieved unless it is .... well, the film takes a more traditional turn to speak (perhaps the expression of Clausot perhaps) but for a short time. <br /> <br /> The form is strange to the comment. There is a wo voices-over, one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero" and the other to the hero mentioned above. The story now takes place in Paris, now in Rouen, the town of Guy de Maupassant. In a scene with the hero says that the writer's madness was only an expression of his disgust for the man, drawing a parallel between his despair and one of Mobassan. <br /> <br /> This frustrating movie is only suitable for an early audience. For very short excerpts of films that have earned an X rating, but after viewing them, you may feel comfortable in the dumps.
