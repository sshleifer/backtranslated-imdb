I was in a bad mental state when I first saw this movie. For some reason, you click on all levels, family tensions, loneliness, and someone's desire to share your life. It was not painful to be the person you share in your beautiful girl life like Claire (Cindy Preston). I've also purchased a sound track for this movie (very hard to get). I loved it and hope to come out one day on DV
