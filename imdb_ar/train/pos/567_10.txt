Both Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann collaborated to do some of the best Westerners of all, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> However, the real star of the film is the brilliant Canadian Rockies, which acts as a backdrop to the story. Some of the best cinematic works ever made were in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> In each of the five Westerns Stuart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were ideally represented. There is no exception here, to the parts that may contain only a few lines, the characters are firmly etched in those lines. <br /> <br /> Stuart is the only person in this film who is considered to be his only real friend, Walter Brennan. The death of Brennan at the hands of the wicked is what makes him want to finally free the golden settlement of the wicked and redeem himself in this process. <br /> <br /> John McIntyre is the main villain of the piece and he was a lesser actor with a wide range. Old characters can play delicious, power characters and in this case the villain is very bad and cunning. <br /> <br /> One of the best Westerners ever.
