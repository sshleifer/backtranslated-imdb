When I was a kid, I loved the computer animation, although it was very limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. This film, while I sat in awe and watched the amazing images and hypnotic music, formed the desire to create animated objects in the computer. This package is a complete package, between music and video, which really includes one punch. If you know which child wants to participate in the animation of the computer, this is something that must be done. <br /> <br /> Almost 20 years later, I still consider this movie one of my favorite 3 films. I think authenticity is still unprecedented in most McMovies that spit Hollywood today. I would like to know if I can recreate it on my own; if tradition is the most flattering form, this film deserves "tons of tradition" =)
