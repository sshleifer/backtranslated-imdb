This is a family movie, which is for some people automatic shutdown. It seems that a lot of people do not want to watch movies that are not loaded with their arms and legs failing, unjustified violence and enough curses to fill a New York phone book. This film is not of these. It's a cliche, it's a formula, but it's also fun. You are not asked to think and you are not asked to accept the film as a reality. He simply does what a good film has to do, which is to willingly suspend kufr for two hours and enjoy the adventure. Cast good, while not excellent. One commentator pointed out that John Williams' sound was, as usual, excellent. The fact that much of the film was filmed at Huntsville in the real space camp made him more believable. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the original version of the film was delayed for a few months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played a major role in its original opening, but eventually helped to focus the dreams of many young people back to space and possibilities Inherent in it. Sit with your children and get ready to enjoy.
