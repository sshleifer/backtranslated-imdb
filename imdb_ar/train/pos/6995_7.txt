Rather a bad piece of Bella Lugosi's work as a crazy scientist (with yes, an assistant like Rainfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the wife of the world.) Lugosi gives his wife's injection of death brides (why do they? The bride gets to be in her place for a scoop and decides to walk around to get a story, she gets all kinds of clues about orchids The sky knows where the police were, and soon she is out at night, when she meets M N is a strange-looking doctor who may or may not be ... It all accumulates in a completely elusive plan for a fake wedding to catch the crazy world, but the world seems to have an x-ray vision, because it frustrates its plans, no, what will happen? Lugosi is great here, as its hangers are all very strange, the story is very bad in some places, making it more interesting.
