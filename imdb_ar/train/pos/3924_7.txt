The 1939 film by John Ford and writer Lamar Trotty tells a fictional story of the young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his trials (literally) and his ordeal. It is a passionate film, well made but barely breathtaking. Henry Fonda Lincoln's choice seems to have been wrong, because while the actor had the wrong qualities for the part, even with several inches of make-up and a fake nose, he was very handsome to Honest Abe, who was famous at home. It's a good attempt by Fonda, who has nothing if not honest, but its misuse leads to the entire film being cast. The excellent support team, however, includes Eric Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is very proud of his dealings with Lincoln, who has been shown to be shy of a saint, and in the final film the film tops the top.
