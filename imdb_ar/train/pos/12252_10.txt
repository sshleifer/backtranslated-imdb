I really enjoyed this modification to "Emma". I've seen him so much and I always look forward to seeing him again. Although it lasts only 107 minutes, most plots and sub-novels have been developed satisfactorily. All figures are well illustrated. Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel without adding any silly jokes, as in "Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility". <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the ideal strength of the actors. The setting and costumes were lovely. I find this version on par with 1995 series "Pride and Prejudice" but then the producer and scriptwriter himself. Kate Beckinsell did a really good job portraying "Emma", and Jane Austen said she would make a heroina no one, but she would love her. She is arrogant but she has enough young people and little experience to be loved. Mark Strong was also good at filming Mr. Knightley, not an easy part, I think, although he did not enjoy Mr. Darcy's attraction from Colin Firth in pride and prejudice. Even the finale of the novel does not offer an appropriate ending except when it appears that Emma is almost as cool and unpleasant with Frank Churchill as she was perfectly reconciled with the novel, so she told him that she would have enjoyed the duality, if she had been in his position. A strange deviation from the sincerity shown in the film. I find fashion more beautiful and detailed than other quotations from Jane Austen's novels.
