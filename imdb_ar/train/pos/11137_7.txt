The Midnight Cowboy sparked a sensation when it was released in 1969, drawing the X rating. According to today's standards, it will be difficult to squeeze the rating of R. John Voight, who was the best, efficient in his role as Joe Buck, who is out of town wanting to make it big With ladies in New York City. He meets an unwanted street robber named Ratsu Rizo, who tries to authenticate Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually formulated a pathetic link. As Ratsu, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman was often wonderful, but he was no more than before in this picture. He is in character so that everything around him dwindles in comparison. The loss of the Oscar for John Wayne is one of the most absurd decisions ever taken by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Schlesinger has a brilliant role in his production, but this film has a severe weakness in the body leaving a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. Worth watching for Hoffman's performance alone.
