Finally, a thriller misses car chases, explosions and other attractive influences. The film combines a simple conspiracy (assassination of the French president) with an excellent background. It takes a look at the man's behavior with the authorities and explains why we will obey almost every order (even murder) that will be presented to us. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it shows us how the intelligence services can deal with the course of history and how it can hardly be controlled. The best thing about this film is that there is no classic "Hollywood end" that can be easily predicted.
