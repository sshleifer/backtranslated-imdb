By Hook or By Crook is a highly innovative film by two highly talented and intelligent filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They are able to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style, and were beautifully photographed by Anne T. Rosetti, her brilliant writing - really poetic. <br /> <br /> The main characters are the real heroes and serve as a rare type of model / inspiration for the butcher's ramparts and horses everywhere. This film has a lot of energy, a lot of moving emotion and the heart of San Francisco so dirty. I can not recommend it enough! <br /> <br /> Best Friend Boych movie of all time!
