(There are no spoilers, only the details of a plot of land) I can not understand such hatred for this episode. Want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Underground - Now there is a bag of crap. Tom Welling offers good performance (I do not say that much), and Michael Rosenbaum is wonderful, but most of the time. The alternative universe scenario seems frighteningly realistic. Martian Manhunter, who previously appeared in the movie "Static", tells Clark that the doctor who heads a mad asylum where they are being held is actually a ghost from the stealth zone. If Clark wants to return to his place of the universe, he must be killed. Overall a large loop, with good acting and decent speed.
