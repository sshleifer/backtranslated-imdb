I liked this movie very much. I hired this and I expect something not so bad for an evening. It has been a very satisfying experience. Some of the scenes were hilarious and I managed to be as well in a film that was not meant to be just a stupid, senseless comedy but with some sense and moral values. He manages both cases. All threads are good but especially the guy who wrote the stars and produced the film. I have never seen any of these actors before, but they were loved and made me care what happens to them in the end and he says a lot. The script is intelligent and includes a refreshing feel. . I think you will not be disappointed to see this.
