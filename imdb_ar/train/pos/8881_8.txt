One must first take into account the period in which this film was produced in 1995. The rappers had it, and that added to his inclination. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially awkward teenager trying to find him. The road I could not, so met and had a friendship with the Nazis. They took him. The Nazi is not all that embarrassing, but like most gangs, they fill a missing space, be it economic, social or emotional, whatever. Michael Rabab played an ideal role. <br /> <br /> Ebs was a fast track star, with dubious work ethics and a slap on his shoulder. He was trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and he had his girlfriend and his teacher to correct it. <br /> <br /> Christine was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to adapt to her, until she was raped. She then found her own experience with her sexuality and political involvement. <br /> <br /> This film deals with racism and, like most things dealing with racism, people's views are taken into account. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of comments about the lack of "evil" black characters, but there were evil white characters (Nazism). So what? Remy was not portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and continued to fail until he accepted some heads. He was afraid, it was sad to see him convey how he did. So he said before he killed himself, I did not mean it, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rimes were angry black men, Ice Cube was somewhat educated, Busta Rhymes was portrayed as a stupid thief. They both showed no regard for their colleagues in the room, and they did not seem to like white people very much. They were as angry as the Nazis but not at the level of the Nazis in terms of public bad. Sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say it appears white = black = good = black. It is not true that the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, and this is true to a certain extent in real life. Christine was a good girl, and her boyfriend (colleague Omar Ebs in the room) was a good man, and even Remy was a good man, he was misleading. <br /> <br /> Age Ebs, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed, angry and indifferent. Despite their continued harassment by the police apparently to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to adjust to him seems to justify his anger as well. <br /> <br /> Good movie, better. Like all films dealing with racism, it is good that the debate continues. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cobb and Basta had defeated these Nazis.
