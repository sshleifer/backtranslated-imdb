I think they were telling the truth all the time .. I can not trust anything in the wild ... The family has gone through hell. These poor young boys understand what is going on around them. But there is still a need to deal with rumors. As well as dealing with the loss of their little sister. I can not believe that this case lasted for a long time. It seems that the jury could not see the truth, even if it angered the situation. I feel about this family, and if I can tell them about it, I hate what happened. For them, I would have no idea what they went through, and I can not even imagine it. After watching this movie, I was in tears, I had to check my little daughter in bed ... I think everyone should watch this.
