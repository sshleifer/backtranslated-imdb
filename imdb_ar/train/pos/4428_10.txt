I have to disagree completely with the other comment about this film. The visual effects complement the supernatural features of the film and do not detract from the plot. I also liked how it was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword was not threaded and most of the time you can see the movement up close. <br /> <br /> I think Western viewers will be puzzled by viewers, one including a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other about villagers who say it is the end of the world. These scenes are derived from certain interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene is strange in the Japanese calendar ... People at that time really believed that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has a work, Attract any scenes. I firmly believe that with some skillful editing, it can be sold in the United States. My only complaint is in another fight scene (I can not give up anything - sorry).
