It's a curious short film by David Lynch, and saying that the name of David Lynch may be enough for a large number of people. This is your typical short Lynch. Blonde and a brunette in a dark room. The blonde was crying, the brunette talking threateningly to the blonde, and that was it. <br /> <br /> With a lot of silent moments, but with the painful music of Angelo Badalamenti a strange form of suspense. This film looks like "Mulholland D." , A film I loved, so I liked this movie too. This is likely to be special for Lynch lovers but there is a chance to like you.
