I work in a library and I expect to like this film when it was introduced five years ago. Well, I loved Parker Posey a lot (she was a great actress) and Townsend was very nice as a friend (he could not act but when he looked like who cares?) But the film was bad. It was not funny or cute or much of anything. Bossi kept the film standing on his feet. But she learned Dewey decimal system overnight and then racked up a lot of books on the rhythm of music ?? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with the way I looked at her when she became a full librarian at the end - hair in a cake, glasses, no sense of humor - can we leave this stereotype please? Worth seeing for Busy and Townsend but that's about it. The TV series was much better.
