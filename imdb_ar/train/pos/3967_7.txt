This is not among the best Jimmy Stewart movies - I'm quick to admit it. However, while some view his film as purely propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that? Yes, of course, like the FBI television program, this is a clear case because the office is doing some public relations work in an effort to mobilize support. But, as entertainment goes, it does a good job. In addition, the film focuses surprisingly enough on the time it was produced, on crime rather than on spyware and "Commies". Instead, it's a fictional process for one of the first clients and the job he has chosen. Now that the agent is playing with Jimmy Stewart, the acting and writing were certainly good - the film was on a real budget and the studio was not about to miss the star with a third click. Overall, it's worth watching but not particularly great.
