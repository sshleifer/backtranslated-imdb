To say that Anton Newcomb of the Brian Johnston massacre can use some treatments is mild. In the pits! Who won the Grand Jury Award at Sundance, is seen with his self-sabotaging band for seven years, while his former friends and contemporaries, The Dandy Warhols, bring to great grandeur (mobile advertising, anyway). <br /> <br /> What you dig up! Above its contemporaries, the comical tragedy close to the Torah in which it takes place: a sad, honest thesis on art versus trade and compromise. Despite all his "look at me, I'm a bloody genius", it has been discovered that Newcombe is indeed a unique talent, albeit a very troubled, musician - much more talented than his rival, Dandy Courtney Taylor who tells the picture. If Newcombe is Dennis Hooper, Peter Thailand Peter Thailand. <br /> <br /> It seems that Taylor knows this more sadly, as evidenced by his tired voice, which hates itself: knows that his team won the battle - but what happened. cost? In fact, they sold, made Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth pretty and clean, and perhaps cleaned their hair twice before bedtime - and thus won standard contracts and a big tourist bus. And abandon all credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in a filthy state, constantly exposed to collapse, and overcomes his fellow band members on stage, wiggling monitors in his head - and the last time in Dig! Being transferred by the police, having lost the right to see his child. <br /> <br /> Women have directed two of the best films about sub-rock culture: Penelope Chabris entitled "The Deviation of Western Civilization" and this one? The moment of classic moment of its release.
