I recently bought the game Dreamcast lightly and went to town to find some games to use. I bought Soul Calibur (Classic) and then entered Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 and I played Res Resil 3 on many occasions and I was impressed with them all, especially that No.1 which has to go back in history with its classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them come anywhere near the Dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gauri playing. If it's only for the purchase of Dreamcast for this game, it's worth every moment of your time and effort, I've never enjoyed a computer game the way it drew me. <br /> <br /> In any event, the story is derived from the second story in which Claire Redfield looks for her brother (Chris - from the first story), who is supposedly missing under the company's dreadful parachute conspiracy. Little is known about this company except for the fact that you are though you have destroyed it 3 times in previous stories. <br /> <br /> So, with the help of Clare, with the help of Super Brat Steve, you must unlock the true truth of your brother's site. You can control the second CD in Chris, if you can reach that limit without running out of space in fear. <br /> <br /> The control is very simple and the movement of characters is very realistic, when you notice a dangerous character, that he / she is facing the direction from which you come. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> In general, this game was given 10/10 because it is simply a game of the year and the game of contract and the best game in the world. Please buy this game as soon as possible.
