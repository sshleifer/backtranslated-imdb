Now, I know that French prisoners are unlikely to have read Lovecraft (which proves my point of view that his writing should be taught at school, perhaps as a separate subject), but how they thought something that looked like a "robot jugen futon" could potentially lead to any Good? <br /> <br /> The film takes place in a prison where four of his highly unlikely colleagues find themselves in a magical book that might come out if they read it well. As the prisons passed, the cell was completely unrealistic, making it difficult to get into the atmosphere. They also move fairly slowly, which may carry people. But otherwise, this is a first-rate horror, as "Hell with the Sartre" is mixed with a kind of Lovecraft / Barker story, and they succeed to some extent. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Take the time to see these. This means not doing so when you are about to go to work or sleep or while doing something else. This is the movie that works best if you are immersed in it. Lessons to learn: Yogurt is bad, and almost as bad as French women.
