Kubrick proved his talent once more, now in a teaser film based on Stephen King's book titled The Same Way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married with one child and has a history of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado stops service during the winter due to its ruthless decor, and there is a paid job for the caretaker during those five months; Torrance, who looked forward to becoming a writer, found it ideal. But the manager advised Torrance to be alone in the place during the winter, which is potentially dangerous, and told him that some charge d'affaires in the past was insane and killed his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friends who shines the future (climbing), knew that the place was not good and did not want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started to go well but within a month, Jack began acting strangely, furious and depressed. At this point, we know that something will happen, but do not know when and how. Frightening things happen like the appearance of twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt satisfied with them, as if they were his family; including the famous psychologist, Dilbert Grady. Grady Torrance was told that his family should be killed because they were "infiltrators" at the hotel. In line with this request, Jack went for the goal and many of the most scary things I've seen happen here. The end is spectacular and viewers will remain interested and shocked until the last minute.
