Tracking a sitcom is so easy that the presence of her character works simultaneously both inside and outside the context, the rest of the addicted team is a kind of experience that can actually be used by the sitcom. Supporting characters support the presentation in the reality of the sitcom which provides a contextual point of reference for the wrong Sarah character which, beyond general sensitivity, has no specific repetitive characteristics to predict behaviors, making it less personal than a canvas reprinted every episode if not the scene. Sarah manages to see everything from an external perspective of parody to social aspects of intelligence that are sufficiently intelligent to be unnoticed. Each time you speak it like a 5-second sitcom. They exaggerate a lot, indicating the myriad things that a smile or a change in voice may indicate, but never adhere to one idea long enough to feel comfortable and make up expectations that you will be satisfied. This television program may be the most creative, original and experimental ever.
