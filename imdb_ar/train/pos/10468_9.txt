Monstervision had a show that originated with him. From late night hosting with Ben and Tyler to one, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me on Friday night in my high school years and gave some of the best driving memories ever out of the car. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the best late night TV ever. If you are not awake, you may be missing. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live on it, but I want them to go back to where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! The question is ... Does anyone else sit throughout every 4 hours of the "Squadron"? Q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
