This film is a little sunshine in the dark season. It celebrates better quality and easily described old friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays a character like Freeman himself - a successful actor paying 70 years. He traveled to a rather dark little grocery store to look for a part he might play as a manager for such a place. The staff and customers, especially the beautiful young woman, quickly cheated if they were eccentric (Paz Vega) who headed the exit path "10 Items or Less". <br /> <br /> 10 Items or Less We do not have a big statement to make and do not pretend to do. When Freeman and Vega became friends, and since the older man presented his lawyer, in return for a trip to their home - the owner of the film company he was supposed to pick up and Freeman did not forget his own phone number - he could not ask for help. I had a little blues on a gray Sunday in New York City, and this curse cured what bothered me.
