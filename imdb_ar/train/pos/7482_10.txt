"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderful thoughtful film. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched this movie late one night, excited about what would have come. I was not disappointed. By the end of the film, I was awake. I could not get rid of it. The whole idea of ​​it just blew me away. The end was more surprising than Shyamalan could have done. The land line was also something that kept me enjoying. Cast, wonderful. It was a great film. The type of movie you can watch over and over and always find something new. I've seen him four or five times and always find something new. It's a film to keep you interested forever.
