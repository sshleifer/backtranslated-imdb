This is one of the most fascinating episodes in the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogue and amusing characters to break the tension in some frightening moments. There is the usual blond dancer "dancer" (what's up with Sirling's fondness for this type of character, so they continue to appear in different episodes?) And various other characters, but the "old man" of Jack Ilam is the one who steals the show completely. I consider this funny and funny version of "The Monsters Is Due on Maple Street" - or perhaps a 20-minute spoof from Twilight's "The Thing". In another observation: I thought the young fan of the ring might have been someone who eventually followed other things - it seemed familiar - but it seems that Ron Kipling disappeared after only two of the TV credits in his name.
