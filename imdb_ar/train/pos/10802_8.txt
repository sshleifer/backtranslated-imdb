I'm at the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think this was meant to be a direct complement to The Jerk. I mean it is not "The Jerk 2" ... It's "The Jerk, Too", which makes me think that although many of the characters' names are similar, they are about a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: there is no approximate relationship to the previous film, unlike the characters' names; a completely different story. Cast different. And the fact that it is a partial musical part. <br /> <br /> I say Give this movie some credit. She has a lot of laughter in it .. Mark Blankfield in prime.
