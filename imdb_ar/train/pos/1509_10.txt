The British horror film was in a final decline with the beginning of the seventies, but out of darkness, three films were among the best produced by our island. Wickerman, the blood on the Devil's claw and the house whose future blood has fallen pink looks, although many people know by this point that there will be no one. THTDB has a type of actor who can easily form a wish list, if it is not already assembled, in the darker areas of 2008 you may find yourself expecting to wake up. Waxworks are the most stories that are overlooked by four stories, which are of course my favorite, Cushing's life and art are tied firmly so that you can not figure out where the performance ends and the pain begins. One can only guess how this role affected a gentle and sensitive man. Death and early. Ripped Peter.
