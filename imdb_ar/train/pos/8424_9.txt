That My Bush is a live action project by the creators at South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, not because of bad reviews (I've already got good ratings), but because it was too expensive. Is a funny parody of a regular television series on the Internet. It is also political satire. Now, this is not anywhere near South Park, but it is a very funny parody of the sitcom as well as a very good political satire. The man who plays in this tree is very much like him! If you can find the offer, check it. There is a lot of laughter that you have to get! <br /> <br /> 9/10
