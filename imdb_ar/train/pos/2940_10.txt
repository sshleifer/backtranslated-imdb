The first time I came to delirium, I heard only that. I have listened to the whole comedy performance and have not laughed much in my life. Eddie's ability to draw hilarious images in our minds and make a great tradition is captivating. When I finally saw him do this, I had to get him. The performance of Eddie Murphy on Delerious shows his genius! With the new millennium, his actions in 1983 became as funny today as they were at that time. My parents love her as teenagers and I love her too (at 18). Since that moment, I had to watch other Murphy films such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian such as Eddie.
