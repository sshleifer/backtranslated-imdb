The "return of the Jedi" is often remembered for its mistake and not what it did properly, which is a disgrace, because the recent installment of the Star Wars epic is a shining example of epic stories. He is able to conclude all the lines of the story of the previous films in one big conclusion, and does so in a very convincing way. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and lovable bears that have served extensively to expand Star Wars demographics - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But it can be said that the last hour is the best piece in the full story, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most famous villain in the film's history. <br /> <br /> Gedi's return has done many things right that people tend to overlook: he made an astounding conclusion to the story of Darth Vader (which turned out to be somewhat unreasonable in the "Empire Strikes Back" to a very convincing here ), An exciting opening at the Jabba Palace, an ingenious display of Ian MacDarmid. Emperor Locke has finally entered his own solution, the accuracy of Solo and Liya's romance, and the very powerful last moments on the Indore moon. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a slight inconvenience. But they are a nuisance to a generation of filmgoers who have had time to spend a lot of time in every scene. A charming and moving cinematic piece continues to serve as a wonderful last chapter. It's not a good movie - it's great!
