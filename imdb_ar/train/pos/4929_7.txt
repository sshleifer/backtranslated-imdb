I can not really condemn the film because it works. There are enough noir elements for the film to be considered a noir movie, but I think it's only in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing evil in this piece, and here noir elements fail. Sure, the disease can be considered evil, but I have trouble seeing it. The film alludes to a darker side: Blackie may be a human trafficker, the New Orleans police are only willing to catch a reporter, the plague ghost hangs on all the people in the film ... but these are just really hints. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to question Reed's motives, as with Marlowe or Spade, and there is no attempt to bring a human side to the Blackie, making him more disdainful if human trafficking has actually taken place. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is why the film eventually failed. <br /> <br /> The story is respectable, the acting is good, the writing and guidance are well done ... but there is nothing to make this movie you should go back again and again. Worth seeing once, maybe twice if you do not remember them for years, then put them away.
