After reading reviews of this film, I began to understand him by seeing a great deal of doubt in my opinion that it would be really good. However, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Most of the reviews I have read have said that the complex plot has made it extremely difficult to follow. While some parts leave you confused, the ends are tied with so many loose ends that you feel like kicking them because you missed a lot. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", meaning it's not funny (in fact, it's rather dark), smarter in the way parts of the viewer see different views Scenes in the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the elevator with an argument with himself). The way the two films you've just mentioned is that it's full of memorable characters, especially Statham, who performs brilliantly as a lead, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie in Speedo, but gives a great performance. If you have time, and you have time to then think about the movie, and even watch it again, you really begin to see all the icons and hints that were placed during the movie. I think it's great, and that Jay Ritchie is a manager in his game.
