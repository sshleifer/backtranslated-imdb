This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish Broadcasting Company decided to broadcast again before the summer when I just finished my first semester in medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the members were explained. Sure, some things are simplified but most of them were correct (although they were made 22 years ago!) And are quite understandable. I would like to suggest to every nearby medical student to see it. It's a very good way to learn some basic medical words, for example. I'm now in seventh grade and I think I'll see the series again once I've bought a DVD box :-)
