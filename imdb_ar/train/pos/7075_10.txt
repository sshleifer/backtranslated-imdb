The paradoxes of time are the devil's ambush of the labor-deficient minds. It's fun to think of "What if?" Kind of way. This time and again filmmakers and authors have treated film and television collections, including Star Trek: First Contact, Back to the Future, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Groundhog Day and Stargate SG1 , "Window of opportunity". Heinlein wrote "All You Zombies" for decades, but will still revolve around people who read that short story for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, "12 Monkeys", it is difficult to determine what problems of continuity versus plot elements may be aimed at rethinking our concept of film. Frequent scenes will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some will see the film for the first time, Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a schizophrenic. Most of Cole will see him as a man annoyed by what Adams describes as "the continuing experience of experience" he has traveled through time. <br /> <br /> Unlike other travel stories over time, "monkeys" are not clear as to whether the history of the future can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Riley (Madeleine Stowe), that time can not be changed, but scientists intercepted a telephone call from the airport after his return to 1996, in his own personal plan. <br /> <br /> Even this can be interpreted as an event that must occur in a single temporal world, in order to ensure that the timeline does not change ... Cole must die before the eyes smaller than the soul to achieve destiny. If this is the case, time is like fluid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces it works on. It's a mind boggling to think about this kind of thing too much. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that direct the actions of those who have the ability to return people in time, as seen on the plane at the end of the film, this means that the future can be changed by manipulating past events. .. Or does it? The film may have led to many drunken fights in pubs frequented by physicists and athletes
