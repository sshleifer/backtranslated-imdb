Laurence Olivier, Merle Uberon, Ralph Richardson and Benny Barnes, starred in The Divorce of Lady X, a 1938-based comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Ivard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the fog in London is too heavy for guests in the fashion ball to return home. The next day, his friend, Lord Mir (Richardson), announced that his wife (Barnes) had spent the night with another man in the same hotel and wanted to divorce them. The woman's belief that she is Oberon, Oliver Panic. Oberon, a bachelor and granddaughter of the judge, pretends to be the lady in question, Ms. Meyer, when Leslie Steele really is. <br /> <br /> We've seen this conspiracy or different forms dozens of times. With this cast, it's exhilarating. I mean, Richardson and Oliver? Oliver and Oberon, this wonderful team in the Wizring Heights? Very special. Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a wonderful job with comedy because he depicts a nervous lawyer. Oberon gives her the right touch. She looks very small here, her face full, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and her very different hairstyle. She wears some beautiful clothes on the streets, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in one dress she tries to do, with her hair this, she is ready to play Snow White. Penny Barnes is as cheerful as the real lady Mir. <br /> <br /> Color in this mess, and as others have mentioned, can really be used as a restoration. Definitely worth seeing.
