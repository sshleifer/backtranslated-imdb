I found that this was a very light touch in the film The Culture Struggle in 1950. John Wayne would hardly be the first choice as a cultural supplement, being a diplomat with his good intentions like the bull in Harrods. But this time he left him to play a role that was more negative than his usual character, and he accomplished his task in an elegant manner. The Duke was a man who could really act well. His facial expressions and body language may be very precise. <br /> <br /> Despite his great presence as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to control this film. Many of his good intentions came from Cropper. He had authority over no one, and the intermittent narrative was presented by the Honorary Army who was barbaric. <br /> <br /> The story of US attempts to gain support with isolationist Japan has been the story of a political plot rather than a political conspiracy, sunken battles or hell versus leather. I can not comment on the accuracy of her research, but the strangeness of Eastern culture towards Western sentiments is well illustrated. There was a great deal of celebration, which was very carefully designed and necessitated what this observer looked like, fashion and original fashion. The set of pieces was complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought has been applied to it. <br /> <br /> The broken romance between Win and Gisha added a little extra element, and the film was stopped as a political effort or flag-waving. The script was good without being too talkative. There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue, but long periods of translation did not interfere with the narrative. It was good to see a lot of real orientalists on the group. Whether they were Japanese or not, I could not say. But anyway they looked at the part. At least the role was not played by the intertwined Caucasians, in contrast to other efforts such as the "Blood Corridor" (yes, I know they are Chinese) "Down the Sixth Happiness" or even "King and I". <br /> <br /> Honestly, I enjoyed this more than any of those other films. The script was better for a start. I never liked the songs in "The King And I" and was not impressed by the ultimatum of the communitarian communism, the "blood alley". I admit I have never seen this work before and I found it well compared to many of the most popular The Duke tours. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
