Danielle Dae Lewis gave us in my left foot one of the best performances ever made by a representative. He's as smart as Christie Brown, a man with cerebral palsy, who later learned to write and paint his left foot. Oscar deservedly deserved him and Brenda Frecker who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Connor is wonderful because the younger Christie Brown and Ray McNally are as wonderful as the father. Worth watching for outstanding performance.
