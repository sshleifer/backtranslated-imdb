I must agree with anyone else who has posted it. <br /> <br /> I've seen it for a long time, but I'll tell you that whenever I hear certain music from this anime, I'll remind you of the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I felt when I watched it make me cry (such a feeling of happiness and sadness). However, I find that the story of love in it felt a rush and did not explain things correctly but did not destroy any part of the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I was in this comedy so much that after the end, I had to do some research (and watch the end several times) and found all my answers and lots more. I loved the way they created the historical legends to conform to this anime, it was amazing and made me just want to search much more. (I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> I think it should have been a longer chain but if this is all it had to work with then pull it out well. I would recommend this to anyone who loves an emotional anime with an excellent story, well-built characters (some are mysterious) and a bit of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Also, although it was based on Game H does not contain any of these things and actually better in this way. (I have no problem with mature anime, and in most cases the best of it)
