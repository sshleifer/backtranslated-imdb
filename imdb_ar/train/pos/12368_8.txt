I got the TV for a white noise companion and I heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment" so I ran into the TV room I expected a flick in the seventies of the last century and got more. Luckily, I was able to rewind to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the record button to view it completely. (Cinemax uncut and HD no less!) Aside from some holes in the story and dialogue / events that are not possible intermittently, this is an exciting thriller worth your time to watch. Beautiful, creepy and progressive Sometimes: The character of Beverly Dangello masturbates in front of Allison Parker, brilliantly played by Christina Raines, Parker stabs, very superbly, her father, an outspoken scene management scene (Do not let the kids watch) The movie is full of a total of 70 years of clothing The bad (suits of polyester and scottish vulgar) and decor, bad hair, bloated music degrees, fashionable cinematography. The cast is excellent, take a second home page of this movie to check it out. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walsh, Jerry Auerbach and Jeff Goldblum very small. Silvia Miles - Always Wonderful Creepy! Enjoy!
