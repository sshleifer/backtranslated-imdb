I am quite surprised by some of the comments in this forum and many reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good film here. Yes, it is very elegant, glamorous and above the top, but very entertaining. I'm happy at least with Ebert and Robert's agreement with me :) <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for anyone, but if you like dark humor, excitement and nice dialogue, you should see it. <br /> <br /> I've seen Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and the enemy of State - all good movies, but I like this more. It's like a roller coaster ride, with great audio selections and visual styles. While all films seem to be PG13, it's good to see that someone is not afraid to show nudity, mysterious violence, and a clear dialogue. <br /> <br /> It is not painful that Keira is too hot, and even shows nipples in this, either ...
