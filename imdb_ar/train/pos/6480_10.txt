This was by far the best documentary about the war. From the beginning of the first episode, when Sir Lawrence Olivier described the horrific events in Orador-sur-Glene as Soldiers' Day. In the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared on Japan, I never missed a second of this classic series and I remember it well although it was shown in 1974. Each aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. This whole series must be a compulsory offer to as many children as possible in the world so that the tragedy of the Second World War does not recur and intolerance, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
