Star Rating: ***** The Works **** Just Missing the Mark *** That Little Bit Among ** Underdeveloped * Engraving <br /> <br /> Mike Oderton (Dudikoff) Makes Peace Road in the West The savage when he saw a group of men mistreat a lady. Being a gentleman, he intervenes naturally and stops this and kills the son of a bad executor. This is just the beginning of a battle in which all weapons will burn until the end, where there will be only one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who has not really succeeded in taking it off with me. Maybe I discovered it too late and after the other film I saw with him last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another Dud ha ha that was added to the list. But I have something for the Westerners, being films that somehow move me to a different time and place and provide a real escapade. Dudikoff chose this with one of his best writings, where his films are moving anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie hits a few low points in the form of a villain amid the Nav, it looks like an empty Brandon Marlon and some Ruby generally acting out some of the actors, along with the mandatory cheap looking sets. But if your life depends for a strange reason on watching Dudikoff, this will be one of your best choices. ***
