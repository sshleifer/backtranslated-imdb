Director Edward Montagny works just over an hour after other, more expensive films fail. Mr. Montagne shows us a detective story written by Philip Rysman Jr, while while not one of the best, it keeps the viewer involved in everything. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a B movie. In fact, the best thing about The The Tattooed Stranger is the opportunity to take a look at how New York looked at those years. Pure Pure Film Photography by William O. Steiner, either kept in this way over the years, or lovingly restored. <br /> <br /> There are great views of New York in the opening series. Later we were moved to Brooklyn to the Dumbo section, and then the film travels to the Bronx and John Hill Road with many of the region's antique shops. <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella have made a great work for the detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as a botanist from the Museum of Natural History. Jack Lourdes, who went to bigger things in his career, is seen in a role he does not speak. <br /> <br /> It was very good to see a city, as it was, because it no longer existed.
