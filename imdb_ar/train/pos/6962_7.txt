My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise to me, I was really expecting a terrible film that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this film had a lot of great laughs and an interesting plot so anyone could get out of it. I know this was a very great film, but Uma and Anna were fantastic, and Steve was a great addition with great actors who seemed to enjoy it a lot and that's what made the film really work. <br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, this is my true real friend's name) is not an ordinary woman looking for a librarian, when Matt asks her, your average man asks her that, more than expected, he asked G -Girl in a date, the super hero of the world! But when he discovers what a jealous and crazy girl that is really and decides that it may be good to spend some time away, but Jenny will not get it since she fell with another girl, Hannah, his life will be a living hell, I mean, let's face it, it was not It is possible to choose the best girl to pick it up. <br /> <br /> The effect was trivial, but you quickly took it seriously, the story and made the story work really successful and I loved Auma in this film, and this was a step from Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you should not take seriously, it's just a nice romantic comedy I think if you can laugh at it, anyone can. <br /> <br /> 7/10
