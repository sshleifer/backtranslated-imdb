This movie is awesome in everything. He deals with the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script does not waive any personality, nor even the unhappy Johnny. It also benefits from immediate direction and design of production, casting and displays. The fact that Cher is perfect in the film is different from "Sher" than ever, it's a wonder to me. I see Moonstruck at least once a year, and I saw her again this Christmas Eve with my 16-year-old twin daughter and loved her too. He has something for everyone with heart and leaves you full of joy in the end.
