This movie is a wonderful movie. It was all about it in my opinion first class representation to guidance. I know that Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s but most of his other films are on video, if not DVD. This is the case, why is not this one? A friend recorded it outside TCM for me but getting it on a DVD would be great. For special features, they can tell a Marines historian talking about the battle, and if Mr. Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they can be interviewed as well. Anyway, this is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it. If displayed in the hope not to be colored. In my opinion, coloring them would just destroy the full impact of the film. The battle scene was as realistic as it was in 1945, the film would have moved. Mr. Garfield did a great job filming Mr. Schmid. Some actors may have been tempted to exaggerate part of Mr. Schmid's disability but I feel he is doing well. I sincerely hope that they will come out on this DVD one day as a tribute to the courage of the Shamite and all the other Marines who sacrificed so much in World War II.
