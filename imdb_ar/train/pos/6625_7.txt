If you've watched the movie "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you will never have to watch this movie. Unfortunately, the Renaissance company had makers of similar revelation trailers. <br /> <br /> The story of the Renaissance revolves around an investigator investigating the abduction of a young woman and a medical researcher. The setting is Paris futuristic, and the science fiction elements feature around. The characteristic thing about the Renaissance, however, is its visual style, not its story. Renaissance is a 3D animation of a computer, such as Final Fantasy, but it is too fancy to black and white with very sharp variations. The result is startling (although the three-dimensional animation problems of humans are still noticeable from time to time: small robotic movements, little wooden faces, etc.) Being a beautiful nouira, the Renaissance has stunned the audience, especially visually. The story and writing, though, are not quite the same level of quality as the visual images. It's not a bad story (presumably, if you have not seen the trailer, it's more exciting than it was for me). But it is a story that is not very original and is on the edge of the cornea. There were a few painstaking lines of dialogue, making writing look like the efforts of the first beginner. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend with Renaissance friends. It is unlike anything I have ever seen, visually, and I think its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. It's also an exciting story, even if it's not perfect.
