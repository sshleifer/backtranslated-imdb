A Bugs Life is a wonderful movie not only for children but also for adults. The story revolves around a colony of ants and their struggle against evil locusts who return every year and steal their food (Mirror of the Seven Shining). There are some wonderful computer animations and the sounds are very large. You will love it !! 8 of 10
