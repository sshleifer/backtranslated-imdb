Perfect cast for a little person drama. Simon is dead but sends from outside. What he saw there is displayed in the form of empty spots, managed to a remarkable degree by the German pioneer Werner Haines. He is accompanied by Simon's death, relieved by the support of the people he saw on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive, but she fails, and decides to follow him after his last death. Very sensitive and touching, deep psychological, but a bit slow and even somewhere boring.
