In Mexico City, the former CIA assassin, currently a perverted alcoholic John Cresy (Denzel Washington), was hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Mark Anthony), on the recommendation of his old friend Riebern (Christopher Walken) View Profile of ابنته الصغيرة بيتا (داكوتا Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the cold behavior of Creasy, making him live and smiling again, and feels her great love. When the girl is kidnapped and tells Crissy that she was killed by criminals, he swears to kill everyone responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece, and will certainly become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never worry and although the running time is 146 minutes, the viewer does not feel the passage of time. The cast consists of excellent actors and performers, and their performances are outstanding, featuring Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Richard Mitchell. Cinema has wonderful moments, and the script has amazing lines. Personally, I liked the fact that the character of Christopher Walsh of Manzanu (Giancarlo Giannini) explained that Krissy's specialty is death, which is his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best, movie of the year in this genre. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingança" ("Flames of the Revenge")
