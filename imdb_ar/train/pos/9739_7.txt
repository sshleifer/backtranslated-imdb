I enjoyed watching this movie, mainly due to Simon Beige, who quickly became the draw box office for comedy films. <br /> <br /> He was appointed to the post of deadlock in London by Chief Information Officer New York Jeff Bridges, as a writer, about a celebrity breaker. <br /> <br /> After paying his dues, he has made him a top-notch celebrity writer ("Room 7"), where he has become a famous minor. The story is very funny, and Gillian Anderson puts an impressive supporting role as an innovative propaganda agent. <br /> <br /> Along the way to success, he finds the true meaning of love, and so on. <br /> <br /> The plot shown aside, the film was very funny, mainly due to Simon Big, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was as good as the love interest. The rest of the support team did their job well. <br /> <br /> This was a good comedy worth seeing in the theaters.
