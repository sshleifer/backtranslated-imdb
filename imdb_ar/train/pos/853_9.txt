"Matador" starring Pierce Brosnan as a burning killer. James Bond went to seed, in very tight clothes, golden chains, and an ugly hair story. We fought the fight, Julianne Noble, in Mexico, trying to regain his nerve. Staying in the same hotel is a lucky businessman lucky Danny Wright (Gregg Kinnear), as he tries to restore his balance. Danny is desperate to close the deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright suddenly became friends. Wright persuades Nobel to reveal some of the methods he demonstrates in bullfighting. Nobel is ultimately targeted by employers and appears in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Sheppard did a question-and-answer job after this great film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also on his luck. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejecting modern scripts, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a personality that no one wanted to play. Then called Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan restores his balance in this film. (There is life after Bond!) Has a wonderful tendency for a comedy that criticizes the self. do not miss. <br /> <br /> Stay closed to read what filmmakers say about bullfights. I look forward to more of Richard Sheppard's projects.
