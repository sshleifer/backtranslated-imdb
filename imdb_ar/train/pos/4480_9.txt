In The Film of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a leading musician. I certainly can not do it better. It's an important film in both Jane Kelly and Frank Sinatra's careers. Catherine Grayson did not do this very badly. <br /> <br /> Louis P. Meyer to lend Gene Kelly to Colombia where Harry Cohen was an inspiration to allow Kelly to design his own numbers, and because of that, Coffer became the classic girl. So if Meyer did not learn a lesson, Joe Pasternak learned the product and allowed the technical control of Kelly. When Anchors Aweigh finished, Fred Astaire finally had a dance competitor for the King of Dance. <br /> <br /> The main figure everyone talks about with Jane Kelly here is dancing with Jerry Mouse. Originally Kelly wanted to do the figure with Walt Disney Mickey Mouse, but Disney was not lending Mickey to anyone. Mickey will have to wait until Framed Roger Rabbit makes an outside film. No need to worry because MGM had half of Tom and Jerry's moving rodents. <br /> <br /> Kelly always wanted a dancer to do something new and different on the screen like Fred Astaire did. Over the next 12 years, these two types of technical control have been allowed, and they have been praised for their work even if the films themselves were not appropriate. It was like all the inspiration for the other for greater and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios. In the Aweigh Anchors, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a little. In fact, Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Jane Kelly because he showed him how music should be performed and Bert Lancaster and Montgomery Clift were credited for helping him win Oscar Force from From Here to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra bought his half contract from the RKO of MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own. He became a friend of songwriter Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography, Sami Kan tells how Sinatra insisted on writing his songs for the film. Louis B. surrendered. Meyer wrote some truly wonderful stories to enrich them. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too. Frank sings accompanied him on the piano in the empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and then with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn has earned the title of putting more lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth more than anyone else. They have been friends for life, and Cahn always attributed this important achievement to Sinatra's career. <br /> <br /> In a bet, Stein and Kahn said they could write a song using a chromatic scale. They proved it in the Aweigh Anchors when Katharine Grayson put her soprano to work on everyone who suddenly sings my heart. I also did some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here singing is actually the basis of the plot. Two sailors meet on vacation through a combination of circumstances with Katharine Grayson and her niece Dean Dean Stockwell. In an attempt to fix it with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get a test with Jose Iturbe. They spend the film trying to do it. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment in the ouiyas was that Pamela Breton, who plays the Brooklyn waitress, did not get any number herself. I've got a playful review of her performance like Meg Brocky in Brigadoon on Broadway and this is what she brought to Hollywood. I have doubts that she has a number cut, and somewhere in the basement of the MGM, maybe still so. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why music is not being added to music. All of that creative talent was under contract with Metro Goldwyn Meyer. If you have to pay the market value, the debt of some third world countries may be retired. <br /> <br /> But the film's results will be extraordinary.
