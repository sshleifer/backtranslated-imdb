The title has many meanings - boxing ring, where the differences and grievances, marriage ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels that his problems will end and cause the problem, a ring-like bracelet gives Bill Maple as a symbol of love. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer Carl Bresson gave his debut in Alfred Hitchcock's films "The Ring". Young Ian Hunter, a long-time filmmaker, plays the role of Bob Corby, who caught the attention of a pretty girl, Mabel (Liliane Hall Davis), at an entertaining show. You happen to be engaged with "One Tour" by Jack Sander (Carl Bresson) but that does not stop her from flirting with Bob. Bob is convinced to go "round one" with Jack. He wins several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager attended the show to see if Jack was a good fighter as they heard him. He shows Jack grabbing and Jack, along with his stupid coach (Great Gordon Harker), proceeds to achieve his wealth through the marriage plans of Maple when he improves. Jack wins his fight and marries Maple the next day, but there is still a deep attraction that she and Bob feel to each other. Jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> In the end a boxing movie where the hero does not explode - Bob acts and does everything in his power to be a hero - if Mabel behaves just the same way !!! I left him for Bob - and the battle was in the end a mighty battle. It is very realistic - it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film. After Jack was enthusiastic and sensitive, he was almost eliminated - then between sessions, Mabel reunited, giving him the courage to triumph. The question is why she wants her return - from the start she did not think about starting an affair with Bob - why did not she do it again? <br /> <br /> The movie is full of symbolism. Jack, handshake handshake, changes to accept Mabel's bracelet from Bob. When Jack puts the ring on a maple's finger, the Pops bracelet slides down her arm. In the end, Jack sees the reflection of the Maple in a water bucket on the side of the ring and this gives him confidence to continue. It's an excellent movie that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
