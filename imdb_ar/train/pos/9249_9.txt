This film is masterful, fun and touching. Now you often see that Jean Harlow (or any actress in this era, for this woman) gives another woman a quick punch in the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Harlow sends Robbie to my fixer after mixing with Jabels Edward Hall (a cheese and granny smile), her plight becomes more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant and is convinced that this destroyer has given up But in fact, she has brought her love back and comes to see her, despite the fact that he will be arrested, and with the help of a minister, she is married. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with fellow inmates comes second only to her electrochemistry with Gabel, who was her most famous man. Her sarcastic personality is the perfect match for the smooth swindler in Gable. What do not you like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you will not be a bad-looking lady - if that is not your face!" Robbie cast his words on the gypsies, her rival. "If you approach me, I will have to open the other window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
