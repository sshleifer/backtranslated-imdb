Before I start, I would like to point out that I know the editor of this film. We never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (those things that came before the message boards), and we have spoken over the phone, so I have a bias here. Anyway ... It's ironic how the culture of the "Buck Mouse" in the late 1950s and early until the mid-1960s was back in the mid-nineties, this movie, from the son of one of the original Rat Pack , Which were made in a similar fashion, was flop. Not only that, it was a critical fluctuation. I think that Peter Travers of Rolling Stone is the only one who did not go wild (he gave her a mixed review, as I remember). Although I do not think this is the greatest movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of Rat Pack, or "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> For one thing, this looks neat and moves along. For another, the basic offerings are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly constrained here when the gangster returns from a sanatorium, and has a soft edge to him. Jeff Gold Plum returns to his satirical performances in the days before the turnout, such as the Great Cold. Although Elaine Barkin is only required to give up this film, she does so in an amusing way. Admittedly, it is not a great film; dialogue is often made up of puns, and many of them do not work (like the entire "Zen of Ben"). Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are here. However, you are comfortable, and if you love gangster movies, it may also be.
