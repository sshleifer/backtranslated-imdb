The moment I started watching, I realized that I was watching well, so I was not surprised when I found that the script was written by Andrew Davis and performed by Sue Bertoistel, both of whom brought us an excellent production of 1995 from Pride & Brigises! So my only presence here is that Emma did not reach 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was great, and I think Brunella has excellent features like Miss Bates, but I liked Kate Beckinsell and Mark Strong as well. Language is a joy to hear, can you imagine in this day and age to hold someone without uttering an actual word? Samantha Morton was as excellent as Miss Smith in fact, the casting site was immediately as it was with pride and prejudice. I was so impressed that I saw him twice in two days !! So, thanks again to the BBC for another high-quality TV piece. I have seen the Paltrow version which is fine but I think the BBC version is much better. Excellent production I'm happy to own on DVD !!!
