Collect from reading previous comments that indicate that this movie went directly to the cable. Well, I paid for her in a theater, and I'm glad I did it because it was a great movie. Most of the settings seem to have been manufactured in the early 1960s (with the exception of the Shrink office, which was dated differently). If you leave the Neve Campbell sequence outside, the entire film has a washed-out atmosphere in the early 1960s. The use of restaurants in the movie was fantastic. For the first time director who I think his background is written, he has a wonderful eye. During the first ten minutes I felt that the plot lacked reasonableness, so I suspended my will to disbelieve and went to ride. In terms of representation and portrayal of relations between father, son, wife, wife and parent-child relations, the film immediately appeared. It seems that William H. Messi, whom I was delighted to see, fills the void left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia demonstrate it. Tracy Ullman as a neglected wife was very moving for me. A three-dimensional portrayal of a personality perceived by society was often two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of memorable photos. The portrayal of parents (Bain / Sutherland), indirectly, reminded me of the BUFFALO of Vincent Gallo '66, although it dropped somewhat! I will certainly pay the money to see a second film from this director. He has the self-discipline of a b-crimefilm director in the 1950s (something that will never have P.T.Anderson!), Yet he has a visual style and a way with actors who grab attention.
