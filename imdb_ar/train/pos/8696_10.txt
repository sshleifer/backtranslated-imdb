One of the unknown gems of the 1980s, Scenes ... is characterized by sharp irony and great performances from Arnetia Walker (how did not get a lot of roles after this?) And Wallace Shawn. It is a delicious dispatch of class warfare and people in those categories. The hilarious writing and characters, though not subtle, are accurate. And sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese person to blackmail another character as a "gang") have not been placed "for social value" as another review suggests they should be. The value here lies in the mockery of the film and in its brilliant, sinister way. I found it creative, funny and of a special character.
