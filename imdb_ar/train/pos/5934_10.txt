Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Definitely give us movies like the Batman start. Oh, by the way, I think Hollywood might cover the story line in Batman, but please do not think about what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I looked around to see when it was coming out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics, where the story line looks good, had all the wonderful movie decorations. Unfortunately, this will not happen at this time. For producers, directors and all the great task actors, but I hate to do it to me. Let me want more.
