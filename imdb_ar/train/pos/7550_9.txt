Wonderful. The film "Journey" is truly wonderful and contains a lot of super surreal images, dark intentions and a completely strange black feeling about how to see the cartoon animals of the world. It is full of a wonderful group of characters that bend and flow with distorted backgrounds. With all the wonderful imagination, this secondary story is secondary to the visual images of the eye and we follow a small cat and his zombie sister while facing death, flood, water elephants, swords, swords and pigs that fish. I never heard of her, but now I love her - perhaps because she reminded me of the surrealist pen of the American cartoonist; Bill Pimpton. It is a delightful pleasure for lovers of exotic and beautiful things and has pushed me to the screen for fear of missing something wonderful. Simply, it's "Hello Kitty" without "o".
