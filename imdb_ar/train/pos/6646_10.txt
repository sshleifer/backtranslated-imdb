Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for freedom in India, ignored his family and son. This film revolves around his son Heralal, who feels he has been neglected because of Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The film begins in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi acts as a lawyer and fights India's freedom against the British. Herarala arrives in South Africa to help his father's lawyer. Gandhi participated in the struggle for freedom and wanted his wife and children to join as a service to society. As a result, Herarlal has no chance of completing his education and failing his exams. He marries his lover (bhoomika Chawla) mother. Heralal has ambitions to travel to England and becomes an attorney like his father, but his father refuses to grant him a family grant by a businessman and instead gives it to someone else who says the grant should not be limited to granting it. The family must be open to the most deserving students living in a colony. This irritates Hiralal and the conflict between the father and the son increases, hieraral hates his father for neglecting him and accuses him of being uneducated and unemployed. Heralal struggles to cover his expenses and land on the streets through failed business attempts and huge debt, losing his wife and children. Akshay Khana gave a wonderful performance like HERALAL GANDI .. All the best to him, the direction and the scenario is awesome, the photography is excellent. Overall an excellent movie and a must see. I give it 10/10
