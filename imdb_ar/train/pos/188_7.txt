I'm a fan of huge classic movies, but I just shoot silent movies. Many silent films do not get my attention, but showing people is a remarkable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davis and William Heinz are fantastic in this picture. Davis, in particular, has a wide range, turning from a laughing little girl in the city into a comedian who takes herself very seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast paced movie with an impressive array of engravings by some of the biggest stars of the Silent Era. The film caught my attention immediately and I forgot it was a silent movie. (I know this does not make much sense, but that's what happened). The actors are very skillful in their craft so that little dialogue cards are needed. <br /> <br /> People are an ideal introduction to silent movies. It is a fast-paced and enjoyable film with two of the best silent-era stars. Add in Hollywood spelling and Show People should be on the "must see" list for all classic movie buffs.
