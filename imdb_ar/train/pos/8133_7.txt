Well, I do not like Rap personally, but I still find the fear of Black Hat Farhana. I'm sure I did not get some jokes, but I knew it, and it was funny enough to make me laugh after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of the Spinal tap, so it was natural to check it out. It was derived from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes starkly, but this film is still self-evident as an original, funny and funny satire. My favorite personal point of view: "At the time of slaves, they did not have hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were so tired that they could not rebel.
