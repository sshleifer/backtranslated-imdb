I have enjoyed the series of criminal intent of law and order for a long time. Catherine Erbe, Det. Alexandra Ims, female detective is somewhat difficult and seems somewhat bitterness in the series of criminal targets. Look at her other side in this film. <br /> <br /> This film presents the wonderful and beautiful aspect of these talented actresses. If you are a fan of criminal crime, this film is a handful in its representation and gets a very good look spinning family hardships in the south. <br /> <br /> I did not like the role of Albert Veniz in this film because he did the moving work of his older, hard-headed colleague and intolerance of change. It reminds me of many of my young men and that photography is divine, but you are likely to find it difficult in this film. <br /> <br /> It is easy to admire Catherine Erebi in this film and why I recommend him as a 10 star for criminal crime, law and order fans.
