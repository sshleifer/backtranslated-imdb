The planning rings were a bit dim, but when they reached the desert it was very interesting to see them. The reason I call it the most realistic reality program is that Charlie came out of the race relatively early to my surprise. When his hands were painful, I expected the usual pressure and then fix a miracle, but instead he actually quit the race. The most worrying moments in this show should be that Max was stuck in the desert with almost no water or food! The end was great and I was very happy to see at least one team make it. Overall, not as big as the Long Way Round, but certainly an interesting hour, so one gets a peek at the most challenging race in the world.
