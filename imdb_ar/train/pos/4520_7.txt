This comedy is fairly long and goes beyond the top, a very exhilarating look, never giving up the irony or irony of the problems of a "strong man", who likes to wear women's clothes at night. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters is as beautiful as ever, but Adrian Pasdar enjoys full credibility and steals the film. He (she) is very gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings.
