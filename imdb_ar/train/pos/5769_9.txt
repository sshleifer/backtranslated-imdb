Do all of you please throw hell off the Todd leaves?!! Let's give you $ 30,000 to create a movie and find out what you've found! The man got a 735 zombie and was regularly thrown to work for free! The acting is certainly laughable at times. Yes, make-up is not the greatest thing you see at all. But this is not the worst either, if you want to see it, go to watch Zombie Nation with the raccoon zombie. <br /> <br /> This is the pure old Guerilla Film. Todd is a professional consummate, all-around gentle man. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot does not seem out of reach. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I hope that Todd Shetz will come out of his hiding place and do a new copy of this. If anyone tries to make a film, they know that just finishing it is an achievement in itself.
