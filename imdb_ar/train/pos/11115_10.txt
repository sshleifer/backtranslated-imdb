I think the soprano is a great show because of all the supporting characters in it. You've purchased every video so far and wait for the rest. In all 42 episodes so far, the best of them is definitely Episode 3, Denial, Fury, Acceptance. This episode addresses my most favorite character at The Sopranos. Brendan Fillon was named. He was killed because of the wrong truck hijacking and a truck driver was killed by mistake. Brendan was wonderful because he was already one of the few figures that actually stood up against Tony and his gang. In the end, he ended up shooting through the eye as he bathe, and this is my most favorite scene ever in the history of soprano. Brendan Fillon is # 1 for me. My second favorite character was Matthew Bevileka, who was killed after his attempt to assassinate Christopher Molticante. Tony and Pussy shot him in the Haklabarni Park after they grabbed him and tortured him. My favorite character # 3 is Sean Gismonti, who was killed immediately after the shooting of Christopher. Finally, my favorite figure # 4 is Chuckie Senior, a follower of Uncle Junior. He was killed on board Tony. All the dead characters are dead. This is the only bad thing about the soprano. All the nice men are always killed. You know what would be nice to change about the soprano? They must have a whole episode where they show all the supporting characters in hell and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Jon Jr., Silvio and Polly because they need revenge. Brendan Fillon must reply !!!!!!!!! 1
