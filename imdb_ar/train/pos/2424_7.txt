Three screams get the deserts only after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done. This type of film makes me always wonder where you leave the truth and imagine the imagination. Although these people were scum of the earth, I found myself feeling sorry for them. They never stood a chance.
