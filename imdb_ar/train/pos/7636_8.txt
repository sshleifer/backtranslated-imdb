It's been a few years since I saw this, but I remember it and want to see it again. It has become a kind of "treatment" for me with a personal experience of my own. <br /> <br /> A 35-year-old man regrets a high school baseball game in which he "missed the ball" and lost his side. He thought about it after 20 years, "If I just hit that ball" and how his life would be better because of it. After that, he gets a chance to find out .... and gets a little over his bargains. <br /> <br /> This reminds me a lot when I was in high school, we tried our experience twice the drilling / dancing team and did not make it. This team was the closest to a women's club in my school. If you're on it, you're "all that". I did not try out until the last two years of the HS system and after the second time, I took it badly. I was bruised and badly shackled before doing exercises and wearing tights to cover bruises, causing my injury. That was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, and sometimes even now, I think, "If I did not hit my leg just because I would never wear those stupid socks." Now I do not sit and I think my life would be better or even different if I made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never know how things can be different by changing one small thing in the past. . Who knows, it could have changed the course of events so much that I would not have met my father's father. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has that moment in the past they want to change. Be careful what you want !!!
