I went to see this movie twice in a week, and I can only sum it up with one word (which I usually do not use lightly): great! From my point of view, the best film ever made. Who deserves the Oscars and other awards if not the Swedish crew that invented the film's perfection in the last scene of the film, when all that is said (and has no pay) is collected throughout the story? Just as Daniel Darius's personality evokes many long-held feelings and feelings among people around him, the film does the same for its viewers: you walk with your head and feel your heart full. Great things! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life," you may think about what you feel after a luxurious experience like in heaven: happy, guaranteed, fulfilled. To say it with Virginia Woolf, Ms. Dalloway: "These moments are enough."
