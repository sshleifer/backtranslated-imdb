I really enjoyed the first episode and I look forward to more. Slightly weak on the crime front (almost intellectually, not suspiciously or physically) but I thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming. I will definitely see it again! <br /> <br /> I hope they will have a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and have been a little exploited this time. The actress who plays the role of assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched think) is very sweet and up and opens her door as sweet and full of vitality instead of stupid and very pleasant nuisance. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
