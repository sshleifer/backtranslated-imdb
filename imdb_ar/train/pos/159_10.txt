This was just another great film for the Berlin Festival. But unlike Sally Potter, which I saw a few days ago, when I left the cinema I felt a strong desire to embrace the whole world and I was happy to be alive, and this time something quite the opposite happened: Down, the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. It was as if, suddenly, there was nothing left, all hope, all the future was moved to a dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed bleak and closed, but then, one lovely day, this kind of glamor opens up the horizon and makes her dream come true. There was no one standing beside her, but she suddenly found a companion, without anything, anyone was able to share the most hidden feelings in her life. This person was Tony, a homeless girl who does not seem to have any roots, just like her. <br /> <br /> But the title of the movie is "Ghosts", and the ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, a way to keep them? The ghosts also represent the hidden delusions of people, the strange thoughts that concern you, which only you imagine, and disappear from all other people. Francoise, a French woman, is the victim of such ghosts. She once lost her daughter in Berlin, who seems to have been robbed in a supermarket, at one moment of lack of interest. The time is now over. Francoise returns to Berlin and is still looking for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina may be that girl, after all that she got from the same scar in her ankles and her heart-shaped date between the blades of her shoulder that seem to prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> Nina adopts this idea, after all, she is not only in desperate need of a companion, but also yearns for the mother. But in the end empty-handed, Tony disappeared with a man, and her supposed mother turned out to be a sick woman. Fran√ßois's husband concludes, "Marie is dead," and the statement can not be more disappointed. Nina is just "Nina", a nameless girl, and there is no hope of achieving any god. There is no Mary in this world to accompany our lonely lives. So, in the end, we see each Nina on her own, about to walk along the path that opened up to her, in a future that looks happy and uncertain.
