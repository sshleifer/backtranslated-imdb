Another wonderful film from a country, where because of decades of repression of fundamentalist regimes, has no problems creating a passionate theme. Panahi follows a different approach this time with a mixture of satirical comedies and charismatic and unprofessional actors. While still expressing his message about what he sees as inherently wrong in his own country, he does so without the need for a sharp story. It is a positive step for a country, especially its people, that the Iranian people desperately need. The greatest pity is that it will not be released locally. Iran's isolated, paranoid government asserts that this good filmmaker succeeds only abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up amid a revolution and watching academics, artists and learners "disappear" over the past 25 years, he shows great courage in continuing to put his work there. The realism achieved through the actual World Cup qualifiers takes you to the event. The fact that it was launched on 35mm is amazing because most of them will only try to use this project using digital format. It looks great. His insistence on using non-professional actors only also works in this film. Great deals from all sides. After watching several films illustrating Iran's problems as well as the news media that publish the facts, we can tend to demonize people as well as the government. This film does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things by laughing at themselves and the ridiculous rules of the law that perhaps the change for the better was not too far away. Some call Banahi a women's filmmaker, but I think he is fighting for the most oppressed demography in Iran. Independent young woman.
