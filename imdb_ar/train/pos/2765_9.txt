That is what the French and the Belgians are doing. It is a strange story, innovative and exhilarating and full of emotional challenges. Director Jacko van Dormail takes us to the world of George, who suffers from Down's syndrome and seeks to establish a meaningful relationship with someone, anyone else. It is not done in a patronizing way but with a great sense of humor and honesty as well. In George's interaction with the corporate management man, Harry was skillfully handled - turning from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease. <br /> <br /> The eighth day places similar Hollywood fare like the award-winning Rain Man, Barry Levinson or Robert Mann for the Fermist Gump Zemeckis well and really in the shadows. Sometimes, conjuring up the humor of Milos Forman Wen flew over the cuckoo's nest with the shadows of Dennis Potter thrown for good measure. <br /> <br /> While Harry, Daniel Otwell, is emotionally and emotionally transformed into Yobi, Harry after another sublime performance. But matched by gorgeous Paquel Duquenne as George. It is a film with uniformly strong performances and many memorable pieces of art - a shoe shop scene, a car showroom scene, George's dance to Genesis "Jesus He Knows Me", conference scene, fireworks scene. If you do not see it, there's only one thing you can do. Just rent it or attend a show at an old cinema near you and find out what you're missing. Better yet, buy this movie. Pure genius .....
