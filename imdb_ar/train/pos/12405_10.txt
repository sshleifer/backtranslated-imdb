I picked up this movie in 1990 on a video by accident and without knowing what I was in to. Many fans of horror may have missed this belief that it was a film in prison and they did not like it because it was not what they wanted to see. The above factors are likely to be the reasons why they are low rated but you should just ignore it and give it a whirlwind if you are a fan of this type. <br /> <br /> Contains strong claims in all sections of text and atmosphere to work and prison itself. <br /> <br /> It's an absolute diamond, a movie I still have a video to this day. check it out.
