Brian Dannahi, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino, and best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one film. Wow is all I can think of saying about it. These are four of the most disdainful representatives in the business world and they work together beautifully. The hair is like the way they play each other and add to the natural ability to appear as if they were the best friends of the movies even if they filmed the film. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is good and can be very intense to show the first time, and the four stars help to re-see the ability greatly. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahi together on the screen, and the greatest moment when they saw a couple from afar and filled the song themselves, I brought my tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> Good movie, great team, go and see. why? Four words, Fahi, Denhi, Paxton, Pantalino.
