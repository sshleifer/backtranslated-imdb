Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in several ways. First, it's a series of fans, available only on the web, and mainly featuring friends and neighbors who have software, home video cameras, and sewing machines, as Mickey & Judy once showed. It's definitely friends and neighbors, you can tell. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people I have ever seen, or younger or thinner? Some of them stumble through their lines as if walking on the marble ?? Some of them have thick accents, or simply do not speak well in the first place, so it makes it virtually impossible to understand one single word they say. However, you must recognize, because in everything collected by these friends and neighbors, it is fun to see it already. Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it's a bit strange (although it's a little recognized too) watching two Starfleet male tribes (although some kissing scenes seem continuous and persistent.) Yes, a little swinging when you quote clearly from ST: TOS, TNG or other presentations and movies, or when you hear the theme of Galaxy Quest being played at the beginning and end of each show. Okay. We can get it. why? Graphics are first class. Better than almost anything I've seen. Sometimes, a show or two really highlights the story ?? Some of them are actually a real trick. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is a complete fun guilty in every sense of the word ?? But you have to grant the people concerned credit when the credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to put the production of this size. People, groups, fashion, graphics? It's a huge effort on lots of people. We watch and go back and thank them.
