Now either you love Mr. Curry's humor or do not like it. Anna, Muslef and Irene had a crowd going out in large numbers, and on the other hand, they were bleeding and falling into mothers' ponds. Bruce Almighty is somewhat more common, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, check out the video. I saw the trailer three times and I still laughed at the same gags when I saw the movie. If you do not find a dog scene putting the seat down after using the funny bathroom, do not care about the film. <br /> <br /> Carrie, a reporter stuck in a rut that covers "lighter news" condemning God when it seems that his entire life will go. God faces the challenge and asks Carrie if he can do better. Curry enters in a swing possessing all the powers of God by making his girlfriend's breast (Jennifer Aniston) bigger, getting promoted, and answering the prayers of everyone through computer orders with one shot. <br /> <br /> This is not a highbrow movie or even memorable, but it is well made within its very limited intention, and provides almost continuous laughter to curry lovers, and even any religious cheese is likely to be harmless to all except the narrowest and most hostile swarms of God - The swarm of God. <br /> <br /> On the most thoughtful level, the film urges us to speculate about Kari's career - stuck in his "comedy" because he failed to make a big impact as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globe titles. His more direct role, "The Man on the Moon," does not know well that his comedy films - or Truman's show (which the Academy confirmed were three nominations while Carrie exceeded).
