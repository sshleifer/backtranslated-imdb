Brando plays the role of pilot Ace, just returned from dropping MiGs in the Korean War. On vacation, he discovers Madame Butterfield, falling in love. Both lovers see the folly of racism and cruelty that can be brought about by conservative cultural norms of human relations. <br /> <br /> This movie is an excellent love story with a nice touch that rejects racist, conservative and dominant standards while it was made in 1957. "Sayonara" will make you laugh and cry. Be aware that the musical background will make you wish you did not exist, although the Irving Berlin song will attract your memory for a long time after the stage lights come on again.
