While it is universally recognized that homosexuality of fear has been greatly influenced by the Kolchak episode they have performed, they, will be, whether this makes it a rip or a tribute represents a more controversial point altogether. As a great admirer of both, I share this last belief, although the least fortunate may not. James Whitmore was brave enough to take on the task of managing such a difficult episode. Invisible elephants and gorilla suits look like a recipe for disaster, but he swallows it elegantly. Lance Guest is doing a great job of creating a reliable personality from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader who are threatened by Ed Meecham. Forget the originality questionable parity fear and enjoy it only as X file is very satisfactory.
