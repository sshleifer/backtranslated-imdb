With "Twelve Monkeys," you should be careful, but if you do, you may find a lot to appreciate. I know I did. The story is interesting and deals with travel over time. The virus killed many people in 1997, and a person named Cole (Bruce Willis) was born in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he was arrested and placed in a mental hospital. There he meets with Jeffrey Goyns (Brad Pitt), who may have been linked to the virus. He also meets with psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Riley (Madeleine Stowe) who did not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996, Katherine began to believe the stories of Cole. <br /> <br /> The movie plays down over time. Cole is making a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, being picked up in the future and "they" are sending someone. For Cole, someone appears only seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen all over the film and therefore you should pay attention. You can ask some questions, but since you can not get an answer yourself, it's best to approve the movie. <br /> <br /> "Twelve Monkeys" works as a science fiction, with some brilliant images and a dark atmosphere, and it acts as a thriller. You're never sure what will happen next and that helps the movie. It may have some flaws in the story, but since it's about something fantastic like traveling through time, you have to accept what the movie tells us and try to enjoy it. This was the easy part for me.
