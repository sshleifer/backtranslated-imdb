"One shot, one shot, no exceptions." You should see if you are in the marines or snipers. Big thumbs! A great overall story, great camera action, good drama, movement, details, and more. Very close to the real thing. But this is not a film of collapse and the choice of editorial errors. This is sitting and getting 99 minutes good. The plot has some depth but this film is not really about making you think. About enjoying sniper lifestyle and action. Sniper 2 and 3 are a very good follow up but the first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger does a wonderful job playing his character and shows the hidden side of sniper life. Easy to deal with all the death. Must see for sniper lovers.
