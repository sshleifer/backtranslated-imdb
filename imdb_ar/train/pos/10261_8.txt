First, this film is not supposed to be as great and thought-provoking as many other reviewers who seem to compare it to. The first review says that something like anyone who likes this does not know anything about horror cinema, it seems the opposite. If one had to look back after the film, it really was not meant to be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But in fact, this was all he meant to keep viewers away from the shock of the day (and all the flaws were less visible in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I have given this level a high degree because it has reached its goal, and although it was not totally shocking (meaning not to shock) it made me a little sick and felt paranoid / pessimistic (I did not) Person for almost a week because I did not want to wake up and torture)
