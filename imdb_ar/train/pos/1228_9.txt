This 1991 NBC-TV was aired six months before John Goodman was released on the big screen of Babe Ruth's life. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. Television production is not ideal, but Babe's story is presented in more depth and complexity than Judman's one-dimensional novel. I especially enjoyed filming the intricate relationship between love and Ruth with the director of Yankee Miller Hughes, who always understood the brilliance of his star player and also continued to try to point out why Roth's faults in his character would never allow him to become a manager or captain of his players. The TV film rightly observes that Roth never achieved his dream of running the Yankees because of his flaws, while the terrible version of Goodman tries to drive the falsehood that Roth denied what he should have had in making the decision. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great companion story for "Eight Men Out" since the story began with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox scandal, and when his home race takes advantage of the literally saved baseball game. In fact, continuity continues between the two films with John Anderson re-acting the role of "Eight Men Outside" as Commissioner Kenesau Mountain Landis.
