I do not shake ten ratings easily. The film should really impress me, and Bourne's warning went even further. Moreover, I have combined this trilogy very well, so much so that I think it is one of the greatest 3D animation of our time. Although the three films can not be different from Ludlow's novels, they still represent a milestone in cinematic achievement. Bourn Ultimatum made me want to cry that the serial was complete, but I could not even try to stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the opening title appeared, I knew we were on the run. Paul Greengrass has done it again. All we love of the previous Bourne films here again: movement, dialogue and of course the shaky camera. But for me, the latter was never a problem. I think it adds to the thrill. <br /> <br /> I will come back to watch this movie several times before releasing it to a DVD, because it is simply a genius. It is a very satisfactory result, and must stand the test of time as a wonderful film, and overall, an unforgettable trilogy.
