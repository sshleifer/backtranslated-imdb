When you compare what Brian de Palma did in the 1980s to what entertainment dictates today, his films will still look better and better. Dressed To Kill, Blow Out, Body Double, Scarface, and Carlito's Way are all great works for a film artist at the height of his power. The man had a long period of films better than average. This pure Hitchcock with a sharp aberration in the eighties of the last century, a wise story of lust and murder with a lot of twists, huge help for elegance, the amazing degree of Pino Donaggio, and the plot inspired by Giallo. The work of the camera and the bloodthirsty images help to overcome logical gaps, while the wonderful performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director), Nancy Allen (wife of Palma at the time) and Michael Caen make everything special, let the talented take you on a journey A scary surreal sexual charged and you will enjoy every frame of "Dressed To Kill".
