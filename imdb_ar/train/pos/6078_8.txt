I was particularly happy because in this film, Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona did not have fair hair as always. The actors performed very well, and I loved the text that follows the original Shakespeare text honestly. But I have to say that some scenes acted very dramatically for a character such as Didimona. I always thought it was very modest, which is why it is not at all appropriate to show it on the bed with Cassio - although that was only happening in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a bit surprised that even a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was overtly presented. But as a whole, I loved the film especially Desmona crying in the scene of death.
