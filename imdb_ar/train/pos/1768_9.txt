I have not laughed this hard in a long time movie. I have to go to a preview, and I was overjoyed because I was dying to see him. My tears were in my eyes of laughter throughout a lot of the film. Everyone laughed, and they clapped and yelled throughout most of the film. <br /> <br /> Glory to Steve Carell (who you already love). In this film he proves his enormous talent for comedy. He has a style I have never seen before. Catherine Kinner is excellent as always. Thank God there was no veil from Will Ferrell (I love him, but I saw him so much this summer). <br /> <br /> There were parts of the comic genius in this film. Partly thanks to Karel, and partly thanks to the writing (Karel also). The wax scene and the speed with which the "obvious problem" was carrying were completely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I will definitely go to see "The 40 Year Old Virgin" when it is released. My advice: Go see her for huge laughs and a very enjoyable film.
