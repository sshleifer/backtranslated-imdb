I've seen a lot of rock horror in the 80s over the years, from trash like "Terror on Tour" to soothing gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2." Somehow I managed to keep it off, which is odd because it is probably the most popular and well received. Well, I've finally caught it, and it's best to easily have this most unusual subtype (but always be loved!). The plot (largely raised in "The Black Roses") relates to an unofficial person named Eddie, who was ridiculed by everyone in his high school because of his taste in music. He liked the metal in the 1980s, especially his idol, Sammy Corr (played by the late great Tony Fields). After Sammy's death, DJ Eddie gives him his latest recording of Sami. Once Eddie plays the record back, he discovers that it is stricter, and bad things begin to happen to those who make fun of him. Do you own Sami Music? "Trick or Treat" is a well-made and total scream. The special effects are wonderful, although they feature typical laser beams in the 1980s. I grew up in the 1980s, and while I was not a fan of the heavy metal, I remember the urban myth of playing back and hearing the voices of Satan worship. Haha! I also remember that my elder brothers and neighbors told me that both KISS and Ozzy were worshiping Satan, so it was very interesting to see them making chats like a non-harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If only I had seen this movie as a child! While the film seems to make fun of the popular conspiracy of the 1980s between alleged Satanism and heavy metal, the viewer did not really discover why Sami Corr was back from the dead, causing chaos and killing anyone who blocked his way. This is the weakest point in the film, but if you can overlook it, it will be fun.
