In the rapid economic development of the 1990s in China, there is a return to traditional Chinese culture, in part because of the rise of nationalism accompanied by increased wealth and, most importantly, because of a sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old. Socialist ideology in the post-cultural revolution. <br /> <br /> However, the return of Chinese traditional culture, Confucianism, was not disaster-free, because the Chinese had adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls depicted in this film is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the part that should be neglected is not only inherited, but the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its style, such as face change, was discarded in emission and facing extinction . <br /> <br /> The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-adoption of tradition by contemporary China. This is the deeper meaning behind the film.
