Once upon a time, there were different kinds of movies. These different films coexisted although everyone had something different to offer .... <br /> <br /> This seems obvious at first, but I thought I would refer to him during this review because some people seem to have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti lovers. That's all it is. Do not claim to be anything else or anything greater. People who mock him as something less than promise do not see the whole picture literally. After all, Hollywood produces films all the time that are a cruel means for people (eg, a personal guard or a preacher's wife with Whitney Houston are two examples in your mind.) <br /> <br /> First, I would like to take the film as a medium for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. Singing is a wonderful and pleasant selection of Arias. The film begins with Schubert Avi Maria and Mattinata Leoncafalo. Baff sings Arias from La Gioconda and Manon Lescaut and Turandot but also sings folk music such as "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" and the song that was nominated for the Oscar and Golden Globe "If We Were in Love" music by John Williams and the lyrics of Alan and Marilyn Bergman - Ex-Oscars. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. It is designed for Bavaro and therefore will not be something deep or universally applicable to the ordinary viewer of the film. It's the story of the famous opera singer who was shocked at a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing again in the same place, a "MET" in New York City, loses his voice of fear. The doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) played by Katharine Harold - gives him a bullet to treat his physical psychological reaction. She gives her the opportunity to walk around with him reluctantly. <br /> <br /> They begin an affair, knowing he is married and promised not to fall in love with him, and thinks he will be just another woman. Despite all this, they fall in love (hence the song, "If we are in love") and with her help, overcome his fear and return to MET where he wins. I will not tell how it ends, but it is fairly predictable. This is not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Presentations in this are not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Finney) is not a representative, so if you expect Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks to perform, you're a fool, not Pavarotti. He knows he is not Specby. What is nice, charming and charming. He enjoys himself, and if you can let yourself enjoy yourself, that's not bad. A funny line is that when Pamela (Harold) is told that she is "a thirsty plant, a fanny can tell you!" She says, of course, I do not want to lean to Vinnie! Katharine Harold is very sweet and performs a pleasant job as a semi-educated woman learns from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the film is: "Life must not be the size of life." There is Eddie Albert, who does his usual job as a technical director. There are many models "on their own" by real conductors and singers, and are photographed on-site at the Metropolitan Opera at the Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you can let yourself go and enjoy a "little toss" just as he suggests in the movie, you can enjoy this movie for what it is. I know I do all the time. :) <br /> <br />
