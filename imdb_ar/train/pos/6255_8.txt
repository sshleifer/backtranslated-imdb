This film shows people in the toughest days in Austria. It shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples. It shows people's inability to communicate or talk to others. <br /> <br /> In the show I attended, people left in the middle because they were no longer able to watch the movie. And rightly so. Because the film is not easy to watch. She has a very frustrating message and there is no moment of compassion in the film. It is a very harsh film, not everyone's taste. You can not talk about the conditions for enjoying this movie. He gets caught in your throat and never leaves you and in the end simply feels shortness of breath because of his severity. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie. You must make your mind based on what you said earlier. Just be aware that this is not a normal film and not everyone's taste.
