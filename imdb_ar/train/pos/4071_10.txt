I first saw this film when I was about seven years old, and I was quite enchanted after that, but for years I could not figure out what the film was called. Now I'm twenty-one and found the movie by accident two weeks ago and I bought a copy. Although my memory in the film was a little blurry, I did not feel any disappointment because of what I saw. The animation in this wonderful film conjures up a whole world that is so believable and moving that you are attracted to the film through it alone. But this film also contains a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. With Floating Island, General Madness, Pirate Grandma Friendly and a love story constructed this movie will not let you down I would recommend this movie to anyone.
