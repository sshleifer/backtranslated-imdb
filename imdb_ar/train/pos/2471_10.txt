I did not read Hamlet Shakespeare before watching it but I have Shakespeare's book with me and I can follow the dialogue through it. My point of view in the film may be partial biased because I have never read the play before, but I have been engaged in understanding this film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers who have ever lived, and Hamlet's story is certainly one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now in the movie ... <br /> <br /> I found that all the actors in the film have a strong understanding of what they were saying and therefore, they were able to express it well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet none compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. The thing I liked about it was that it worked well in a "movie" and not as a play that you were studying. You do not need to be rich in Shakespeare to relate to every village the misery you have to go through. I recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> This is my year.
