I will hasten to address the film's issues here: it was a very attractive story about the destructive qualities of emotions that consume everything; a young Italian woman who can not communicate emotionally with her imprisoned political fianc√© (partly due to her non-political attitudes and her free orientation towards life) Her new young mistress who begins an explicit sexual relationship with her. The anxiety, anger, tenderness and passions that surround her in the atmosphere of the story are equal to the calmness that seems to swallow Khayyatin. It gives the film a disturbing mood that permeates all the political conflicts that have been lost to the viewer in another way (unless you had a deep knowledge of Italian politics during the 1980s). I found that the film is convincing ... What is somehow ruined is an oral sex scene performed by the actress in male leadership ... it is not simulated and leaves little imagination. There are other scenes of sex in the film that I feel are necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness in which characters live. But the oral sex scene, as I feel, hinders focus on the real story. It was a smooth sailing to that point and once the scene of the infamous sex (which caused the return of a lot of excitement in its day) appeared, it was like hitting a roadblock. It's annoying and unnecessary and I'm in the camp I think the film would not have been damaged if the scene had been removed from it. Unfortunately this particular scene may deter people from watching this interesting film, which I think is worth watching because there is a lot going on under the surface, emotions and additional disorders in the sub-text. <br /> <br /> In general: a wonderful film hampered by an unnecessary sexual scene.
