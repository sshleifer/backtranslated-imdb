I liked the idea of ​​this film from the moment I saw it first. Einstein was always one of my country's heroes, and his image as a gentle, fun, and crazy genius was small enough to make me watch the movie. The added spices of Matthau also made it better Einstein. <br /> <br /> The story is purely fictional, but it is a delightful story. The auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four of the physics physicists, Ed begins to win the heart of Catherine. The jealous fiancé (who embodies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower throw in this mix, and you enjoy pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of actors with wonderful characters and a sweet and daffy performance. Walter Matau plays the role of Einstein as a naughty ephedra; Cupid with a slide base. Tim Robbins is graciously cool, with both Ed and Meg Ryan playing higher than normal rom-com. Stephen Fry is a delight as "RRRatman" and Ryan's preacher. Who lacks a single romantic grandeur in his body. <br /> <br /> The movie has fallen under most radars, but it's a delightful treasure that does not grow with frequent scenes. It is characterized by writing and first class presentations and is a nice treat in a less than nice world.
