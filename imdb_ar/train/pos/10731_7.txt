I noticed that a DVD version appears to be missing scenes or lines between FRF publishing and release. <br /> <br /> They must prove that they can win the right to sit in the FRF other than the Green Team. <br /> <br /> Similar to the other scene during their simulations, Kevin gets Joaquin to retreat, <br /> <br /> I think the VHS version other than ABC may contain all the missing things. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I would like to know which DVD version contains the missing items. <br /> <br /> The DVD you have seen feels edited to the TV.
