I know it's difficult, I know it's not on every computer, but it's very funny. If you can put it in perspective from the early 1980s and carry all the stereotypes at that time - and the film still makes you almost laugh - more than a really good comedy. With the tradition of comedy films for thousands of years, the subject of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend your political health for an hour and a half, all you have to do is laugh completely, please see this. <br /> <br /> P.S. Is it possible to put this on a DVD, it is very difficult to find it on VHS.
