I saw this movie with my father. I have to be 15 years old. That was in a Star Movies one afternoon. The film began somewhat vaguely, but you can say that these thieves were gathering to get a degree. Things really went well after half an hour. <br /> <br /> All actors are fantastic, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think they are the band, they play well together. I can watch this movie at any time. I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters that are trying to deal with a very strange result. Jokes are not loving but subtle and extreme at the same time make them very fun. <br /> <br /> Comedy is perfect for spending the lazy afternoon.
