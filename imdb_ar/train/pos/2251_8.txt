I found the Alan Jacobs review very accurate in relation to the film; however I had the opportunity to rent a DVD of popular films with a comment from the BYU film coordinator, Motion Pictures' James Dark Records. LDS Prophet Heber J. Grant agreed on the film which understood the deviations of historical content For dramatic expression and telescope events. For example, the movie Joseph Smith was shown experimentally. Despite the great rhetoric of Brigham Young in defense of Joseph Smith was convicted anyway. Then Joseph was killed. Historically Joseph Smith has never been convicted of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hirum, both of whom were killed before the trial.
