I love playing football and I think this movie was great because it contains a lot of football. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kira Knightley were good as well as Archie Punjabi. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) likes to play football but her parents want her to learn how to cook a desire to marry her. When jazz begins in the football team secretly meet Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Jo (Jonathan Rhys Myers) coach. When her parents discovers turbulence but her father allows her to play a big game at the wedding of her pinky sisters (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents realize how much she loves football and allows her to travel abroad to play.
