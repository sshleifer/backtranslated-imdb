Such as "My Sassy Girl", this film is based on a real story published from the Internet, but this is where the similarities end. The story generally revolves around this rebellious man named Ji Hoon (Kwon Sang-woo), who is still trying to finish high school, where his parents hire a teacher named Soo Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a poor background but happens to be the same age . Add to that some obstacles, martial arts (thugs always after Ji-hoon to revenge), a disturbing and love-loving sarcastic girl behind him, his tendency to give up lessons, you can generally guess the whole story. Have you mentioned it as a romantic comedy? This film features some good fighting scenes, brilliant visual humor and a lot of courage, thanks to good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which brings a lot of energy to the story. Romance elements also work because of this reason. I must say, I want his girlfriend like Kim Ha Noel more than that girl of "My Sassy Girl" (at least a wise figure). She has some courage, but she is more in a gentle and sweet way. The characters are mostly likable (so one might say that he had only a hill less than "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle worked for this film on his score), and the movie is very intelligent and enjoyable in most ways. However, this type of story deteriorates about 2/3 of the road (where it is somewhat on a familiar fare, where nothing really interesting happens), but as the end approaches, it recovers a bit again. Overall, fun, nice movie. 10/08
