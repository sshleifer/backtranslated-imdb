I doubt that much of this film depends on a true story. At first she says on the basis of a true story, somewhat. I bet the only truth is that there was a previous model turned into a favored fisherman perhaps named Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it starts with talking to Domino to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Dominos are questioned about what you know about stealing $ 10 million. Through memories of the past, we see the domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a good fisherman. She mainly tells my other reward hunters, Ed and Choco. They allowed her to join the group. It is powerful, can use any kind of weapon, and will use its beautiful appearance if necessary. <br /> <br /> They are involved in a fraud by Claremont, a police officer. Along the way, the group begins a live TV show, featuring Ian Zering and Bryan Austin Green. They look like hosts and must be really desperate to appear in this. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was amusing and had some laugh. The amendment did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly using weapons and blood. It could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Good enough to watch.
