Strictly, the top commander of bandit gangs Frankie Diomide (Lee Van Cleef is always gorgeous in his rugged form) has been arrested and sent to prison to be able to uncover the discovery of a traitorless partner. Get bust to catch the goofball for the headdress for a short time and wannabe wannabe wise Tony Breda (a nice photograph by Tony Le Bianco) also gets a shock. Frank and Tony formed an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony Frank helps out of the joint and helps him in his quest to avenge a rival gang of ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly playing Jean Rochefort). Director Michelle Lobo, who works on a screenplay by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, connects the elegant story at an accelerated pace, with the appropriate courage, but occasionally enlivening all the time, and the exciting pieces are organized with a remarkable array of snoring. (Treadmill shower jailhouse approximation and chase rate Mundo destructo car chase as exciting exciting highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco offer nice, wonderful and fun chemistry. The relationship between their characters is funny alternating and touching. Sadly Edwige Fenech has not given much to do as Tony's wonderful friend Orchidea, but at least she gets her gorgeous and weak body in an unjustified nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's horrifying, pulsating and synchronized jazz hits are definitely a swing. The glamorous cinematography of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tunti is equally impressive. The winner is neat and really fun.
