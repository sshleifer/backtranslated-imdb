My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. I never forgot that. I have never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two years old when she was Elephant Walk) Remember, I'm nine years old, so feelings are not sexual, I could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit on her feet like a puppy and stare at her. I'm starting to show her age, (about 74 years old), but I still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and quickest women ever. <br /> <br /> I've seen the film several times since, and it's a happy sapphire. What he saves is, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, the picturesque scenery, the impressive elephant duel, and a well-established point of human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> In general, well - I spent two hours watching a movie channel or a rented video.
