This is a fantastic Canadian comedy series. The film tells how the stars Jean-Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the lead showwriter and colleagues Ricky and Papples play at the top in the form of a real cynical view of the gardens of the vehicles and sections of the garbage cans mentioned. . The film will tell you why Ricky and Julian are starting to make their most advanced conquests in the world of crime. Why and the reasons behind everything will be spoiler so I will not give the real reasons behind their brighter flight. Their friend and partner often (bubbles) is a wonderful figure. The entire presentation is great and losing the movie will not affect the way you see one sit-com. It's a comedy with a C capital and a wonderful hideaway in the garden of trailers and time scammers with small small time ideas but great time dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to watch - buy - steal this grabbing program. You'll be glad you did. And to my American friends --- he will also deliver you. 10 of 9. Brilliant. How TV should be TV.
