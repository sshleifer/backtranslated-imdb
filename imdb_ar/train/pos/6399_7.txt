Although it was not definitely the best movie I've ever seen, it was definitely worth $ 8 (which can not be said about many movies these days.) <br /> <br /> This was a great account of the real story , Although many of the details of the real story were crooked to the film (that is, the Billy Sunday character was three or four people in the real story combined together.) Robert De Niro was of course good, and Cuba Gooding Jr. was also wonderful.
