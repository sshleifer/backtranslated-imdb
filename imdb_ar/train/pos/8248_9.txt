When you see a DVD cover, you're sure it's a cheap B movie, a $ 1,000 movie in someone's backyard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> These are quality materials and really good. It's a comedy and a clever one. It is also very impressive in locations, with a nice spot of kindness. The production values ​​are very good (it sounds excellent) and the actors are well known and the direction of the film and its collections are wonderful. Something amazing. Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie Anne Moss, who played against the genre, is wonderful, like "Helen Robinson", a wife resembling Jun Cleaver; Billy Connolly is a wonderful comedian like "Fido" Tim Blake Nelson His neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend Tammy, Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as excellent parents, as well as K'Sun Ray as young Timmy Robinson, should not be overlooked either. In fact, he may have lines in the film more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If you explain the story, it will seem so stupid that few of you will see it. You'll just have to take the word people who liked her here and find her very pleasantly surprised. You need a dark sense of humor, appreciation of absurdity.
