The film was a long-awaited release, which was a bit disappointing because of my expectations. When looking at it again, I must say that it is really quite a bit. First of all, this is quite true for the original history (of course not quite) and is not done in this way except to preserve the film's right. The history of humility is presented as a child and perfectly true to the origin. Acting may not be the best, the plot is a bit thin, but when compared to the 1966 film Vitti, they are much better just because they do not try to be musical. In general, I would recommend it only to fans of Modesty Blaise or to someone by picking it up on TV.
