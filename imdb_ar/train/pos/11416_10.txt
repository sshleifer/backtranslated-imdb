An excellent family movie ... gives a lot to think about ... there is nothing wrong at all in this film. Everything is perfect. The text is wonderful - it's real ... real ... things like this can happen in everyone's life. And do not forget to represent - it's great! Just see Frankie and you'll know what I thought of ... this picture is real and can not be missed !!!
