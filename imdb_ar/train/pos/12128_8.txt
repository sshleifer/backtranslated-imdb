I just saw "Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago! What a mysterious and almost scary film. I loved the way music went with every step of Philip. You gave me chills for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the greatest aspects of this film is to see the House of Davis enter itself directly in front of your eyes. She is wonderful, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because it was unusual to be very evil, courageous, and uneducated as an actress in 1934 ... she was a risk house, she always wanted to be different and that was true when she started to realize They can be as bad and bold as you want and that people will love them for it. If you are a real fan of the movie, it is amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> She has had a way to connect the line making part, and the film to that matter belongs to her. Such as "a block of music and fire ... this is me ... an old caso and some diamonds" or "but you are blanche, you are in this chair!" Or "with all my heart, I still love the man who killed him !!" ... those are a few of her films, but you got drifting. She looked brave and curious and close to those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe it was again ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was wonderful ... very calm and persevering and you need to be loved. I thought he was wonderful and could not understand how not everyone was falling for him, but again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was something that was common in writing in the first films. They have made a person so hateful that it is almost unreasonable for someone to fall in the first place. The performances were fantastic, but in real life, Philip was not interested in Mildred. This is just a simple truth ... see!
