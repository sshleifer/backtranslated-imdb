It may not be fair to see most interesting reviews about the soprano and then add what people have forgotten, but well ....... <br /> <br /> From the point of view of acting, how can any actor fail with these characters ? Every one is mesmerizing and dense in their endeavors for life. Tony Soprano - While the mob was "Capo" and suffering from mental illness, he still sees his life in front of him and knows what to do to survive. Every one of his men, seeing their lives almost from within like a true form of voyerism. It certainly stands aside "curious" in all scenes, and I guarantee myself in this! <br /> <br /> While some of the above do not care about braco, I must say that this is the newest role they have had years since Good Fellas. It is next to Tony that makes him listen to the mind, makes him fit, and provides him with comfort when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for a long time, if any. She simply put it, his savior. (Do not speak in religious colors) <br /> <br /> But the performance of the knockout here is no doubt Eddie Falco. To see her role in prison guard in the other famous HBO series, "Oz" and then see it as Livia is the final courtesy to any actor or actress. I have exceeded the limits of the well-known actress, only something actresses such as Merle Streep can go unpunished. Type of chameleon quality to override the roles. But as I mentioned before, with such strong characters, how could any actor fail? <br /> <br /> The power of Livia is in her daily assertion of faith in herself. She is a survivor, hoping to have her husband and family survivors. She is prepared for the worst because she knows the dangers of her husband's work, yet she knows that her lifestyle is more than most of the women of Jersey. She is wise, if not more witty, in the street, then Tony himself. <br /> <br /> In general, the biggest crime of the Soprano family is that the viewer must wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This in my opinion is the worst thing in the HBO series. This was what made Larry Sanders' program, Sex and the City, Dream On, and others retreating to earth in popularity and killing them in the end. Very large space between the seasons and very sparse. Until then, I will see redirects in the hope of bridging this programming gap.
