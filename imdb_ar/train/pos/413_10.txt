This film is certainly not historically accurate but it is a wonderful entertainment. Most of DeMille's own photographs of the subsequent saga are slow and interrelated but the motion here moves in a clip. The story is basically a series of summits with very quiet moments. One of the best parts of the film with Jean Arthur is excellent as he tries to please the war-scarred indigenous people, followed by her and Cooper's transfer to the war and torture camp. Later came a long battle with Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous but fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this age and she is shining here.
