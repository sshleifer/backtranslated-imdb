I write this after seeing the ideal son at the Gay and Mardi Gras Film Festival 2002 in Sydney, Australia. Of the brothers die of AIDS, enter the warm-hearted journey of reconciliation. The two perform a wonderful task in creating the gradual warmth and respect that accumulates between them as the film progresses. I have one problem in the film - while the brother who dies is acting ill, he does not look like it. A person from 0 T4 cells may seem quite ill - not even a compensatory function to make the actor appear ill. The grip is small, but it makes it less realistic. However, The Perfect Son is a great movie and you should have a chance to see it. I wish the DVD version in the near future!
