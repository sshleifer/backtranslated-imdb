First, let me say that I did not like the fact that the rock won the title which is gay. I feel then that Regal had to regain his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy hero. Rob Van Dam has been named Intercontinental for a very long time and Brock had to win. I'm glad that Storm and Christianity Chambers, the best match was the game of T-Poker and Big Show in my opinion.
