Wow, this movie was very wonderful. I really do not know why everyone says that its a slow speed. I thought the pace was perfect. The film revolves around Michael Sullivan, performed by Tom Hanks, a killer of John Rooney (Paul Newman). He hates this work but he does it because Rooney pays for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children are unaware that this is his job, and when one sees a cold-blooded murder before him, he is placed in an awkward position. When atrocities occur, he leaves with his son and intends to take revenge. They steal jokes and much more and build bonds. They're the perfect team. Hanks does a wonderful job as always as well as Good Lo who plays his scary role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and shows pretty much how it was in the 1930s.
