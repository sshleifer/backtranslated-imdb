This episode of the Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with acting and acting films, a tribute to the early Buster Keaton films. Too much slap: the buster falls on the door of the barrier, falling into the pond, running around the pants less. The invention of a silly world of time helmet reminds us of the idea of ​​Flash Gordon for what the future will be. Cheap prices, such as $ 1.95 for women's hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef, seem too high for Buster. Even the 1890 world is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How horrific it was when it was mistakenly moved to the "modern" world of 1960! Buster was trying to go back! The "world" wanted to return to a calmer world in 1890, which he studied and admired. They have returned together, Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the "world" regrets the lack of electronic devices, modern beds or electric blankets. So Buster returns it with the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight message does not contain a heavy message. Since the death of Buster Keaton in 1966, this is one of his last efforts. its enough. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing, the long-untapped Manitag Man Jesse White, a reformer of the time helmet, presages his career in the washing machine.
