I watched the movie for the first time on the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good explanation for the person Conan Doyle, and I really wonder about the opinion of Sherlock fans about it. I also think it's a movie for those fans whether they agree or not to what is mentioned. You may ask yourself whether A.C was nevertheless the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much was a kind of autobiography? Nothing less than what I strongly put into this amendment, it's a movie you should watch - even if you're not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look for it, enjoy it yourself, and think about it.
