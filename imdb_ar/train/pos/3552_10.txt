I just want to add the value of my year, forgive me if I repeat something that has already been published, but I feel that it is worth reminding the people of Dungeon Ronnion who has always been. If it were not for the wonderful street, Damon Ronnon's writing for this film - and most of the other great classics dealing with gamblers and the like before 1960. Damon Ronnon was a journalist, was from Colorado, but he certainly did a street scene on the East Coast. If you are not a fan of Hollywood's old comedy, I recommend some other clicks from the writings of Demon Runyon; both "The Lemondrop" and "Miss Little Miss Marker," two of Bob Hope's films, who were always funny Policies. (Liberal West Coast, I find his policies somewhat laughable, too!) Damon Ronneon lives!
