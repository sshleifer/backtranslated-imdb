From "Last Seduction" and "Kill me again", comes another noir style. John Dal created a place for himself by producing films about adultery and extortion in the early 1990s. Although I did not have much of an opinion regarding past seduction. But for the time being, Mr. Dale has turned to the management of television programs. It is shameful that a man has talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This very impressive film revolves around a stray cage that comes in to the town of Wyoming to get a job. However, it does prove to be lucky and mistaken for a Texas businessman by the owner of the Gee Bar. T-Walsh. He was assigned to kill his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to split after taking the down payment without doing so. On his way out of town, he accidentally hit a man on the road and then returned to the local hospital. At that point, Cage accidentally met again with Walsh, who appeared to be the local police chief. After that, Cage escapes from his clutches but meets the real man who happens to be Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dale co-wrote and directed the film. Therefore, it appears that the project can turn into an appropriate situation when the director presents his ideas on the screen. The direction is of a good standard, but while watching the movie, I got an idea for a TV movie. There were plenty of tires close up. But this does not deter the film from being an enjoyable experience. The film was at a good pace and the structure was perfect. D wrote the program text with a good duration. <br /> <br /> Cage portrayed the role as physically slim, although his performance seemed to me somewhat restricted. His facial expressions were on the mark. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and took on her role as a Vim girl. Her hairstyle was far away and could make anyone kneel down on his knees. Hopper played his role well. But I feel it was a mistake in this role. He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a successful man. The role was not written with his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie, deja vu will get previous movies like "The Hot Spot" and "Perfect Perfect Murder". Because of the fact that some of the sub plots are similar. In general, if you are a fan of noir movies, this is good for you. Worth recommending. 10/07
