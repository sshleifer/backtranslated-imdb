Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read are "three hurt girls" in this 1936 world film, which introduces Deanna Durbin to the film audience. Ray Milland, Micha Oyer, Charles Wenninger, John King, Benny Barnes and Alice Brady also participate. It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with her divorced mother, who hears her father (Wenninger) remarry. Because they had not seen him for 10 years and did not know that their mother loved him, they went up to America with the help of a housekeeper / nanny designed to stop the wedding. The realization that the intended, called "precious" (Barnes) is only a gold digger with the help and instigation by her mother (Brady), they arrange to be introduced to the number of the wealthy. This is arranged by their father's accountant (king). The man of his choice is drunk full-time (Oyer), but the girls miss him in a real rich census (Miland). such a mess. <br /> <br /> This is a delightful film, I do not like or overburden at all, with some nice performances, especially by Auer, Miland, Barnes and Barade. The young women are beautiful and all of them do a good job. The focus, of course, is on young Durbin, a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice when I was younger was much larger than it would be in puberty - she had no problem with high tones, as she did later because she put great weight into the middle sound. Singing the song "Il Bacio" exhilarating at a police station. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful things in the film is the vision of the father, played by Charles Wenninger, who does not want his children - to see them. Barnes recognizes them as gold diggers. Not all of them are young, but the girls' mother seems to be on her way, so perhaps the conclusion is that the older man is looking for his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the young people he was looking for in his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal gives Durbin the big star you've acquired here - it has the last shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this stage was still paying his dues, and it would be so surprising to portray fans how young and attractive he was. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and of course, this led to the complement and great stardom of Diana.
