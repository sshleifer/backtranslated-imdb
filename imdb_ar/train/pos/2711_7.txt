When I think of "women in prison," my opinion often goes to Italian / Spanish production, which is being worn down by directors such as Jess Franco and Bruno Matte; although these films are often undesirable, they are also very similar and once seen; I have seen them all. I must admit that these types of films are not generally preferred; but in fact, the idea of ​​women behind bars has been implemented well on several occasions outside of Italy and Spain; Roger Korman New World Pictures is responsible for some of its best. Caged Heat is the first directed by Oscar-winning Jonathan Demi, a little flick with lots of entertainment value! Of course, the film focuses on the story of a girl being arrested who commits a crime and is sent to a women's prison where she is identified as a group of violent prisoners. This prison is governed by wheelchair stuff committed to McQueen supervisor. It offends a play staged by the girls; leads them to planning to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is much lighter than usual than usual for women in the jail flick; but this is more than compensated by some great motion scenes and dialogue that ensures Caged Heat enjoys all along. It must be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows the same structure as many other women in the prison films that were presented to it; but this is not a big problem. The film never becomes boring and is filled with prominent scenes, including trying to escape while working in a field and bank robbery. The film is assisted by directing the content of the man who will continue masterpiece masterpiece "Silence of the Lambs" and a host of actors; including the best of all legendary Barbara Steel in the role of prison chief director. In general, Caged Heat may not leave the viewer much to think about by the end; but it's a slightly grindhouse flick that's amusingly entertaining and anyone who enjoys this kind of movie definitely wants to track it down.
