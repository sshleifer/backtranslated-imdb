<br /> <br /> If you love rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you do not get references, as a direct comedy. <br /> <br /> You did not see much of CB4, but what I saw did not have the heart of this small storm. <br /> <br /> We have not heard from the people involved since then, which is a surprise. The movie is very similar to the Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think there is a lot of dialogue, while the priceless in Tap is the funniest here, probably because I rap more than the days of rock theses, so my opinion is doing a cloud That point. <br /> <br /> Rap songs are funny like hell, and are basically a reference to most of the film, not all of them in your face, meaning physical comedy and individual lines have the priority to take off. <br /> <br /> Great fun, one to watch twice if there's ever a movie.
