I first saw this film here in the UK in December 1989 when it was broadcast on Central Television. I still have a video, though worn out (over the years, borrowed by a lot of friends and family members, as it was cooled!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember going home that night, catching Christmas, lights out and watching what was advertised as the "Christmas Ghost Story". So far I remember some scenes that still send hair on my neck standing at the end ... <br /> <br /> I've seen some comments on the film saying it is not and not so ... I think these people are afraid by Friday the 13th The like, the leg, the drums, which are laughable. This is a traditional ghost story. There is no big work in the budget or special effects ... There is no swear, no blood, no sex scenes are unjustified, and there are no saws or pistols, etc. ... How to revive !! It's in the atmosphere. If you like scary horror, well written, and well behaved with a really scary atmosphere, this is the right movie for you. I love the original horrors; last night I just saw the original Haunting and this wonderful movie. Very atmospheric again - and also a "black woman". The end of the film differs from the book, but it is still very good. I highly recommend it. Try it ... * * You will like it if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... Turn off the lights, turn off the fire, close the doors, grab the drink ... and enjoy ...:)
