"The Ladies Man" is a common problem among films based on "Saturday Night Live" plays. This means that a drawing that usually works in five minutes will not work in ninety minutes. Although this film laughs, like Tim Meadows in the role of Leon Phelps, a sex obsessed directly from the seventies of the last century, Will Will Ferrell as a man obsessed with wrestling melts Leon. This movie is funny enough, but it is not a "World of Win"!
