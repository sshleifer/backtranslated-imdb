This show began with great mystery episodes. I think everyone in the first 15 or 16 episode. After that, the show began running short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo, and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20 minutes into short episodes. Some audio actors are unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Wilker (who played a unique role) became unavailable. I think the sound of a film changes after the first 12 episodes, because the first vocal actress played a film that was not available. <br /> <br /> The network ordered Hanna Barbera's studio to make more short films with Shaggy and Scooby doo Scrappy doo because the ratings were high. So they had to make more shorts. I wish they were puzzles like 15 episodes. Still is a good display.
