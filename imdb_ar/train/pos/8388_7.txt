Maria Brown is an extraordinary woman who is made fully and sincerely, despite being so obnoxious as to make her unbelievable. She will do her best to make her marriage work, including shameful opportunism and sexual manipulation. And thus under the outer surface of the guilt, reveal a system of sweet values. The film suffers from sudden and unexpected endings that then seem inadequate at all, with the familiar comfort when you finish your creative writing exercise at 'Wake Up'. It is also written on the other end by the most unusual title sequence I have ever seen, but do not let any of that delay you.
