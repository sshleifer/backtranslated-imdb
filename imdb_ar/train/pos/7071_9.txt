The paradoxes of time are the devil's ambush of the labor-deficient minds. It's fun to think of "What if?" Kind of way. This time and again filmmakers and authors have treated film and television collections, including Star Trek: First Contact, Back to the Future, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Groundhog Day and Stargate SG1 , "Window of opportunity". Heinlein wrote "All You Zombies" for decades, but will still revolve around people who read that short story for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, "12 Monkeys", it is difficult to determine what problems of continuity versus plot elements may be aimed at rethinking our concept of film. Frequent scenes will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some will see the film for the first time, Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a schizophrenic. Most of Cole will see him as a man annoyed by what Adams describes as "the continuing experience of experience" he has traveled through time. <br /> <br /> Unlike other travel stories over time, "monkeys" are not clear as to whether the history of the future can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Riley (Madeleine Stowe), that time can not be changed, but scientists intercepted a telephone call from the airport after his return to 1996, in his own personal plan. <br /> <br /> Even this can be interpreted as an event that must occur in a single temporal world, in order to ensure that the timeline does not change ... Cole must die before the eyes smaller than the soul to achieve destiny. If this is the case, time is like fluid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces it works on. It's a mind boggling to think about this kind of thing too much. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that direct the actions of those who have the ability to return people in time, as seen on the plane at the end of the film, this means that the future can be changed by manipulating past events. .. Or does it? The film may have led to many drunken fights in pubs frequented by physicists and athletes. <br /> <br /> The bonus material on the DVD is very interesting. Gilliam is under more pressure than usual to get the film out of the budget, which is not particularly surprising after the Monchausen disaster and his recent attempt to film Don Quixote. I would like to make the documentary "Industry" as one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. It is certainly not white and carefully monitors the difficulties and occasional conflicts that arise between the creators involved. Gilliam described the film as a "7 إصدار" version, because of the film written by another book - and therefore, not his "film" - really does not do justice to the film itself. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's photography of Gwen is interesting, although his character is not particularly sympathetic. He watched his walled eyes a little in a scene from the resort. It is disturbing and disturbing. <br /> <br /> It may have been a coincidence that Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" song was used at the end of the "The 12 Monkeys" and the last episode of the television series "The Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy. The British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' is a story of science fiction that will enjoy the same way as the mental stimulation of the chess game, it's not reckless recreation, that's for sure.
