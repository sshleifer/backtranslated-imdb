I sometimes feel weary of reading reviews of some lesser-known Hitchcock movies, because almost every film starts with someone who says that this movie has been grossly ignored or that it is a hidden Hitchcock essence or a real Hitchcock essence or some other common species - just - people - They - will - this - this - it - great - Hitchcock - movie - only - as much - as - as - vertigo - north - by - north - west - psycho - back - window - etc, however, I would just say That if - only - people - you will see - this - they - will - see - this - this - is - great - Hitchcock - film - exactly - - much - as in the roundabout - The north - by - the north - west - the psychological - the background - the window <br /> <br /> <br /> Now, this may exceed a bit, the circuit does not represent any scope of imagination even in the same period of any of those films mentioned above , But compared to other films made by Hitchcock in the late 1920s and early 1930s, I really think the T Ring is one of the best films filmed and performed most of them all. As a near-new director, there are some fascinating dream sequences and brilliant editing sequences that show why Hitchcock was interested in a lot of interest early in his career. <br /> <br /> It is recognized that the film begins, among other things. Things, the scene is very disturbing to the performance of the Black Cirque Circus (I use the idiot in a final way, as Stephen King often does) the presence of eggs and fruit thrown by a crowd of people are not the most elegant white-looking. I suppose this only shows how unbelievably different these circuses and people are from that time, but I think it's one of the most invincible serials in any Hitchcock movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction in the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to hit any man on a single tour, but when he meets his match, he is against a man who defies his power, not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger. Thus begins an entertaining, if not very tense, challenge to the love of a woman, who seems to be swaying from one man to another without effort and without thinking. <br /> <br /> There is, for example, a scene where her husband watches from the top as she leaves the house late at night, and before going directly to the building, she is persuaded to return to the car to kiss her. This kiss is never explained at all, and there is also the fact that, even in the end when she proves her loyalty to her husband, or at least eventually chooses him, they look at each other's eyes but they do not actually accept. <br /> <br /> The movie was certainly beautifully filmed, even more than many of the films that Hitch released in subsequent years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as a coach for one tour, which reminds me of his expressive stone often with the brilliant Keaton Paster. The obstacle leaves it a bit vague, but this is a wonderful sample of his early work.
