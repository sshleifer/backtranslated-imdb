Strong B movie. <br /> <br /> I love Jake Weber. His reduced delivery is refreshing at the time of most of the top performances. I loved the relationship between father and son. I loved the family dynamics. Wendigo looks silly, but it represents a child's game and dead deer. It's a merger like, you see? This is a psychological story, not Freddy's slippery flicker of instant gratification. Watching and meditating in your child's inner and what the film might say to you will be fine. <br /> <br /> Great work.
