You should enjoy this lighthearted comedy to get entertainment value. It becomes hysterically funny at times, but if you do not spend any time on this side of the tracks, you will miss comedy when it breaks out. <br /> <br /> The group of characters blends well together very reasonably in their roles. How Grace dealt with her dead husband friend played well. She is a real lady. My favorite is the white Grace suit you wear. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this person to anyone who wants to laugh out loud or cheer for the loser or just want to see something different.
