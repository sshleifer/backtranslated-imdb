First off I admire Modesty's, I've been reading storyboards since I was a kid, and previous films have found our heroines unsatisfactory, but where these rocks failed! <br /> <br /> Well, here we are: Mrs. Blaise is working in a casino, and a band of thieves is starting to gamble for the life of her friends. If the thief won one tour, she would have to tell him herself. If you win twice in a row, a staff member becomes free. (It seems stupid, yes, well, I'm not good at explaining either.); <br /> <br /> Tell him about his growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about helping an old man in a refugee camp and how to escape, They live according to the rules of nature. They look for food, teach them to read and fight. As they approach civilization, they become embroiled in war, and when they are driven into rebellion, they are shot and the old man dies, leaving her to meet the city herself. <br /> <br /> Then you meet the man in the casino, and the story ends. <br /> <br /> What needs to be followed is that there is great fighting and the lines are absolutely fantastic. Alexandra Staden is a Belize modesty game! Just as humble and strong, agile and intellectual as a comedian. <br /> <br /> It seems embarrassing, also listening to humility speaking in a slightly broken tone, but this is inappropriate because the comic book is unable to speak out loud, but certainly a tone must exist to some extent. (Not to mention that it is strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans ..) <br /> <br /> The representation is really good, even the child who embodies the young Belizean should be applauded! <br /> <br /> My favorite part is to tear up her dress to kick the stupid thief ass! totally awesome! : D I can not wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie / movies! <br /> <br /> Watch them, you will not be disappointed!
