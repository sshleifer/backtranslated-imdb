This movie resonates with me on two levels. When I was a child, I was evacuated from London and planted on an unwilling host in a rural village. As I escaped from the bombardment and had experiences that brought me fond memories (for example, I heard a passionate night singing a dark night for the first time) and enjoyed a life I could not get in London, I missed my family and worried. Tom is an old man whose wife and son have died and live alone in a small rural village. As an old man now without a wife who married her children and lives away in another province, I feel lonely again at some point. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic and has very strange ideas about raising a child. Due to the growing affection between old Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom is looking for him and finally rescues him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story, there is great tension because because of some bureaucratic rule, it seems that the child will lose someone who has developed a love relationship with him.
