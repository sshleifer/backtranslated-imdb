Harem Bracelet is the best movie I've seen in the year 2000. Bravo Farzan Your Oz. Harem Suare is a bold and amazingly stunning film that depicts an interracial love story, a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors, complete the film. Insulated from the outside world, women entertain each other by narrating stories about conspiracies, rivalry and jealousy within their ranks.
