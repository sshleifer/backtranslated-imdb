What is the percentage of movies a person goes to these days that leave him wondering what happened to eight to ten dollars? Answer: Too many! This film is not so. It's a story about real people who are sometimes a mixture of both the likes and dislikes. <br /> <br /> Downside: <br /> <br /> There is not enough character development and some of the lines that have been left twisted in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upside: <br /> <br /> People are forced to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their lives. <br /> <br /> Acted well: Scott Cohen Hersh, Susan Floyd, Atto Isandoh and Elliot Kurt. <br /> <br /> Contains some good humor.
