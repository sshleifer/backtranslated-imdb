This wonderful movie takes a non-stop click for several hours to fully appreciate. Music performances by Busby Berkeley will not be repeated. I think this film easily outperforms all his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Kenny do not believe together. Some humor will push the boundaries of movies almost today. Put a logical explanation of how they do it aside and enjoy the scene it is.
