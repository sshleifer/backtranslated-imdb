This movie is horrible - in a very bad "good" way. <br /> <br /> The film has been rewritten from many other films of this kind, so I will not be bothered to describe it. It is a picture of the sword / sorcery, and it has a child hoping to realize its importance in this world, and has a adventurer "Badawi", and assistant / witch evil, princess, and creature hair .... Get this point br /> <br /> It was the first time In which I shoot this film during the very harsh winter. I do not know why I decided to keep watching it for another five minutes before running the channel, but when I discovered the location of Gulfax, I decided to stay and watch it till the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white furry creature resembling Chewbacca, but it is not useful or fun to watch. It looks like someone pasted a bunch of shaggy white carpet together and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes that look like the actor can not move from inside, or he almost falls. Although it is not in the film very much, only a few scenes are worth the effort! He watched his attempt to talk to Bo Svenson, where the comparison of Solo-Chewbacca reached a higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this movie because of that character, and I still have somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may seem like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I have never seen a sequel, or even sought out, was because of his absence! Maybe there should be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will achieve a much anticipated return!
