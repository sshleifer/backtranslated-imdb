If you're a fan of noir and think they do not make it, here's your answer - you no longer make it in Hollywood anymore. We must go to the French to remember how such a film could be satisfactory, accurate and wonderful. Read My Lips is a very bad small gift for the faithful of Jacques Audiard, and includes a great novel and performances by Emmanuel Devos and Vincent Cassell. <br /> <br /> The basic plot could be written in the 1940s: mute but ex-con con and fatale femme clever but david (who turned out to be ruthless ambition) discover each other while living a life of despair and gloomy nostalgia , Manipulate each other to achieve their own ends, develop a complex love / hate relationship, cook up a criminal scheme that includes theft, double intersections, close calls and lots of money. All procedures occur in places of depression and / or abnormal and / or poor lighting. <br /> <br /> Audiard has formulated some modern transformations, of course. Femme fatale is an unappreciated office worker who speaks of being almost deaf and using her ability to read lips to avenge those who marginalize her. Where you might expect lively scenes of love, you discover that both cases are awkward and immature. Add a little modern technology and music and it seems to be a contemporary film, but make no mistake - this is an old film in the old school. It's as good as any movie of this kind and easily one of the best movies I have seen all year.
