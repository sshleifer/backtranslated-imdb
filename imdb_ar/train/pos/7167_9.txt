I could not stop commenting after reading the short comment "Not bad". This movie is much better than not bad. The acting is wonderful, even from the kids on the staff, who do not play gently or anything else but act like my son's friends. The film is intelligent and is expected to be public as well. The lines of the dual flash story are fictional and contribute to the story rather than as a filler of time. I watched this movie with my children and then saw it again a few days later. If you have children and have been sick to death by the movies that inspire diabetic coma with sweetness of syrup, then check out "holes". I enjoyed my 6-year-old daughter just like my 11-year-old, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as I did. How many movies can you say?
