I often wonder why this series was criticized a lot. I thought it was fantastic as well as very intelligently written and performed. I think that in due course it will appear in the light of what he deserves, that is, if they issue it. Many young comedians appeared in this, and they all followed more. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and must be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Big and Peter Serafinovic, not least Julian Rind Tut of the highly successful green wing, writers Graham Linhan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comic books of modern times. Anyone who can produce a comedy like Father Ted can not write something that is not worth publishing. If ever released you'll definitely buy it.
