Slaughtered high for a boy named Marty. He was harassed and picked up in high school. A group of kids played a lot of pranks on it, and these pranks were very bad. The joke of the past ended tragically. <br /> <br /> Cue to 5 years later. The children's gang meets again for reunion. One of them prepared it in the old high school. The school has now been abandoned, and it has to break into. For some reason, Janitor still exists, but he asks them to go ahead and have fun because they offer him beer. <br /> <br /> Partying, looking at their old coffins, they see something of Marty. One girl feels sorry for Marty, but another man calms her down. <br /> <br /> Once the killings begin, they become wonderful. All he kills is creative and glory. See a character in the clown's mask, hunting them one by one throughout the school. Marty seems to have returned to exact revenge. After the first person is killed, they discover that they are locked up in school. They start looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now, there are a number of irrational things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a 5 year reunion. Second, after the death of the first child, a girl is torn by blood. They all run in panic, but they run to the bathroom and find a bathtub. I killed a friend of Hrr just, and decided to take a bath !? More importantly, why is there a bathtub in the school bathroom. In any case, the bathtub does not seem to really work .... It has died horribly and it is a movie from the 1980s. It is bitter and terrifying. Who cares if he has some illogical parts. I'm nobody. This film has really great mortality. The end .... there is evolution. After I saw the tension recently, I compare the two. The only way they are similar is that there is a shift, which kind of left me disappointed ... And then, comes a wonderful, if not the best, movie in the film. <br /> <br /> After the last murder, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy, and that was the best way to end the movie. I've gone "Wow ..."
