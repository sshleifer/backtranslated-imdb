First of all, I would like to say that I am Portuguese and it is not usual to spend my time watching Portuguese films, maybe one film every year or even nothing ... <br /> <br /> The reason is the almost general idea among the people Portuguese that the national photos are very bad, and they are very close to the worst at all! However, in the last decade, it started to surprise me when we recall the funny 1940s when "Leão da Estrela" was one of the best worlds of his time, with films such as "Pulsação Zero" "Sorte Nula" Fragata is also with some common music and actors. <br /> <br /> This film is also good, not the same kind because it is not a real comedy; in fact, it's officially a drama, a drama for women that contains unexpected funny parts, or because of fun characters or funny things that happen to them, Such as default travel to the Caribbean just to put it. The plot works and can surprise us several times; the actors are fine, and the regular sites are like the result; but the fact is that everything is logical, then we can consider it a great effort for national cinema, and it seems to have started out of ashes like phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese movie, surely you can take a better choice, but it is still better to measure it.
