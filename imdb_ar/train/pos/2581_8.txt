People are hard on the film. Sometimes, we must sit down and enjoy the story without trying to "revise" it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his goal is still falling. Then the fun begins as everyone "collapses" too. <br /> <br /> Just think of JFK and all the people associated with any way to assassinate him, whose life ended abruptly and in dubious ways, and would be grateful for what is implied in this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's an excellent explanation of what might happen. Although the exact line of the story did not follow me (it is too late here after Jim Maars read "Crossfire"), this implies that it is important. <br /> <br /> I would like a copy of it to see it again. In the light of what is known today, the domino principle is right.
