I lost my father at a very young age. So in fact, I did not remember him. Over the years I learned a lot about him. One of these things was that he loved the West, and he was watching Bonanza every evening one of his absolute rites for him. I personally remember the end of the series, where I was 8 years old when the show stopped in 1973. Watching this program over the years makes me closer to my long-lost father. He has all the right elements to make the show successful; laughter, tears, the edge of your suspended seat , And has sometimes irritated you. The anniversary of the original exhibition, shortly after the death of beloved Cartwright "Hoss", Dan Blocker. In a certain episode, the end of the final appropriations, the image of the Blocker flashed, faded to black, and I can also recall my older sister who was tearing her eyes in the sight of this. I can remember this as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say it is the same, we love Bonanza. Long live Cartwrights.
