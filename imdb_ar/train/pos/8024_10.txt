When I first saw this film in the 1980s, I was in my middle teens and was somewhat reluctant to see this since I considered myself grown up and out of the Sesame Street / Puppet Theater era. Frankly I do not remember whether I liked him at that time or not. However, somewhere in college, I watched this movie again and ended up (and staying) in my "Best Films Ever" collection. <br /> <br /> This movie was loaded with a sense of humor that goes far beyond what was expected of the puppets. I mean, it is clear that the puppet movement has always been appealing to adults and children because there is humor directed at both generations. But come on ... Janice heard it by mistake and he says to someone, "I do not take off my clothes for anyone, even if it's technically" ... there's a joke from father to son if the son loves Kermit the frog and then the father does not want to hear it .. Gonzo saves a chicken with resuscitation from mouth to mouth (sp?) And then says "I think we are sharing now" ... these and many other moments in the film I had rolling. Add to that the most intelligent dialogue, the very smart New York / Broadway humor "wink wink", the usual large quantity of celebrity celebrities and some really fun songs that do not match the "Cheesy Children's Level" at all ... This movie is a masterpiece! I do not get rid of the number "10" regularly ... but it's worth it. After more than 20 years, this film stood up perfectly, perhaps more. Muppets have never been and never will be again, they are funny, smart and shiny just like this movie was and still is. --- Q
