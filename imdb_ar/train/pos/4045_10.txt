I'm very happy because I got a chance to see this rare little jewel for a movie. I saw him at an independent film festival, so do not expect to come to your town any time soon. During the film, I noticed that about 10 people wake up and go out. Too bad for them (here in the south, people do not like having to read translations). The film begins slowly, but it is so rich in dialogue that I never feel bored. When the procedure finally arrived, I found myself attached to the screen as if I were riding a rotary ship. <br /> <br /> You also got a big kick from the "Chapter Titles" that appear in front of the chapters, especially those that show the characters as they appear on the screen. Zelda (Ocarina of Time) reminded me when faced with level leaders. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "video games / comic books", I welcome them.
