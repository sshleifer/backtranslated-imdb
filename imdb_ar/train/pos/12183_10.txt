One reviewer points out that it does not matter what Welles is saying or does, that he is moving to you. I agree. It was still a unique force in the film. More than just a triple threat that he can act, write and direct, he had a uniquely suited genius for photography. One can think about whether at an early age he was a painter. This film certainly enhances this impression. Musician, theater actor, heir to Shakespeare? Hard to say but I am so grateful that his time cam with the movie and that he has been caught in the film. I love the tone. I love the face, size, elegance, mind and games. I love all his films and hope there will be more. I particularly like how other actors interacted with him in the film. Not many were better off or at least different with him because at least he was there. Even in the end when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps by his own intention, it was impossible to ignore him and make every scene he had. Rita was a fantastic blonde - Lana Turner's look alike but perhaps even more beautiful eyes are turning to Wales and one wishes for another moment and another film and another hour at his company. That is why we all hope that we can face the missing clips from his films because we all know that there is no part of it that does not deserve our time. Watch it and be grateful for the opportunity.
