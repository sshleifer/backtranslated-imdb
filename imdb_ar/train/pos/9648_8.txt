I liked this movie so much the story jumps back and forth a bit and is not easy to follow. There is no solution to the story at all, leaving you to wonder what actually happened. Since I loved this kind of movies I enjoyed this. Especially as I like the scenes of "dating" among the children and attracted to their lives. Of course, any movie with naked Staffan Redo will get a few extra points. ;-)
