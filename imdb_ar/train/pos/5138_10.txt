In 1994, I spent a long vacation around July 4th - about 17 consecutive days with a two week vacation, weekend and the same holiday. I stayed in the city during that time, so I was hanging around my parents house very much. <br /> <br /> I did not have a TV in my apartment, so I used to watch my father's tube. I had just finished viewing part of X files when I started a program called Personal FX. I was hooked immediately. I have always been fascinated by the elements in our home that came from my parents 'family homes and through inheritance from relatives' properties, and I often wondered about their history, value, etc. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks' home in my lunch hours just to catch my personal FX. <br /> <br /> I can remember one episode in which co-host Claire Carter announced that a New York apartment that was filmed was updated and that once the renovations were completed, Personl FX would return to the air. <br /> <br /> This has never happened! FX was the first and best among the collectible offers. And disappeared from the air! Fifteen years later, I still feel pain. <br /> <br /> The way to go, FX.
