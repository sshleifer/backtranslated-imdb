Eddie Murphy Delerious is by far the most extreme thing you'll see in your life. You can compare it with any movie, and I will decide that the Delirious movie is the most extreme film ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and throughout that time, there was hardly a moment when I did not laugh at them. You will laugh for hours after it is over, and re-run the punching lines repeatedly in your head. Eddie Murphy has made many funny shows throughout his career (48 hours, commercial places, Beverly Hills Cobb, Rao, coming to America, Professor Josie, partner, etc.), but these are by far his most famous moment. I've seen this movie several times and it's funnier every time. Never lose its limit. From this day onwards, every outstanding performance will be emulated in the Delirious game. ***** and two thumbs!
