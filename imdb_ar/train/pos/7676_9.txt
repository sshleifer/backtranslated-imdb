brilliant! My wife and I joined the huge line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the film, I can understand why there is such a long line. Holly is an impressive story about an impossible relationship between two people. She is a small girl, a worn-out western. Take the film every bone in the body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that is hard to see - it's the surreal life that really leads you. The film was filmed beautifully. Among other things, we liked the scene where Patrick Holly teaches a small motorcycle ride. The toughness of Thuy Nguyen (I can not believe this is her first acting post) and Ron Livingston's performance with me stayed for two days. Highly recommended.
