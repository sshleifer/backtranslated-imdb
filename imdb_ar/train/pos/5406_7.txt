The fourth Pokemon movie made me cry when Sylby died. Do not dare say that Pokemon sucks! I do not like it when people say it .... I have loved Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please say that Pokemon is wonderful and must be enjoyed by people of all ages. Also, why does Pokemon give low ratings to all or most Pokemon movies? I do not understand .... they should not do it ... There is no reason why people should not vote without just proving that Pokemon is absorbed by the fact: 1) Pokemon for young children only. 2) The stupid Pokemon. And 3) people should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
