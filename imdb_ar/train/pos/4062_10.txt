I realized that I have been using IMDb for years and have not reviewed my favorite film. Preferably, I do not mean anything I liked right now, I mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there's no other animation experience you'll touch. This is clear because I will never be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early 1990s. I was 12 years old, the age group targeted by this film, I am also a male, the sex that this film aims at (the vast majority of female Miyazaki heroes). So this film inspired the indelible psyche of my childhood and I owe forever to Carl Masque (sp?) For the production of the English film for this film which far outweighs the production of Di $ ney which is not funny - I have never been able to see this translated title of course is The only way eventually, however, the Macek version is very good (the sounds correspond exactly to the original Japanese actors) with this version available on the Japanese DVD! Not available in any distribution in an English speaking country. Go to figure. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of reviews, so I will put some trivia here, and I'm not the final archive of information for this movie. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are in their own league, making the catalog almost entirely on IMDb combined pretty pale. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of this film is that Miyazaki has set up the countryside around Raven Seljun (Paso town area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 1980s (possibly in the late 1970s) just after one of the major mining strikes. As a strong supporter of socialist student movements in the 1960s, he felt their plight. Fighting between city dwellers and pirates initially serves to illustrate this sympathy with the working man. The countryside and clouds, especially in this film, remind me of the place where I grew up, where the film depicts a fictional version of rolling hills in the West British Isles in the Midwest. <br /> <br /> The island is of course a Swift genius satire. The novel of the 18th century - the story in the book Swift is, deliberately, silly. In Castle in The Sky, Miyazaki weaves between legends like Atlantis and the Tower of Babylon - I think the architecture is also based on the Peruvian monuments. Although I'm not sure, someone told me that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who enjoys reading this review and who really likes this movie will want to check out the Miyazaki epic series Miraye Shunnen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short science fiction novel "The Incredible Tide" by Alexander Kay on the Internet ). Conan is basically a model of Paso Laputta and Chita. In addition, you may not be familiar with his previous work for Masterpiece Theater - some animation of the main frame. He also has a key frame for Sherlock Hound - and this has some of the best backgrounds I've seen too. Also check out the film "Horus Prince of the Sun" (1968) in Miyazaki and Takahata, which is stunning today's standards in reality. What ... Gush The Celest and The Flying Ghost Ship - though very rare. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a gift, I do not know what we will do without it with everyone this is another nonsense story around it, and this is like an oasis. Arigato Miyazaki Sensei!
