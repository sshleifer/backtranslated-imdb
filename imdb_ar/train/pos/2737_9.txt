The film was dominated from start to finish and his photography in the heart of the United States is stunning. We feel we are there with them when they cross this country into a big sky then to Mexico and back to America again. Near the end of the film, the rain reflection on Robert Blake looks like a small stream of sweat and tears roll over his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairs until the last minute. <br /> <br /> The criminals played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, such as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, can be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with the stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town. This point was illustrated in the film, and we were always amazed that the criminals did not differ in appearance from anyone else. Evil, even the saints, is part of the human condition. These two imaginary men kill an entire family, searching for a safe place that does not exist. As soon as they escape, they begin to write bad checks and make a path for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many supporting actors. John Forsyth loved the case's investigator, Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer shines in a short but excellent scene as a trial lawyer. <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch this movie all the time, after I only caught it in short pictures; I finally got it after buying a DVD. The result is the coolest classic crime film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this wonderful movie. For me, this is what the wonderful film industry is all about.
