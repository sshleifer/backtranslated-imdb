The only reason I saw this film was for Jimmy Fallon, who was shocked by the ninth grade, and who was his first year on the SNL. I am a hardy Yankees fan, and I did not find the film painful until the last 15 minutes, when they start showing clips from the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small voices so I could not hear what should not be heard, but otherwise it was quite possible. <br /> <br /> I think Jimmy played the role well, the character was supposed to be nervous and weird, a nervous and strange man. I know it may not be an Oscar-winning extension, but the film is just a light, fun and romantic comedy that is really appropriate for both men and women. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked together well and had a much better chemistry on the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this stupid film? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive life in front of him, and thank God, because a taxi could have killed her. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone must stop criticizing his acting ability because he is just starting out in films. I imagine it should be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you'll see that they started in some twists. Busom friends? Australian soap operas? Here he wishes Jimmy a successful career on the screen. I never wanted to leave SNL but what can you do?
