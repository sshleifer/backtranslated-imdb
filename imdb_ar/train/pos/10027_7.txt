Certainly, Titanic was a good film, the first time you see it, but you should see it again and it will definitely change your mind in the film. The first time you watch the movie you see the basic love story and think: Oh, how romantic it is. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks about it), it's just annoying as you sit there watching the movie as he thinks, when will this ship sink d ** n ??? Even this is not impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but it certainly is not great either. Were you happy because DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this film, I mean who is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He is doing a good half-film and will not make a film for less than $ 20 million. And then, everyone was surprised that almost no movies with him. But enough, in my eyes, the worst character in the film. The performance of Kate Winslet on the other hand was fantastic. I also think the director is very talented in putting a film of such a big size. There is one lesson to learn about this film: There are so many love stories as they are, filmmakers should not try to add a love story to every single movie !!! Out of 100% possible this movie was given just 71%.
