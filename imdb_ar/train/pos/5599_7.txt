This was the second time I saw the film (through the French version, unlike the first version, which was named in Italian) and I feel it is improving in subsequent performances. <br /> <br /> An appealing saying if it is slowly built - studying characters that were beautifully photographed with the Parisian setting equally impressive. In the long run, Polanski was not first class, and I would rank him ninth in his film, but he is still a confident mix of chills, ingenuity, and often surprisingly wide comedy. It's also a great game, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvin Douglas and Joe Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I feel a bit puzzled by Treklovsky's sudden compulsion to "change" the former tenant; regardless of the owner of the cafe opposite the apartment building, where Simon was given everything without asking him if he wanted In anything different, there is little to indicate (as much as I can distinguish, anyway) that this is what everyone else is required of! Well, then he found that Simon's purposes were still lying in the apartment, but what exactly made him wear her clothes and make herself (even if he seemed to be unconsciously doing so)? After seeing the nightmares in the bathroom, the last part of the film (where Adjani disappears) is anti-climatic robbery - especially the scene where the owner and other tenants witness suicide as if it were a night at the opera, a concept he had already used 46 years ago. In The Blood of A Poet (1930)! <br /> <br /> The end, in the end, is predictable and unresolved: just what made occupants of this apartment especially jump out of the window ?! I remember this factor that bothers me when I first watch too, and I regret to say that it is not clearer now! Keep in mind that the first two-thirds of the film is fairly strong, but I hope Polanski is less dependent on the mysterious plot points all the time.
