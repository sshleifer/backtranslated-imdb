Have you ever been in your life, engaged in sports activity, tried to do your best, and then found yourself in an important part, where I gave a brief moment the opportunity to be a hero and a hero. . . Failure? I think many of us have passed that moment in our lives. This is the introduction to the film "Best Times". In this story, a middle-aged banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) suffers from deep sadness at the football mistake, which happened years ago, and is an inspiration to re-play the game. . one more time. In order to achieve this, he must convince the great football player once, Renault Haitauer (Kurt Russell) to return. For Renault, who is satisfied with his current life, there is no need to change the previous record, which improves with age. Add to their problem the fact that the years have passed, in addition to that their marriages stumble and need to be re-fed. It was not easy when his father (Donald Moffat) routinely reminded him of the biggest drop. However, Dundee is permanent and will do anything to try to correct the biggest mistake of his life. Great fun for anyone who wants to enjoy their youth again. ***
