I really liked the first 2 seasons. Because a lot of good characters disappeared later. Like most presentations are rather slow at first and then improve in subsequent seasons, but this is quite the opposite. Jenny was from Season 1 and Valerie from the second season of Sabrina's friends, and I was not interested in others. Jenny and Valerie were some of her best friends. For some reason, I think the producers wanted us not to love college friends for some reason. They were hard on Sabrina. But the favorite episode of the first season is the showdown with cats and my favorite dessert of season 2 is the charming trash, the furthest episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and she never had a real friend but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I wish they could have made better ones. I also liked how the first and second chapters, during the opening credits, Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume, as in the experimental episode where she was wearing a charming costume, I liked how she said "This is not me too" and later still trying to change Itself to something else, but this is a truly wonderful show. It's kind of like Andy Griffith's presentation in a good way because at first but once the color shifted and Barney left to left, it was good. But I still love watching it, but the only reason I see it later is the Spearna seasons. What I meant about the opening sequence is: the opening titles of season 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror showing many different costumes and clothes as the names of the cast members flashed quickly on the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina will say a bit of a fairy about the outfit she wears, and then disappear. The opening sequence of Season 4 includes characters in bubbles. The opening credits for season 5-7 include Sabrina at various locations around Boston
