John Zhao, of Inspector Inspector Morse, plays the role of Tom Oakley in this old film. Tom lives in a small English village during 1939 and the beginning of World War II. A little bit of recoil, Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son during his service during the First World War. If you can imagine Inspector Morse old and retired, weak like a crochet when he was a cop, you'll get a character Tom Oakley. <br /> <br /> However, this heart of flint is about to melt. London children are evacuated before the attack begins. Young William (Willie) Beach Crashed with Tom the Protester. Nick Willy plays a good role by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs to take care of Capital C. Behind the school, he is still wetting the bed and can not read his smallest problems. It came from a shocking background in London, with or can not overcome, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Slowly and steadily, a man and boy are warm with each other. Tom once again discovers his ability to love and care. The boy learns to accept this love and care. Tom and Willie build a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. See Willy's delight in what is likely to be Tom's first ever birthday party. <br /> <br /> Do not give up the end, but Willie was adopted by Tom after a big fight, and the couple begin a new life much richer for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson follow a long series of films where men meet boys and develop mutual love. The late Dirk Bogard and John Whitley watched the Spanish Gardener. Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angelite in "Started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in Captains Courageous. Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in The Man without a Face. <br /> <br /> Two important points. This is the only glacial appearance I know in terms of singing. Only a verse of the Hymn, New Jerusalem, but it sings. <br /> <br /> Second, a young man Robinson also starred in a second film, "Tom" in the title "Tombs Midnight Garden," which is based on the classic children's novel.
