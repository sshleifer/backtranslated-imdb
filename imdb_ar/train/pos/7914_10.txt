I may have seen this film for the first time since 1995. Since then I have come back to it several times. it's great! I particularly like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization rise." Wonderful! This was very impressive in CG animation days. CG is older than me, as I know Tron made 7 years ago. But it was a milestone in the early 1990s. Perhaps it was the first collaboration between the various CG experiments that were tuned to the music. I love it so much, I think I'll go watch it now. Good-bye
