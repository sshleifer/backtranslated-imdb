Tachiguichi Ritsudin <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshi Featuring: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Haidu, Kenji Kauai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Tirada, Narrated by Koichi Yamadera - ----- --------------------------------- <br /> <br /> In 1995 Mamoru Oshi launched an animated film "Ghost In The Shell", which helped cement the international acceptance of anime - and the Andy And Larry Wachowski comprehensive concept of The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The sequel, Innocence (2004), was the first Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or in Cannes, leaving the heads around its style and innovative effects as in its incomprehensible plot. <br /> <br /> Always, Oshii has now provided us with Tachigui: The Amazing Lives of the Fast Food Grifters ?? Which has nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor Japanese anime in this regard. <br /> <br /> Say hi to the creation of Oshii "superlivemation": not quite animated, or completely live animation. Instead, the mold is carried somewhere near 30,000 shots, which have been digitally processed and reconstructed in a deceptive fashion style reminiscent of worn-out toys. The movement itself is a zigzag style and position of motion reflecting the chain echoes of the book Tetsuo: Iron Man demo of Shinya Tsukamoto (1988). <br /> <br /> "I could not think of any way but that way," Oishi said in a recent interview with Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> Team selection is equally ambiguous. Kenji Kauai, who has also written the high-pitched soundtrack, seems to be arrogant and arrogant, while the famous Gibli studio producer Toshio Suzuki spends his screen time killing oddly. Among them are Katsuya Tirada, who made fun of Oshii on Blood: The Last Vampire and Shinji Higuchi - the special effects on Godzilla's films. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's novel looks like a dry NHK documentary. ?? Which contrasts with the comedian here as well as Yamadera's extensive career to express elegant cartoon characters such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy's Peep. <br /> <br /> The same plot is a re-imagining of post-World War II Japan in the context of many fast food - from the Soba Ramen to the Gidon stand-up bars; American dogs in the small-shop heating trays to burger-inspired chain restaurants McDonald's. "Food is the root of desire," Oshi stressed, by way of interpretation. <br /> <br /> The new mix is ​​a new mix of consumers: fast-food owners of this title, people who do not like to pay for their work and constantly improve their complex frauds to score free snacks. <br /> <br /> Oishi said that the hidden motive is to honor the "art" of eating in the streets? Is still regarded as something of taboo in this country, which explains the use of "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> Avalon, Stray Dog, and animation, Oshii often spoils the definition between the two arguments. The result of celluloid is deposited here somewhere in the gray area between the two coordinates. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experience here is as exhilarating as it can be. Do not just ask what is supposed to mean? The Auchi films, which are equal and innovative parts, are often not clear. Where does Oshi succeed through a liberal dose of black humor? Here you'll find Kentucky Fried Rat, Death of Hula Hoop, the fastest chef in the world's samurai? And in the nature of the real film of Surrealism. <br /> <br /> This is the man who is lagging behind the influence of filmmakers such as Godard and Tropot, and may owe to Andrei Tarkovsky as much as David Lynch. So it should not come as a surprise that the B-52 bomber at one stage makes a flight in Yoshinoya. It seems that the 54-year-old writer and director thinks this is normal. "Japan portrayed in the film may not necessarily be true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
