I have seen this movie several times and for my life, I can not understand why some people compare this to BABE. This film does not revolve around the secret life of all animals that can speak in secret. Instead, it's about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a young girl with a dangerous motor, overcome her speech impediment just to be separated from her in a heart-beating scene early on. Then the great journey begins. Paulie starts the Parrot in an attempt to find his great friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he meets many wonderful people and many bad people. A girl falls in love with a parrot and loses it. He is deceived by a decent life and then picked up by a bad world who wants to exploit it. <br /> <br /> Tells his story to a sympathetic genet in the lab agreeing to help him escape and find his lover. Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shlop shines as a gentle gentleman with an open mind and a big heart who decides to help small Paulie despite the risks. Jay Moher plays the voice of the parrot and one of the vile characters he encounters. <br /> <br /> There is a little animating language but this movie is suitable for most children and even more so if parents join to the fun and watch too. It is a story of clever, smart and intelligent adventure, and ultimately a wonderful love story about a bird and its little girls. He's looking for Marie ends up with an unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen wild green parrot tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will benefit from watching this film and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable pets. All children everywhere will see that pets are deeply attached to themselves, and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift that you should cherish. <br /> <br /> So there is no child here, more than an amazing journey with a twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to tear during the sad parts.
