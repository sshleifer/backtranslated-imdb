Riding the Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary follows the history of surfing and follows three other well-known and well-known surfer movies, Dana Brown, Endless Summer, and Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son, and Step in Liquid (IMAX) ). I saw first, not others. <br /> <br /> Although the surf footage is amazing, I appreciate most of the filmmaker's historical perspective. It brings us back to the origins of sport for almost a hundred years, and shows how it evolved into its present form. This includes extensive interviews with prominent personalities and performers, and how the skateboards over time have changed. The beaches of Hawaii and California have been the most frequented by world-class surfers, and they are astounded by the amazing adrenaline given them by the sport. Athletes lived for months at a time on beaches, surfing from dawn to dusk, their camps on primitive sidewalks, hunting for food, and went out on their plates the next day. What a delightful way to spend the days of your youth. <br /> <br /> See how the media discovered this sport and promoted it after a slow start. What is the biggest push for this sport? Believe it or not, it was Gidget, although I doubt that copyright issues may prevent you from adding Beachboys songs like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing magazine and Surfing Encyclopedia (who knew there was such a large number) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from sports leaders and their families, and how the current generation of creators benefited in the 1960s. One of these stories is how Laird Hamilton, 40, who is considered the most exalted of the waves today, associated with the former surfer, introduced him to his only mother, whom he married before he became his father. <br /> <br /> The exciting background story of contemporary music of all ages accompanies the story. Do you sharpen your appetite? Wonderful. Enjoy a wonderful trip.
