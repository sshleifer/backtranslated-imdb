Good view of the work, but nothing new. This one happened in the mountains, which showed some beautiful scenery as well. One man takes a group of mercenaries, leads lead, and hits the butt. It was called "Rambo goes to the Rocky Mountains" and it was pat. She had one very effective scene directly in the first film that made me terrified. Not a bad picture, but only himself, OL saw himself.
