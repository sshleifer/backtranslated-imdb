I love this movie too. I saw it when it was first introduced on the i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was very crowded and the atmosphere was very ambitious. The thriller hit viewers and the discussion with Moritz Buerner remained the producer and director who was always stressed. In this type of film, it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it is an independent film. <br /> <br /> Much of this film was not present. Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and made two or two films. Three other short films worked for television also before becoming a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For people who want to watch this movie again, you can find it on their home page which is not so easy to find but possible.
