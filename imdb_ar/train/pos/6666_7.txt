I can not say that this movie is worth anywhere near the amount of vitriol that is spoiled by some reviewers. Yes, he is steeped in excessive running time, stumbling editing, and over-reliance on special effects of athletics. It lacks the energy that comedy needs to get your average audience to sit without checking its watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, she also got some laughable lines, a talented and serious crew, and a weak traditional hypothesis. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are a "core" team. Garofalo and Studi are doing great work that adds conflict and diversity to the team. I can not say Robbins or Mitchell added much to the film in general, although each one had few chances to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is the classic "consuming things you make". No surprises there, because you know they will win. What makes it worth it is not the bad and evil villains, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Under all this, these people are children at heart, who just want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional foundation. Look at Azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; Messi is a fondly unpopular in his unwillingness to accept Cap. Secret identity is amazing. Stellar's anger (no different from that strange and elegant child you knew before and who would always go to a helpless rage on the pitch); Garvalo's desire to avenge her father. This childish belief that a sense of justice and good will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of the superhero comics; under its sarcastic manifestations, the "mysterious men" show why these comics are so important to many people. <br /> <br /> Do not ever turn into a satisfactory entity, given the huge number of half-baked sub plots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is the loopy fun it makes up for it. The fact that it's supposed to be good, it seems that the amazing fun is getting lost on some reviewers here, so I will issue a warning: if you are viewers who find the fun of scratching and irrational cartoon scratching and irrational ("Do I think this kind of .. * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone? "), then you are quite literal and do not laugh at this film. Go for a Sandler movie rental instead. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
