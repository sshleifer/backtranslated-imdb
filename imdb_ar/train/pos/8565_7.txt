If you love animal movies, this movie please. My wife loves animals and animal movies, she likes the parrot in this movie. It is directed at children, but I laughed in the most sense of humor. The French fashion figure made me laugh, adding balance to the text. It's a Disney movie, with a happy and happy family appeal, but I like to leave the theater with a positive art
