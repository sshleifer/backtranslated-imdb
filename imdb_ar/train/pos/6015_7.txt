In the early 1970s, many of us who embraced the Hippie / Acid / Alternative culture wholeheartedly realized that the mainstream society would not change the way we thought it would. For me, this movie set the tension "Now what?" That many people I knew knew at the time. Do we go to the town and create our own vision of utopia, or do we change and demand change? <br /> <br /> From useless gestures to police, radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd's music to love - making explosive images in the desert - there's a lot more. It picks up a good moment at a great time.
