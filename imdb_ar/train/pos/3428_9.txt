I watched this movie tonight in New York City at Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, and I did not read much about him as I knew I would see him no matter what. All in all, it is very well done. He does not focus on circulating "anti-war" statements, which left politics to me. The soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training at the boot camp, and how difficult it is once they return to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rekoff and Camilo Mejia telling of the difficulty of staying not only in war, but also refusing to go back when they were against personal morality. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. Anyone who says he has not seen or not lived with the scars of war on their lives.
