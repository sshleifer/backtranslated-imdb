Being a small town in Illinois myself, I can immediately relate to this film. Given the age at which it was made, the inhabitants of the town seem uncomfortably like many people who grew up with them. Yes the plot is as well. And yes, acting for the Oscars will not be nominated any time soon. But this is not the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have fun. This movie has a lot of fun. From a greedy bank that does not care about good intentions, but a weak MP, this movie was made for entertainment in the SciFi type and the small town that lives at best. Who can not smile in the sight of Inversion Dron or Verne Druid? I love FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I was bigger. In general, taking into account the technology that was available at the time, this great fun in his childhood, where you can sit on Saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand, laughing at the weaknesses of small town life. This is a film I see again and again, if not for any other reason than to ridicule myself and my small city.
