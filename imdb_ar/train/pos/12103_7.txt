I never saw Barbara Steele, which I did not like, and I was always sucking on a well-haunted house story (especially for great pictures like "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions of "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill"). This French-Italian production, though perhaps not classic, which remains the first horror film of Steele, "Black Sunday", remains to this day , Is an atmospheric entry into this kind of horror, filmed in black and white, and capable of transporting a real creeping swamp.This film concerns a journalist betting on Lord Blackwood and author of the hand Edgar Allan Poe can spend the night at Blackwood Castle on Halloween, when the souls of the dead in the castle re-represent their fate.The viewer gets these deaths, which are horrifying to a large extent, in most cases.In fact, the movie sends shivers in the column And the immaculate DVD you've just seen - thanks to the wonderful people at Synapse - so it features a stunning naked scene and some light lesbians! Barbara is wonderful in this film. Its other beauty is well placed in sympathetic ghost play. Its mere presence transforms a scary ghost story into something truly memorable. Not for nothing has been named "Queen of Horror".
