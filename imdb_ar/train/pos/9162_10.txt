Although I did not begin to read "classics" in literature until I was 47 years old, it is not too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for several reasons, especially since there is no part of the book that I liked less, the parts I enjoyed more. The 1983 mini-TV series with Zilla Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it would be. I saw him as a full-length movie in 2006. Mr. Dalton was very good, but I loved him very much, Jane Eyre of Zila, by voting for another movie I saw recently, I was disappointed in production, direction and dialogue. The technical license for great works of literature is nothing less than a literary theft, using the title after this license is fraud, leave it to the British to get this right (among other things.) You will not be able to re-read the book without re-broadcasting the film in a proper context and spirit Well done BBC.
