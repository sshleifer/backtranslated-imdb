This film could have been a silent film. She definitely has one feeling. I was very lucky, to see this very rare version of this film. Extase, is a "love symphony" and transcends all language versions. The French language, the absolute romantic language, seems perfectly suited to this highly sensual and lyrical version. Young Hedy Lamarr shines on the screen, in this film that is somewhat like sexual fantasy; but certainly far from being pornographic. But this does not detract from the magic spell that this film exudes. Many early movie lovers will love this movie perfectly.
