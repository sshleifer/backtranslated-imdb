I have never seen many online movies in most of my life, but if I choose any of them, I will choose Spatula Madness, an intelligent reference to most movies such as star trooper, etc. Using a camera and steel intelligence, Jason Steele mastered the art of turning the normal picture into a painting , And then put them all with animation frame by frame to get a world populated by spoons. The story begins in the middle, how can directors be happy? And then the middle at first, and so, when I first saw it, I expected an unmatched look, but Jason, like me, likes the look, so take all the details to the extreme. Although I do not recommend it to children, or anyone else like it, but please search it online (it's a short film, look for a movie cow), but its style reminds me of the South Park, but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for the laugh, 6 for the story, all due to 10/10, good work <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I'm keen to watch the movie.
