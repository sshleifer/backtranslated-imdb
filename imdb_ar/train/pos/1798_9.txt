I saw Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, a movie stuck by your great characters - I've really stayed with me. Having been so cleverly adopted that it may be an excellent novel, it is a sequential drama with completely round characters and thoughtful recitation about life choices, and I do not exaggerate. One of the greatest actors ever assembled in more than 100 years of filmmaking. A wonderful work by everyone, led by the bright Vanessa Redgraff as a camouflaged and misguided Newport laugh, and Claire Dance as a younger. The daughter of Meryl Streep Mami Gumer, like Mama, is the real deal; Patrick Wilson is like Paul Newman around 1958 and is not nearly as charming as he is. I have the pleasure of seeing excellent theater actors like Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contributing to a sharp, detailed veil. Hugh Dansy, of the same stage, does not bring much of a somewhat vulgar role to a rich and unhappy drug, and family issues have perhaps been resolved more precisely than real life allows. But he hopes deliberately, visually stunning in real life issues, you can cry on him and do not feel like you are manipulating him recklessly. Also, what a grand parade of 1940s / 50s cars.
