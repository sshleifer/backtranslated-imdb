The good thing about this film: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think of those little things in life that can dramatically affect someone else's life without ever knowing. It's a small world and this little film shows us. <br /> <br /> The Bad Thing: There are many characters and it's hard to tell who is the main character but it's still a great movie. <br /> It is a wonderful film and many people compare it to Magnolia which I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Uncategorized --- I would like to rate -13 for brief violence, some linguistic and sexual positions.
