First, I loved this movie. Everyone has acted well. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments I hear from people about a sudden end. I did not know anything about this film, except some recommendations "that you should see", but I knew where the plot was less than ten minutes. (I will not mention what made me so as not to spoil a good film for others.) However, although it seems obvious, I have continued to watch. It was good to see how everything played, filling with details and personal motives in the subsequent scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not hate it when I guess the early end of the film. I hate it only when the road to accuracy is surrounded by boring scenery. <br /> <br /> Will Will Smith's character is completely loved, even when he plays such a troubled character. He is active and credible in everything I have seen him do. Seven Pounds is another good performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a strong performer, portraying a strange figure, somewhat optimistic despite the heart-hearted state. Beauty in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you do not find it wonderful, you should consider replacing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson again on screen. I have not seen him much recently, but this can only be me. Woody did not have a huge amount of screen time, but he sold his jubilant personality and played the piano for everything he deserved. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Some quick research on jellyfish tells me that their toxins are heart poisoning, neurotoxicity and skin. I think this makes it a dubious choice for both the pet and the plot. <br /> <br /> In general, I should recommend this film not for layout, but for some very good performances, and because it tends to evoke some of the tragic feelings that we are trying to avoid in general.
