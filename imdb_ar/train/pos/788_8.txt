Well, I admit. I think Kenny Dutty looks great in this film - but besides his good looks, the film is executed through a predictable plot at times, but reasonably. <br /> <br /> We started at the beginning, we met the three leading females in the film. One manager - very concerned about her image and never married. A police officer - with a child and a bad past to continue. Third - a doctor hungry in power and status has the desire to recognize three of these ex. <br /> <br /> They are almost the "First Wives Club" and there is already a lot of verbal beatings for the former participants as well as some "credit card" behavior. Group of characters - The film continues. <br /> <br /> McDowell, the school principal, is late at a funeral - picked up by a young musician who fills the normal operator. What would her friend say about the harm that followed? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> It is recommended to use a handkerchief or two tissues if you are the tear type - the end of the renaissance, but perhaps not what you expect. All-in-One Superb movie highlights the current options of action, special effects and horror schlock.
