This is a tepid documentary drama that does not cover any new land, rephrases all the cliches and is dirty with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is the hills in the film? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender but a truce. However, they are declared as surrender. For example, European news vendors (and do not shout) did not tell the headlines because they were knocking their papers. However, this American custom is used strictly in the film. For example, the Nazis adopted the German Eagle only after they took power, but there on the podium where Hitler handed over a stem winder. In fact, most of this disappointing production of Hitler's speech is more than a little. The film also perpetuates the myth that the coup d'Ã©tat of the beer hall had been staged at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. has not been. Robert Carlyle accurately depicts his subject. But the cast supports him at best and often does not happen. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can hope to have a better second but do not bet on it.
