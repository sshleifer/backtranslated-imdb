If the films are certified, Chinese ghosts are more beautiful and more disturbing than their Western counterparts. The main lines of the three "Chinese Ghost" films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent, the details and the color is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of robberies. For those who have not yet encountered the "Chinese GhostStory" trilogy so far, this film offers an interesting exit from the Western type of horror / ghost. For those who have, another fun in the Chinese ghost world.
