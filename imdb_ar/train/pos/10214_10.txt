For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies without an idea of ​​what will happen, so I think many other reviews of this film contain saboteurs! <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again, and I must emphasize it contains the best end of any movie. Start. Start. Start. The real translation, "Hit the Butterfly Wings", is not used strangely as a translated title. I think they thought most Americans would not know what the chaos theory was (except those who saw or read the Jurassic Park). The film relies on chaotic theory, and how a small event can affect the results of events that seem irrelevant, all of which are related to one event. The film is a whirlwind of cause and effect wondrous, as we follow the chaos chain as it intertwines between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the end seems inevitable though, but if you think about it, it is an ideal ending. Think of yourself, "What should be said"? At the same time, it is a very courageous end. Too bad, we should go abroad in search of such a jewel, but such end will never go out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
