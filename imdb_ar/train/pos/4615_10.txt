I think people are under the estimate of this incredible film. People view it as a typical horror film prepared to frighten us and prevent us from sleeping. If he tries to do that, he will be worthy of 1/10, but I saw this film with a few friends and found it very enjoyable, even though it was a good film after everything Stephanie Petton got. That is why I think it is worth 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film. <br /> <br /> The general view of this movie is that it behaves poorly, a simple text spanning 10 years can produce old and it can not be taken seriously and people rated low because of this. But I see this as a completely entertaining masterpiece ... containing a funny, funny scenario, which is more entertaining by actors, and although it is not very serious, it is very entertaining.
