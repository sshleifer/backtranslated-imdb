Despite being recognized as the best movie to address the difficulties of building a house in the country (or purchase) according to your specifications, it is not the first or the last. In 1940, Jack Bennett and Anne Sheridan were at the forefront of the GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE comedy by George Kaufman and Moose Hart. Fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in the financial hole. The former was about moving into an 18th century country house ... wrong, needs work. The last was about building the house of your dreams - in the late eighties. Although the two films have passed their moments, neither is as good as Blanding, which was based on a biographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Carey Grant and Merna Lowe) notice the narrow corners of their apartment, which they share with their daughters Joanne and Pepsi (Charin Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings had a good income as an executive director of the ad (in 1948, he was earning $ 15,000.00 a year, which was like making $ 90,000.00 a day) and living in a luxury apartment - which is in New York City that day he rents! - Feel that they must look for something better. He and Morrell toured the country (Connecticut) and soon found ancient ruins that could be imagined as the dream home they wanted. <br /> <br /> Both fall into the financial worm hole that land purchase and construction can lead to. For one reason, they clung to the idea of ​​building a house like this, they did not respond to the warning after being warned by their wise, if the lawyer's lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a good sarcastic role). For example, Jim buys the land from a dealer in Connecticut (Ian Wolf, and quietly absorbs the pieces), with a check before checking the correct cost of land in that part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than he deserved. There are water supply problems that are never thought of by Blandings, such as hard and soft water - which leads to the Zis-Zis water softening machine. They found that the designs they thought of, and worked with the architect (Reginald Denny), could not be dropped cheaply in Muriel's decision to build a little anger that was not planned by anyone. <br /> <br /> The rising cost of the project is a matter of interest to Jim. Was assigned to deal with the "Wham" account ("spam" became a common result of World War II, where the public began to use it as an alternative to meat, in light of its success with the armed forces). Jim can not control this (he is not alone - one executive or other executive has lurched in front of him). He came to the next part of the "Hair" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little pig went to the market, <br /> <br /> It was pink and beautiful like pork. <br /> <br /> <br /> He smiled at his tracks, <br /> <br /> They also gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew he would end up with "Wham"! <br /> <br /> I reminded him of him as if he needed a straight jacket when he read it! <br /> <br /> Jim also increasingly questions Bill's interest in Morrell, though (in this case) Bell Blum. But he always exists (Jim still forgets that Bill is the one with clear heads, and that Jim and Murrell are not allowed to make too many mistakes). The three had traffic accidents, the best when they were locked up in a half-built room in the house, just as men left for the day. They can not open the door, and Jim (in panic) tries to smash the door down a malignant ram. He smashes a window and opens the door on his own. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, with all actors seem to enjoy themselves. It's one film (although price levels and salary levels change) really do not live at all. After all, most Americans dream of owning their own homes and always. <br /> <br /> Several years ago, the paint company benefited from a spectacular sight with Mirna Loy and Emory Parnell in relation to Parnell's paint job. To do in different rooms. They carefully show the distinctive shades of red, blue and so on, and they want - so that Parnell gives a polite one line to the right shade of blue. The commercials hinted that the paint company has a wide range of colors to choose from for the paint job. They proudly launched "Blandings" in front of commercials. You can imagine how Parnell makes no sense dealing with the position then, when Loye leaves him with the paint crew.
