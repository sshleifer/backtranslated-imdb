My brief comment to this flick is going to pick up the item. Chances are you will be pleasantly surprised by a variety of elements that have been wonderfully explored in this criminal film. There's no way to figure Miklos, where you claim and press to save space in every possible way, and you will not push your nerves to the edge ... thumbs up!
