This film is unusual and strange, and almost unusual and strange in a very good way. I give this figure only 7 because it is unique and outside the wall, but it seems to seem odd most of the time just because it is strange. If the film has been able to integrate its most unusual moments into some aspects of the plot, it will be truly fascinating. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that it seems as if the creators gathered together a bunch of crap around spoons, then threw in a whole bunch of more crap that seemed like funny coming from a spoon mouth. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth checking out, but it's not the highest rate by any stretch of wild imagination creators.
