A fictional documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modin) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubenick), are trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is a comic tale of their struggle to bring everything together, despite the number of conflicting threads. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North is working in a very similar way to why Is Is Spinal Tap (1984) works so well. Although exaggerated in some respects, they are very close to the truth, and the truth is made up of "behind the scenes" facts that are quite different from the general face of the industry. It's not easy to make a film, and it should be hard in Canada in the late 1970s. The films include dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many of them do not conflict with desires, motives and personalities. Funders and on-screen talent are especially important, as if they were leaking or becoming unreliable at any stage during the production of the film, which could jeopardize the whole thing, either requiring extensive re-filming or abandoning the film altogether. <br /> <br /> So it is not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on these types of relationships. The result is an excellent movie hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and the presentations are top notch. This is a must for any emerging film director and anyone who has a serious interest in the craft of filmmaking. It must be more of an entertainment for any viewer with little intelligence and humor. <br /> <br /> Of 10 out of 10.
