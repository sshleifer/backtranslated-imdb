Unfortunately, this film has not been available for a long time (as other posters have noted), but this is one of the basic drama of the Great Depression, a lyrical and moving play of love located in a shantytown. It features the Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young shows, which are almost the best of their careers. It is a great example of how Frank Borsage managed to create a halo of fairy tales about the elements of poverty and crime, the terrible social injustice that only shows how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were. This film shows how love lives in the midst of adversity and need, which confirms life completely. This is a real masterpiece in this period, a film that deserves to be widely known.
