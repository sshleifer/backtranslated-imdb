Very good movie classic science fiction film with humor, movement and everything. This film offers more foreigners. We see the leaders of the rebel alliance and a lot of imperial forces. The emperor is somewhat original character. I loved the Ewoks which somehow represented the original monsters and the Vietnamese. (Excellent signals) I liked the fencing between Vader and Luke which is the best story. In the return of the Jedi, the conclusion of the first trimester ended and the Empire finally fell. I also appreciate the victory ceremony where Vader's recovery comes back to the spirit of Anakin Skywalker along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives grief and tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this film: When Emperor Vedder is occupied. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan and Yoda and his father (version 1997 Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to answer Darth Vader to protect Leah. There is a deep dark side to this film although there is a good ending. I felt that there was much more to see than the eye. As always, John William's classical music will bring the world of Star Wars.
