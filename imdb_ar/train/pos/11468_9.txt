I am frankly surprised how little was accomplished in the Colombian massacre film. There is no great documentary film, very puzzling. Luckily, we were honored with the talent of Ben Coco who directed the movie ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant who performed the wonderful ELEPHANT. Two different themes take the event, which shares the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, and that there is something puzzling and ultimately unknown about the motives of the killers, and what actually drove them beyond imagination in the terrible reality. ZERO DAY, allegedly made up of shooters and found after the event, has become quite crowded. So if you know where to go, you still have the hope of not "going there" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the film runs out. The film is gorgeous from top to bottom, from the director to the script (not too clumsy, although it seems very automatically) to the main actors, and the supporting players as well. There is only one side of ZERO DAY that bothers me. Well, so we can not understand why the shooters will do what they did, but certainly one participant was their anger. After these boys does not seem really angry. They may say some things to indicate that they are, but they really did not convince me that they had something inside them that forced them to kill innocents. But this still leaves me with a feeling of "why ???" This director Coccio wants me to be. In any case, rent or buy this movie, you will creep and stay with you for a long time. BLAIR WITCH people can only hope for the success of these young people in making a fictional documentary.
