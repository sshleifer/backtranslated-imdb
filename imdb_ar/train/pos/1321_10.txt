Skip the track to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is just a better version of Norma Khoury's book Forbidden Love, which was a best seller. Lie $ is considered to be a precursor to literary fraud and a beautiful woman, and is the best in reality television. <br /> <br /> The story of Bruinowski has been beautifully edited and full of vitality. . I do not agree (with Variety) as continuous; instead, my simple problem was the casual nature of the core players who comment on the testimony of others just registered. If you see one, your sense of the story becomes drowned ... so I saw it twice. <br /> <br /> This effort which is worth the Oscars simultaneously is really funny and disturbing and is fully shared because it documents one lie after another. The apparent deception in Queensland is revealed by a very personal deception of friends and acquaintances (!). It is clear that these friends have "turned", the line on the camera belongs to his neighbor Khoury Rachel Richardson of Khoury, who speaks of her disappointment in the flat, meaningless slang: "I think it's a personal load." <br /> <br /> We need to learn from their experience, and hence my faith in the spoilers. A permanent lie in a lie will say something just to gain the time to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There are some breathtaking footage of Khoury cynically manipulating the deceit of this very documentary, which is pressed (con) "artist" over and over to confirm. <br /> <br /> A year after it was published, Ms. Khoury was in flight, but was seduced by the director to explain her supposed name. She supposedly fled because she (a) is either terrified of her malignant husband, who seems more Italian than Greek, or b) because she needed her passport / visas to clarify her name. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely. <br /> <br /> The most logical reason is that the FBI has regained its influence in Queensland before crossing back abroad (one guess: no, not Jordan). According to the final paper, Khoury is still "under investigation by the FBI" in 2007. <br /> <br /> I thought that the masses might give Khouri the benefit of doubt once the need for utmost secrecy and deception was required. Instead, the fans that sat with her slowly become just as disappointed as the deception on the screen. Once caught, there was a lot of irony and gangs. Earlier, the strains of tension had emerged from an audience of people who did not know how to take the contradictions of Khoury. <br /> <br /> The film director has the potential to extend this beautifully complex story from start to finish, leaving nothing outside - not even self-sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film by telling a book sympathetic to Khoury herself. The supposed cause of authorship is recounted very reasonably at first - the key to how a liar works for life: in half the facts. However, Khoury, 35, is beautiful, elegant and charming and somewhat enchanting, and surprisingly, the biceps were prepared. <br /> <br /> Gradually, we introduced to smaller and lesser-known Australian newspapers. Fans who initially bought Khoury's charges for killing honor, line and diving. Later on, we see their more perverse reactions, which are largely self-governing and related to reality, if some may be a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> It was the militants who killed the honor of the Jordanians who were very angry at Khoury's fallacies because their forced movement forced them to slow the pace of change. Honor crimes occur in Jordan. It is just a spread unlike Khoury's book - in addition to 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists sent by fax (Australian) Random House with 73 well-verified objections. <br /> <br /> Publishing houses have not been published on 4 continents that have jumped on the chance of publishing a first-time author, Khoury, to investigate any facts. Leaving no confirmation of the disclaimer in the author's contract, was also a fair game. So hot topics were easy to fool around the world, like writing in Internet cafes. <br /> <br /> Later, we are still shocked to discover that "factual errors" extend to the biography of Khoury like Well. For one reason, she is not only a 35-year-old virgin (her defense is that she has not denied people their assumptions), but she has a pimp husband and two teenagers! Sometimes, you speak very quickly in her American dialect. They also look very comfortable with mobile phone technology and Western clothing. I realize that such observations may be detrimental to Jordanian women who do not need any of my Western parents, but even when you do not notice the cultural cues as well as Khoury's "facts," you should start questioning your source. <br /> <br /> At some point the director reached the same conclusion. She is making a wonderful effort to hold Khoury personally accountable in Jordan. The last third is spent on a fact-finding trip to Amman, where "reality" is located one by one. Eventually, Bruinowski (artist) compels her to recognize the contradiction in her story, and then Khoury records her secret secret confession in her digital camera. Secret, because in that "American security guard" of Khoury, Jeremy heard an Australian dialect: he is a representative! (We never found out how Anna found out.) <br /> <br /> So this is a triumph for the filmmaker, because she never gives up her tone or commitment. Her vision on the camera prompted her audience to learn from the mistakes of others because of such reasonable doubt, FBI documents - and the first most shocking Khuri crime. <br /> <br /> Anna Bruinowski (now watching her) is smart enough to use the technical staff (the main players to hang the footage) to kill two birds - making her fans want to drink from the same well again. <br /> <br /> In fact, although it has made me reassure that its deceptive style is that Ofrington and Knox DID really won the Walkleys 2004 award in Investigate Pressism for "Norma Khouri Investigation." <br /> <br /> Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.
