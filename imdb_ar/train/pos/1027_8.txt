I'm not great at writing reviews, so I'll just keep my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I liked this series at first. Adventure, motion, comedy, drama ... I thought it was fantastic. Anderson, tapping, legs, judge, Davis ... I love them all. Davis appeared to be the fifth most important person in the team. Not a big problem. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of season seven, and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off the cliff. I do not know if the reason is that Hammond realized it or what, but for some reason, the chain turned into ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven chapters, though, were awesome. Stargate looked mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out that, even if this was not the original intention, it was a great preparation for the series. I recommend you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new estimate from it the second time, believe me), then watch the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not as good as the first seven seasons, but that does not mean it's not good. This means it's just a disappointment if you've been spoiled by the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After completing this series, be sure to watch the separate series, Stargate: Atlantis. He is a successor worthy of this wonderful series. <br /> <br /> EDIT on 7-18-08: I discovered that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
