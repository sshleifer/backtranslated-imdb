It all begins with a series of thefts of things that seem to have nothing to do with a student hostel on Hickory Road, London. Her sister, the housekeeper there, is interested in asking Hercules Poirot to look into it. Agrees, but soon the risk rises when a girl is found, she has admitted that she was responsible for most of the robberies (not all of them), being killed. <br /> <br /> Hickory Duckory Duck is a solid brain exercise, without being as stunned by complexity as "one, two, clasp my shoes". Murder, robbery and diamond smuggling are crimes that have been committed, and final touches are detected that tie everything together only in the last 2 minutes! The interesting characters, especially the psychology student Colin McNab and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, and Inspector Japp have their ridiculous moments (perhaps the series closest to the "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon got an integral part of the story than usual.
