You will be forgiven for believing that a Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing an American horror film (especially a movie that is entirely in a US prison) - watch this to prove you're wrong! It was produced in the 1980s, and the film was produced with a budget more suited to a recent TV commercial for DIY (something I think anyone might really notice these days in what everyone practically used to budgets of over $ 100 million for motion movies. Industry!) Being the first major production of Mr. Harlin - and at least what is now considered astral. I still believe that most of the North's contribution to the film industry as a whole relates more to the screenplay of Stellan Stardgard (not to mention Mr. Bergman's efforts to exaggerate Mr. Bergman's direction) - at least for all female views - but this click really proves an appropriate film talent outside The United States and Hollywood to make us watch a thriller. Try this movie and watch it even if it is not a puff of horror, it is certainly IMO worth it!
