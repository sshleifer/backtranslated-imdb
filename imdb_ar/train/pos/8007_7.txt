This game caused great addiction, I kept playing for hours in a row until late at night, but also the fact that you can not save a game when in space contributed to it, and sometimes I play so I do not play lose any data about the game. <br /> <br /> So, yes, "Freelancer" is addictive but completely flawed. Also, for example, what bothered me so much was that you could not get past any broken scene as a result. Sometimes you had to see the same scene that took several minutes time after time. A great opportunity for me to do multiple tasks to check my email or to chat with my friends and more things like that, while I had to wait until the cutting scene ends. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a promise but the more ridiculous you get all the more it gets. The game also ends very abruptly, at least I did it for me. It is quite clear they are hinting at the sequel coming. I do not know if there is a sequence at work right now, but I'm sure I'll probably drop it once it's released. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flying games. With bold words, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are very difficult and require a lot of effort. It took me about two weeks to finish this game that might be too short. But thank God for the multi-player choice! Allows you to continue to play short tasks, just like a single player game once completed by the way. <br /> <br /> Although many tasks are similar, they remain simply cool to be in the middle of huge battle times. <br /> <br /> Graphics are good but not just anything revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Addicting game but beware of its flaws. <br /> <br /> 10/7
