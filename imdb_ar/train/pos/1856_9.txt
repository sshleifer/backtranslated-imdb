He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in "Glory" and proved that he was not "Malcolm in the middle" the average actor in "Malcolm X" and showed his fraternal love to work in "Philadelphia" and he slammed a blow at " , Did not lift punches and shook like a hurricane in the "hurricane", he gave us an active education in the "training day", and has now proved that he is able to guide him too! Anthony Fischer's debut in Denzel Washington is the most exciting film of the year. The story of the "fisherman" does not relate to the Miami dolphin split in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriot in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the dolphin tragedy, Anton Fisher has an emotionally amusing ending. The film is based on a true story about a young naval officer with a problem managing anger over the repugnance he suffered as a child. Denzel plays the role of a marine psychologist who helps Antoine overcome his anger and persuades him to find his natural mother. The performance of Derek Locke debut as Antwone is the most impressive actor I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw some of the strangeness in Luke's representation as I saw in previous Washington shows. It was as if Washington were saying to Luke - la la la Luke - I am your acting father. Okay! I will get rid of Star Wars jokes before readers send me to a distant galaxy. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a brilliant psychiatrist. But what can you expect from the acting "Mr. D" himself. "Anton Fisher" written by Anton Fischer himself. The emotional emotions he introduced in the scenario of his life story about the "king of fishermen." I pay tribute to President Washington for catching the right bait at Anton Fisher. ***** Excellent
