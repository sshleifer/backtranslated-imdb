I was surprised to see the low result of this film. I saw this film for the first time in 10 years and was reminded that I loved it. <br /> <br /> Come back, children, to the time when Michael Keaton was a young comedian, you might find some joy in this film. It's a nice comedy - the kind that Ron Howard specializes in - but if that's your thing, you should check it out. Keaton's low-key charm is quite suitable for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit old, because it takes its place in the last stage of the pre-world economy, when it still mattered the country in which the company was founded. However, it offers laughter in addition to a lesson on how people learn from each other, to bring great benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering a particular scene you really liked, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but steady flow of laughter. It's like IV. drip. I mean it in a good way.
