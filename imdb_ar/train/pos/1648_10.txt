This is one of the best movies ever. It is a realistic portrayal of rural livestock life that has been a major part of American history. The setting is 1906 Wyoming where life has not changed much since the previous century. The movie keeps your attention without the added Hollywood legends. The whole family can see this film and raise their interest in how life in America was when it was often a rural nation. With this film, you will escape from the present and witness daily life 100 years ago. In a beautiful environment with breathtaking views you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive, as well as the constant fears and fears of elements and market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure. Watch this movie and try life as it was in most of our nation's history. This movie deserves your time to see. My only question is - why do not there be more movies like this one?
