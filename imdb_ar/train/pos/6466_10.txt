I really loved this movie and also loved the audience I saw in Los Angeles. After the film, many people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them. I can see why this was a huge blow in her home country, Sweden. The film is brilliantly directed and each character is brilliantly drawn to the end to really know these people and care about them. The music is very natural and the main song in the film is extremely tragic but inspirational. I would definitely recommend it to everyone - even people who do not usually go to translated movies. He certainly deserved Oscar nomination because of the deep themes of the film that are reflected without a pretext in a small town community with people every day. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. Must see!
