The story line was somewhat exciting, but the characters were fairly flat and sometimes exaggerated in their thoughts / behavior. Too extreme. Also, I think there is something wrong with casting. John Tortoro does not really satisfy the playing of semi-autistic chess player, not talking about the Italian player. Motivation is also not identified. <br /> <br />
