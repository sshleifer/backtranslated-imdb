Michael Jackson is no longer very popular in the United States, but in Europe (especially Germany) he still has a lot of fans. Many will say that this is a bad film: he has no conspiracy, he is full of clichés, Michael is always praising himself. <br /> <br /> But, you can not expect a plot or non-cliché in this kind of movie! It has amusing visual effects and perfect music. The Smooth Criminal part - the greatest song ever, filled with Moonwalks, and group dance and even the famous "Bench-over" by Michael Jackson - is one of Jackson's masterpieces with Michael's good-looking (and white ...) Jackson! <br /> <br /> Jackson fans, music lovers, and the need for lovers to represent the dance must. <br /> <br /> However, since I'm a fan of MJ, I have to be careful what Michael Jackson hates there: do not watch this movie, it will increase your hatred ...
