In fact, this film contains ridiculous moments, both in the clay part or in the Pesci atmosphere and children, much worse than other MJ films such as "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But as a fan of Michael Jackson almost eleven years ago, "Yes, that's half my life, you guys!" I can not complain much about it. Just seeing this beautiful guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. But as a film, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid to get a much lower grade for me, if it's not my lover Mike who's starred. But since there is only one Mike IS, he must get 7 out of 10 of me.
