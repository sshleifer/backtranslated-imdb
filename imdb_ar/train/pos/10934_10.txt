After reviewing this intense self-defense film for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say that he did not lose any of his mysticism or any of his martial arts that I remembered from my youth. The story of one of the martial arts instructors who send his "unfinished" pupil to find the five former members of the "poison" clan, so they are not looking for a fortune hidden by his friend. Afraid that his last pupil did not get enough training, he asked him to endorse one of the five "toxins" to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about choreography or camera work. A good film by itself and one of the best martial arts films ever made. traditional!!
