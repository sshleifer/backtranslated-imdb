This film was very cool. The pre-partition time and culture has been beautifully recreated. Ormila made another great performance. What I really like about this film is that it does not resort to beating Pakistan which is spread in films like Gadar and LOC. With partition as background, the film does not move into political issues or focuses on violence or what is right and wrong. The film is always about the tragic story of Urmila's life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpayee was portrayed in an excellent way. The film actually shows how people, Hindus or Muslims alike, suffered from this division. The theme of having only one religion is truly prevalent in this film.
