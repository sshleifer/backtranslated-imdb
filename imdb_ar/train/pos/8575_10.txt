This is a movie that I can watch over and over and I never tire of it. It has a lot of laughter, guns, movement, crime, good passengers, decent plot, and with its presence above the top, Donald Sutherland in a somewhat comic role as a murderer. Tia Carrera looks as hot as she ever did and she can act as well. Thomas Ian Griffin is superb in this matter as the main character of "Max" and agent Dia Dian is the FBI agent, played by Carrera, and John Lithgow of Fraser on TV, plays the bad guy, Livingstone. The plot centered around Max and Diane trying to catch Livingston while fighting and arguing with each other about who gets the money for the agencies involved, and throws the mix to Assassain Sutherland, who owns all the good lines, that is the perfect crime, there's the usual love story, Very differently than I thought by Carrera and Griffith. You also have a Russian mafia, an Italian mafia, a Chinese mafia here in this mix, the film is filmed in Boston, where you have some wonderful shots, locals, photography, and brilliant music in this film, this movie is just an example of a comedy crime, What one can ever want. Check out the Sutherland toilet in a particular scene, very unusual. This movie is a riot and will make you laugh a lot more 10 for me.
