As the blazer announces, this film "was beautifully filmed and edited brilliantly", and yes, it is magically beautiful. The eternity that we see in the sand rocks and in the continuous tides of the aqueducts, the demise of the hands of Goldsworthy so that they mark eternity forever. <br /> <br /> So the beauty of his works haunts us with a touch of woven gloom - or Matthew Arnold of Dover Beach: <br /> <br /> Listen! You hear the squeaky gravel squealing of the waves, and flutter, on their return, at the top of the border, never, stop, then start again, with a slow rhythm, and bring the eternal tune of sadness. At one point near the end of the film, Goldsworth says, "Words do their job, but what I do here says a lot." As a word myself, I do not get angry or for a moment, I think it is unwise because the combination of shape, time, change, texture, color and composition that Goldsworth creates with hardness and accuracy, is really something more than just words. <br /> <br /> At another stage, he said "what's left here ... and what is not." This is his subject. <br /> <br /> I believe that sometime in the 20th century artists became fully aware of how even the greatest works of art were compared to the enormous time of cosmic time; they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were ephemeral. The idea was that by emphasizing the extent to which the short-term work of the most powerful human works, a sense of immortality would be expressed in art. <br /> <br /> Part of the effectiveness of Goldsworth's work may be in this expression type. Hardly formed a kind of straw or leaves that will reach the tide, or put it in the river where it will be washed; in this process, both the composition and the merging time are combined. <br /> <br /> Both transit and eternity are necessary to understand our world and our place in it. It is important that these works take place in the context of nature so that they are formed within what is normal. The stone walls and stone bricks built by the Goldsworthy site are silent and solid, but we know that they are not eternal effects, but they will remain instead for an indefinite period of time and then disappear and return to a state very similar to that which existed before we arrived. <br /> <br /> This art should also be art-like spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Goldsworth's work is an uninterrupted understanding. It is a pure experience of time and form. In a sense, the famous Chilean poem "Ozymandias" answers, even when the tide is washed away, and even when the river wastes expression, so art continues to work because of our experience. Similarly, one thinks of Tibetan sand paintings that have been carefully constructed and measured, and then just as if they were full of beauty and precious, given to the wind, so that we know that everything flows. > However, in the modern world, these works of art persist in photos and videos. Goldsworthy is a witty photographer (necessary to say) and all his works, even those that are not successful, he tells us, were filmed so he could look at them in a more reflective mood and see what he accomplished and what he accomplished. <br /> <br /> This film production directed by Thomas Redlsheimer with the beautiful and embarrassing music misses Fred Frith. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries I have ever seen and one of the most beautiful documentaries.
