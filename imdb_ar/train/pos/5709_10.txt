In 1931, you should watch this foreign movie and enjoy it more than once. <br /> <br /> We open in a quiet little French village, and we survey the roofs of sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. When investigating the fuss, two adjacent men are told of the story of two men, presumably friends, who have chosen two lottery numbers. <br /> <br /> Our star in the picture bears his number and friend. When he asks his friend, he will share half the dough, if his ticket is the winning figure, his friend immediately says no. In fact, hockey sticks do not double! Is how he behaves. <br /> <br /> So when our man discovers that he has a winning card and that he is lost, without a mistake on his part, he is very concerned. Everyone is out for themselves, looking for this card, in something like the great race intro. Although this is all flash memory, I was in a knot all the time, and I was very upset about everything small in this film that shows cash in the bank. See Le Million today!
