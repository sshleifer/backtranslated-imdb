Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements into this kind of tiredness from the first person shooting. Patrick Galloway tells the story of an expert on magic and an enormous fighter summoned by a friend to his possession in Ireland to investigate some of the strange infections. The game was set in Ireland after World War I, so do not expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers. All the weapons in the game can be considered antiques, but the real fun in the game is its spells and the system in which our hero works so he can use both his hands at the same time: cast mascots with his right arm and use his guns with the left. So you can shoot and throw spells at the same time that you understand very fun and also unique to the game! The graphics are superb and can work very well on P.C .. Power with medium design is also cool and atmosphere. The game mostly revolves around the estate of the crown and the palace but there are many other sites waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker, the game has a great story and a plot (very rare for the shooter from the first person) and I said in front of a very cool and terrifying atmosphere that the vocal representation is also good but not excellent. But the game has two major drawbacks. First of all, it is perfectly linear, so when you say your task, for example, go to that room and all the doors in the house will be closed for those that lead to your task room, this may save time but limits the freedom of exploration. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiques may not attract most fps players who are accustomed to high tech weapons. As far as the difficulty involved the game is very well balanced. Most of them are of medium difficulty but sometimes it becomes more difficult but not frustrating. Overall undying is a fantastic game. Definitely one of the best fps there.
