James Meychner's books, which carry readers to distant places with strange vocal names, are probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His tales in the South Pacific became a great hit on Broadway for Rodgers and Hammerstein. The South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and it was natural to compose a film for the success of another Michener, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> There was only a decade before the American films during World War II did not portray the Japanese please. I'm sure it was not easy for people who fought the Pacific War to change positions overnight. This general non-brotherhood policy with the occupied peoples in general is at the core of this story about interracial romance. <br /> <br /> Saiyunara is a related film today. The army has always maintained the personal life of its members in ways that no civil employer can legally escape. In America at that time, Saiyunara was introduced, and there are still laws of misinformation in books in many states. Gays today in the army is a big issue. Someone might someday perform Sayonara like this. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on a familiar land. The South Pacific also had racism as a component of its scheme. With a firm hand, Logan has assembled a wonderful story and a wonderful craft. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith, some Western players are doing a good job. But the picture was stolen by the Orientals here. Mikko Taka hits a beautiful mark like Brando love attention. But the real stars are the only two stars supporting the Oscar, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki awards. <br /> <br /> Buttons are your member of the Air Force. He falls in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Omyki. They marry and military forces do everything in their power to disperse them. They assume they know what is best for Buttons and Umeki. Buttons was a television comedy and a fair talent, but he never participated in this part of his career. <br /> <br /> Oscar Miyoshi Omeki was the first film to be given to an oriental person. I got a great deal of attention because at the time of the Oscars, Miyoshi was starring at Broadway in the Dram's Song Falls. I was honored to see her on Broadway, and it was the first Broadway show I've ever seen. I still carry his memory. <br /> <br /> This Oscar symbolizes something else as well. Our war with Japan ended and we saw in Sayonara a great nation with proud traditions and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays the role of Nakamura, Kabuki's representative. If Saiyunara is executed today, Logan will not escape. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and great story. This movie should be revived often.
