While the titles of the films contain the word "mother", the first thing that comes to mind is the mother's love for her children. <br /> <br /> However, the mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> Mother does not discuss love between mother and child, or how to sacrifice herself for the sake of her child. Here, director Roger Michel of Notting Hill tells us that a mother's love for a man about half her life hurts people around her. <br /> <br /> Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond, Darren plays here, a man who helps restore the mother's son's house, and sleeps with her daughter as well. Ann Reid, who was a familiar face in the television series, takes on the difficult role of the protagonist, May. <br /> <br /> The story begins in the face of May with the sudden loss of her husband, Tots, on a family visit to her son, Bobby. While she was certified, Darren, a witty worker doing some renovations at Bobby's house, was shocked to discover that her daughter Paula was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, Mai was adapted to life after the death of Tots. Fearing that Harry and Paula do not want her, May begins to find her life on the right track, until she spends the afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was nice and friendly in May, and you may soon find some affection for Darren. Instead of treating him as a friend, the man, who was about half a year old, treated a couple. Later, Mai found the sexual pleasure of Daren, where she gave her pleasure that she did not find anyone else. This is the beginning of a disaster that can lead to the destruction of the family. <br /> <br /> The mother explores the inner world of the widow who wanted to experience something she had never had before in her life, and consolation to someone there for her to endure. This may be said in May of buying Darin tea snacks to meet the sexual needs of a younger man, who eventually gave her more than she wished. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid has made a breakthrough in May, as she was previously known for her varied role in the television series. Because she does not have many films in her career, the mother has put her on the critic. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, played a similar role in his career in cinema, such as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If James Bond's outstanding role fails, film reviewers should not forget that he had performed better in his small productions in his career in the film, and that the mother was one of them. <br /> <br /> Mother may not be the favorite of all, but certainly not your usual program is to go along with tea and cakes, accompanied by butter and jam.
