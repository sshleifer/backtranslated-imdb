Soprano (now preparing for the end) is the climax of television and adult drama. When the soprano hits the mark, it hits the mark. Using brilliant writing and great actors (mostly from the additions of Goodfellas), this series is out loud for progress in an unexpectedly unexpected and unpredictable way. The cast of the cast is James Gandolfini, who is Tony Soprano for all intense purposes, and Eddie Falco, certainly owned. The series also boasts a large array of regular elements to drive the plot by any means necessary (usually a language of violence and foul language). Tony Serico, Michael Emprioli and Steve Van Zandt are fantastic secondary characters that make each episode more interesting. Seasonal additions are notable, including names such as Steve Busemi (Azim!), Joe Pantoliano (Azim!), David Proval (Good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> The Sopranos is a wonderful family drama and a realistic interpretation of the modern mafia communities that despite the rare story lines have managed to be a unique television. Simple icons, story lines, dreams, shooting and many other things create stories and tangled relationships that are solved at the end of each season to create another perfect HBO package.
