I'm not sure if it's true or wrong, but I read the other comments before watching the shortcut. I must say I do not agree with most of the negative comments or problems that people have encountered. <br /> <br /> For the first time as a producer / producer of "Lon Wolf", I like to see things I can aspire to, not necessarily supporters, but only by people who are wasting their feet like me. <br /> <br /> If this already is also from the first timer, as I read, I salute the effort.Great work then in this regard! There were some comments about the music. I thought it was very good for the piece. Some say it's unmanned for a while, but I found that tension was created without necessarily being aware of it. When the pull was unleashed, the guitar began to hit the ropes, as if we knew there was a train on the tracks, but we realize it's moving now . Yes, there is a 180-degree slip / clip, but it happens. Did anyone else see that the dirty Hugh shirt turns white (near the end, in the rain) in Australia? Look how much money and people were behind this movie! Give the child a break for the gods! All in all I think it was done very well. Only two of the things I mentioned are hardly worth mentioning - do not walk into a glossy brass frame with the camera, and I'd only show the stink in the first shots on the still shots, so people would not necessarily hurt to know what it was. <br /> <br /> My experience so far has taught me that it's not hard to make a movie; it just takes a long time to learn how to do it, then the time to do it already, and then, it's better to take more time to think about all the details You'll need to pick them up before you call "post-production!" IMHO, it seems that director / writer Ryan Jeffrey has done his job, and if this is indeed his first report card, I will give him a. The rest of you report to the Directors' Office about rhythm.
