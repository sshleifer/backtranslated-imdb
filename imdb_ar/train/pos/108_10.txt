"Europe" (or, also known as "Zentropa") is one of the most visually-viewed films. Grayscale and color grading combination is approaching smooth ... a real feast for the eyes. The picture was a competition for the Golden Palm in 1991 in Canars. The prize went to Barton Fink (from the Quinn Brothers); a film very stylistically like Zentropa. Here's an exercise in the classroom: hire both films and be your own judge.
