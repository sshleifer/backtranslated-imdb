Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, the reckless dissident policeman in the Standard Edition who got his title because no matter how many shots he takes (38 and counting), he never stops chasing the bad guys. <br /> <br /> When a sophisticated American tank called "Thunderblast" is launched across the border into Mexico, it was captured by the rebels / terrorists led by General Progado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiv (Henri Silva), who joined To himself with the Russian bad guys. Captured military personnel are kept as prisoners, headed by Devon Sheppard (Darlan Fluegel), who happened to be a former friend of McBain. McCain is then recruited by the military for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not enjoy the physical presence of the saying, someone like Schwarzenegger, who could have been another suitable film of this kind, but he bursts out as a dude confident of himself who is fast with wececss. Fluegel is a great female lead. It does not only look amazingly exciting, but it makes an exciting babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and the permanent welcome William Smith (as a Russian leader) are a disturbing scum in the tradition of classic motion films. Cast iron is fully filled with actors of a familiar and reliable character: L.Q. Jones, J. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askio, Danny Trigo, and Kari Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and BJ Goldman provided the script, based on a story by Lankford and veteran B manager Fred Olin Rai. It's a type of writing where you know only that the book has their tongues in their cheeks: they know their material is silly and skeletal, and they only have credibility from the window. Veteran film director Steve Carver is moving it and offering a respectable amount of fire, explosions and total chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bullet Resistance" is a good fun for fans who do not mind turning off their brain every now and then and enjoying a generous array of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
