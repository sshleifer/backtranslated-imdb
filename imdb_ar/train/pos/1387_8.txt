A bit slow (somewhat like Sophia Coppola) but still an attractive film about the discovery of sexual activity by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories to what their time seemed to be. Confusion and insecurity are portrayed in a very simple way but this is true in life. The music is perfect and the representation is amazing. The camera works beautifully too. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual drives and desires. I would also like to say that it is a wonderful film for young people who go through that period. Many films have been produced about adolescence, but this truly embodies the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its intricacies.
