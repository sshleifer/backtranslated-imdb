I watched this movie for the first time in years and continued to watch it several times a year when I had the chance. It is included in the list of favorite movies with some classic films. If anyone tells you that he is an idiot or obsolete, ignore him ... This film is for anyone who enjoys laughter and music. Dance is not as important in this film as it is in other Astaire films, so starring comedy and acting. Watch this movie if you can, it may be light but still completely amused. So I know that many people hate black and white movies, and they think that old movies can not be really funny, this film should make them change their mind. No one I know can watch this movie without being at least amused. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire sings without a dance. It may be a great performer and a strong singer, but it is not wonderful and leaves a big gap in the middle of the story. Comedy sometimes gets some cliches, but the G Burns and G Allen voice shows are perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughter. Give this movie a chance Even if you do not like old movies, this movie can make you laugh at any movie.
