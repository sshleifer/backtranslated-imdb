A true and healthy American story about teenagers interested in firing their own rocket in the rural coal mining town of West Virginia, after Sputnik's launch in 1957. <br /> <br /> With experience, tribulations and perseverance beyond imagination, they are finally able to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, as captain of the group, is excellent in starring. As a motivational science teacher, Laura Lenny is very good, but her southern accent has gone beyond the top. <br /> <br /> There is a notable support performance by Chris Cooper, a senior miner, who wants his son to follow him in his footsteps, but gradually comes to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unusual in our time is that there are no scenes moving the bed and no blasphemy at all. It is an example of a well-done American story. <br /> <br /> Beside the corner of the flag, we have a father-son dispute and the provision of football as a way to escape the extraction of coal and loving family spirit. <br /> <br /> Why are not these photos more recognizable at award times?
