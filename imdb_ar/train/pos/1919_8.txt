I did not read the book on which he / she was inspired. Being some (other cinematic roles) another work for John Ritter (RIP), one hopes to be a joy. and he. Each time he was present in this, for the sake of reality. Most cast, as well as regular support, play each other well, the material tends to be large. He plays the role of Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical man of the age, Kerry, a depressive middle child who struggles for reasons and consciousness, and Bridget, famous popular love in fashion. Sagal returns to being the leading female in the sitcom, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. Offer changed somewhat after Mr. Three's Company, and for a while, could not determine whether they wanted to go for laughter or being influential and be respectful. One may wonder how or why it lasted for a long time afterwards: it can be very good, some additions were lucky (if you love David Spade, most of it consists of doing chtec) and had things to say. My favorite personal episode is last season. Humor is a nice mix of "mute person" jokes (mainly related to high school), ridiculous, dark comedy and raw materials. This is treated with sex and other subjects for adults, but not in a graphical way. The language is moderate, and at times, fairly strong. I recommend this to any of its fans. 10/08
