I have seen The Blob several times, and it is one of the best films of the low-budget foreign invasion of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteorite lands outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate it. Then a substance such as foreign jelly attaches to one of his arms and a young couple witness the meteorite arrive in time and take it to the local doctor, where the old mass absorbs completely. The doctor and his nurse are the next victim and the mass grows. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe the young couple and accuse them of doing all this. They finally believe in it when the masses appear, now huge in the town cinema and everyone runs to the streets screaming. She then attached herself to dinner with the young couple and others at home. Blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers on it and freezes, which is double. They are then transported by plane to Arctic frozen wastes and disposed of. But it's just frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a typical environment for its season: teenagers and a small town. The Blob has a good rock-and-roll song at the beginning and the movie is full of vitality all the time. <br /> <br /> The sequel, beware! The Blob followed in 1972 and came in remake in 1988, but this is the best film The Blob. <br /> <br /> The team is led by Steve McCoyn (The Great Escape) and the movie that made him a star. Anita and Korsa play his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> The Blob is indispensable for all science fiction lovers. Wonderful. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
