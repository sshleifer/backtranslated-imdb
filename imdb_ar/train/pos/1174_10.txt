Some people have said that from Season 11, South Park has begun to abandon their cynical political satire. But this can not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode does not spoil the Living Dead series, there are more. It is a satire of how people deal with the homeless. Characters say things like "They pretend to be like us" or "They want to be human." This episode attacks the culture of people who ignore the lower class who often have their luck. <br /> <br /> So, yes, still spelling, it's also a parody. What would you ask for more?
