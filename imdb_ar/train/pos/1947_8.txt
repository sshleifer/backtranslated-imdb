SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the end was a bit suprise. I wanted to see the crew adapt to life again on the ground after their return. I assume that the writers predicted this problem by "loading the front" of some Voyager on the Earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this timeline has been eliminated, so everything is mysterious). I liked how Admiral Janoy died aboard the Voyager crew. As fans, we get our cake and eat it, by making Janeway offer the ultimate sacrifice and live. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self-conversations were strange, and she was easily able to cross the line to the camp. Luckily, Mulgrew (s) pulled him.
