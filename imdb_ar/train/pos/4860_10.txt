Damsel in Distress is fun because Gershwin's wonderful songs, unique Astaire, Joan Fontaine and a great support representative headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> A typical absurd plot of the movie Astaire as an American dance star in England with Burns as an advertisement for him and his secretary. They fabricated a story about being a love bug with women who are victims of his left and right. He runs to Fontaine, who is being held captive in her castle by an authoritarian aunt and a docile father. A silly plot. <br /> <br /> Great songs include a foggy day, things look for work, nice work if you can get it, and I can not bother you now. Fontaine does not sing, but he offers a brief (and fit) number with Astaire. Surprisingly a few dances with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including innovative fun and fun through the park. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montague Love, Harry Watson (as Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite favorite - Jean Dogan as the principal singer of the school. <br /> <br /> Yan Dogan is in the middle of the strong trio singing the Nice Work song if you can get it. Her expressions are hilarious. She was also a scene thief in WC. Comedy Fields, The Old Fashioned Way, plays the role of Cleopatra Beberday. <br /> <br /> A lot of abuse has been made of this movie because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, was so bad. The TCM host notes that Robbie Keller and Jesse Matthews have been considered. Yikes. Two potential disasters. Fontaine is as great as Alyce and Dynamism that allows the music numbers to belong to the Astaire, with a lively sense of humor by Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movie, great songs, good actors, and Jan Duggan in the rare spotlight!
