I remembered this as one of my favorite books as a child and I wanted to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the film would be released soon, so we went to the library to get the book and gave us preview permits for the next day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. This was not necessary. The only thing common to the book and the film is the first name of the main characters, the fact that there is a bet, a lot of wormy eating. Oh yes, I forgot that the child who cooks the most worms likes to present his masterpieces with a French accent. How children know each other, the number of children involved, how the bet happened, how many worms they should eat, the time frame in which they should eat worms, how they are cooked, the evolution of their friendships, climax scenes, etc., nothing is the same. But somehow, the film did not ruin me. All the characters are pleasant, and the film did not leave me disappointed. A word of warning to parents. There was one moment when I heard adults in the room breathing together as Billy's small brother pointed to his penis as a "dirty cock." The awkward part came when my daughter started asking who were sitting around, "Does anyone know what Dick DeLay is?" Haha. This and "shut up" accidental is as foul as this movie gets. My daughter thought she might get sick around the worm 3 and 4 (she was holding the empty nacho in her case) but she was okay from the worm 6. I really enjoyed the film and enjoyed a wonderful time sharing the experience.
