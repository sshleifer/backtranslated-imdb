Genteel, the quietly spoken drama of Steven Spielberg was his first real project in this genre. After his departure from his usual adventures / imagination, paved the way for his success in 1993, "Schindler's List". <br /> <br /> Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Alice Walder novel, the story relates to the marriage of a young girl who is struggling for a wildly angry farm and her painful separation from her younger sister, Nity. While the plot - about empathy, abuse, and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often strong and dynamic, it loses its way through the error of continuity and the scenario of imagination Menno Meyjes. "Purple" is sometimes difficult to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a bit wrong with regard to the time frame. This separator in scripting has costed depth scenes and details clearly contained in Miss Walker's novel. It is a real shame that Maestro Spielberg was not able to pick and correct these problems, because most of this show is a wonderful example of his talent as a director. <br /> <br /> The performances were strong all the time, and Whoopi Goldberg made his debut - which he has not met since then in terms of acting performance - as a broken heart that Sealy wants to be loved. Danny Glover offers strong support, although his film "Moses" was a great role for him in "Places in the Heart". The famous show by Oprah Winfrey comes not to exaggerate the role of Miss Sophia, the mental black woman fighting in her spirit for a terrible incident involving a white woman of the upper class. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (a co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) made beautifully filled points and presented some of the original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Khan is always as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows skillful skill in capturing some of the magnificent southern landscapes. <br /> <br /> Surely, this real heart issue will tear your eyes. Unfortunately, we are leaving many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, 15 January 1997 - Video
