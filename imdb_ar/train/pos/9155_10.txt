Who ever came the story is a sick person. We hired it because of our sleeping in the bad party and we all got the horror because we all had a semester together and we knew two representatives from the class. Besides everyone screaming throughout the night is terrible, I had terrible nightmares. I kept thinking, my God, if I could go to the bathroom to look around, I'd be stabbed in the middle of the survey or anything. I could not even go to the bathroom because we saw this horrific horror film. I also thought why all the girls are nude in this movie but we do not use the boys' units? You must make a horror movie where the killer girl and cut the units. I've been watching it over and over again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that. I just give this movie number 9 because you scared me.
