Steve Carell achieved a career of portraying a slightly odd straight man, first on the "daily show" and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Karel found a clever and funny text that takes advantage of his strengths. Karel plays the role of Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives a lonely life. Andy is a bit weird, but in a strange nice way. One night, while communicating with his co-workers for the first time, Andy inadvertently reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romano Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially annoy Andy. But it is clear that the three have a certain respect for the decent man Andy is, and they are determined to help him by helping him finish his virginity. And so Andy's quest begins in adulthood. Andy is the perfect innocent, and derives most of the humor from his naivet√© to the positions he finds in the film. Some of the humor is gross raw stuff, but most of them just a smart comedy well done. In addition, I found that some parts of the film are really moving because Andy finds himself developing romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I do not try to portray the film as a love story or drama; it's rolling in your comedy seats. Still, every good comedy I've seen contains enough heart for you to take care of the characters. There will be a good comparison of "Wedding Craters" earlier this summer. A virgin has the same humor, but she may be more attenuated in some jokes. I particularly liked the end of the film, which I thought was the perfect way to end the click. Without giving anything away, he reminded me of "something about Mary". Very light and pleasant. Makes you laugh and smile, which is exactly what you should feel when you finish the comedy. I would highly recommend it.
