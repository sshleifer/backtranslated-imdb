Hardly a masterpiece. Not written well. Beautiful cinematography I do not think so. This movie was not too terrible but it was not much better than average. The main story dealing with immoral adolescents should have focused more on forbidden romance and why ... it should have entered rather than essentially scraping the surface "because my mother says we can not" some parts should be completely dropped Or reformulated so as to be more important to the plight of the two main persons. I wondered twice if the writer / director liked the classic American graphic of George Lucas. It is not wrong to be a fan of this movie but to make a movie sometimes looks like this, I mean come on! The worst part is that Madchen Amick had a small part, I mean double Come on !! She was the only one, in a line or two lines, who had already tried a southern accent. (Hear well, there was even though her character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she was the star that others could follow and we had an original film. Well, what you can do when you have a way out is just a way out and not an artist as well. so sad. Overall I give this B-this being a little generous' cause I'm partial to Lady Amick.
