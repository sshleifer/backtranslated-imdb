A few films can be seen almost 60 years later, yet remain as wonderful as this film. Technological advances have never dated this classic love story. The special effects used are notable for the 1946 film. David Neven, Kim Hunter, and Roger Lipsy are doing a great job. The use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the film. He has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people realize his presence. It's my favorite film of all time. The wait and hope in the DVD version of this film for many years is, in itself, "a matter of life or death".
