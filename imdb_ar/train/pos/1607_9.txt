As someone else said here, every scene in this movie is a gem. Most of the films are lucky because they have a perfect scene, but director Jewison ran the house every time. The cast got the correct text, in addition to Dick Heyman's musical settings for opera and other music that were prepared to match the perfect. It is hard to imagine how they preserved the delicate mood during the long film production. Hidden comics (mostly), mirrors and camera work each little emotional reflection of the narrative. Sher is a natural comedy, Vincent Gardinia (which I often know through Frank Lorenzo in All in the Family until I saw him in this and then outside Broadway in the 1980s) deserves a much bigger starry than ever, Just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving fame to this phenomenal actor. Has Kesson ever written about this film? <br /> <br /> I would love to read it. It's hard to know why the average rating here is low in IMDb ...
