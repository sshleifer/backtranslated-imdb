The things you are dreaming of are hardly the pursuit of a copper ring by a naive swindler (JON VOIGT) and the owner of the lame companion (DUSTIN Hoffman), soon to form a friendship based on basic survival skills. <br /> <br /> A bold film of his time, an example of the kind of bold landscapes explored in the most graphic films of the 1960s. Ramsey for "The End of Innocence" in American films, because it was the only award-winning film to win the Oscar for best film. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is a male scammer who comes to the big city and expects to find women an easy way to make money when they fight on his body, but soon find that the city is a cool place with no welcome mat for him. He is a friend of his friend DUSTIN Hoffman, who undergoes a series of comic adventures that make him feel disappointed and bitter, ready to leave the cold water limits flat to the promised sun in Florida, the land of his friend Ratzu dreams of living there. <br /> <br /> But even in this final endeavor, the losers are the losers. John Schlesinger has worked brilliantly from a brilliant screenplay of Waldo Salt, and adds John Barry's "Midnight Cowboy" to the painful moments of search and despair. <br /> <br /> Summarizing: A truly American classic is a tough and bold subject to show the weakness of some aspects of life in the city.
