This is a fantastic movie !!! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time when it was released. I recently watched this film again and still keep my mind on it. It does not seem that many of the films we saw when we were younger stop when we see them later in life. The film is actually a wonderful example of the 1980s for the type of films that were produced at that time. Keaton is at his best, all actors have already done a very good job, and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the film along with forcing it. Quick movie speed with a few slow points and seeing cars from the eighties is very funny. I was from the 1980s I loved to see again. The movie is a wonderful movie for any of the lovers of comedy and lovers of the films of the eighties.
