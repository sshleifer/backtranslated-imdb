As I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon two years ago, and I was impressed by the landscape, I can only hope that this film, although it has beautiful colors and stunning landscapes, was picked up at the actual location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a wonderful place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, it's when I feel that Anthony Mann, who used the outside sites well, would have made the most of it if he was filmed in the actual place. James Stewart here is once again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help the people who are standing in his way to reap money, the other side is only unable to look at the people being killed. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care about her, Corinne Calvette is the beautiful girl. Man mastered the shooting, but the high point in the film was how well he performed in the outside scenes. It is used outdoors as much as it can, and it is helped by winter scenery, predominantly white, as it was with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the Browns at The Man From Laramie. Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional Western, with a variation in the most complex character of Stewart.
