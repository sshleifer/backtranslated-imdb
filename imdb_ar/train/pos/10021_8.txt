This tale, based on two pieces by Edgar Allan Bo ("The Fall of the Field of the Field Marshal", "The Dance of Death" (poem)) is in fact completely creeping from beginning to end. It's similar to some old black and white movies about people who meet in an old house (for example, "The Cat and Canary", "The Old Dark House", "Night of Terror", etc.). Boris Karloff plays an inventor with life-size dolls that frightens guests. I have died early in the film (or is it?) And the residents of the house are subjected to a number of horrific experiences. I will not go into much detail here, but it is definitely a must for lovers of old dark house secrets. <br /> <br /> See him with lots of popcorn and soda in a dark room. <br /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
