From modern feelings, it is sometimes difficult to watch old films. It is annoying that you have to watch a modeling librarian who must take off her glasses and become pretty stupid to win a man. Especially this shallow man is not diluted. He is obviously a player (I do not trust him to stay true to her) who does not want stability, and who only looks at the attractive women who are stupid and always describes them as "babies" (ick!). Even after she completely changed her appearance and her life for him, he did not go to her until he refused (presumably) to be rejected by another woman and learned that Kony had spent all her money in renewing his boat. I wanted her to stand in front of him, not after a pathetic chase! His sudden transformation within a few minutes was completely unrealistic and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Regardless of this sub-chart, I liked the movie. How do you like dancing with sailors with each other? (You can say they were from San Francisco ....; d) The "rehearsal" was fantastic, watching the Rogers Ginger deliberately fall into the Right Steps and it was wonderful. The last dance scene was "Encounter the Music" with beautiful costumes and a beautiful art deco set. I really enjoyed "seeing the sea" (although they used it a few times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a little weak, like most of the musicals (IMO) - the songs were good, but the dance was worth watching the movie. I wish they had shown some footage of San Francisco because that was supposed to be the film set up. <br /> <br /> It is also curious to watch a lukewarm sea film with knowledge of what Hitler was already doing. I must try to suspend all knowledge to plunge myself into a fictional land made up.
