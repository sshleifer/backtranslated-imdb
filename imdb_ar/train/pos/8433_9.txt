The acting in this film was wonderful, but it was mixed up with the fact that many Africans in South Africa were in a state of pain. It was good to have the writer isolate and protect us from others fleeing their homes, so that we could fully participate in their victories and defeats; the conflicts they shared as they grew apart and apart. Worth watching when putting the movie in its proper context.
