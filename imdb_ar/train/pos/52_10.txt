This film is incredible. If you have the opportunity, watch it. Although this warning will scream your eyes. I do it, every time I see it, and I own it and have seen it many times. The offers are great. It deals with darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world in a different way: a close experience, according to the English teacher. Also, if you see it, note the dramatic use of shadows and light. Home room is a huge movie, and I consider it a 10/10 - real - because of the good acting, the amazing plot and the annoying dialogue. Very tense, very impressive. It does not give all the answers, but it points to many good points about humanity
