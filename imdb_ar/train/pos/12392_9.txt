"The second beginning," as the title explains, shows us the beginning of the end of mankind. Long before the existence of the matrix, this short anime written by Wachowski shows us the world that can set us in the not too distant future, which began at the turn of the twenty-first century. The second renaissance becomes a common issue with human behavior. Greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> Using robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second renaissance is no exception to this concept, but instead of simple man-versus-machine planning, this story explains the conflict that the machines have faced, and the struggle for acceptance into a world ruled by humans. Where matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The answer to the second renaissance is part 1 + 2, answering many of the questions posed by the original Matrix film, such as how the war broke out, how the sky was black, which led to the use of humans as batteries, Called Machine City 01, which may be related to the forthcoming Matrix Revolutions. <br /> <br /> I will not give up much of the story, because I do not want to spoil the experience of perspective viewers, however, I will recommend it to anyone interested in the matrix world or simply anyone interested in Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
