This film was really eye opening. I have seen this movie several times. First, when I was four years old I actually remembered it, then when I was 12 years old. The whole message that the director conveys is that everyone wakes up and makes no mistake in leaving God out of our daily lives or just going to an extra mile to insult him. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie for both believers and believers!
