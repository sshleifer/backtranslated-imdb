Two years later, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are close to rock stars in the future but still need more work on their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted will be in public popular history, but then a wicked man (Joss Ackland) will be recruited to kill Bill & Ted by sending a cyborg look-like to destroy it. Cyborgs are sent to the last present and are already killing the real Bill & Ted. Now, both men are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, the Borrowers), he made a clever sequel with great visual effects. Much more funny and entertaining than the original. The Shawshank Redemption steals the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a wide distorted optical image (1.85: 1) and a superb 5.1-Dolby digital surround sound. DVD has a wonderful play trailer and behind-the-scenes features. This was the box office that was registered like the original but also (believe it or not), one of the best results created (depending on your point of view). George Carlin returns his role from the original briefly. Pam Greer also appears in a little role. It's a fun fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
