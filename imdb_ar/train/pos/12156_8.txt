Some of the background details of this story, too loosely, are based on real events in the era of the story. The story combines some of the details of the famous Leopold and Lopeb case along with a little of Emmy Simpson McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Amin (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) following the courtroom. The crowd seems determined to inflict physical harm because their children have been convicted only of a heinous crime. There seems to be someone in the crowd cutting Winters' hand as he heads for a waiting car. <br /> <br /> Soon after they arrive at home, they start receiving threatening phone calls, so Reynolds points out that they both move to the west coast together and open a dance school. The dance school has succeeded in meeting the needs of abusive parents who believe their child is Shirley's next temple. One of the parents of these pampered children is a very fond millionaire Brendolds and they start dating. Life looks very good, but when threatened phone calls start again, Winters flops - acting as if she is approaching a psychic pause and falling further back to religion - listening to the Voice of Sister Alma almost permanently. Over and over again, you see Winters on the edge of the cliff and finally culminate in very bad things !! I will not say more, because it may spoil this exciting and impressive film. <br /> <br /> This movie is very much like Betty Davis and Joan Crawford's horrifying 1960s movies like "What Happened" to Baby Jane? "," Straight jacket "and" nanny. "While none of these are exactly the intellectual fare, at the level of the falling art it is very entertaining and fun.The writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end which make it all very exciting. Reynolds plays one of the most attractive women of the age of 39 - plus she can really dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern about all this is that some find that Winters owes his extreme in some tacky movie The thing - like a cheap attack on Christianity - at first I felt this way, but when I met Sister Alma, She seems honest and unrepentant, so I took the religious vibrations of Winters as a sign of madness - which, I think, was all that was intended. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was encapsulated alongside "Who ran Aunt Rowe? "- another horror film by Shelley Winters from 1971. Both are very enjoyable ... and above all!
