In the winter, December 28, 1986, two bored young men, 14, rent a film. "Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting," "Who is this Jackie Chan?" , "Unheard of". Two hours after watching the movie, in a daze, we wanted to learn more. After 16 years (and I came out of the JC film collection!), The film still holds me more than anything else. Well, maybe I have a soft spot because it was the first movie (Cannonball Run is not !!) JC, but it's an excellent movie. It has all the classic JC elements, work, humor, work, heart and action! Some comments say they dated, were released in 1985, and of course have been dated! But then it must be jaw, Casablanca and Sengen under the rain and the godfather !!!!!! Without movies like Police Story, where will the Hollywood events be today? PS set standards, many scenes were stolen for use in other films. To really appreciate it, you should see it in the widescreen, you miss a lot of the film otherwise (yes, it actually drops off the bus in the corner!) If you have not already done so, look for this movie now !!!! <br /> <br />
