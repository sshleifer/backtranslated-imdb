On the surface, this is a post-war romantic comedy. Under the veneer, MGM is an iconic figure in the stunt game. <br /> <br /> The offers are clear, but all the second salaries are cast against writing. Margaret Hamilton (known as Wicked of the West), Edward Everett Horton (compulsive compulsive budget), Sage Roman (the enemy of Marx Brothers in the night in Casablanca, and always brilliant in the opera), the gang intends to combine Khayyatin instead of dismantling them As do their "usual" characters. <br /> <br /> He also enjoys many romantic comedy conferences, another indication that this can not be a "straight" romantic comedy, a brilliant dispatch of many post-war romantic comics and characters Two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once, with a break, so I can not be positive, but this movie may have been one of those that worked better in the context of the time it was made, but less successful now that "Viewers" see these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I suppose this is the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
