In September 2003, Johnny Kennedy, 36, died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Distrophic Epidermolysis Bulosa (EB) - meaning that his skin literally fell at the slightest touch, leaving his body covered with painful ulcers and leading to a definitive fight against skin cancer. In the final months of his life, Johnny decided to work with director Patrick Collerton to document his life and death. The result was a film that was first released in March and was an exciting, confusing and humorous story for an individual man. Not far from the bleak truth of the EP, the film was also a celebration of a lifetime that lived in full. Directed and produced by Patrick Collerton and premiered in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off became the most documentary of the year. Attracted about five million viewers. After the film, the audience donated more than half a million pounds to the Johnny Deborah charity. The Kennedy Kennedy Fund was created to raise half a million more to ensure that Johnny Kennedy left a legacy of 1 million pounds.
