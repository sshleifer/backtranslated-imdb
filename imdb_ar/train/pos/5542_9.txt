It may have been the best image manufacturers have ever made, this small piece of horror draws attention from first to last. Frank Weisbar clearly knows a good story when he writes a story, and most importantly he knows how to realize the full potential of the shock on the screen. Not only is the plot involving the characters beautifully drawn, but setup is out of this world completely! Almost every activity happens at night or in the middle of a clinging fog. This cool atmosphere is enhanced by the innovative Wisbar direction and the completely convincing performances that have attracted all of its players. The beautiful Rosemary La Planche makes a perfect, beautiful, passionate and complex heroine. Robert Barrett delivers his usual serene and direct image of local dignitaries, although it is hard to believe that the elegant and brilliant person who plays his son is only the brilliant writer / director of Leeds Edwards.
