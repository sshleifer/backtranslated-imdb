Spanish films have become, if not golden, certainly a silver age. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that takes people and their struggles seriously. Although the emotions are strong or almost in life or in the level of death, they are still not filled with the true sense. This may occur. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here, which have become connected. One relates to the backward girl who does not dare to pass the street to the next neighborhood. One of them revolves around a middle-aged woman who finds her life lover in passing. Another about the girl with drug problems left by her beloved. Still another about Madame's brothel finds (almost) true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. In Spain, filmmakers take women seriously.
