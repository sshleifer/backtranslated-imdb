Not many people like Bertrand blier films simply because they do not understand them. Simply because they are different types of people. <br /> <br /> If you do not live under a deep despair that is intertwined with a great personal hope, it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor set out here. <br /> <br /> Also, blier can not easily be classified as black comedy, cult, etc., like fantasy movies, etc. Given the sensitivity that the North American public often fails to appreciate. <br /> <br /> When I looked at these two "troublemakers" with Jean Morro in the sea-view restaurant, I felt they were more genteel than any gentleman could have been. <br /> <br /> The desire to make love like this is the natural reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of being symbolized by Cameroon suddenly appearing in Carrefour. <br /> <br /> So, les valseuses are much better than going to places. To dance a wealthy one, you must be elegant, but go to places you do not do.
