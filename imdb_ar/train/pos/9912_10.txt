Very impressive drama and first class Russ ... I highly recommend this film. Her performance, in my opinion, was an Oscar-winning article! The real sad truth here is that Universal did not see that this movie was ever available in any video format, whether it was a tape or a DVD. They are ignoring a very good film. But Universal has little interest in its DVD library, which is sad. If I got a chance to see this somewhere (I'm not sure why it runs up on the cable), check it out! I will not go into the story because I think most people prefer to have an opinion in the film, and that many "reviewers" spend hours writing about the story, and is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> 10!
