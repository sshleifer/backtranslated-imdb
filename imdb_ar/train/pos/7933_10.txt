Good working times with the Queiroz brothers, and the full representatives of the project as the "man on the bench". I was amazed at how well they did to capture all the specific qualities of a real horror film. We hope to have the opportunity to work with Pumpkin Patch Pictures again in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and I have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release. Once she was actually in the video shop and the girl curse near her lost mind. It was very interesting and it was the first real signing moment where the receipt took place. One day, the girl asked the blockbuster whether the movie was rented often, and confirmed it by searching for it in the computer. While he was renting more than Ring2 which was also a new release at the time ... the title really attracts immediate attention to the most urban markets. I also noticed on many occasions that the movie was not returned by the client, which led me to believe that the film is very good and people do not want to return it .... Watch out for ZoMbIeS when they are in the hood because they will get you! Jason Bar (Guy on the bench 2005)
