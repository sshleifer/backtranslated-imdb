Seriously, I loved this movie ... I started to read the book and loved it ... the way everything was prepared and everything had a purpose ... I think this film was good because Louis Sakar wrote the script. And of course Andrew Davies ... Xia Lipov performs a wonderful performance for his first film ... A wonderful story and interesting ... There is humor and heart and intensity ... It is very similar to the book .. I find this film is not less boring ... I loved him completely ... I encourage anyone to read the book .. in all this film was well placed and carefully designed ... two excellent for me in every single way
