This is a very interesting film following a rehearsal for Macbeth production in New York. Although he has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth Themes) in our modern world, the film works better when it does not take itself seriously. Well-known actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury play nice roles in the main roles, but the highlight for me is the funny scene where "Banquo" (John Elsen) was "killed". Perhaps a more enjoyable film for those in the theater, but anyone with Shakespeare should enjoy this film.
