Good movie about Downs syndrome. The mother has twins, one of them is very ill and the other is good but suffers from bleeding. The mother does not think she can raise him so they give it to some people who have 15 children 11 have a drop! The mother does not like this and believes that he must be with his family (I also agree) so they take it to court and the family is fragmented and the grandparents lose, and does not that really say if the mother and daughter makeup? I think this film is good but the plot is familiar, it's still good and it has a few unintended laughs!
