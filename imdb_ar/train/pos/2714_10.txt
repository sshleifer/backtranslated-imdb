This was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. Which I wish I had captured forever on the VHS. Would not the air be back ever? <br /> <br /> It was very creative and I remember it was broadcast once a week and the next episode was a painful one. I want to see it all again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not get. Not even on eBay. <br /> <br /> So, having screamed enough, it was by far one of the best serials of the 1980s. It must be considered classy but lost in space. At least this Wikipedia site mention it. Sob. <br /> <br /> He was quite attractive, funny, spinning and original. I probably do not like the original Sherlock Holmes, I think Quentin is more attractive and has a better chance with his master-more than the ruthless Holmes and Chalky.
