In Paris, the timid and insecure bureaucrat Trylkovski (Roman Polanski) rented an old apartment without a bathroom where the Egyptian tenant Simon Chol (Dominique Polange) committed suicide. Shelley Winters and the tough owner Zy (Melvyn Douglas) place strict rules of conduct and Trekovsky feels his atmosphere. At the same time Simon visits the hospital and endorses her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simon's death, Trekowski feels she is obsessed with her and believes that his owner and neighbors are planning a plot to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The story of "Le Locataire" alien is a disturbing and frightening story of paranoia and deception. The story of the process of insanity and the loss of the lonely identity of Tilkowski slowly developed into a nightmare atmosphere in the heinous location of his apartment, and what actually happens is completely unpredictable. The offers are great and Isabelle Adjani is very nice. Eight voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("The Tenant")
