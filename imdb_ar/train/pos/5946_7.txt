"Best World" is a unique project. It's a trailer for Superman / Batman Cross does not exist and will never, at least not in this model, with these characters and actors and plot line anyway. <br /> <br /> So the movie is one big tease, even more than the standard real movie trailers everyday. The trailer will noise you all for nothing. In this regard, I did not like this short project. When you watch this trailer, it makes you feel hungry and excited for more time and at the same time sad, and you may feel cheated afterwards, when it turns out that a full-length movie of this trailer will not exist at all. Kind of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place. Certainly to show the skills of Sandy Collora, but he could not do so with a real short film, such as his previous film "Batman: Dead End". <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this short film purely as it is, so from the perspective of film technique, it is really great. It's a great look and it's more professional than you'd expect at first, although people who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" will know better than to expect a short purchase with cardboard sets, cheap homemade fashion, and third rate actors. The picture does not look consistently impressive, and obviously the budget was not high-rise, but mostly looks fantastic and very professional, with nice costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> The short contains a fast and good model trailer build-up, with very few shots that pretend to be quite reliable but hey, it works well with the trailer style. It has some impressive stills but also some lame picks, especially Superman flight sequences. It was obvious that the man was standing just on a moving car, with a camera pointed at him from the angle down. So I found it ridiculous to watch it. But in fact, the best and most exciting moments really make up for it. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Haren looked like Superman / Clark Kent well, although he is clearly not the greatest talented actor around him. Clark Bartram reassembles Batman's role well again, and Kurt Carly seemed like an awesome Lex. The rest of the actors served their purpose well enough. <br /> <br /> It is particularly interesting to watch this shortly after the recent modern reinterpretation of the two major protagonists of this film, in the films "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns." It is interesting to compare the style and style of these films with this character. It's really amazing to hear Kurt Carley sound like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> It's a good-looking, well-made trailer that makes you feel hungry for more, although you know there will not be more. Whatever happened to Waner Bros plans. To create a Superman / Batman real full length movie by the way? I thought the developments had been going on for two years but nothing had been heard since. Instead, two separate films were produced: Batman and Superman; Batman Starts and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> 7/10
