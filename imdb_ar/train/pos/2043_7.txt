I watched this film last night at the Toronto Film Festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason I went to this movie was that he shared his name with the song Radiohead and also because my friend bought the tickets so I had no choice: it would be something like "Silence of the Lambs", but it turned out to be a flick. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters are loved, and this is absolutely true. I really could not have less whether the character of the botnet had gotten its sorrows apart from crawling. I was rooting for the homeless to make them alive with the botanical character that you just get from desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is rather weak, but again the aim of the entire film was to scare the crap out of you and did so with great effectiveness. The result was that the Bristol band called Insects were first class. This, more than anything else, really scared me of crap from me. <br /> <br /> The director was in a really decent class and was very fun during the Q & A session. I really hope to get better movies in the future. <br /> <br /> This movie is for genre lovers, but I recommend that fans try this anyway. It was an enjoyable trip.
