Oh wow. I saw this film in the Irish International Flade film in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available to ask questions afterwards. What a wonderful movie! Although this story was put in Ireland amid Catholic / Protestant rivalries, the story could have happened anywhere between two groups of people who hated each other. The horror of the speed with which people can carry them is woven when they have the opportunity to vent their hatred and anger with a moving love story mixed with humor and fun. If this person is not selected in the United States, it would be very unfortunate. <br /> <br /> As for stars and supporting players ... FIRST RATE. They call it Orla Brady Irish Meryl Streep. In my opinion it is better than Merrill Streep. They should call the American Merrill Orla Brady! Liam Cunningham's hard and strong portrayal of a simple, private man sucked into a political war was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
