It is loosely meant as a satire of D.W. Griffith was a fanaticism, the Three Ages was the first attempt to poster Keaton in a full length comedy show. The only similarities with intolerance are the spectacle of the opening "book" and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together in a full film. Keaton reasoned for this method that if it did not work as a feature film, it could be reduced to three rollers. Fortunately, the three eras have worked brilliantly as a comedy and contain some of the most poignant novels I have ever seen in any of Keaton's films. There is nothing unique or bold about story lines. They are simple schemes for boys, girls, boys, girls, boys and girls, but the spelling period is a riot and is a benchmark for the future work of Mel Brooks and all the films of this genre. However, I do not think anyone has topped this comedy. No one can play a darling idiot like Keaton and the thriller in this movie are some of his best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Berry as a rival to Keaton adds to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks that the comedy of 1920 can not be appreciated by modern audiences needs to watch this movie.
