**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Average <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go ahead Go ahead, make my day! ' <br /> <br /> The fourth in the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who is said to have produced most Magnum Force) and reinstates the violence community from the first two films. However, the film still lacks influence and credibility. The film was released in the early 1980s, at the time of Reagan and the young Republicans. The hypothesis of raped women who avenge their rapists does not appeal to this time frame. This plot was better for the outlet, which would have made it a good film. What I needed Sudden Impact was a plot like on Wall Street but with Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 Stars
