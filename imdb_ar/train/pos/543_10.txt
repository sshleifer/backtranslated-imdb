This movie is the best horror film, nothing. I like the way Stanley threw the women in the lake. I've been a fan of Good Nelson's work for many years and blew me away. It is a combination of horror, drama, romance, not much comedy. Sinister, but charming look caught me at the time there. To look at his eyes, I will never forget. There is something about him, I can not describe.
