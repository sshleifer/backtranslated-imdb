Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the real story begins, we get Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror), and a great movie begins. After that, we got some sort of collage of Michael Michael, as it was until Mon Walker appeared in 1988. After a few music videos too (Speed ​​Demon, leave me alone, etc.) the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is that Michael and his three friends (children) are being chased by the bad guy in the story of "The Big Master" because they have discovered his evil plans of getting children around the world on drugs. During the chase we see fantastic sectors, Forex. Video Michaels for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely wonderful in its own dance sequences, etc. But then, one of the children was kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will rescue her before she becomes addicted to drugs. /> During the film, see special effects not only amazing to the standards of those days, but also impressive today. For example, see Michael turning into a robot / spaceship in order to protect his friends! It's so wonderful! <br /> <br /> The film ends with Come Together (later published in HIStory's double Michaels album), leaving the film with a magical feeling. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend this to every family you want to spend a lovely night with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. Now some parents may stand up and say, "But Michael Jackson is an alleged abuser!" Yes, it's already, but, come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see ..
