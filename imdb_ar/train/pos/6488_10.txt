War is hell. But this documentary about World War II is paradise. <br /> <br /> This series is not only a charming and comprehensive look at World War II, it is a poetic masterpiece that Laurence Olivier has clearly and beautifully told. /> <br /> This document string specifies the type. It's a long time, no doubt, but you'll enjoy them all and want to go back more and more. (I have a serial on DVD and probably watch the series three times a year). <br /> <br /> Indeed, this part of filmmaking is impeccable. Unlike Olivier, the best part of the series is to listen to veterans tell their stories; whether it is an actual battle or to find a pig for the butcher's so they can get something delicious for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'll go and see it now (again, ...).
