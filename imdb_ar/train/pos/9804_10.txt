"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" revolves around the entertainment of animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> While still true with the sense of picture books, however, the animation takes place in a spirit that is lighter than that in the animated series. Bruce Wayne seems to be much like him before, but now seems somewhat less hypocritical. Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by Tim Drake Rubin, the youngest and youngest. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, evokes Batman's voice better than most of the live movement's representatives. <br /> <br /> Kelly Reba made a more vocal representation than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in Batman's live films, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the bad guys. My favorite at all, Penguin, is here. His design is more elegant than ever before, and more is heard about the portrayal of Burgess Meredith in the 1960s from Danny DeVito's "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stirrs is the perfect choice for the sound of a penguin. The penguin is finally portrayed as a wily development, just as it appears in the comics. Hector Elzondo's unforgettable "Bane" creates more than the forgotten version of "Batman & Robin". Finally, Batman has a puzzle to solve the problem, and returns the "investigator" back to "Detective Comics" (that's what DC stands for after all.) The revolution in ambiguity is a fast and delightful development. <br /> <br /> The result adds to the ambiguous atmosphere of the film. It seems to be a combination of the result of "Poirot" and the result of "Mission: Impossible". All in all, it is more entertaining than regular animations.
