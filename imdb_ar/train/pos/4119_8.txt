Another show of the genius of Kurosawa, his first color film is a dark surrealistic look at the tragic life of slum dwellers in Tokyo, essentially a series of interlocking short stories depicting several groups of people in a precarious existence in a shabby, . This film turns from comedy to tragedy and back to how people deal with the worst kinds of life in their own way, where most of them retreat to themselves and live in imaginary worlds of their heads, emotionally withdraw from their surroundings or drown themselves in alcohol. Kurosawa mixes realism and laundry with Kabuki plays, plays expertly with the feelings of his audience, and draws tears and laughter equally. Great drain experience.
