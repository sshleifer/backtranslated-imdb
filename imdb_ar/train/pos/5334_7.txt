See, although we do not want to admit it, we all have to suppress our fears about the possibility of extreme exposure to the events taking place in this film. As you know: I got into your car and immediately began to think, "My God, I hope that today is not the day my speed fastens at a comfortable 55 mph, all four door latches explode in closed mode, both crash main and emergency brakes, I can not turn off the ignition key, and I have a whole tank of gas; all at once.

This is not the case for the dreaded white-rimmed seat makers and the edge of the seat (if only in preparation for leaving the room), the Runaway Car, but they go ahead and lead anyway! <br /> I am delighted to infinity because I found (thanks imdb) that this movie is real and that I have not only dreamed of it. <br /> <br /> This film, at least, is one of the great sights you will see on your journey to find El Dorado of Very Bad Cinema. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this.
