I've had this film on tape for years and started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry - how ridiculous!) Mostly because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frank's music again. I ended up sitting in the first half hour, amazed at the extent of admiration in the direction, writing and presentations. The film is similar to one of 50 British stars: Cecil Parker, Michael Gow, Miles Malison and Duncan Lamont, especially Ernest Thesiger, who is as great as the old giant in textile factories. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Jane Greenwood, not personal players as such but lead charming, charismatic. This is science fiction in its purest form and comedy as well. A classic of all time, I hope no one will try to remake it!
