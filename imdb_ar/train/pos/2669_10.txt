This story, prepared in Wellington, New Zealand's suburb of Toa, is McCartney's first feature. <br /> <br /> With New Zealand's contemporary flavor, Via Satellite is full of very fun situations developing in the (adult) family context. At the same time, I was able to evoke feelings of deep sadness and despair. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting and humorous year films - not to be missed!
