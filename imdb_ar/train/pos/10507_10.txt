This game is amazing. Really, you should get it if you do not have it. Although it is old now, it was fantastic when I went out. I think this game will always be a classic. It's just as good as Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I sat and played this game for hours trying to overcome it, which we did in the end. It's not nearly as advanced as the Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fan of Mario, it's necessary. It's fun entertaining and difficult. All you can want from a fantasy game except for good graphics, (it happened well in 1996). Nintendo is the best!
