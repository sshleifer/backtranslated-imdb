As a citizen of Bolton, this film has a clear appeal to me. Fantastic site shots Bolton's show is very transitional - there are a number of default scenes in apparent default but this serves to show the city being rebuilt - and the idea that the old must give way to the new is at the heart of this film. James Mason leads a group of misguided characters to some extent an interesting collection in a story about a fuss about herring that turns into a large-scale intergenerational conflict and then a very difficult solution. Though I am too small to remember him, the details of Lancashire's life in the 1960s are here: recollection on Friday, songs about the piano, Sunday's constitutional newspaper, good neighborliness, the fear of courting the importance of self-esteem, and I am glad to see the most extreme lines Naughton from the play left intact. There is no doubt that this movie should be available on DVD - it is well done and most performances are well done.
