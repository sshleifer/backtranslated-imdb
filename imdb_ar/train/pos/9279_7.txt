The comedy drama "Jafar Panahi" ("Offside") depicts some women trying to enter a sports field in Tehran where women are banned. Official reason: a lot of foul language and soccer players show their legs. But of course, it is already a case of sexual discrimination. So most of the film consists of mild comic relief as women try to ask men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium, and even one woman comes up with her own plan to challenge men. <br /> <br /> As I understand, all of Jaafar Panahi's films (including) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA's downfall in 1953 to the prime minister and the subsequent support of the brutal Shah gave Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to create a chauvinistic society, and that George W. Bush's current policy towards Iran is an excuse to act with cowboys and tighten censorship. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is an accurate look at people who find ways to challenge the system. Not a great movie, but worth watching. Since all of Jaafar Panahi's films are banned, I wonder how he can make them.
