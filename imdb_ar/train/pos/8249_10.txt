Rabah. This film really shows the talents of actors. Billy Connelly reviews his muscles in acting. Truly an amazing man, if you look at him in absolution as a rebel, Bondok Saints is a madman / murderer, and finally in Vidu Zumbe! His character in Fido looks nice to the scary, very cool! Carrie Ann Moss is not a breakthrough! Jumping in the career of Matrix and Mumintu as a darker figure, to a passionate housewife in 1950! Rarely these days to see actors and they can not be loved. <br /> <br /> Now on the story (no spoilers, do not worry). This movie will make Max Brooks (author of Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z) happy with joy! Finally a good twist of zombie and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombie, or if you do not like zombie, or if you're just bored, or if you're too busy, look for this movie!
