I was delighted to see this beautiful film last night, with a wonderful addition to the Q & A session with the director who is watching. I think the first commentator never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. I've got many of these losses, and this movie talked to me. One of the main themes is how we do not deal with questions / issues / stories with our loved ones until it is too late - they are powerless or dead before that happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen to their stories and record, tell the people you love, and resolve your differences. I loved a message that there are no errors. I like the director filming the relationship between the two daughters - as one of the six brothers, it is clear to me that he understands the complexity of those relationships. His history as a cinematographer also comes out loud and clear - what a beautiful film! Fantastic check - movie not to be missed!
