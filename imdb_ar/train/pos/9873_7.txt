Lilly March, a little girl in Indiana, dreams of making her big on Broadway and her aspirations are lifted when her successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown on a visit. Lilly tries to do all she can to get Thornway to notice her, but he gets upset by her instincts. When Thornway returns to New York to view her program, Lily follows (of course unknown to John), and eventually Thornway gives her a small role in his next show, only for her family's benefit, but Thornway begins to fall for this young girl and romantic florists, Isabel Rikay, feel jealous. When Isabelle was tired of John Lilly's love story that caused friction with the show, she left and John decided to make Leila a star. Isabelle returns later, forcing Thornway to tell Leila that she has returned to her small role in the play, which may also endanger the romance. An extremely enchanting film, a refreshing change to see Garland putting the comic touches in her role (her reading of Ms. Macbeth, while she was supposed to be humorous, never threatened her lyrical career) lily rather than being romantic. The film must be fairly predictable and the scenes are not well combined, but a very interesting film. Evaluation, 7.
