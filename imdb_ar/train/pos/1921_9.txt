ABC has done a lot for this show by allowing two television wrestlers James Garner and David Spade to join the cast. At first, the show was fantastic and predictable with John Ritter and Katie Sagall. John loss shocked the world. Katie and the three children are really a professional cast strong. He studied the hour-long lesson after John's death in real life home to me. I lost my father at the age of 17 and I can sympathize with and understand their pain and pain. ABC should be proud to maintain this offer and even preserve it as John's final desire. This offer has matured and evolved because of these impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emis.
