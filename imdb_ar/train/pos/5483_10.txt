I enjoyed it a lot. "The revolution will not be broadcast on television." He has once again given me a positive feeling of the ability of people to decide for themselves how they wish to rule. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that 20 per cent of Venezuela's wealthy citizens have made decisions for eight per cent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when the coup failed. After the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the Ombudsman, the Electoral Councils and all civil rights, one of the conspirators did not come out of the fold and fired at them. They did not go to jail. Senior conspirators live in Florida, to continue. The protection they enjoy is the "Bolivarian Constitution" adopted by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. Not only history is biting. Democracy can give you a lot of hell if you leave it loose. In Venezuela, it is loose.
