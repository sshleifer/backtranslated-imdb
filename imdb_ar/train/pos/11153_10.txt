Big Vile, but naive, Joe Pack leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, heading up to Big Apple looking for women and big packages. In New York City, JB meets with frustration, and with Rizzo "Ratsu", a scruffy but friendly con artist. In a way, this unequal husband survives, which in turn helps both overcome bold, sometimes brutal, America on its way to painful ends. <br /> <br /> Both are funny and depressing. "Midnight Cowboy" is riding head-on in the spiral of cultural and cyclical change, thus assuring viewers in 1969 that they, themselves, had invaded the era of innocence in 1950 and fell, like Dorothy and Tutu like, in the 1960's Aquarius era. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie is great. Casting is perfect. Representation is first class. The scenario is crisp and convincing. Cinematography is engaging. Music enhances all of the above. Well, she won the Oscar for best picture of 1969, and I will sing it as one of the best films of that decade.
