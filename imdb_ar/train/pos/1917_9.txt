This was a wonderful funny comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katie Sagall were exciting for the parents, and the children were also wonderful. Cali Coco was a good choice to play Bridget, which was a toned version of Kelly Bondy's version of Married with Children. Both writing and presentations were first class. <br /> <br /> Sadly, John Ritter died during the series, putting an obstacle in things. They had to compete to change the offer and bring in more trained members. It was obviously an uncomfortable situation, but they treated it well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have lasted longer if Ritter had lived. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked him when they brought Ed O'Neill into a guest house. That was great. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
