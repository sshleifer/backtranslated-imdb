Watch this film in August at the 27th Annual Conference of the National Association of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the first public presentation. The movie is awesome! Derek Locke is as wonderful as Anton Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and directing Denzel on the money. See that opening weekend. You will not be disappointed.
