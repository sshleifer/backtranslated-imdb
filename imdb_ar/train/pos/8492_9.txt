Gung Ho is one of those movies that I have never been tired of seeing. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite for me, and he is very hilarious in this film. Matching his step to step is a good Watanabe. The two work together wonderfully. Although this film is a comedy, I like the way Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) are portrayed as struggling in their roles as leaders of their groups. Both are trying hard to keep peace, and finally enter into battle (which is hysterical to watch). First, both are on the ground. Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazehiro jumps on the table. Chase jumps on the desk with him. Then the battle leaks from the office to the factory. I like it after they are separated by workers, you can say they feel bad because they let things out of control. Also, there is a scene where you can see the impact that Hunt had on Kazihiro. He is at home and his boss arrives from Japan and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: Kazihiro: Tomorrow will not be a good day. SAKAMOTO: Why not? Kazehiro: The factory is closed and we can not find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not shoot Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this film because it's really funny, and it also shows how different people can not only learn from each other but also become close friends.
