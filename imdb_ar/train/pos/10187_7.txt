Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly Sholai. But you can not get a shulay every week. In fact, you can see distinctive signatures for "Not Without My Daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this film. However, as most movies go "inspired", this was a well-inspired film, handled well and well. Nana Battikar, as usual, tends to exaggerate hysterics, but all others deserve praise. Especially about Dipti Naval: I saw her after a long time, but she did not lose any of her grace. In fact, it has been performing much better when I last saw it. Another one of the Bollywood stars seems to grow more beautiful with age? <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful hour.
