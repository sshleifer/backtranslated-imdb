What will you get if you cross Matrix with Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've seen Matrix now. The creators of the matrix say it is "animation-inspired." Just from watching the trailer to this classic movie, you can see where they took the plot. <br /> <br /> The film was set somewhat in Japan in the 1980s, and it really shows. Fashion, music and words (in the latest English version of AD Vision) seem to have been pulled straight out of the age. I think it was made at the time too, but due to some plot points, this is no longer a history of the film! <br /> <br /> Since you may have guessed by pointing to the "matrix", the world is not real. It's not the 1980s. In fact, it is something like the 2480. After the nuclear war, the Earth's ecosystem (or "biosphere") was destroyed. The survivors who forced us to flee into space, where the conflict continued. Once the planets are abandoned (or "biosphere"), people began to live in the MegaZones - cities within the spacecraft, where, via hypnosis techniques and the Truman Show-esque illusion, they were forced to believe they had returned to Earth, In modern memory ... in the 1980s. When a young man gets on a mysterious motorcycle with an advanced appearance, he leads him to know more than he was supposed to know ... Garland (a bicycle becomes a mechanic), a 20th century weapon, helps Shugo escape from pursuit of the army. With the discovery of more and more about MegaZone, the war is nearing home, and because of the conflicts between the army and the computer, the war is also coming to MegaZone ... I apologize if those points are considered spoiled, but the outline is basically defined in this way on the summary. <br /> <br /> Feelings in this movie are superior to The Matrix. You really think the war is going on, and Shogo is so afraid of what he discovers. What begins as a cool blaze of Happy Operetta in the eighties becomes a tragic story about war and realism. These characters are real people, not the cardboard that we saw fluctuating in lead times in The Matrix. There is already a sense of suffering that people can go through after such a conspiracy and war. It may stifle you to the end ... I know that's what he did with me. <br /> <br /> The animation is impressive on its day, and the image quality on the ADVision DVD is unbelievable given its age. The style of artwork is beautiful and is reminiscent of the traditional and cultural anime. Be prepared for a lot of violence and blood, and there is also a sexy sexy scene. <br /> <br /> The ending can be considered as "there can be no end", like the matrix, or it is supposed to be followed by a sequel, which I have not yet seen. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is one of the best cartoon cartoons I have ever seen, in fact, one of the best animated films I've seen, and considered by many to be one of the greatest animations of all time. <br /> <br /> I should recommend the ADVision DVD, since their movies in English are unbelievable, the movie is done justice, and can be purchased through an artbox box for two complementary nodes when they are released, which will have the same loud sound. <br /> <br /> All in all, MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be firmly stuck and must be necessary in any group of anime fans. Heck, so my mother enjoyed it.
