I've always had a philosophy that everyone tastes different. I've found this movie to be wonderful and I think every college student may agree with me. Although this film is not a "film with a conspiracy," it is about real men and some "problems" they face. The film found Farhana (especially the parts in which they played practical jokes on each other). Simply put, if you're in the same "wavelength" like these people, you'll find this movie amazing. I do not think this will win any Golden Globes or Oscars, or people in this film will become future Hollywood stars, but it's a kind of "classic worship" among young people who can be associated with their experience. For me the most prominent man is Hans: the Scandinavian man, who, he says, "is not the viewer", but he gets all (or some) chicks. "Little People" also play a big role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If you continue to work, the spoiler is lost and I do not want to do so, just go and get the movie and you will not regret it. Give it 8/10
