Yesterday, I went alone to the cinema, because here in Mexico, most of the time, films from other countries are part of the so-called "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). But after I saw this film, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I enjoyed this film very much. In the end I was happy. This film is a small spoon of hope these days. The main lesson for me is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good choice to watch a good movie in Spanish ... I must mention good music .. especially the main song of the film .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... Excellent song! !!
