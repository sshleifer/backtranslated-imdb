I am a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the United States series were shown here (the original language with translation) and Batman was one of the first to take care of it. Unfortunately, panic hysteria among mothers caused Batman to be considered very violent. Geez, compare the innocence of that series with the stupid children who see these days. So because of my mothers who protected the 1960s, I had only the chance to see two or three rings! I was so frustrated that I started collecting comics and bubbles (I still got them) to make up. So I got a slide show View Master ... I had a desire to see the fascinated Crusaders. All children need a kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally had the opportunity to see a reboot as a teenager and I enjoyed it a lot. The acting in the tongue would have escaped me when I was watching him as a child, but I understood it at the age of seventeen. Yes, I've seen them all now and the good spirit that appears on the Internet publications is episodes because they did not release the series on the DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this evening "Going Back to the Bat Cave" ... it was a pleasure I was glad to see it because it was full of trivia and jokes. Adam and Bert's vision was a joy and this TV movie was simply wonderful on every side. They play for themselves as they play their part in this series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who produced this great feast "nostalgia" ... I will see it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: See! Rent it !!! Lend it to a friend! Buy it! I never expect myself to raise this on 9/10 ... I've done well!
