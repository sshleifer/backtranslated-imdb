The movie was hired as a joke. My friends and I enjoyed laughing so much that I went and found a used copy and bought it myself. Now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie, I offer them Sasquatch Hunters. It should be said though there is a rule that made the film much better. It is not allowed to talk while the movie is playing unless the words are repeated in the Sayquatch chant. I love credit at the end of the film as well. "Thanks for the pocket, Tom!" Who said Tom thank you because without your pocket, the film may not have been made. In short a wonderful movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie, look for something else, but if you do not mind laughing at the expense of a man wearing a monkey suit, extract a copy of it.
