"Lost", "24", "Carnival", "Desperate Housewives" ... The list goes on and on. These shows and a host of other high quality programs prove that we are in the middle of a golden age in the history of television. "Lost" is a pure genius. Incredible layers of personal stories are psychologically viable, confirmed by high-definition cinematography (incredible use of this word, when describing a TV show), a lethal degree, and wonderful performances and editing. Anyone who is not addicted to this is missing one of the most important creative expressions on television. You may experience problems when you watch only one episode per week, but DVD format is actually a great way to see it. I hope they will continue to do so (as I am sure they will).
