This is a wonderful film about the struggle of the Mormons and their final vote in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are particularly strong, and the message is one message we must all remember - God does not speak, but communicates, if we only listen. As I write this in the midst of the atrocities that occur in New Orleans and the surrounding area because of Katrina, I was particularly touched by the Mormons who had to leave everything behind and go ahead after Joseph Smith's assassination. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, but they could not. The Mormons' struggle to cross the country, the cost of lives, and the hardships they experienced were truly spectacular, demonstrating their enormous power. With regard to the actual beliefs of Mormons, this has not been addressed much, and polygamy is mentioned but not an essential part of the film at all. <br /> <br /> The cast is first class, although others who have commented on more about the actual characters can talk about the validity of the images. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donleaf, John Carradine, Jane Darwell, all master the writing they gave. <br /> <br /> Although the film could easily stand alone today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the team to get crowds in theaters to watch a film about Mormons. The power is wonderfully wonderful as a small Mormon, and Darnell, like Xena, is not a Mormon but stays with the family after her father's death. Power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when he has a great scene, and Darnell (who was still a teenager at the time of filming) is less, even though they make a beautiful couple. Their fate is still unclear as to their conversion, and one wonders about polygamy in their case. You can not beat any one for eye candy.
