Drama Tillman Jr. about the first African-American diver (Gooding Jr.), who challenges all odds and achieves his goals despite the tough coach bitter. The film script is not bad, very little sometimes, but the direction and the first-class acting, this film inspires and fulfills what it is supposed to do. I loved DeNiro in the foreground, although she is not on par with his ingenious work (taxi driver, godfather and all others) she is as good as his other good performances like King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always a persuasive and friendly, very good performer, Gooding Jr. Not bad, definitely one of his best performers. --- Rating IMDb: 6.6, My rating: 9/10
