This last Dutch film from Verhoeven made me laugh well. As a movie film looking for all the small details, cross references etc. In any film, I can assure anyone interested in the art of cinema that this piece entertains all the senses. I did not read Gerard Reeve's book, but I still think that we get a candid picture of a somewhat self-indulgent poet / writer who gets it (somehow - does not spoil here). The hero is surrounded by characters with mysterious intentions, as he is. All this in an excellent envelope film, Paul Verhoeven manages to turn the Dutch "gesellich (?)" Dutch into an impressive place, an impressive work!
