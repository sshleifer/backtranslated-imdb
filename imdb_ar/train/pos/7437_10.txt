Recently, I and a friend were discussing educational and moral influences when we felt in the 1950s versus today. According to Samuel Taylor Colleridge, who wrote, in 1798, The Rime of The Ancient Mariner. Both of us had to read parts of the epic poem in secondary schools and English literature courses in college. My friend said: "Even her messages can be called metaphysical in today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to read it and only remembered the pieces and parts. (I have problems remembering Dr. Suss.) I said I would get two copies of the poem so that each of them could read it. It was easy enough, but I was very surprised when I found it turned into a movie. We were looking forward to watching the movie to see how it was interpreted. After all, the Rime of the Ancient Mariner is not just a light read. After reading each poem, we saw the movie together. <br /> <br /> The film was a great achievement, especially since it was completed in the 1970s, before computers, before the so-called "Ken Burns effect", and before special effects often began to compensate for the lack of materials The 19th and 20th century illustrations are inspired by "lesser-known artists," such as Willie Bogani, the early Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> The film tells Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught the poem when he was a teacher, Power and credibility in maintaining the fulfillment of the poem. <br /> <br /> Mastery in layers of hidden messages, are transferred without "Toji "Or to become a clear and clear moral story, we found this refreshing change from the mindset of the day" in your face "and" beating them above the mindset. "Most of the ethics messages today in a film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and chaos are a bad sign. The Rummy of The Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual, personality, and appreciation to celebrate all the richness of his life, within the broader context of humanity, that is, man's ability to give to others. <br /> <br /> We are proud to have found these "unknown" gems, and then learned that she won the first prize in her fifth class out of six times at international film festivals "The Name". Another surprise was the film director, Raul daSilva, was recognized authority on early animation and the author of six award-winning books about the film. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is relevant today, if not more important, than it was when Coleridge coined the original epic poem and when Raul da Silva translated it into the film. If I'm still in high school, which I've done for five years, I'll hold it and show it to all my students. A level of wealth here naturally leads to a debate on the big and important issues we all face, both in 1798 and 1978 or today - in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual element. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
