"Most of us live in at least two worlds, the real world in which we live at the mercy of circumstances and the world within it, the subconscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With these words, Mr. Goone introduces the world of "Maxx" to a world where imagination and reality are combined. Inspired by the comic books of Sam Kieth, "The Maxx" is very loyal to the materials that were inspired not only in the story but also in the drawing style, which appears as comic pages, and gives this surrealistic show and unique appearance. But also, the story is exciting and entertaining. In moments it may turn out to be very strange, but when you enter it, it is hard to get out. The story and the characters were beautifully developed. The music perfectly matches the style and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good mobile presentations, this offer was short-lived. "Max" must see. It's one of my favorites at all times.
