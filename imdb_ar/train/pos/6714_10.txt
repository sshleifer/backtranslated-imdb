Why did you enjoy the show in the last episode? Because of the real talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her supportive representatives have proved that humor, comedy, light humor and deep thinking can actually coexist. The most I enjoyed was the fact that I was able to return home after a hard day, smile with a smile ... I was an inspiration ... and why? He was inspired to see this magical person was very happy while he was helping others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was a hero in my opinion ... although she was weak in ways that were not quite different from our lives ... to another very different; she had powers at hand, desires, and leadership that could be used For good or bad which may exist only in many of our imagination. Anything we see, teach, teach, possess or want ... for good or bad, and how we choose to define it, can determine who we are. <br /> <br /> I traveled around the world and other worlds with these fixed and unstable ideas in mind ... to learn, live, laugh and love. She has always learned how to improve her skills for everyone around; she made mistakes because she was living life, going through a different journey of growth, as she did, her dreams, and Salem (the playful, but incomplete hero) to show that even through mistakes, You can be noble, talented and wonderful. <br /> <br /> She has also shown many non-selfish acts, learning and love as she walks her way. If this is not enough reason for ten stars in this war-torn world, where people are very hostile to each other, and do not realize how differences are the seasoning of life and not the cause of death ... I do not know what it is. This show was definitely a journey to a better world as well as an inspiration to be ourselves the best and a gift aimed at breaking a smile on our pieces ... I've heard from a doctor before all that I mentioned above leads to a healthy "Hart" ... is not that what we need All of them? :)
