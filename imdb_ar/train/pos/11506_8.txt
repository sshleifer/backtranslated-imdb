"Kolchak" was a television series did not really fall into any category. Part of the horror, part of the comedy, some social consciousness that has been thrown out, and what we have is something I think people were not prepared for. It's really shameful, as I started watching these shows on Chiller, (I did not see the original), I realized how different they really were. <br /> <br /> Starring Darren Mcgavin as Colchac as international news correspondent, and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show was followed by the exploits of the Chicago News reporter, who is often a part of the story himself, The stormy city is about a creeping modern age that stumbles at night. The magic of Macgavin basically distinguishes the show. A rather clumsy man, always wearing the same suit, you can only love him. His wonderful jokes, and his successor with the skeptical editor, Oakland, are quite fun. <br /> <br /> The stories are mostly good, and the representation is very good. The 1970s were not a great period for special effects, and the show suffers from it, but if you suspend disbelief, what you have is an entertaining series that was before.
