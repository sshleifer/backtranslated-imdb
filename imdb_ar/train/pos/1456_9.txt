Documentaries of this kind are often of great opinion. It seems that this film takes away all opinions and allows the viewer to decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad how these poor people must work, this film is a great job to show the ugly side of sweat shops. Mardi Gras: Made in China A good way to show the world how a little thing like beads in celebration can affect the lives of many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this movie to separate the English language where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people try to eliminate them and helped this film to generalize the subject. It was a wonderful and very useful film and I recommend anyone to see it, it opens your eyes.
