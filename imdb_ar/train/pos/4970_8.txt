Some critics found this film dark, but for me there was enough humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the positive personality and the daughter's satisfaction are the constant center of the film, often paralleling the unpleasant aspects of the setting and shape. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the final outcome can not be predicted: I felt it could have gone both ways. <br /> <br /> By the way, many of the reviews I've read refer to the effective use of black and white, but the print I've seen, on SBS TV here in Australia, is in full color. <br /> <br />
