A beautiful and touching film deserves a wider view than likely to get. Simra Turan plays Aisha, a second-generation Turkish immigrant, trying to break the mold. Not at home with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, Aisha's martial arts experience has become a battle to find herself and has the strength to allow herself to be in spite of her family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthi has managed to balance the introspection and narration so that it becomes deep without becoming a great philosophical speech, and drawing on dance design skills Xian Gao pays off in an amazing battle sequence. In the end, however, the stunning performance of the first time in Semra Turan is what gives this film spirit. The attractive heart and martial arts skills necessary to make her personal drama believable are honored. <br /> <br /> Well worth your time.
