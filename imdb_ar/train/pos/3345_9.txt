What I was expecting: a rather lopsided stereotype of a man angered by sport and an equally lame stereotype of Gal who loves him yet suffering with being the second banana for his very enthusiastic support for his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: A parable story where both the man and the other - for themselves and each other - recognize that each has emotions in their lives, yet each can forgive the other to save the love that he shares. <br /> <br /> You look happier but with continued humor and great performances, this story works! Barrymore Classic Barrymore: This perfect combination of sweet, strong, and adorable. We expect them to do so. <br /> <br /> Fallon is a beautiful surprise in this film. It combines the ideal role of the sports mix with appreciation for the natural things in life, such as caring for children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He could be interested ("I ran through the field for me!") And at the same time blindly loved his love for Red Sox ("How did the grass feel?") At the same time. Photographing Fallon "Made" movie. We hope this film will be the beginning of a better career for Fallon, something beyond the typical philosophical humor of SNL (ie Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a film could fall victim to stereotypical males versus female characters that rose above this limitation and provided humorous lines nonstop, most delivered with exquisite precision by Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw this with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved her as I liked. It's not "Guy Flake" nor "chick flick". It is a flicker of laughter. Go see it!
