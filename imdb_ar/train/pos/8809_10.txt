This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film has been put together with experience and presents this disaster more than just an attack on American soil. The results of this disaster are previewed from many different countries and perspectives. I think this film should be distributed more widely to this point. It also helps the healing process to see something other than news reports about terrorist attacks. Some pieces are already funny, but not very badly. This film came highly recommended to me, and I convey the same feeling.
