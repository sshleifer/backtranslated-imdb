If I'm going to see a pornographic film, I'd rather have some sort of plot and genealogy. Behind bedroom doors is one of the few things I've encountered with those qualities. <br /> <br /> The next-door girl scams the human nature of neighbors and their weakness with regard to seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue, (meaning Brooke Lavelle) is the selected actress who plays the role of seductive blackmail, and plays a wonderful role. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and beautiful actress. The movie gets a total of just 10 for it's in it. Her partner in the film, Monique Alexander is a clear cutie. The two should do more work together. In this film, although Monique, who plays the role of Gigi, has little to do or say. This too bad seems to have more talent to share. I love the girl who was the next DA (Possible) wife. She forgot her name, but she is pretty looking, not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some people feel. It is clear that there are parts of them bought for it. It's okay, but have you finished? Sorry, but come on! I'm afraid that her performance here has dropped the rating some, except that Chelsea's talent and beauty ignore any negative. Overall, this film is a good idea.
