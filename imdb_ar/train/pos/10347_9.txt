A delightful secondary film, comedian and detective comedy, romance and drama like Lieutenant Kenny Williams (Milvin Douglas) balances his dedication to his daughters Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to power as an Asa investigator. <br /> <br /> This hodge-podge may not attract all viewers today, but on its day, it had something to offer to each member of the movie family, and the accuracy of the somewhat tired plot is original and refreshing, and worth the wait. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Mr. Williams" contains what must be among the most horrible blind dates in the film's history, and its bright comic luster. Ironically, Milvin Douglas offers some of the best lines: "I was walking down the main street in a Turkish towel before I let any woman control my life!" Joan Blondell gives her fugitive criticism: "Good grief! You look like my aunt Nili!" <br /> <br /> Solving the crime here is a standard fare, although a wonderful array of VIP actors help bring materials back to life. <br /> <br /> From today's point of view, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" may be the most interesting because of his insightful comment on gender as a socially specific construct, which is more flexible with regard to its seemingly solid boundaries. While much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle between the sexes, it is sometimes penetrating, playing not only in some fine detail of the film, but in the battle of species that culminate in the final scene.
