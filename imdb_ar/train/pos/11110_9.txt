I can not add a lot of positive comments here - such as great representation, balanced writing, multifaceted characters, the great antagonist of Tony's hero, and the great commentary on the American millennium. The combined use of psychiatry alongside Tony's mother's issues is particularly new and humorous. Many other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh's impressive history as a curious stranger, a brutal Ralphie that can not be fixed, Chris's dual desires in life, and so forth. <br /> <br /> I have to look at some of the criticisms, especially "it glorifies violence / degrades the Italians of America". Most writers and actors of Italian origin, are they attacking themselves? There are many positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco Chef, Dr. Melfi and her family and Cusamanos next to the soprano. In fact, Dr. Millie's former husband in the first season notes that only a small minority of American-Italians have ever had mob connections (certainly smaller than African-Americans involved in the crime, dare to say so. . <br /> <br /> Most characters do not really choose the life they have; family background or corner conditions are pretty much in it. The outsiders (even the Italian stock) who try to integrate into it usually end up with painful ends - Matthew and his friend in the second season, for example. If you criticize this offer, I assume that Frasier made you want to be a psychologist, or would Will & Grace make you want to go to homosexuality? You should not listen to rap music that discusses gangs, or that discuss mixing, or rock music that discusses drugs (or any other group)? People are not as stupid as some of you do .... <br /> <br /> Not everything is perfect. Many characters only appeared once, when they were supposed to be seen or mentioned at least in previous episodes - Tracy Dancer, Mido's friend, junior junior junior (supposedly for 20 years until split into the first season).
