Starlift is a fun and enjoyable rerun of all the stellar musical images that every studio exhibited during World War II. When you get stars like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, Randolph Scott, etc. In the movie, with people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn providing music, it's easy to take the film. The plot is not in the way yet. <br /> <br /> The plot involves two Air Force men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerty, in an attempt to meet Warner Brothers' Janice Roll star by using a gimmick. That both come from Youngstown, Ohio Harthy's father was a dentist at the base as well as half the town. The chart works very well as Louella Parsons soon placed it as an element in its column. Yes, Luella in the film as well. She must have liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner, who was patronized by more studio directors because she took advantage of this studio to publish her radio program at the Hollywood Hotel today. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot also touched upon Roman Roth's real-life efforts as she plays her part in getting her own studio and other shows in air force bases for soldiers and women going to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and lead in a show at Travis Air Force Base where a lot of this film was filmed. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris, who plays "See The Stranger," has been filmed for the first time. I'm a Texas guard with the help and assistance of Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked like he was having a wonderful time joking with his picture. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest cliche when she says she no longer makes them like this, but they really do not. Because you do not have a studio system that contains all of these talents under the contract. This is one thing about the demise of the old studio system that we can mourn.
