Perhaps I was one of the few Australians who did not watch tennis when the series was broadcast. I have to say when William Mackins appeared for the first time even though I'm a crappy actor! But as the series continued, he played down his performance and loved him completely. He was such a rotten man but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Spears (Heart and Bone, Monty Full) and Tom Long (Si Chang, Yadan). It was interesting to see Speers play a nice, quiet and more interesting man to watch the muscles of Tom Wongs undulating! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a complete shock and really brilliant. The exhibition was stolen. Martin Sachs was also good in a small role, where the lead actress made an entertainment show. I recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a touch and watch Tom Long walk around without a shirt ...
