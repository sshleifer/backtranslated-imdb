Music entertainment where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 for a floating crap game, so he lures Sky Masterson to try to get a Salvation Army girl, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> After 5 years, Simmons will be in the missionary again in the fabulous Elmer Gantry. There she was Sharon's sister and here is her sister Sarah. Same mood, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is that devil Nathan Detroit. He has worked with Vivienne Blaine for 14 years, and usually dislikes his game in gambling. <br /> <br /> In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson played the role of Marlon Brando who has already performed here! <br /> <br /> The movie is saved by the super dances design. The singing routine and dancing are wonderful. They particularly recognized Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> In general, it's a very cool production.
