This documentary about Schillkmister and William Castle takes some cheap shots in the naive "50s and 60s" environment where he did his most distinguished work - a look at the ridiculous and ridiculous people wearing ghostly glasses - but he is also affectionate and lively, with a particularly glowing comment from John Waters, Who was the target audience at all for such things at that time, and Kassel's daughter, who loved her father and was also very much aware of how he handled his craft. (We never discovered what became of the descendants of the other castle). The films were not very good, I made it clear, but marketing them was wonderful, and he seemed to be a family man working hard. Fun people continue to appear, such as Diane Baker from the thrilling "Protective Jacket" and Anne Helm, who was replaced by Joan Crawford. Daryl Heckman explodes in laughter on a happy anniversary to work with Castle on "The Tingler", and there are enough shots to give us an idea of ​​Castle's talent level - not very high, but very lively. Have a fun look at a time when the audience is happier, which makes you feel nostalgic for simpler days of movies.
