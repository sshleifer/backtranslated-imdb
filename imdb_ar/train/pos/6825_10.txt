It exploded at all on John Cassavet's opening night. It is his first film that I have seen on a larger scale, so he feels more mainstream, but he still does not feel as if he has established himself more than in his previous films. Maybe this is what makes them so intense. There is also something undoubtedly distorted about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, he has made Cassavet a key factor in his career, which he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here to express it in front. The character of Rolands, middle-aged playwright Myrtle Gordon, can not prepare herself to play her role in the next production as it is written, so she follows the impulse well after the rush, leading to what appears to be chaos on stage, until you find the right mess . It is a boldly abstract introduction. <br /> <br /> This film does not fail to capture the innate direction one undergoes during emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does a lot of what it does, looks at and is portrayed as something destructive, yet it may be the best thing for her. It may be cleansing instead of breakdown. The withdrawal, the cocoon, the rebellion, all this culminates in a collapse. Cassavetes gives her personality a real, brutal touch, which is that early on, she argued passionately that she has no common denominators with her personality, yet she is calm but emotionally eroded that the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> The final scene, the climatic performance that Myrtle shares with a distraught figure about the person she is acting with, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, challenging, rewarding and enjoyable moments I've ever seen in a movie.
