This is my favorite movie of all time. I've seen him at least 10 times and cried every time. My family begs me not to watch them so I will not have a screaming fit. I think I like that this is a real story written by Anton himself as much as I like the film. Acting is first class, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite film to date. She took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most expensive little boy I ever met. It has now been adopted by a wonderful family that has fought for it for nearly two years. I watched this movie while the battle was still going on and its future uncertain and I am very happy because it is safe and loved. I am very happy because Anton is happy and found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about him and how he has been since meeting with his family. I can not say enough good things about it!
