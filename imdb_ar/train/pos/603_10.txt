Albenez's music excels in this film. It runs from time to time using original musical instruments (such as piano, but never plays an orchestra), but is often re-played with various contemporary bands (such as guitar) and treatments (such as piano music). Sometimes, music is the only focus of the film: the vast majority of the time the music is tuned to different dances, often flamenco, but not always. I think there are 12-14 scenes, not united by a conspiracy. Not all scenes will reach a peak for individual scenes. In my case half of them reached the top, although all the rest were in their own way. Those who worked with me took me to aesthetic delight; indeed, the last scene left me with tears. And in a very magical way bring you the depth of Spanish culture. If you do not like translation, do not worry. The film is almost non-verbal, although each scene bears the title of piece Albinis. Watching this very beautiful film sharpens my skepticism about the lack of sora movies on DVD in the United States. I think here in particular of his Carmen Flamenco, a great piece of art available in Europe but not here (European DVDs will not play on US DVD players). This is a scandal.
