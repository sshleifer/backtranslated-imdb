I was fully engaged in this film from first to last minute. Filmed brilliantly, with lots of interesting and original camera angles used. The plot surrounds a deaf woman chosen by friends and colleagues alike. She employs an assistant at work, with her real intention to find love. He is a former con man who takes advantage of him in retaliation against those who hurt her. In turn, you should help him in stealing require lip reading skills to pull them out. The film transcends its role in a dark film, with two truly excellent scenes and a better ending. The real beauty of this film comes from the way in which the director exploits the leading personal disability. The use of sound keeps the tension steady, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keep the blood pumping, which is for sure. In the small black comedy and erotic thriller sounds you've got to put a great movie. It's a kind of film that Hollywood really wants, but it can not.
