Overall, I totally agree with the Ebert review. In a sense, I feel I should not even comment because it's a great film for the vet and I'm not a vet (I was resistant). The drawback is that Martha is poorly backward and does not behave consistently. I think Steven Metcalfe is a veterinarian and has spent little time planning her character.
