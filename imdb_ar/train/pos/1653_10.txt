I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best kind of "spy". My husband and I were intrigued by it when it first aired in the United States and I watched every episode. I tried at that time to buy the serial (I filmed it in full) but WGBH told it it was not available. So I thought of writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complex plot.) If the original version is available on a DVD, I'll be among the first in the queue to capture a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable Bernard Samson was weak but courageous. (It's always amazing.)
