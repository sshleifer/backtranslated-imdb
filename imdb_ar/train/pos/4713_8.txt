One whole, this film is not perfect. Do not "hang" together because the story line is a set of hooks to hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a little "Eighties of the Qur'an" and tend to update the image. <br /> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know that the movie has something special when you and your friends still point to ridiculous quotes from it more than two decades later. In addition, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Joe Pescapo, Peter Boyle, Marilo Hinner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunn, and one of the last roles of Alan Hill Junior, Skipper of Gilligan Island. <br /> <br /> Also, there are some ridiculous moments, such as when Johnny names puppies with a pricing gun, or the pope appears in Johnny's neighborhood. Also, the scene where the fake priest forms a lot of excellent Latin words. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio louda ... Post meridian, ante meridian, Uncle meridian"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney Slaughtering the English Danny Devito and urging Griffin without to "play the ball" Peter Boyle thinking he lost his manhood VD fake film <br /> <br /> This film is not from home . But like "Porky's", it contains a sufficient number of classic comedy bits to make it memorable.
