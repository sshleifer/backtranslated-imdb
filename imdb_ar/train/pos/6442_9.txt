This is a wonderful Swedish film .. It was the first Swedish film I saw .. It is simple and deep .. What a wonderful mix! <br /> <br /> Michael Nickvist has performed brilliantly as one of the most famous viewers to search for peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Halgren was as wonderful as his inspiring girlfriend to help him continue and never surrender. <br /> <br /> The battle between Mosul and a hypocritical priest loses his fight with Michael when his wife confronts him and defends Michael's noble cause to help the people of his hometown find their own peace of music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the end .. This was not good but it has some deep meaning.
