Watch this movie on DVD yesterday and was blown up and shocked. The unimaginable thought of DDL affected my mind, and I was surprised by the fullness of the representatives and his wonderful actor. The whole character was very authentic to me, DDL had already taken Christie Burns and Brenda Fricker to his mother. Go to see him! You will cry your heart, but you will know the wonderful respiration! Moreover, it teaches you one important lesson: Design is everything. You may be paralyzed in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you are strong enough, you will not face any problems at all. If you can only turn your left foot, it is still good enough to be a painter or a writer. The worst thing you can do when faced with a mental challenge is indulging in self-pity. No one will take you anywhere and the only person who will pity yourself.
