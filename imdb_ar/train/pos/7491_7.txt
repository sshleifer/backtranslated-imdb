Years ago, I found a copy of "Ben Bargaining" from this film versus a buck or two. In many ways, this is quite appropriate, because when it was introduced in 1933, it was really a cheap film studio through the "Poverty Row", Majestic. However, while the film is fairly derivative, it is still worth watching and provides some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very familiar, as in some Germanic cities, people are upset about some recent deaths that seem to be vampires! In addition to this familiarity is Dwight Frey. Reynfeld has played in Dracula, and here he is much like him - even though he plays a more damaging eccentric. In this case, he is obsessed with pet fights and people start to blame him for the deaths. The film does a good job of providing some "red herring". While it does not take a genius to know Frye may not be responsible, the WHO and why they are curious and make them very different from the medium horror film. In addition, while production did not have much money to talk about, he still had some good actors in the day - Lionel Atwell and Milvin Douglas - and also used Universal Studios at night (when they were filmed during the day). As a result, the film looks good in general, although I also thought, as usual, that Fay Wray was terrible - I thought it did not detract significantly from the film. I've seen her in a number of movies more than most people on IMDb and I've noticed that her characters have no depth - they always seem to be represented as "Lady Scream" and offer very little in every film. <br /> <br /> In general, for old horror movie fans, this is excellent and worth watching. For people who are not lovers of this genre, it is likely to be wonderful.
