I deal with movies that talk about animals carefully. For every great person like Babe, you will get as poor as the horrific version of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea about a movie that does not live up to its potential. When I heard about Pauli, the premise of parrot is not entirely believable. But I found the movie pleasantly surprised. He is able to sneak into your heart without realizing it. <br /> <br /> A Russian concierge, Misha Filinkov (Tony Shalop) gets a job at a research lab. One day, he hears singing coming from the basement. When he does, he finds a parrot in his cage singing his little heart. Misha is fascinated by the birds, especially when the parrot can not only sing, but can speak. Not some phrases either. It's a parrot you can have a conversation with already. <br /> <br /> The parrot is named Paulie (pronounced by Jay Moher), and recognizes his discarded colleague in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in the cellar of Meterb, she persuaded Misha Polly to tell him the story of his life. All this began as a child, and in the care of Mary, a five-year-old girl stammered. The two of them became feather birds (well, bad game!). <br /> <br /> When Mary's parents became worried about her close friendship with the birds, they thought of sending him away. They finally did so after Mary nearly hit herself in the fall after teaching Paulie the flight. After being desperate for reunion, Paulie begins a long journey through America, which includes a variety of new owners, flies long distances, and ends up behind bars. From the cage represents! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of a number of animated DreamWorks animated films in the late 1990s. Although she has not received the same appreciation or success as Babe at the box office, Paulie succeeds on several levels, an occasional work of brilliant intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's method of following up the acting situation is perfectly appropriate for the Pauli part. He does not play the role as arrogant, even if he is a little smarter than Alec. Paulie is mundane, but he is also naive in his way. <br /> <br /> Since he lived a somewhat protected Mary's life, when he was moved away, he had to defend himself for the first time. When it falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paul that he will not reunite with Mary, which he believes. Just to break these promises over and over again. <br /> <br /> Polly is recognized as accidental. It follows that Polly selects selectively, and how slowly approaches Mary. He first ended up in the pawn shop, where he was adopted by Ivy (Gina Rowlands), a nice woman who learned the meaning of morality. Sympathetic to Pauli's position, she leads a RV across America to find Mary. <br /> <br /> Polly is a very moving film at times. Watching with Ivy is some of the best. Fantastic moments of Pauli sitting on her shoulder singing numbers Tom Jones. The way you instill the need for hope is great, and some dialogue is written well and thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> "There are things in your life that are postponed because you think I will do it later, but the real thing Ive taught you is that you have to live as If there is not yet. "<br /> <br /> The scene in which Evie is on his way, leaving only Paul alone to detonate the heart. And the sequence in which you gain the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, the spectacular rise is a scene of the most beautiful scenery and stays with you for hours after the film ends. <br /> <br /> Despite the occasional sad moment, there is a lot of laughter. Pauli is located in a group of parrots in an outdoor Spanish restaurant. The moving effects here are truly excellent, with four birds performing a perfectly designed dance number. And Paulie gets so romantic. It is intermittent when it falls with a small thief (played by Moher as well). This may be the only complaint I have. Once you feel comfortable about a situation, the movie then moves to Paulie to another location. <br /> <br /> The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATMs is funny, but also troubling. I was surprised DreamWorks got a chance to incorporate such a scene into a children's film. A robotic robbery diamond is a very impossible task. He signed the film, and shipped it to the lab for animal testing, where he remained since then. <br /> <br /> The story eventually comes in a full circle in the laboratory, where Misha undertakes to help Polly. Of course they found Mary. But the last revelation is a scene of this terrible intensity, I have been left a few minutes. Paula may not get the longevity of Babe's life, but I think it's just as wonderful. The same laugh. The same effects are flawless. And the same sudden intelligence. <br /> <br /> A simple gem.
