The basic premise of this film is simple as well as the text: The elderly Muslim gets his teenage son to lead him in an old vehicle similar to him from France to pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that he can fulfill his sacred obligation before he dies. The father is obviously religious, but the son is unaffected; he accepts his father's motivation rather than commitment to religion; he prefers to be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in a lot of things that the son does not understand and the reproach between them is the organ that keeps the drama, although it is often annoying. However, like any good road movie, there are strange characters you come across all the way. For example, a woman in the background in Croatia, when requesting directions to Belgrade, simply gets the back seat and points out that her hand speaks of one word that is supposed to be a place but can not find it on the map. In Bulgaria another man asks for directions stating that he is able to speak French and then gives an intensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also teaser from time to time - in one country the son is tired of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they get a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) runs away before the father can perform the Muslim ritual. In the end, they reach Mecca - the Islamic equivalent of the Vatican but on a much greater scale. For Westerners, all this is strange but wonderful. The film is not sophisticated but enchanting in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with the soul.
