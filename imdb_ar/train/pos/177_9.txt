This is a good feeling film and nothing more. So, it's great fun to watch. Make sure they float on political issues. But what about it? I'm sure they were not trying to make a "good night and have a good luck" here. Let's not try to make it anything else but what it is ... light fare. <br /> <br /> And very fun at it! <br /> <br /> Do you remember the shape of 1984? We have become very sophisticated according to the media as we see it or not. I tend to disagree at this point. Goldie realized that it was fun and went ahead and did it. <br /> <br /> Like her lighter fare: Protocol, Overboard, or Haustr, or Wild Cats, or your Benjamin, looks like Old Times, Playboy, and Death becomes known as the first Golds Club, and the First Wives Club, for what you do ... She plays every role in the camp where you can get out of it! Goldie knows herself very well and knows what she can do well. <br /> <br /> She always pushed me to laugh and innocence. I loved it at Laugh-In and everything was in it at all. She has never tried to be anything other than who she is ... and this is that laughing girl and the neighboring girl who happens to be very beautiful and has a smile and laughter that will always frustrate me and remind me that life is too short and you have to be quiet before you know it .. You are old and wrinkled and suffer from one of life's inevitable diseases. Even if it is too late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a beloved and comic actress.
