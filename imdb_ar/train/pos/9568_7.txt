Some of the comments here were compared to the IMDb Dog Bite Dog in the classic Cat III movies of the 1990s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very pessimistic, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang is not really corrupt, intimidating, or thrilling. However, it is still a punch that makes it worth watching, especially if the bravest act of courage is something of your own. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays the role of Pang, the successful Cambodian man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of the judge; Sam Lee Lee Huyi, the harsh policeman who is determined to track him, no matter what the cost. With Wai closing on his goal, Pang will not stop for anything to ensure his escape? So meet with Yue, an illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life from abuse. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog is one of the fans of watching extremely violent Asian violence (think of a great cinematic drama, stunning soundtrack, an embarrassing degree, strong shows from Chen and Lee) and newcomer Pei Pei As a love interest Pang.) Similar to Triple Revenge Chan Walk Park). Stabbing, shooting, and beating mercilessly: All this happens regularly in this film and is tirelessly captured by director Chang. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the kind of tale that is supposed to have an unhappy ending for all concerned, and certainly, everyone dies in this movie (fairly bad deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between the tragedy and the comedy (unintentional), and in its final moments, expressed by Dog Bite Dog: In a very surprising final scene, Pang and Wai fight while Yue looks pregnant. In the end, after all three suffered severe stab wounds during the fights, Bang injured a Caesarean section on Yue (now dead), delivering the moments of their baby before dying himself. <br /> <br /> While this film may not be a "classic" part of the Hong Kong surplus, thanks to its tremendous activity in OTT and its stylish images, it is still worth searching.
