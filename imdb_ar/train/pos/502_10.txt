Well, this will come a few weeks late, but it's here. Mostly, this is due to different negative nature data. Starting with technology. When Star Trek ran: TOS, the special effect technique was very low, and more, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper drafting. In the 35 years following the introduction of the TOS, the Star Trek crew became experts in economics. <br /> <br /> In the end, they decided, in my opinion right, to give up the form of TOS and reflect TNG et al. What if they decide not to remove the carrier from the luster of gold or to make the revolvers appear closer to those in Star Trek II? As for the lice being picked up around the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed, based on comments made by Kirk and Reeker, that the Earth met only Clingon in 2200. Nothing was firmly established. <br /> <br /> Enterprise gives us a promising exploration location that we have seen for some time. This is what Voyager was born. No series can develop without some contradictions, but be thankful that Star Trek has little. So, leave constipation and enjoy.
