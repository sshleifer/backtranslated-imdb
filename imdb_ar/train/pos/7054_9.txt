I thought this film was much better than film critics. Although it contains confusing parts of the chart, it does not interfere much with your understanding of the film. However, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, this film may not be right for you. I thought all the actors in the film were wonderful. Each character has funny moments, and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival was laughing all the time. I thought the spelling was a boy on top in a certain area, but it was done deliberately. John Kozak is right in that although it was prepared in the future, it makes you really see the present.
