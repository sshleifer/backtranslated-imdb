Zero Day is a film that only a few people have seen. What a disgrace. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, where the main characters descended on the room and killed people mercilessly, then committed suicide and made me hold my stomach. I was trembling, that's how strong this film is. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It is incredibly incredible not to get a perfect ten. It is sad that few people understand the real beauty of this film. It's not a budget that makes the film good, but how much filmmakers feel it makes it good. <br /> <br /> It leaves a lasting impression in your mind that you can not get out of it. Makes you realize the real horror of shooting - especially if you know this person, this movie makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it. I am 14 years old and I feel this film is so amazing that it can not be put into words. You seem to be seeing something that has already happened.
