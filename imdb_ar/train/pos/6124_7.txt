This movie is as idiotic as hell! I think he wrote as a serious film, but when it was time to shoot, Michael Connie said, "Hey, let's have some humor and spice!" The characters actually put a little, too. Oh, the death sequence is the best. One thing I hate, despite the dryer weapons. What was all that?
