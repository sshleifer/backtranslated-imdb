This is one of the few films I consider to be a movie improvement in the original book. The story is clear and accessible, entertaining and interesting and musical numbers are undoubtedly exceptional. I liked the periodic delivery of the Old House Guard and the charming Portobello Road, a wonderful mix of early animation techniques + real actors that, although dated, do not detract from the charm of the piece. The background to World War II worked well and was not deleted at the start of the film, which is often the case in the "evacuation" stories. <br /> <br /> It is a film that is often underestimated and does not produce end-enjoyment for people of all ages. The performance of actors is exceptionally good and the entire text is linked together well. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
