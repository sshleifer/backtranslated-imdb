It's hard for Faye Grem to be incoherent and angry, but Parker Busy is the only actress who can take this story and do it. It's at once touching, funny, cunning. Its supporters are also committed. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you the plot. It includes characters from Henry Foley in Hartley and tries the story of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue with its understanding. In a sense, absolutely silly. It becomes more and more silly as you fall along. (Resist the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Faye Grimm needs to attend an adventurous film willing to deal with something that is not like a bunch of cookies. In the end, it offers something defying description.
