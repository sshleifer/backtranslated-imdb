I was pleasantly surprised by the film. The assumption does not seem particularly attractive when you have to hand over money for a flick at night, but it has a simple character to win. There were no moments when I felt distressed, and I doubt what moment I will remember the next day, but this does not fail as a gentle conversion. What I found funny is watching it here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who does not understand anything I like. I told her that there was a conspiracy - three men had to return some herbs to London. Barely satisfactory to her. There are no stolen operations here for the camera I was expecting after reading a number of comments. I do not exclude that with the comparison with Withnail and I; not in the same league, I doubt it was intended. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
