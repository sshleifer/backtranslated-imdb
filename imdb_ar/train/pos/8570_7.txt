I noticed immediately that this film was not based on Dodi Smith's novel. Anyway, it was a beautiful idea that the son of Pongo and Perdita now has his own dogs. The Dalmatians were, of course, a little snowball that was completely useless until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely. In fact she has often thought of becoming a friend, but now that she has quickly turned to "herself" again and announced that she was a croela again, she almost started to feel really worried by Dalach Klawi> <br /> In fact, In it were the puppies of Lady and Trump while Chloe and Kevin were having dinner, it was much better than I expected. I was also fond of a parrot who played to be a dog, and it was incredible that dogs learned a lot of tricks for this film. <br /> <br /> Of course I was convinced that in the end the Dalmans were rescued again, but I wanted to know what would happen to Carola after she lost her property completely. What can a dog house do on earth with such a huge amount of money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was very impressive that Snowball also had locations at the end of the movie.
