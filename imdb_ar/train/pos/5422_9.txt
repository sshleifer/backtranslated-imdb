The story of the pariah who acted as a great soldier, and saved the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, was recounted in the 1939 film Gunga Din. The film is based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, directed by George Stevens, stars Carrie Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McClagin. The role of the title is Sam Jaffe, known in my era as the head of Casey's son, Dr. Zorba, a name that has become synonymous with the great poetry out of control. Say "Doctor Zorba" to anyone from my generation, and know what you are talking about. <br /> <br /> In India at the time of the British occupation, three soldiers - two broken Romanes in Grant, Fairbanks, and McLagen as a great force - are in fact a teenager - in fact, three grown children. Gunga Din is a water carrier, somehow treated - verbally, anyway - by McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) is fond of him. When he holds a religion (pronounced fat) as he trains to walk to his soldiers and salutes while he is drawing lots during the exercises, Kater gives him some pointers. <br /> <br /> The cavalry fraternity will collapse when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that he is about to marry a beautiful young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leave the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter run across Thugees, a murderous cult led by a teacher (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, Ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save Cutter. It's a friend film anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie "Gunga Din" begins with disappointment, through a thrill and a wonderful and extensive comedy, especially by Carrie Grant, who is very funny. Both he and Fairbanks and Seaman are very hard to decide which one to look at first. A large part of the film is made up of huge thrillers. In the latter part, the story becomes very exciting and culminated in a tense and exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grant enjoys the most role-playing role, Fairbanks is a lovable romantic, and McLaughlin in the role of McKinney, mostly due to his dealings with Gunga Din, is the most unusual character, despite the discovery of his slave heart in his love for Phil Annie. Litte comes to the end of the film, especially in the last scene very moving and tearful. <br /> <br /> Sam Jaffe is always a nice and loving actor, offering great performance like Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, strong imagination and noble dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe brings the spirit of Gunga Din wonderfully brilliant. <br /> <br /> It's really a final adventure movie, a huge one in its scope, with a good representation of dramatic scenes, a great musical score and some beautiful cinematic pictures. Another one of that brilliant year, 1939. Highly recommended.
