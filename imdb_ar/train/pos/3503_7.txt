If you still remember that summer when you have your first kiss, first boy / girlfriend, or first puppy loves love ... this movie is suitable for you! Well, this movie will not win an Oscar but I will never love it like the Dominicans I loved ... There are some things in the movie that can go over your head if you are not part of the culture ... The children were raised by the grandmother who is the mother and father, the son The youngest recorded and bathed with the tin Cafe Bustelo (sooo Dominican!), Judy being harassed by neighborhood men, going to the church and lighting a prayer candle ... The film's brilliance was in those small details. Granted, did not pull all the cinematic dramas but NOR was not supposed to be intended as an educational tool for those who wanted to learn Latin culture (advice: make new friends instead). This film was more than sweet and time, but he kept his truth without taking himself seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", this was just the story of a boy of old age. I recommend it (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) = Q)
