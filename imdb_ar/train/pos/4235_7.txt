.... 16 years later Tim Burton disappoint me! Whatever happened to the old Burton who read "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as a search for his willingness to steer Batman back in 1988-1989? Apparently, Burton did not search the book or why he got it all! This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original and does not deal with the same subject as the parent. If you want to get a good monkey movie watch the original. <br /> <br /> ** Of **** stars
