My husband and I enjoy The DoodleBops just like our 8 month old. We bought only DVD and CD so we could see it and listen to it ourselves. It is fun, lively and very entertaining. Encourage children to be active, engaged and caring. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears the distinctive song, he turns his head quickly towards the TV and begins to bounce back and forth in a state of excitement. Dee is a wonderful singer and she has a wonderful voice. Mo is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is Bird Song. You can only help smiling and want to dance when you hear it.
