This batch makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In fact, maybe they are. After all, the way this plot continues seems like one man has the ability to punish the murder of everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon does a very reliable job as Bourne tries to stay one step before killing the whole movie. He is still trying to remember who he was and how he got to his place. He gets the help of two people and it seems that every minute of the film, someone tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time to rest in this movie and the strings look very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with a shaky camera that add to reality and make it look less hollywood than many pictures. These realistic sequences add to the film's sense. <br /> <br /> In some sequences, some sequences thrill brilliantly and you wonder if someone will die or whether Bourne can avoid them. This is the kind of suspense procedure you would like to see when you want to entertain, and I'm sure this will lead to the next movie in the series.
