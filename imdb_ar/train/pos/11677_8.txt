I loved the Long Way tour and was not familiar with the race to Dakar until I saw it on the local supermarket shelves. I bought it and after a little "Well it will be good" in the first episode I decided it was. Charlie Burman was fantastic as were the other members of the crew. Great to see him with Iwan again. There was a great deal of right in it but this did not bother me. As for they did not mention it on the package. Which is more so with the ridiculous testimony of the rating certificate that the BBFC has. They should have given them only 15 languages. <br /> <br /> A highly recommended chain, I want more !!
