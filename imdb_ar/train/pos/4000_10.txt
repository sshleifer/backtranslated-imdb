Wonderful. I saw this last night and I still reeling from how good it was. Each character felt the truth (although most of them were trivial and selfish **) and the strange story - the middle-aged widow began to get rid of her ruthless daughter's friend - was completely convincing. Best performances ever, but I catch Anna Reid and our friends in the north Daniel Craig (the latter will come as David Theolles next). <br /> <br /> Director Roger Michelle? This is far from Notting Hill as much as possible. Praise be to God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
