This movie is quite enjoyable. I have nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another experience, but better than Band Band and the naked miles, is at least entertaining. Only after the first five minutes did I laugh my ass, so I decided to call my friend and watch him together. We had a few beers and we enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> You will not find any deep message in this film, but it is worth watching. <br /> <br /> So, just relax and enjoy.
