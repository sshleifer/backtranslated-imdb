There was no such thing, that's for sure. This trilogy, seemingly superfluous, seems only logical in general, and therefore is not a film about Groovin 'Gary, a sensation in Utah. It is a self-conscious film about how the director returns to Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the whole project is an extended and shocking confusion of guilt and repentance. He tried to atone for his sins - yes, he tried to commit suicide after the initial document - through correction, commentary and conferences - and to restore these backup chains in Hollywood as the best friend and the happy happy ending (two different, with a specific modification in the Glover version) and turn it into his very personal uses. So although the subject remains a film about sex and difference, the structure ensures that it is also a film about movies - but at an unprecedented level of complexity. There's a lot going on; in telling and recounting this story, Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and does not miss a chance to make a thing out of it. Moving heavily, and as deep as the camper ever gets.
