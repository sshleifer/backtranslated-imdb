A wonderful production of color technology tells an extraordinary story of romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a trebast monk who left his monastery and broke his promises. The film begins in a monastery in Europe, where a former student, a black beauty named Domini (Marilyn Dietrich), prays. The great mother advises her to go to the desert and "find herself" and lose her grief over her father, who recently died. In the train car on the way to the desert, you sit in front of a very troubled man (Charles Boer) - our former monk. She's soon in a hotel near the palm oasis, where she once again sees our troubled mysterious man and he is perplexed as to what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl. Domini becomes a friend of his, although he knows nothing about his past - romance will follow him soon. <br /> <br /> This film is passionate, melodramatic, and different (in a way, almost surreal, but small) and found to be very fun and entertaining. The photography in this is really interesting - it is full of close-up photos of the face and beautiful color snapshots of the horses' convoys crossing the desert and shaded characters in front of the sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich offers a wonderful performance, despite restraint, here and looks great. Charles Bauer - not usually my favorite one - is really good at this and I think this part fits him and looks very young and handsome. Basil Rathbone is fine here, except for very little to do. Another great result of the Max Steiner Orchestra helps keep the progress of the drama - and in general, a very enjoyable film.
