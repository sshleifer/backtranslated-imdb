This film should be one of the most beautiful films that meet the children of girls honestly and touching at all. While "Rebel without a Cause" and "Say Anything" feature great images, these videos offer useless sub-sections and Hollywood has sprung up. This film focuses on pure romantic romance viewing. Never doubt for a second that the film will lead to the romantic association of these two persons. I almost immediately felt the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Sileen, and we were simply pleased to see them stumble upon it. This film mostly depends on the dialogue. But, every conversation between these is also very interesting. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all this conversation, with no real impact on anything that is mostly important, you can feel the nuances where these two people become more fond and trust each other. This is exactly how you dream about someone special. What makes it the fact that it is not wonderful to believe it. This may be what happens if you're confident enough to talk to someone you've noticed at random somewhere. What sets the ice in this film is the wonderful background of Vienna where this film takes place. It adds only to the romantic serenity suggested by the film. No matter how many times I watch this film, I do not think I will be tired of it.
