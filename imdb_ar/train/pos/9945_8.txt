The most important things first! This is not a motion film, although there are lots of events! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeed in achieving what is inconceivable, winning a game or tournament exceeds expectations! In this case, it is not about football or baseball, but taekwondo! At first, these street thugs seem good for nothing! But soon we will discover that they do not want to be thugs and to achieve something in life! It's nice to see them struggling and training! I was surprised how funny this film was! From start to finish you will laugh at your clothes! Korean young actors very convincing! Go to see this wonderful film feel good!
