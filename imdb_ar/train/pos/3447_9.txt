There is no way I like more than Mamoru Oshii. Unfortunately, although he has produced a few films of international interest, there are still a few of his films that have crept into the cracks. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although I liked it a bit, it is not hard to know why distributors in the West are somewhat reluctant to release it. <br /> <br /> Among his big and dangerous films, Oshii has become known to do some smaller, quieter projects. While Tachiguishi is definitely in this category, Oshii has really outdone this category, creating something very difficult to classify, even if it is a terrible Japanese click. Go to figure. <br /> <br /> In essence, there is a documentary film not unlike Otaku no Video. But instead of deceiving the subculture list, inventing his own Oshi and feeding on the lives of culinary heroes, looking for free food and supports the level of Japanese cooking. Oshiii's approach to this subject is closely related to Dai-Nipponjin, where the subject is treated with a killer sense of gravity while the images on screen are as silly as possible. Humor Deadpan that has been moved to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, instead of just shooting at his fake message, Oshi decided to make it using a new visual technique of super-globalization. A strange combination of live action, photography, digital animation and puppets on a stick. It has been implemented (or thrown out, if you want) by the great Japanese animation industry at least, where the project was supposed to be as low budget as possible. <br /> <br /> If you only think about it, know that the movie is too heavy in the dialogue, making it a good companion piece for Innocence. The impact of killers is analyzed from all kinds of cultural, political and even philosophical angles, which are launched to the public through a continuous series of monologues and dialogues. To make matters worse, the entire film is based entirely on actual Japanese history and customs, making it difficult for the alien to control the material. Needless to say, multiple offers are recommended to make the most of all the details in the movie. <br /> <br /> However, at the conceptual level it is easy to follow the film and it is already very hilarious. Many confidants are introduced as they were the most influential historical figures in Japan after the war. The film is played as if you were expecting a dangerous documentary to be shown to any important figure, but somehow the big, dynamic parts of the photography that collect the numbers do not make them very dangerous. The group of characters that have been introduced is great, Shinji Higuchi takes the cake as a cowboy wearing a nose while taking fast food chains with a bull ring / people. <br /> <br /> The regular Oshii Kenji Kauai provides a beautifully comical performance, ranging from atmospheric and dark to exotic, exotic and comedian. There is a lot of fun that can be enjoyed through exaggerated sounds and effects, which complement the animation and completely contradict the tone of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very visible, although it must be said that the animation is very rare and although it is effective, it remains immersed, to explode in an overly curious atmosphere from time to time. This is not bad, as we see how Tachiguishi is very heavy in dialogue. However, the film is still a visual masterpiece where each frame seems completely fertile and designed to match and improve the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> However, be careful, because Tachiguishi is asking lots of scenes. If you do not speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that require some attention. Moreover, the monologues in the film area are quite extended and can be difficult to follow. The film still lacks translations in English, and although my French language was pretty much enough to get everything around, I'm sure I missed many fine points in the film. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not an easy movie to get to, but halfway through it the steam reaches full and it does not leave off from there onward. I still hope to see this again with English or Dutch submarines. In fact, it would be better for a film like this (much like the container), although I think the quality of the anime describes it in too many characters I can not order. <br /> <br /> With all this, I can only congratulate Oshi on another great movie. It is rare to find a film that mixes and mixes many styles and effects to create something unique and still works. The film is smart, looks great and is full of creativity. It's very funny, even if you can not capture all the details in the first viewing. But be sure to get this at least through decent submarines, since the automatic English translation that surfaced is of no value at all and the film offers no justice at all. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi meets a very specific audience and I am not surprised that the French have been released while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) is waiting for a reference to this film. But for those who love Oshii, they appreciate dry and brutal humor and crave creative spirits, it's a film that can not be missed, although it can break down. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
