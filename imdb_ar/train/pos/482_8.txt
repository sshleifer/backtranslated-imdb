This is a poem about the film, beautifully presented and photographed with a sensitive art. It captures the atmosphere of time and place perfectly. (Italian Lake District in the 1920s). It is a love story with a touch. The characters are unique and reliable. The settings are weird and delicious. Some scenes --- the funerary boat in the fog --- the long long shot of the chess table in the middle of a intricately carved tiled floor --- are beautiful pictures. Instead of a happy happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet. If the film is an art, it is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
