Emily Watson Natalia is the most loving and romantic main character I have ever seen on the screen. She is the queen of this film without a doubt. Or is it transmitted to the king? The internal fabric of chess games and the struggle of families for control, power and victory is astounding. As chess teachers do in the film, the director plays many games simultaneously with our minds, but all of them turn into major or minor patterns. This period, costumes and images of the Lake of Italy in the early 20th century were beautifully captured. Do not waste one square of space. <br /> <br /> Many wonderful scenes are many, I can not list them all. I recommend you allocate enough budget time to watch this movie twice, maybe for a week apart, because you can not capture all the hair in a 64-square but multidimensional frame in one place. <br /> <br /> I have not read Nabakov's book, but to try out a similarity, what I'm reading reminds me of another poignant film, Barry the Natural. I have completely gotten rid of the ends of Bernard Malamod's pessimistic pessimistic book for Romantic Impressionism, which was a unique American. Well, the director did it better by attaching Russian and Italian customs and customs smoothly as a background to enlightenment. The real story here is that the games are zero. There is a winner and a loser, unless all of the contestants draw. But in life, especially in the context of our eternal souls, we are bound only by these limitations and conventions of life to the extent that we leave others to destroy our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, as embodied by Emily Watson and Natalia, can allow us all to be enhanced through her talents at the same time. Only the barriers created by our fears can be separated from them. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie (10/10).
