I have heard good things about this film and I, as I guessed, was a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly promising, and surprisingly confident at an early age; indeed, all the actors are very solid in their simple American atmosphere in the 1950s. The reason I did not rate this film is that in the end, the sadness of the big sister did not seem real, and that's what got me out of the film a bit. Maybe we're expected to fill out the chart, or maybe the film needs to be a bit longer. Morin's character is very backward to what I think. It is understood that Danny (Reese W., the younger) will be shocked and angry, but why does her sister appear more upset? Because it is the largest few years? Did not the end end the film? It seems that the speed of the film seems to have only been met by Maureen and Kurt, when he is exposed to the tractor (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, later, he seems to have been trying to shock a little. It depends on what you want - if you want the love story of happy young girls that you seem to get, you're in for a surprise. "Man in the Moon" is both a stranger and a dreamer and coming from a movie Age ?? A rather awkward mix? I loved the court figure though, I can see what the girls are watching. I loved that they had the courage to let them hurt his younger sister (most men, most of the movies would not) and they were killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on the scale of very rough estimates. For some reason Jason found London on a funny tractor.
