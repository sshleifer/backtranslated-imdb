When I was about 8 years old and I thought Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they have to be anyway because since watching movies, I've tried to learn a lot about real Sheriff Buford Bowser as much as I can. All three parts of the film gave me chills and Buford Busser was a real hero. I hope he is alive today and there are more people who love him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being very brave. I am very sorry because his family had to go through this horror and pain. My heart is with them. So one of the 30-year-old Sheriff Pusser fans and the 3-part Walking Tall and the actors who filmed him, please do not be negative about these films and actors. They were just trying to tell us about a wonderful man who was a real Buford Bowser and a big family. To all the young people who have not heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch Walking Tall movies and learn more about it.
