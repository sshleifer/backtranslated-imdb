Although you have not seen a lot of movies before, you've certainly seen the main conspiracy topics in many movies ever since. <br /> <br /> It is not one of the best films of Grant and Louie, but it makes a great effort together. After all this, with this great talent and very good support, you know that the laughs will be there. <br /> <br /> The movie is light, contains some dramatic sites but keeps the plot moving and makes you smile completely in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> A great example of classic American movie fare that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Definitely a Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on popcorn.
