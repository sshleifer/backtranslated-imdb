YETI deserves an 8 star rating because it is one of the greatest bad films ever produced. I saw him at midnight show in Los Angeles, people were cheering and cheering crazy - this movie is one of the wreck of the movie train who you think they can not get any stranger, then they do! It seems that the millionaire who finances the project to melt the Yeti looks like Chris Ben and John Goodman in a bad suit - the man who plays the role of the world is one of the worst actors on the screen - and yes, there is a muted boy (it seems kinda like a girl) That survived a plane crash killed both his parents (Hmmm, perhaps a child's treatment?). After that you see this Italian girl hottie (as soon as the ice melts - which takes forever) - and she is instantly in love with her - what is the most hysterical thing in the film is that these giant doyy make "sleeping eyes" in her face Seduction Group. In fact, once he picks up the big Yeti and puts it on his chest - accidentally touching his nipples and yes, the film takes time to show his big gray tits GET HARD !!!! Yikes for all YIKES! In addition to that there is a coli dog because the Italian product must have heard that the American public is like dogs and that he has somehow tried to get Lacy - there is also this crazy scene where the yacht eat giant fish - keeps the big fish bone and uses it to comb Italian girl's hair "Gee, thank you Litty - now my hair is softer and smelled like dead salmon. This film is more unusual than anything Ed Wood had dreamed of. If you love classic crap cinema - look for this baby out.
