Daniel Steel Baba, what a refreshing story. This film celebrates the importance of family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is it? In these times of "Heather has two nations" (or what ever fills it, fills the blanks) it is easy to see why this subject is not for everyone. With the father's roles that were prominent I hope this is Daniel Steele Saga's latest. How disappointing to have an end. Every character was important and did a wonderful job carrying her role. I loved to see every character evolve over the years. I loved this movie, it's a film I'll see with a challenge every time it's shown. Good story, good disposition, I hope this is not the spoiler, but not spam or bad language. Yes she touched my heart. Warning, get Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this aspect of family life is rarely portrayed today in our spare time, be it television or. Movies. Daniel If your listening, you go girl, give us more.
