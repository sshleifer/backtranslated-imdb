Despite the narrow narration, Johnnie To's Election sometimes feels as if she was once a longer image, where many characters were abandoned and the planning tapes were finally unresolved. Some of these things are handled in an excellent and truly superior sequel, Elections 2: Harmony is a virtue, but it is still impressively exciting about contested triad elections that go beyond shootings and usual explosions (although they are not violence) in favor of the constant transformation of coalitions that can Turn in the time it takes to make a phone call. It is also a film in which the most cruel character is always the most threatening, as the ends do not end very chillingly: one can imagine lifelong psychological counseling as necessary for all the psychological trauma of an unfortunate passerby. Simon Yam, who is often a variable actor but is always at his best under the supervision of To, was never better than ever, not least because Tony Leung's soaring performance makes his silence more powerful.
