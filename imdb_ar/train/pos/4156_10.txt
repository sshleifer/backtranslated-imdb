I've seen a series of Cold Case episodes since the premiere, especially after the Amazing Race, but this was one of the best writing and acting I've ever seen in Bruckheimer's house, especially the younger officers, who were immediately put in place and made this text, montage and soundtrack If you are the producer, I will present this episode to the Emmy study. A picture of Coop and Jimmy was done within 48 minutes, and this requires a lot of talented people to do their best, and I hope there is a prior warning of repeating this episode, I will notice a lot that I did not notice the first time.
