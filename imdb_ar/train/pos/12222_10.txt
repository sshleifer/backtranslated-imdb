I thought this film was beautifully painted, which made me puzzled by my decision and my cousin who saw it with me. To tell the truth, I think the young man Kevin Dillon was hot. Hahaha ... but I also thought that the girl was stupid was the cop and that's wrong what he said to her before his death "I was under you." I think that's what you get to do what you did to him and how he'll tell her that she's so small when he never cares how old the other girls were. Now I do not think I personally can trust a cop like that. But to tell the truth it was clear that even if he wanted to become a policeman, I would still be suspicious of him in either case. That was funny when I sprayed him in the eye at the store. He was still stupid. He was still stupid because he went to the warehouse again by himself as well as the policeman who died hi !! It is called a backup. Sometimes, these films make me angry when people are stupid and stupid, but that's what I think about the film.
