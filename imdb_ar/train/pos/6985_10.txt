I must say, as a fan of BSG I was not entirely sure of my opinion on this show. I saw him on the big screen at Arclight Cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center), and the filmmakers and the film talked remotely. Ron Moore said they wanted a clean break from Battlestar, they would do something different, they would lose some fans, but hopefully they would win more. "Even without their words, I am now a fan of the new program, I thought of him in the film. <br /> <br /> I really liked it, I think I'm a real science fiction (or "syfy") - do I really have to write it?) Geek, because I was just watching it as a series. On a strong and rich story, and my interest remains. <br /> <br /> A small group of teenagers are starting to plan something, which for me was the weakest and most confusing part of it. The actress who plays the role of "Zoe" seemed a little clearer, but she was playing as a teenager (and I'm sure I will not be the only person I think "Zoe" was a cylinder in Initially, the risk of being a geek BSG.) If they hope to be the new Bamber / Helfer / Park, they may want to rethink it frankly, it was the adults who caught the attention of the masses. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz performs As wonderful as Daniel Griston, a man stalked by the tragedy of his family so much that he jumps at the first opportunity to get out of his life. Sadness and do not leave it. Has a terrifying and exciting function in conveying the personal knowledge of his personality to the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene where a young girl's teenage girl network is hiding, hiding, and rejecting. There is no sign at all on the "Serial Killer" he played on Gray's Anatomy, which is truly impressive. <br /> <br /> Just as Paula Malcolmson did not have nearly as much as his wife, Amanda Gerston. She is smart, well written and plays a beautiful role in the role of Stoltz, and I fully believe that they are a couple, and a couple who were together forever and have a strong relationship, and rarely saw anything these days. I look forward to seeing what is going on with this family, and I hope they will give it a lot to do like Roslyn in BSG - it's strong and smart, and when you attack her child, you're cuddling, it's really wonderful. Not to mention her eyes, which can carry magical powers, that's what it is. The scene you are dealing with the government employee - a very short scene, but beautifully - really gives you an idea of ​​its power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the show that did not work 100% for me was the viewer with Isai Morales, the Mafia clan of its kind. He does a good job in general, but I do not believe in the power of this mob, nor fear them of their threats. I found myself hoping that the whole story line would be more mysterious and harder to detect; the way it is presented is almost a tribute to Godfather, I've hit you a bit on your head a bit. But over time, I can see how this will develop into an interesting "top / bottom" type, with poor minorities (Morales et al.) Versus the rich people who govern the planet (Stolz et al.). To be honest, I enjoyed it when he spoke with his son about the origin of his name - this was a very good scene. <br /> <br /> Note to fans of the BSG team, the boy who plays the role of "Willie Adama" is not much like Ulmus, but he is just a child. Whether it will be screened or not more than it was in this film, who knows? I certainly can not say. But that did not bother me, because it was not as interesting as everything around it. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays the role of Sister Clarisse, chilling in every scene you publish. I'm not sure where you'll go or who will end up, but I was very impressed by her acting. The film was somewhat on the side, but it clearly began to play an important role later on. She was not like her character in Rome, something I always find influential in actors. <br /> <br /> A beautiful surprise - the music is actually better and less clear than the BSG, although it is the same guy who does Bear Mckerere. I was followed by this exciting and unusual approach that took me by surprise, and I will buy this result if I have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> For a "panel discussion" after the show, hosted by Seth Green. Ron Eure was very clever and sophisticated, and David Eck was wise (very much like his video diary), and he told Esai Morales a long story about how to photograph him. Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not really answer the questions (but I've always been something to him) ). Paula Malcolmson was cruel (she took Seth Green on a mission to accidentally say she was in "24"), and the girls who played Zoe and Lucy were both. Grace Park and Tricia Helper were also present, where they answered questions about how they were behaving with themselves in BSG. In general, a wonderful and very enjoyable evening. <br /> <br /> I give the program 9 out of 10, and I look forward to seeing it all unfold. <br /> <br /> Note: I just watched this second time and really hope to explore what HOLOBAND originally made. I have no idea what it could be, but it holds a lot of charm to me.
