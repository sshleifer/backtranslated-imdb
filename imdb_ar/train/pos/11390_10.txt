The story and music (George Gershwin!) Are wonderful, as are the Levant, Gutick, Fuchs, and of course Kelly. One thing is missing, this thing is a good leading lady. I'm sorry, Leslie Karon bothers me. In any case, though, the plot moves well with the famous ballet (and worthy of it). Oh colors, amazing red, blues, greens and yellow. Do not forget to be Biggs as well. . ) I just adore the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white fashion) and the very glamorous ballet. <br /> <br /> So I think what I'm trying to say is this: Please see it, and enjoy it, even though it is not the best, it is great. But make sure not to forget that Jane Kelly's other musical with the 20-year-old girl who set off for stardom shortly afterwards.
