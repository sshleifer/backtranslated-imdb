The cat and mouse share the usual chase when Jerry sinks into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers it disappears. Instead of taking the opportunity to spy on a girl's mouse-changing room or anything else, he uses his new disappearance to defrost Tom. It is very funny and innovative although it is rather fake animation. The movement never leaves the inner part of the house, which is usually a feature lower than the average T & J shorts. Still worth 7/10. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not sure that the invisible mouse can cast a shadow over the wall, it challenges physics and nature itself because it is invisible.
