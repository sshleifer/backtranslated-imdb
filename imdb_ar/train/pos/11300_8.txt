Ossessioni <br /> <br /> It is the first Italian film by Lucino Visconti, thanks in large part to the launch of the new realism movement - well, as he says right at the back of the box - sometimes a penetrating and sometimes disgusting image of the only individuals In moral volatility. In Fascist Italy, a variety of supporting personalities - including the creative innovator who embraces the virtues of communism - embodies the distant despair of a country looking for its identity from the outside and being swept away by delusions of soul. Although Visconti's sympathy with the deprived of their rights and their ability to express their unfortunate circumstances was already good, the spider web of deception is very weak - although the key element in Noir is the assumption that the protagonist is manipulated by fate and fatale femme , The Gino here and without begin to fear it would be deserved - the very cosmic educational paradox, the illegal relationship strained with pigeons. Despite all this, it is critical and necessary, although its actual impact on the history of the film is certainly controversial.
