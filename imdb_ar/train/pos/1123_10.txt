I really enjoyed this, and although the end angered me, I still give it 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> There are four university girls (Paltron, Kelly, Stall and Cadby) heading for Florida, on their way To meet two young people (Turner, Davis), they add nothing to the plot, but they are at least somewhat likable. The girls agree to meet men in Florida for some fun, but they have problems with the car and never make it. One of the girls decided to go to a nearby gas station for help, and stay the other three in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon, one of the girls has to use the bathroom, so they are in the middle of nowhere and have no choice but to go in the bush. After a short while you see a man (March) strangling a woman, in case of horror the girl escapes from the region, it does not go far, but was able to lose. <br /> <br /> Her friends in the car search for her, they also go into the forest and they meet the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, and the man responds by shooting the girls while the other girl flees and returns to the car where she was also killed. <br /> <br /> In the end, the two remaining girls find each other and as they enter the fuel station they are caught. This is the time when she started to go crazy, and these poor girls fear their lives and are not believed by the backward police. <br /> <br /> They are treated badly and one of them is left alone to kill the crazy man run by the remaining friend in the cell, but not without falling into dangerous positions. <br /> <br /> This film features nudity, a good actress, a psychological shower scene, graphic violence towards women, and a solid story. Some women may find it offensive and do not want sensitive individuals in the end, but on the whole, this is a wonderful film unknown.
