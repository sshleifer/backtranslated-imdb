After the initial shock of Mr. Braanag's courage to portray this, I was thrilled by the thrill of having this epic before me. I was not disappointed. This is true for Shakespeare and can be accessed yet. The dawn of my mind. I always enjoy seeing, or rather listening to Branagh and making me wonder ... Is this movie dubbed in other countries? It would be like drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
