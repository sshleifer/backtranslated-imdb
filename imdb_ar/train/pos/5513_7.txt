I read a lot of people who were disappointed with this film, compared to Part 1. At first I understood this but after a bit of thinking I think they are wrong in being. Soderberg continues his truth-based story of Che's life that he began in Part 1. The first part recounted a story of a revolution that moved from unsatisfactory beginnings to a successful end in the end. The second part tells the story of a revolution that moves from unsatisfactory beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderberg's fault that these two parts of Che's life had quite different consequences. He boldly chose to tell both of them in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a great improvement in coming out of the cinema after part 1 of part 2 but this is the reality of qi life and in my opinion no fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. Maybe it's too long. At least in Part 1, we have seen different aspects of the war where guerrillas have achieved successes. In Part 2, they can not catch a break and see their numbers drop down by death and capture. Chi capture and death are handled well. The film was greatly enhanced through dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as Argentine charismatic. So, if you see the first part, you'll see a very similar story for a very different story in Part 2.
