This film really embodies the feeling of freedom ....... and what it deserves your freedom of integrity .... the most fun and hidden way. It's not a serious adventure, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> The story reflects life. We do not always get what we want right away, but we discover we need to understand why we do not get what we want .... which results in getting more than we thought we would get! You will get this as soon as you see the movie. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around finding love and knowing the person who has found it and that completely changed one's life. <br /> <br /> It's one of my best favorite films ever .... not easy to find but worth searching ......... I guarantee you will see it more than once!
