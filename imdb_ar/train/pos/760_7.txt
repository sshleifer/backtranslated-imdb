I have not seen this movie since the late 1980s and decided to pick up a VHS version of it. The plot is too slow, and the actors seem to be automatic in this flick. Music and hip-hop / free artists and break dance scenes are what make this movie distinctive. Breakdancing is actually better in this film than "Breakin", but I must say that "Breakin '1 & 2" carries the energy and excitement to the screen much better. It's a movie I'll keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can see again and again, just once in a blue moon.
