One of my favorite films that has been overlooked by many filmgoers, is a puzzling note. Not only did the acclaimed Ang Lee star, he had many young actors who would become major stars, for example, Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Joel. All the acting was wonderful and each of these actors made memorable performances, especially Myers, who filmed a wicked villain killed for murder. <br /> <br /> When biographies and director's achievements (even when they won an Academy Award) are listed as actors, this film is usually deleted from previous performances. I discovered the movie on DVD by chance and became one of my films that I saw so much. However, it is rare to see everything on the cable. I look forward to reading what others are pointing out the reasons why this film is unknown.
