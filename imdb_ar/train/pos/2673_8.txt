The Journey of Hope (1990) is on a journey by many nomadic Turks and the poor to live a good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live like Westerners that they will give up their lives and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. Many of them are being cheated on greedy scammers who earn a living by imposing heavy fees on desperate people in a situation where everyone is not winning. One family defies the cold, the treacherous mountain range and the predatory criminals only to discover that there is not always bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists all over the world, not just in America. Some people tend to forget about it. A heart-broken movie will leave you wondering why in the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
