Well, at first it sounded like a "partner" - the only person who consistently followed the comic satisfaction. Then evolve into something really convincing, where the glove is set. The result is a fun film, and I have moments that I agree are very exciting for children to see (Manny's past, for example). It is clear that the hypothesis worked for a long time, so that they could succeed in making a set of films without almost different groups (snow and rock hats only) and three characters. It is good to know that they are doing something passionate about it. As I said, it can be jittery at times, so, children are warned. Idle is real animation. This was not as good as the movies of a game story or a partner, and this shows. Human beings are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But do not let this hint the record: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is commendable. I will gather a lot of fans, I have no doubt. Yes and yes, the moments of this tiny mouse priceless, steal the show.
