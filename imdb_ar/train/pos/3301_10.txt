Along with the fact that it was one of the few films in which tears were cast (bye bye), this is one of the most beautiful Indian films ever made.

Pakeezah amazing music, especially if you can understand the wonderful poetry, which is definitely one of the films "OMG, 5 minutes other song." You feel a sense of how Sahibjaan is trapped among all the amazing jewels she wears and the arena of the swollen pitch you walk by casually. <br /> <br /> A parody of all the dreams that have passed through ..... .....
