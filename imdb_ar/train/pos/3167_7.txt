This is one of those films that explores the cultural clash of people born in the East in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of antibodies to attract due to major cultural differences. Ken, a fan of rock and roll, is married to a Japanese girl from Kyoto, so she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. Marriage is expected to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto acquires its legal status again. But Ken, who seems to have lost in every relationship, likes Kyoto and tries hard to make things work. This is despite his friend's urge to dump Kyoto and get rid of all the commitments to the girls, which is bad for rock and roll except to inspire some song lyrics about broken hearts and all. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from strict traditional Japanese education, and does not expect to be married to Ken all this time. Not only that, they are nostalgic for home and want to return to Japan. It is sad that this is in the end someone who believes that Ken can have love with him and with all that, except for the time he thinks he found someone who feels this way, do not expect the girl to stay long. It's not that she does not like Keane, she's used to "an incomplete way of life." "I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me what he feels in Japanese," she says. It is a somewhat sad love story with a killer soundtrack in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite films in the 1980s, Tokyo Pop. For those who enjoyed Loving on Tokyo Time, check Tokyo Pop (a New York singer who goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American band), except that it's a happy ending. <br /> <br />
