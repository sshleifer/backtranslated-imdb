I must really say, this has always been my favorite when I went to see my grandmother. It is still. It is very close to the book. The way they were filmed, the players were just excellent! I should recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but this was really great! I gave him 10/10.
