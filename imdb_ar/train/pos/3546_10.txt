This is one of the best musical works ever presented, an example of producers and directors not afraid to choose actors for their talent, not what people expect. The lighting and lighting are unique, giving it an interesting effect (this has a special name I can not think of). The dialog box is also unique in that no contractions are used. The film is well-paced, acting beautifully and interestingly from start to finish. A real joy is music. A collection of first-class songs, from start to finish, which are executed and perfectly coordinated. Also, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think it is superior to many musicals from the 1930s to the 1960s. It certainly contains original songs and more beautiful than most musical works, which may contain only two or three. Not bad for the director with no experience in this kind of film. Another quality is that it is new every time one sees it.
