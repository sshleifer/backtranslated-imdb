Riding Giants is a stunning film. It really shows how these people lived at that time just to browse. Their lives were basically surfacing, living, breathing and enjoying. They did not care about money, jobs, girls or anything. For them the waves were their daughters. I've never been on a surfboard, and it seems very difficult, I do not understand how they can stay on it, it makes no sense at all. This is a great movie, and if you like surfing, you should really see this movie. If you are on the waves and want to know who started browsing the internet, how you entered life, or who is really famous in it or ever, you should see it already. It may be a documentary, but it's really good. -----
