As a 90-minute experiment, it does not live up to "Drive," where the actors have clearly learned their business in "Who am I?" Academy, while the sequence of motion is not generally better than those in the remarkable Marc Dacascos. However, those who enjoyed Drive, (and I think it was great!), Will undoubtedly enjoy this as well. Of course, you will not go back to the beginning and see it again, but you will definitely return to some of the movement's sights for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see that the art of high-quality choreography is still practiced, even if it is not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these men can do with the budgets, time and respect given to Yuen Wu Ping, . If you sit for the first half hour and you are not mad through the terrible dialogue, you are on your way to treatment. Bosch is great, and can actually restrict any move with some great acrobatics, kicks and simple courage. <br /> <br /> If you're lucky enough to be within 500 miles of a version, track it and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it's less clear than Colio in the China Strike Force, but you'll be dazzled by both the movements and pain of the hard-working team (I'm sure there's no safe way to land directly on top, Speeding !?). <br /> <br />
