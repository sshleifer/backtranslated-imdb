I read a lot of commitments when they were in the theaters and they were all bad .... I think you should be a certain kind of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not someone who has enjoyed Waltons or Little House ... you will not understand U and do not enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now about Loves Abiding Joy ... I knew it was bad news the beginning of the movie .. .. I hope it has shown more end rather than allowing you to think about it. This film has a great relationship with Jeff .... after 6 years, so you know he will be interested in Girls. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I have enjoyed all four movies so far. ... was not crazy about the books ... I could not wait until the next movie. The way Clark talks will get you all at once. I like to see Jan Jones showing a look ... maybe a family reunion or something.
