Yes, dance dance dancing horror ........ with Chile and Debbie! Goody Goody. This is fun, fun and fun and part of the guignol cycle of the 1960s leaked to the 1970s. Released as a double feature with Burt Reynolds Fuzz comedy, this crazy fear is a masterpiece of entertainment. Like a combination of Lost Day, the other and BABY JANE, I suggest to any potential viewer that the idea is that the aim is to be oblique and to sit with someone who can scream with him and stand with him. In fact, screwed up while watching it ..... on a cheap champagne. Again, with many cinematic ideas about the 1930s, they also turn around the illusion. The struggle at that time for a better life becomes bitter and twisted because of falling into emotional madness. But this one is just crazy. It also reminds me of a lot of Bloody Mama festival of the De Niro Winters festival which makes this film look positively positive.
