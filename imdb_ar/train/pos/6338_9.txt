I really liked watching this original classic movie several times but I hardly remember any details. I think this movie is much better than animation, not black and white. I particularly liked how they made Greenwich a full character and gave a reason for what he was. The villain in this film was not the actual Grinch, but the lead, very different from the original drawings. Jim Carrey was perfect for the whole part of the wonderful film that was prepared for children and adults alike.
