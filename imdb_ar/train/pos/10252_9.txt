After seeing "Guinea Pig," two questions come to mind (besides "am I really sick to see that?"): "Is it a sniff?" The answer is no; although it is the closest thing to the movie sniff I've ever seen. And then: "Where did the hell find that girl?" Because she was tortured for 45 minutes, without any reasons (in fact, there is nothing else in this film!): Torn fingernails, hit hands, feet and tools, spread worms, and many others. How they did it). Since it belongs to the "Gabonese Underwater Scene", it is clear that they did not get much money. What are their motives? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without translation, but it is not a problem (there are no real dialogues, boys only insult it in a few scenes). I have not yet seen the entire series, but the first "guinea pig" is unknown because it is the best. I still got the eighth rating, because if the purpose is to make people think that this is wonderful, the problem is very good (ask actor Charlie Sheen, actor). But I think they could have gone ahead, which they did in the following films. <br /> <br /> Another film has been hidden from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
