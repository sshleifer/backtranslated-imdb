I looked into this little film and discovered a website that purportedly was actually an internal joke about gay world Post World Greenwich Village. With the exception of Stewart and Nowak, witches and witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Drotten, who wrote the play gay and very familiar with the village of Greenwich. I thought this was an irony because I first saw "Bill" and "Book" and "Kendall" in the theater when I was in the fifth or sixth grade just because my parents had taken me. It was hard to bring me to a movie that did not include horses, machine guns or strange monsters and I planned to feel bored. But I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart Kim Novak embraced the upper part of the Flatiron building and sank his hat as the camera followed, fluttering on the floor. When the theme of the glorious love of George Dunning rose, I suddenly felt what I felt in love. The first sexual / sexual love movements left me in a daze as I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only boy before the teenager who has been tempted by Kim Novak's stunning direct view. Paradoxically, a gay tale was able to begin adulthood in two different sexes in many of us. I am now in my late fifties and I was re-watched the film last night and aroused the same feelings when I saw that hat back after fifty years. . .
