I watched this movie at a college film festival back in the 1970s - I was waiting forever for this movie to be shown on the video (finally it ended). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed that the reason for it was not yet visible. We have been checking out video shops for the last 15 years waiting for this wonderful movie to appear! It is one of my favorites at all - but warned that it is strange, like the strange Werner Herzog - the strangeness of this film stems from the realism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real incident dating back centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when the Europeans were the first to face tribes in the Amazon. A white man sins by the cannibal tribe as their enemy, so they intend to kill him. Before they send him, they make him part of their tribe (their habit). The entire film is like watching a National Geographic documentary when it becomes an acceptable member of their tribe. This is. cosmic plotline? Intense insight into a variety of human life? Certainly. <br /> <br /> Caution, yes ... Caution ... This film has a specific nudity - this is not some Hollywood movies that are full of noble brutality ... This film tells it as if it were (read again above: National Geographic, Super realism) <br /> <br />
