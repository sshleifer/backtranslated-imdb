Personally, I find the film a very good witness. It shows the actual situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how the triads are organized. The police do not do everything in their power to eliminate the three. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is somewhat violent because of methods of mass murder and torture. However, the film remains real in the real world, so the violence on the screen is just a reflection of what really happens. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to any of Triad / Mafia's fans. Another good watch will be Dragon Squad. This film contains a larger number of weapons, as there are more knives in this film than weapons (in fact I do not remember seeing a single gun).
