When I learned about the death of Sir Alec Guinness, this was the first of his numerous films to be re-imagined. What a wonderful comment the film makes even after all these years. Guinness helps in weaving magic in every frame. His eyes and face are as bright as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film should be considered lifelong favorites.
