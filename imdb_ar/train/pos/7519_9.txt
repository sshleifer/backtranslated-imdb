The BETTIE PAGE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mall as legendary queen Betty Beige lights up in a wonderful biography. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mall is likely to be known for promoting it as The Next-It-Girl a few years ago, before anyone knows who it is despite a notorious cover story by Vanity Fair between the other media dubbing, Although a few of the roles involved in the championship here and there seemed to have looked less stellar yet. Here as the famous pin queen Betty Beige, Gritchen Mall is already a bright star in height. <br /> <br /> Betty Begg was born from Tennessee and grew up as an appropriate girl who mastered God and headed towards the family. She seemed to find herself an unwarranted creature of lust and affection, as she grew up. The collective rape of past memories is not conceived wisely, nor does it show the hidden performance of her father, who has less than decent designs for his relatives, which is important to understand how he succeeded in escaping the life of the potential nightmares of a career. Represented by going to New York City in the 1950s when it was in fact the right time and place to pick up the lighting in a bottle. What the page does not realize is that it really will be when it arrives. <br /> <br /> A beautiful black crow was seen as a lover of a divine nature. The page was spotted at Kony Island on a summer day by a black police officer asking to take her photo to the basement of his house and eventually to the Irving Claw ) And his sister, Paula (Taylor), whose artistic crews were dressed, but looked at the pornographic footage to a unique client: the types of fetish. <br /> <br /> Although the page is somewhat naive, it is undoubtedly smart and knows that its body is not a sin and can see the forest for trees in the sense that it controls it - or at least adheres to what is presented as the work of As it is not inappropriate and she enjoys her increasingly elaborate images - until the Congress hunt for some scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> The talented director Mary Haroon and her screenwriting partner, "An American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol", streamline the biographies in a very precise and hasty manner in identifying who really was Betty Begg Even though they do justice to an era of opportunism at its height. Thank you very much to the talented cinematographer, Mott Hopfil, for his stunning black-and-white photographs, as well as the crisp color footage that calls for Douglas Cirque's contemporary films due to melodramatic variations. Part of the Women's Treaty and the American Dream part of the story of the story with fantastic performances by her group including the comedy Power and Taylor as brothers in the stink and Harris has a field day as a savvy colleague with wine tasting and chatter. It is interesting to see Stratharn in a short period of stunt acting as a senator in a campaign for righteousness after filming Boldog Edward R. Moro in his last stroll, "Good night, good luck" as an opposite role of the table. <br /> <br /> But you hate the talents of the wonderful Mall as the "Betty Beige" is not punished in depth and the most intelligent, which allows her daughter-like bristles to shine through her bold nakedness and is now tame and strange. The borderline - Kitchi, which has fueled male males for decades and is still a reference to human sexuality in this country and possibly in the world in general. Mall is ideal and incorrectly resembles the subject of her image and down to her smile knows teasing. The real Bettie Page is reportedly not involved in the project, but it is clearly given the blessing and continues to live a somewhat isolated life referred to in the final moments of finding Jesus and evading her "infamous" image once and for all. It is a shame that this film strangely embraces the glamor of its saturated theme, radiating everyone to see them in naked splendor.
