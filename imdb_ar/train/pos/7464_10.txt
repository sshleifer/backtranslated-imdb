It made me think about it for days after seeing it. This to me is a wonderful movie sign. Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm fed up with those people who need these happy endings for cookies in Hollywood. I plan to go again tonight to understand the plot a bit better - but apart from that, the emotional messages of the film were completely felt.
