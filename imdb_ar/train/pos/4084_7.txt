I think this is going to be a kind of rewriting or updating Beauty and the Beast, but I can not say that I saw a film that started a few minutes before the graphic. Wonderful. Anyway it seems to be a young woman and her .. aunt? I have traveled to this castle in France where the wife will marry the son of the owner of the castle, the man who is interested in making sure the horses are released from their rocks. There seem to be legends in this area of ​​the beast that were, ah, playful, I think you can say, with ladies, or at least, one in particular. There are all kinds of inherited references in this regard, but every time the small, brushy bride gets her curious little hands on one that the groom's father removes from her eyes. However, the rising bride married upstairs to sleep while the family awaited the appearance of a cardinal for the wedding (a family member, I think), dreaming of dreaming of a monster in the forest, having the way with her. The effects of this are left slightly to the desired level, and any attempt at sexual arousal (I do not know very much) is a kind of laugh that is presented, especially when certain realistic supplements appear such as bedside or baseball bat. This has an odd and somewhat surprising ending, but with a twist, with no evidence or much building on it, but it was kind of appropriate and certainly not what I expected. I do not know, this is a kind of difficulty in reaching him, but his moments are certainly strange. 7 of 10.
