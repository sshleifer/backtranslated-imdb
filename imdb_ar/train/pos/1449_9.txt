This is one of the best criminal drama films of the late 1990s. It was full of great songs, a strong story, and many of the players involved presented great performances. The Pacino was great. Must have been nominated for something. John Kozak was also very good, as long as the viewer did not mind the Louuu-siana glare. It may pay off annoying if you can not afford this dialect. The way Pacino's personality interacted with Cusack's character was reasonable, dramatic, and comedic at times. Danny Ailu was as wonderful as ever. David Baemer was great in his supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned many characters, perhaps a lot. It may take a second watch to remember, "What is Zapatee who was?" After a lot of cross references, one has to stop and think only of summarizing it. The end did not have much sting. It was built for a long time and then it was a little disappointed. This was one of the few problems in the film. Since the film was not described as "huge huge screen", some have forgotten that this film was present. Pacino and Aiello were fantastic, but the film's lack of "start" in the theaters probably did not represent any nominations. It has been almost successful in the local market, and viewers are still learning that this title exists. Made in 1996, still stands today and will remain popular for many years to come. <br /> <br /> So, make yourself some lemon candy (you'll see) and watch this movie!
