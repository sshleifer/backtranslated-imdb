On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a brilliant rock opera about the sexual imbalances of an oil family in Texas. But all beneath it is a deep social commentary on the lives of the 1950s. Director Douglas Cirque records again with another wrestler from Universal. Robert Stack is in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's girlfriend, Rock Hudson, also likes her. When Stack discovers that he is sterile and ends up being pregnant, flying fireworks. Dorothy Malone won the Oscars for her portrayal of the biggest Nympho in Texas that Hudson rejected. Good epic soap opera.
