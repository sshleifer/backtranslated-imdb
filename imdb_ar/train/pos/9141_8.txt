You can discuss the Prince's talent in acting, or even choose a parody of his own life in this film. There is no discussion of his musical talent either at the time or now. It seems to have been mysterious twenty years later, but the music is still relevant and fascinating. <br /> <br /> After experiencing this noise in this film (I graduated from high school in 85), I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. From Tipper Gore, who is trying to censor "Little Nikki" and everything else in the sunshine through the PMRC (the Parental Music Resource Center) to every "air band" at the time of Prince's impersonation, that was the most important thing Absolutely. For a few weeks at least, the prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie, and we were very excited when it premiered. He did not disappoint. Everyone was arrested. I was addicted to MTV channel at the time (they really played music at that time .... all the time) the prince played at least once or twice a hour. I have to say that at that time my favorites were Billy Idol, Ingo Boingo, Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in Punk / New Wave. Prince music at the time exceeded all kinds and styles. One of the reasons some make it seem cheesey and contradictory now is that it was great in SOOOOOOOO. All the things I remind you of in the eighties were iconic. It was mainstream and looked like cliche now. She got so popular that she became silly. It's like a rappin 'commercial grandmother for Wendy hamburgers. <br /> <br /> It seems stupid now that everyone has fallen into it (unfortunately, like some kind of exotic purple macarina or something like that.) Anyway, I hope this has given you every insight.
