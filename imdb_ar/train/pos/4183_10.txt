I have seen this film for a long time, but I found it amazing, and to this day this has never stopped me. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film describes the story of a group of Australian commandos, some of whom tried to sink Japanese ships in the port of Singapore during the height of World War II. <br /> <br /> These commandos are captured in civilian clothes and are considered spies by Japanese spies. But something has not been much explored in any of the WW2 movies I have seen. <br /> <br /> A close and friendly relationship develops between the kidnappers and the captives. They begin to respect each other, while the commander of captured Australian soldiers becomes best friends with a senior Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the entire film and it really mixes your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day the two friends are talking, the Australian captain learns that some of the other prisoners will be put on trial and executed because of the sinking of Jap ships in the port of Singapore. <br /> <br /> It was his team and not others who drowned the ship to his Japanese friend, and when he heard this, the Japanese guard said he was silent because it could lead to the execution of his entire collection. But the captain is still determined to recognize the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, Japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way according to their rules. This is the highest award given to Japan's captive warriors. <br /> <br /> This is the most wonderful part of the film as Australian soldiers wait for their impending death and tense tension for the friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that his Australian friend pleaded guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not give up the end here. But it is more painful than one can even imagine and can easily move it to tears. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent little understatement may not have earned the recognition that it is internationally worthy. Get one copy today and be fascinated.
