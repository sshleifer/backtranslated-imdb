<br /> <br /> This story was filmed immediately after the war, in order to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. It ended with the honor of being the first royal bid after World War II. <br /> <br /> Remarkably, the film with the Royal Air Force and Sigmund Freud intertwines the psychology and founding fathers of America and various others on the long stairs (special effects in the bud) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of their integrity. <br /> <br /> While it seems silly, this clever text, with the skill of a mountain goat, leads and dances between the sky and the earth and gives a charming rest that has rarely been seen in cinema since. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to warm your heart through a sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Lipsy works like a man who has stolen the show !! <br /> <br /> British cinema must cry when you remember how good it was in the postwar years. <br /> <br />
