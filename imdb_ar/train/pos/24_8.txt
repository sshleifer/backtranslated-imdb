Although this was a low-budget production, the shows and songs in this film are worth watching. One of the few musical roles for Walken so far. (He is a great dancer and singer and shows his acrobatic skills as well - watch the wheel!) Also starring Jason Connery. A wonderful children's story and very popular characters.
