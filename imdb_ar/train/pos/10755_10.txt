A wonderful documentary about the life of firefighters in New York during the worst terrorist attack of all time .. This alone reason is why this thing must be seen by collectors of things .. What shocked me was not only attacks, but the "high fat diet" appearance Material for some firefighters. I think many doctors agree with me that in the physical form they were in, some of these firefighters would not reach the 79th floor and carry more than 60 pounds of gear. Having said that, I now have more respect for the firefighters and realize that working as a fireman is a work that changes his life. The French have a history of making great documentaries and this is the great documentary .....
