Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrie's recent "Serious" shows ("Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I always thought his true greedy lies in physical comedy. This does not mean he is a great and talented actor: these awards at the Oscars seem to hate him a lot, and he did not get a nomination or a prize (he really deserves it). Well, no institution should be taken seriously "nominated for the Academy Award for 11 awards such as" Titanic ". <br /> <br /> With the review" The Grinch "is the sweetest and best chapters and the best and most entertaining representation in the film since" The Nightmare before Christmas. "Both films seem very similar, too, with their very elegant collections and the hypothesis that someone steals Christmas.They both make the main actors look like bad guys (one in a higher degree than the other), both offering a strong moral lesson, both fun Really. <br /> <br /> This, even realizing that Jack Skillington is a puppet, and Grinch is a human being. His societies, such as cartoons and unrealism, do not stand in the way of the film: he can be joyous, he can be sad, he may be angry, he lives in a three-dimensional world where three-dimensional people live. The end saves Christmas, I loved this movie, and I can not wait until it's played on DVD.This is one of those movies that you will really enjoy 10 or 20 years from now.
