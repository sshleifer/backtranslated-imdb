This movie is hilarious! I saw it with my friend and we had to see it again. This movie is not for you filmmakers who will only see Oscar nominated films (you know who you are.) I will not summarize it because you saw it from all other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Flicker" is a light-hearted comedy that made me laugh all the time. Do not take the same thing seriously and you should watch it with your friends, not with your girlfriend. He will not win any prizes, but we should be appreciated. It's true that some jokes are funny, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some of it sometimes. Some people need to relax and watch "flipped" to see what it is, not what is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 of *****.
