Another Spanish film about the Civil War in 1936. This time we were told about the story of Carol (a pretty girl who played the role of director Clara Lago), a young girl who comes to live in a small Spanish village of New York. It is an introductory journey, and you will soon find it about the injustices, conflicts, stupid conflicts and contradictions of humankind. <br /> <br /> Emmanuel Uribe is making his best film since Diaz Contados (1994) with this sober pulse, beautiful photography, and a nice text. He tries not to participate in the conflict, shows us just some facts and let's decide (well, the facts are clear enough to make us decide which band we are in) and benefit from the presence and freshness of a young couple starring: Clara Lago and Juan Jose Balista. <br /> <br /> Good care production. My rate: 7/10
