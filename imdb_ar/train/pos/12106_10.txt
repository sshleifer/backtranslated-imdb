"Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" by Antonio Margherie is a strange and successful source on all fronts. It looks very beautiful in black and white and has a wonderful creepy Gothic character. Alan Foster is an English journalist who follows the interview. With visiting American horror writer Edgar Alan Bo. Foster bets that he can not spend one night in the abandoned palace of a friend Thomas Wood. After accepting the bet, Foster is locked up in the palace and begins to panic! The atmosphere is scary and wonderful from hell. The cellar sequence is really strange and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steel looks incredibly beautiful like the evil ghost of Elizabeth Blackwood. "Blood Fort" is one of the best Italian horror films that were produced in the early 60's. Masterpiece!
