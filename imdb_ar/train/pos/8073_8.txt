A wonderful picture of the traitor (Victor McGlain in the performance of the Academy Award winner) who is haunted by his conscience. McLaglen plays Rogge's role in the IRA cheating his leader to collect a reward during the Irish Sinn Fein rebellion. The scenes that show the battles and acts of the mob are very realistic, with an emphasis on desperation within individuals. It seems that the lack of hope for a better future is a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker John Ford beautifully creates a mysterious and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the blurry and grim imagery of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's sensational musical score adds to cinematic delight. Oscar winner also for best screenplay, nominated for best film. This is one of classic Hollywood.
