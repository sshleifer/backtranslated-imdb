Jess is 18 years old and very smart and does not want more than just playing football, when she joins a local team that has to lie to her parents over and over, because they will never agree to chase her dream, they want her to settle a cute Indian boy and learn how to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it like Beckham is a very good and fun movie that does not need to be deep and complex, it's just as good. All actors are very good and play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works well and the script is very realistic and very funny. A wonderful family movie 8/10
