The information in this film is fairly familiar to many who have been interested in the news recently. Walter Reid's scandals show a small part of the fact that we do not do a good job of caring for our injured heroes when they return. <br /> <br /> What this movie also shows is a common fact in all wars. The psychological trauma of soldiers during the war and the difficulty they face when returning to civilian life. They do not change or are affected only, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with it because they do not know themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film shows what the army does to our youth in preparing women for war and the policies and practices they must follow in prosecuting a war that leads to all trauma. <br /> <br /> We have more than 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion. But we have tens of thousands who will suffer physical and psychological trauma for life because of this war. No matter which side you are in, it is advisable to know the cost of the war to decide whether we will be in this business. This film illustrates the costs borne by men and women.
