It is a very good film, carefully and accurately directed by some excellent characters that sometimes move deeply - for example the scene with the loyal but uncooperative policeman and his wife. The plot is compelling and exciting. Character gangs are particularly interesting and play a role in almost metaphysical hero's life. It has become clear that the police are as cruel and ready as the figures of the underworld. <br /> <br /> Some minor reservations: I found the end a little monotonous celebrating the successful integration of the hero in the police structure and the justice system, which breaks down the mystery of police figures that have been preserved to this point. I also found the weak female character somewhat weak: more than just a catalyst for the hero's salvation, all she seems to do is cry and fainting while struggling with hard men.
