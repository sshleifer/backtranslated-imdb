Since the average sounds were very low, and the fact that the writer at the video store thought it was "ok", I did not have much expectations when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But unlike the above, I enjoyed it a lot. This is a magical film that does not need to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the start. Mel Brooks has a great performance as a leading character, and I think he is somewhat different from his usual character in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that, but there are some fairly cheerful scenes and, overall, this is a very enjoyable movie and very easy to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
