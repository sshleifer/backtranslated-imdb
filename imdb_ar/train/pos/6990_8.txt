Bela Lugosi appeared in many of these low-budget refrigerators for Monogram Studios in the 1940s, and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Bela plays a crazy scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts the liquid from their bodies so that he can keep his old wife looking young. After the reporter and night doctor at his home discover that he is responsible for the death of the brides, the next morning they report the killings to the police. The crazy world is shot and then falls dead shortly afterwards. </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> The world's assistants are made up of an old pilgrim, hump and dwarf (her children), thunderstorm and neural corridors at Bella's house. Bela and his wife find they sleep better in the coffins than the family in the film. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes deserve to be considered, especially for lovers of Bela Lugosi. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
