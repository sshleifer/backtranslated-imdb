In an attempt to prove the public's sympathy with Jake Ruidle (Toby Maguire), the filmmakers defamed the North and Jayhackers. Missouri did not withdraw from the Union and the Union's army was not a gas force. The southerners fought for state rights: the right to own slaves, the election of twisted legislatures and judges, and the use of the system of political spoils. There is nothing noble in that. It was possible that Missouri would travel eastward and join the Confederacy Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bush's saboteurs, it is not because he saw a mistake in his way, and he certainly does not surrender himself to the virtue of the abolition.
