This is one of the most meager episodes in this plot that really looks like an excuse to just enjoy. But, I appreciate this lukewarm approach and this is really one of the best episodes that you can see at the level of pure pleasure. Think about it - the crew faced confrontations with the White Rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a horseback horse killing McCoy, and a host of other bizarre events that do not make any sense at all until the end. Despite all the risks, you can not take everything seriously - it's very fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely aesthetic level, it's great.
