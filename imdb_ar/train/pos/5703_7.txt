I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this film explores some of the death themes on highways and the 1980s that I love to see, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> In general, the basic stupidity of Noir's protagonist is not being well extracted by female bullets and its hero is almost primitive human, thus warning Kitch.
