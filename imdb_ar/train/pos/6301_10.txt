I am participating in a filmmaker's seminar, which was shown after we had already seen a film that was not so great and we participated in a 40-minute discussion. Although the time was incredibly late and we were tired, the entire audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the film was a joy in all the right places, and I loved the group of exotic characters. They really grow you in the movie.
