I have come across this film in a show in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the plot; it has a lot of weird characters, but let's just say I'll have a hard time picking anyone who made me laugh harder, I would not know where to start. Even the peripheral roles are well written and acted well. <br /> <br /> There are many small touches that make it very unique and fun, with a few "gadgets" pop-up and add another fun layer. It is refreshing to watch. Not some recycled things I've seen many times before. If this film can reach a wider audience, I'm sure it will be fun for the real crowds, the story is original and very heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> There's a lot here to love, funny stories, bad incidents and misunderstandings that put the final act and dramatic result. Cross Id is a very funny movie with a lot of heart. It's an impressive story with fast paced comedy woven all the time. Definitely worth watching!
