Silverlight Live, the scene from here, is a very stunning film about AIDS as well as about a gay love relationship. It's really hard to capture some images, especially when a person is gay or afraid of AIDS, and maybe anyone who is sensitive is watching him. It is not easy to produce a film about this terrible disease and its consequences for the lives of one person, but two people. This film teaches how to take care of each other in such difficult times, but it does not feel too sick, it still shows life at any time, and reminds you that it is outside the theater or your room, life goes on, whatever the fate of some people may be. The characters are incredibly sweet, while watching their intimacy in clips that never exceed a very strict limit, never reveal anything special or offensive. Children certainly do not watch this film, but adults have to deal with such situations or not, and do so, and will not regret the tears they threw.
