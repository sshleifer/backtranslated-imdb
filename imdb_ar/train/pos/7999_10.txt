This should be one of the best films, if not the best film I've seen in a very long time. He had enough effort to please a fan, but the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the film, and it brought me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I added Dama and Joula in it, but I brought the real nature of what happens in the foreground of the film, and even I was a rude tear that ends for many people. I have to think. <br /> <br /> It's a must see for anyone. I've seen a lot of reviews, and they're showing the film, but to be fair, most of the movies that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best. This proves it again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
