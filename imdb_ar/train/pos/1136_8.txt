I'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but I jam it safely, so do not read this if you do not see the movie. <br /> <br /> I adore this film, and so do everyone I do - and that's the point. I spent a large part of my career in cinema, without being a representative. Such people are the heroes of this film: gaffers, pullers, air directors, lighters, writers, fashion dressers, etc., and the whole thing is said from their point of view, at least to a large extent. Most actors are steadfast and suck themselves to the point of tampering, and this is what spoils this film well, but you have to cooperate with representatives to realize that this film is a realistic drama! Possible alarm of the spoiler: In one wonderful scene, the two parties, both, are competing over how to _discuss_ something personal, something out of the entire script, with another actor, and they begin to form lines, train them, and criticize. Perform each other. <br /> <br /> Since the advent of this movie, it has not been, '91, it has become fashionable to do so, especially on television. But hardly anyone did so well.
