Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting movies. You are more than a film-clad then. I now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater. I also saw this short film "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly I finally managed to gather more information from your site. Thank you ........ I was surprised to learn that this short film was a slot for a Disney picture. I also did not remember a Disney movie. I did not even remember it was an opening film for Disney. I really wish they would show this on TV sometime. I wonder if Desie holds the rights of this film? Is it available on DVD? This is a must for all generations !!!
