It's better to see this episode from the beginning, because if you start watching it later, you'll be confused about what happens in Clark's life. <br /> <br /> However, this is a change; Clark is stuck in an alternative reality. Dedicated to him. Licks lost most of his legs in a wheelchair because of the bridge accident when he devoured Miss Clarke in the series pilot. Martha is married to Lionel. About the only hard is his most loyal friend Chloe, who still believes in who he is. Oh, yes, he has no superpower. He is in a mental institution to put himself in a fantasy world where he has powers, and ridiculed him for his belief in it. Apart from my kidneys, there is a mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who actually lives in the institution and is believed to be from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must remain faithful to whatever he believes is a reality, and not brainwashed by the institution's psychologist, who is actually the fourth Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is quite shocking and shocking. In addition, it provides a new touch of the usual type of "Smallville" ring.
