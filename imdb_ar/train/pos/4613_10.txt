This film contains one of the finest plots I have ever seen. For me, that's what makes it so wonderful! Fred Joyen and Lewis are doing what they did in the original Monster series. While there was less slowness, they still worked together in a superbly "playful" way. I hope that Yvonne de Carlo, as Laila did, has a greater involvement in the plot. She has made it clear that she can play comedy in the original series, but she is often lost in this film. This film also starred the great Sayed Caesar, but unfortunately he had no interaction with Gwen and Lewis. I think some of the best works could come from it.
