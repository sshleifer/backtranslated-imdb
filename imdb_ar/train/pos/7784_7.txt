It was awesome! Photography, editing, cinema, music combined to take us to the dangerous side of the tourist destination. The enjoyment of "decomposition" was without jeopardy. We were there! Dream sequences and new flash sequence sequences were. He talked to me. Keep up the good work! Another type is the city of God. Also - do not laugh! - Comedy, desperately seeking Susan. Nice band types, with great offers by everyone. Sorry, I think the training day fits this type too, with great offers for band teams. I had to switch the channel on some terrible sequences, but all in all, great movie!
