If this is an American movie, it has a value of 7: We've seen this before. Being an Argentinian film, I am an Argentinian myself, I would like to give it 10, because it is the kind of quality I wish - rather than I expected. It is a wonderful quality, given all the constraints imposed by the Third World ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene when Diaz Silverstein's fiance is forced to confess, you know what I mean by seeing a movie. I think this is the main moment of the film, not surprisingly perhaps, but the original. When the real procedure begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie, I always try to gather some of the previous information. Because I am dealing with this situation, cynical, and commercial, I press "Play" and commented on the reality and logic, say the best state of mind to enjoy such films. It is impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, yet it is possible to believe it in a certain way. For me, I could not stop laughing at each joke and one comment - "sos malo" (... "You mean") ... put in the mouth of Diaz, the greatest one. <br /> <br /> I'm fairly tired of watching "Designed for" Peretti movies. I know he is a wonderful actor, but sometimes I feel his roles are unfairly opaque, Louis Lucie's role in this case. I am not very fond of Argentine TV, so I have not seen much of the work from Luque, but it is obviously an excellent performance. His physical role, staring at him, and his content in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should need some improvements, just to let him show us how much he can! <br /> <br /> I do not know if Zephron is planning a sequel or not. I know he would not do that if he followed the rule that "the second parts were never good", so if he did, I would certainly go to see it. I hope to take into account, in the future, the possibility of giving Beretti counterparts the same opportunities to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie, great shows and lots of laughter!
