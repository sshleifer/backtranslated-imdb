A remarkable documentary about the remarkable achievements of the Women Lawyers' Association (WLA) in Kumba, South-West Cameroon, in the legal protection of the rights of women and children to domestic violence. In this Islamic culture, where men have always enjoyed sovereignty over women, according to Shari'a, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing the secular legal rights of women and children. After 17 years of failed efforts, the leaders of the WLA recently began to record some victories, the purpose of which is to share these victorious stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, Prosecutor-General, and Beatrice Ntuba, Chief Justice (President). Both of them are playing themselves in this film, which may contain automatically filmed footage, although I imagine that many, if not all, of them are composed of subsequent activities of the real events of the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all the plaintiffs themselves are also playing in the film. <br /> <br /> Two cases involving repeated beatings of the wife, forced sex in one case; another involving forced sex of a 10-year-old girl; and another involving repeated beatings of an 8-year-old child by a aunt. One of the battered wives is also seeking a divorce. We follow cases from the investigation of complaints to the results of trials. Results in each case are favorable for women and children. The perpetrators receive strict prison sentences and / or fines; divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive prosecution of a child hit by a aunt shows that these female civil servants are gender-neutral when it comes to law enforcement. It should also be noted that respect has been accorded to all parties, including the guilty. This film is very important and well-made. (It is interesting to note that one of the directors, Ms. Longinoto, co-directed the 1998 film "Divorce, the Iranian Style," which dealt with relevant topics in Tehran. My estimate: B + 8/10
