Wonderful movie. With everything you could want in a movie. Battle scenes are huge and lots of other actions. Suspense, romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Kind of like an old swashbuckler movie. Completely entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was quick and you never felt bored for a second. The story is like the classic story of trouble in the royal family. Beautiful actors and wonderful groups. Amazing fashion and trick work is fantasy. The special effects are also amazing. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is truly impressive as a representative and wonderful to look at. It looks like a sure bet on Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Reese Davis is as fantastic as he usually is. He is one of the greatest representatives of our time. <br /> <br /> Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and ideal for the leading lady, but she has an English accent with great success. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the film has won many awards, and I can see why. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an independent and amazing film. We certainly see that. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give it a Tin +!
