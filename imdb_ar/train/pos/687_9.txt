This flick is very entertaining, given the budget and its length. The story of the film is barely addressed in the world of cinema, so it has also brought a sense of novelty. The acting was fantastic (P'z to Dom) and filming was very good. I recommend this movie to anyone who gets into the excitement, you will not be disappointed!
