I did not expect a strong filmmaking experience for "Girlfight". It's indie. Low-budget, no big-name actors, a student manager. I have heard it was good, but this is not good. <br /> <br /> Karyn Kusama has developed in the modern Brooklyn city of the working class and has done an extraordinary job by taking over the struggles of the Latin urban day. Diana, the novelist, takes her anger and criticizes her high school peers and has trouble with the school and her friends. She is raised by her only father, who seems to love her and her brother, but he applies a strict sex standard to his children. The double standard of the father is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, learns lessons in boxing in the local gym, but Diana is deprived of similar tasks. On a gym mission to meet Tiny, Diana is fascinated by boxing. Tiny does not like boxing, so he and Diana trade; he gets money from Dad and then gives him to Diana to take the lessons in place. <br /> <br /> It's really a good film, where Diana grows up and learns about herself through boxing, meets a young man, and deals with some very serious issues face-to-face. There is no laughter, "everything can go just fine, walking right" accurately "Bend like Beckham." The reality and accompanying personal issues are very large for Pat's decisions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying film for it.
