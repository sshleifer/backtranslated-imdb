This film tells the story of a love story between the daughter of Albert Einstein and a gas station host. In order to combine the two, Einstein agrees to help Ed (Tim Robbins Hudsucker Proxy) learn to behave smarter. This impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstein went too far and Ed is considered a genius. It follows hilarious. Not to be missed. He was filmed in New Jersey's Mercer County at Princeton University, the Lawrenceville Preparatory School (double for Princeton University) and a beautiful vintage fuel station in Hopewell.
