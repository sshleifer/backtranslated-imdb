The film "Returning to the Lost World" was filmed in succession with the 1992 release of The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this series, the same five people, led by Challenger return to the plateau where the oil exploration group began threatening to destroy the earth. Gomez has a relationship with this. They are able to defeat the diggers and the plateau is saved, which is a pleasure for the indigenous people. <br /> <br /> As in the "Lost World", few of the dinosaurs we see are made of rubber, including T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Reese-Davies and David Warner re-represented their roles, such as Challenger and Smurly, and three other actors also returned. <br /> <br /> Despite reading many of the bad reviews of this and those cheap-looking rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed "returning to the lost world". <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
