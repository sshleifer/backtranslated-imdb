I really enjoyed this drama from Sydney Lumette. The best word I can come to describe is "crazy." It takes the viewer for an hour and fifty minutes and you are not allowed to breathe until the balances start trading at the end. Trust me, this movie will keep you guessing the whole way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well designed and wonderful. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino story. The acting is all amazing from all the strings and even the small parts, excellent cast. I also liked the cinema, which gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film. Everything was great. <br /> <br /> This movie is excited, exhausting and broken. It is almost hard to watch but you have to be so happy.
