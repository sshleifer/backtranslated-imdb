Yes, the plot is hardly reasonable and very thin. Yes, act acting from average to funny. Yes, it has been done several times before. But what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is now. There are already some original death scenes and tension increases throughout the film. In addition, you are not more than a few minutes away from violent killing. I urge everyone to watch this film with unbiased eyes and his vision of what it was; a scary scary flick, with a theme tune second to none.
