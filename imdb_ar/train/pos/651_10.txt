Potential spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I have no problem staying so awake. That reminds me of a 20-year-old, but that's better. As Veronica says, two chickens at a time. It highlights the strangeness in me, the informal conversation, and the real-life fascination, rather than the prostitutes, provoking us every step of the way. I am also entering the talks. Even if they are quite at times, what about it? Almost every chick, I talked to and outdone herself is usually full of the same b.s. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and sensitive like those b. Philosophical chicks are often to: astrological charts. The only deal with this film is that the man is almost as feminine as women. And mood. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there. <br /> <br /> I think it's funny that a brunette chick is clearly run by Veronica. She wanted to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica played with her all the way. It's a great. She thinks that there is a brunette thinking of having something between them, then steals the boy / man, this is only appropriate because they seem to be of the same age group. A brunette knows that she finally got it, when her face falls into the palm of her hands while Marilyn Dietrich sings in the background, redrafted, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I have this abstention. /> <br /> But do they eventually marry, Alex and Veronica? What are u? I can only imagine a very scandalous relationship ending in the collapse of pre-marriage. They are more than being something to each other than just throwing stones. <br /> <br /> I like the movie though. You've kept me amusing, you've got a beautiful and sexy look.
