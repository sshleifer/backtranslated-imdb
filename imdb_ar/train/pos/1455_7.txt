Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film that shows how there are two cultures shared by many cultures, but they do not even realize the impact of each society on the other. David Redmon opens your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in China make a razor that costs nothing and is sold in America for $ 20. When Redmon asks the Americans about the origin of these beads, they have no idea, and they seem to have found a stupid. When I told them that they were doing in China for less than nothing, with horrendous wages and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans looked sad, wounded and slightly remorseful but did not really seem to stop buying the beads after discovering the truth. When Redmon questioned the workers in China, they did not know that the Americans wore them on their necks and paid for the beads. The workers laughed at what was behind them and could not believe it. This film is a wonderful film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our country. <br /> <br /> M.
