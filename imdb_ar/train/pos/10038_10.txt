Titanic must be one of my favorite films at all. He has problems (what movies do not) but he's still fun. <br /> <br /> When I find someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I assume that my first reaction is "Wait a moment, do not you?" I know a lot of people who do not like this movie, I do not say I do not see the reason. "Love story very cheesy" Well, yes, but it is not fun and moving? Well, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, and everyone knows that such love does not already exist. But this is a film, does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that allows us to get out of the imagination for a while? The following complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, well, in this film, I agree that they do not perform their full potential. However, I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible representatives. Personally, I think they are very talented actors and unfortunately they are very famous for a film they were not amazing. But the roles they got were simple, and the characters seemed real enough to care about them a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do what was expected. <br /> <br /> Finally, if someone complains that they do not like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then sorry, but why they went on the ground and saw a clear film of all these things. It's like people who complain that Dark Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate motion pictures. Just because it's a film, not because you do not like this kind of movie, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> The Oscars, especially the best cinematography, which I find to be the best at all if you see in a movie, deserve the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that some writings have failed, such as the constant screams of each other's names during the film. The back of the story can be very weak at times, but in general it is a great achievement in making the Titanic look very real, and it feels drowned by a strong epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why so many people do not want this movie, but for the most part it's about the basic idea, like being a love story, rather than thinking that the movie itself is not badly constructed. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memos formed on the day it happened, and this film is extremely accurate historically, except for a few mistakes. The only key elements I can find are that the pipes must be copper, not steel, and that the iceberg seems somewhat unreal as in the scene they hit. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10/10, not because I love romantic films, but simply because it's a great cinematic achievement, which makes one feel appalled by the realistic adaptation of events.
