If you want to limit your vision of Chaplin to a lascivious hobbler as you laugh at your belly, watch something else. However, if you love a slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best, you should watch this one. <br /> <br /> The image is a hobo who can not actually get the girl. He spotted two other couples kissing a bench in the garden, and he had a blast that spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of the "park comedy" in Chaplin, filmed at the Mackintosh Park, with pickpockets, policemen and couples. These short films work, as coordination allows Kaplan to shine as he weaves through the dilemmas. <br /> <br /> Checked box, where it can be considered a spoiler, although it is not so if you see these movies. Everyone ends up in the pool except Chaplin. He gets the girl, who played her role in this case Manta Dorvi, like Mrs. Rusko "Fati" Arbakl.
