Well, Ruby looks pretty nice today, and some of the acting is pretty flexible, and most of the special effects can now be repeated by a 12-year-old who has a good computer editing program. Do not make me start around the label. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching the movie "Sci-Fi" on the Sci-Fi Theater / Theater scene at the local TV station on Sunday afternoon, so I saw a few SF films from the 1950s. While most of the films were happy to throw a rubber dress on someone and force him to demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever lifted the tape and showed that it was possible to produce a science fiction film that already contained a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many SF films produced in the 1990s will still be seen in 2030.
