Although there is a melodrama in the middle or rather at the bottom of this film, the story is beautifully recounted and skillfully represented. <br /> <br /> Yara, who is studying in Princeton, returned to her hometown of Israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend, Talia. Because Yara lived practically with her friend's parents after her mother's death, she lost her adoptive sister. Because Yara, blind from her birth, was her mentor and then watched, the suicide of her friend was as unbearable as inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Inevitably, it is the blind girl who decides to solve the mystery of this death. Although there is no sight, she has a vision. Although she can not see her, she is able to find what is far from the "ordinary" people around her. The film becomes an interesting mystery, while Yara searches for evidence of her relationship with Talia, her adoptive family home, the tapes, diaries, and past and present people in Talia. <br /> <br /> A story from Yara's point of view, also sees the film from her point of view, where you imagine what you hear and believe and imagine. The solution to the puzzle is somewhat traditional, but the research is done with such meticulous attention and a very beautifully presented answer without fuss, so that the moment of betting is easily tolerated. The facts gradually emerge inexorably, and illustrate not only the next life, but also its relationship with Yara. Tali Sharon, as Yara, uses her face and her moving voice effectively, and is completely believable as an adult girl and a teenager. We fully accept its ability at the end of the film to find its place in the world with greater confidence. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning the precision in which places and acts are repeated with small but important differences never become dull, the dead - on representation by secondary characters, and an interesting decision to represent only Talia in adolescence. I will discuss with Yara's final announcement as she stands with her friend, Gadi, in Talia, at the edge of the abyss, but that trip to the edge is so wonderful that the picture will remain on the horizon longer than her words.
