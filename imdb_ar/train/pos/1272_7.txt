A fun movie though I think it would probably be better if it has more depth. It's a mystery in the middle of the movie to find out why Elay is such a recoil. Then, when we are finally supplied with an explanation dating back to her childhood, there are still a lot of details. Maybe if they showed past memories or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is still good I see it again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
