Sarah Silverman is quite like Mania Zoe Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you love Jesus is magic, you will love this. If you do not, what is wrong with you? Glory to the comedy channel to push this in my face. My life has a meaning in the end, and "smell your car like chants" is a kind of humor. I'm a happy man. The first episode was a hysterical laugh and I look forward to hungry next week. This is like grease meets South Park. Totally outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I can see reading the phone book. Deliver accurate and very funny. It does not exceed any rhythm. Come to think about it, it's not her choice of materials. They are some really good things, because they are the way you choose them to be delivered. Thank you Sarah Silverman! Thank you, comedy channel!
