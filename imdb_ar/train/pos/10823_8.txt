I always liked John Concho and I hope this movie has been shown on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra presents one of the strangest performances in his career in this film. <br /> <br /> When we met Frank for the first time starring in the film, he is the brother of a notorious gunman outside the city right now. The brother strikes the terror in the heart of the town and Frank takes full advantage of it to flood the townspeople safely and safely in his shadow. Only Sir Phillies has no feeling for him. She is the daughter of Warehouse Secretary Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other gunmen arrived at William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turned out that Conrad had killed Sinatra's brother and that he would come to his city to take charge. They insult Sinatra and get him out of town. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> Sinatra turns overnight from a brow and becomes a man looking for a type of spine. It's a good performance, almost as good as his Oscar nomination in The Man With a Golden Arm. It is regrettable for some reason that this has not been seen for years. <br /> <br /> There are two other performances of the memoirs: Kenan Win, where the former fighter turned into a preacher who helped Sinatra find what he needed to stand in front of Conrad and Park. Then there is Conrad in what I think was his career role on the screen. He is a wicked villain, and he walks on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> However, what I like about Johnny Kunshu is its unforgettable climax where Conrad and Dark are dealt with. Let's just say that I think Johnny Concho was MGM's answer to High Noon and an introduction to what you do when evil causes the breakdown of all laws and order.
