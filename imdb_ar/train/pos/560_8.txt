Another Good Man flick thanks to the father / son mix of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). It is there to see that the younger man takes the fork or ride. "You are wrong Mr. Donston." Jeff Webster (Stuart) gives the impression that he cares only about himself, but clearly he can not abandon Brennan. John McIntyre is excellent as a Skagway law with due respect for justice visits to the truth. Another key theme is helping people and their role is being helped by people. The unit can do nothing and suffer from it. <br /> <br /> The above caption confirms Tatum that he can not live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction proves death. Maybe the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and I now own a DVD.
