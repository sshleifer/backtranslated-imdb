I stumbled upon this film when I was working on Ebay'ing Caesars Palace, and I admire its rich history in Vegas as another original luxury resort that is still in good shape (unless you are preparing Bally's, the original MGM Grand). In this regard, this film offers full strength. You have been given a great tour of the Caesars, despite all the renovations and additions they have made over the past forty years, which were alarmingly similar. In general, it is difficult to follow this plot, thanks in large part to the terrible liberation. When I say ugly, I do not use this word lightly. There are a lot of excerpts from the Vegas traffic, the crowds of casinos, and even a scene in which Robert Davidas' character revolves around his father, and without explanation, (Drivas) moves (from those notorious stories) , To a young boy, then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father. (This does not give any details about the plot; if there is anything, it can be set up for it, and probably will not be as entranced as before by editing). The film may progress in age otherwise, and it has a good message about the inherent differences between the father and son that most players can relate to in a fashion or style.
