I took this film on the IFC and enjoyed it, although I felt that the editing job was a bit tricky, although it may be deliberate. I had a little hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going a little bit of a non-linear conspiracy plot-like fantasy core. It seemed a bit forced, though. I definitely think the movie is worth watching, but I think it could have been used a little clean. Some scenes do not seem logical after others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see this rating as low as it is. It's not great, but it does not have any serious problems really. I gave it 7/10. The film showed at least that Lawrence Fishburne could act when he wanted to. They should have just told him in Matrix movies.
