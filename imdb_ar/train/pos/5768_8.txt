The collapse of a nuclear power plant causes the majority of people to turn into a deadly zombie and face-teasing zombie. A handful of unaffected people are doing their best to survive this cruel ordeal. Director Todd Coates presents a loving and sincere love for a vibrant and lively atmosphere of terror: Keeps pace fast and fun all the time, and fills the screen insanely from the wall to the wall work, thank God keeps the terrible dialogue to a minimum satisfactory. Moreover, the sheets are certainly not overly picturesque and overly elegant: this picture provides a delicious truckload of meat melting, evacuation, lots of chewing intestines, someone has snatched his heart, and there is even a nice impalement on the tree branch. The cards earn extra points to keep the tone melancholy and bad until the bitter end of the craft (for example, almost all major characters will end up becoming zombie chau). There is no doubt that this click has its fair share of flaws: the coarse editing, many pork attempts at Pathos, and the horrendous representation of a largely unnamed rank casts everything well. The first honors awards go to Kasey Rausch, a beautiful and wonderful film for her courageous portrayal of Daria Trumelio's trick. Frank Donnelly was as good as the veteran veteran of the team's leadership, Ralph Walsh. Most of all, the full awareness of the emblems of the sambang sense of gastronomy with the relentless momentum and constant continuity of this kind of horror ensures that this remains a complete explosion that must be seen from start to finish.
