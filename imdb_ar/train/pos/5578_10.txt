The hilarious perspective of the world is chronicled in this comic off-beat writer / director for the first time Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds when the four male heroes meet each week at a local dinner to talk about dating problems. We meet Brad: a good-looking playboy in the street with a sharp, fast tongue. Zack: A cynical and sensitive writer; Jonathan: A sexually amusing man with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation. Erik: The married man, who cherishes his weekly encounters with his only friends, hoping for some enlightenment for his boring and tattered marital existence. The experiences and tribulations experienced by single men in New York are amused in an amusing way, reflecting the sex of the city and the new HBO comedy The Mind of Married Man, giving a great light on fraud. The story takes a twist as the three meet with Mia - cleverly played by Amanda Pitt - all falling for her. They lure each of them with their strange abilities to agree with the characters they show. When they realized that they had all met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her for their friendship. Skin is a realistic portrayal of the world of dating, which the critic failed to recognize. In clear language, missed the point. The protagonist here is comics of real people. Exaggeration is hysterical, blending satire with humility, and must not be taken seriously as the dissatisfaction of the critic suggests. Watch this movie, you will laugh from start to finish.
