When reading a review from another user, saying it was a terrible game, I could not stand idly by and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!), for the story, I find it very good! I only complain that the enemies start to flash when they die, so they disappear; and some frustrating positions in the LEILA VR missions, when riding a bike, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Besides, it is a wonderful game, , Good graphics, excellent characters, fantastic soundtrack ... I recommend it! Definitely! It can be a bit old, but still enjoyable! At least, on a Dreamcast ... but the PS2 copy must be the same.
