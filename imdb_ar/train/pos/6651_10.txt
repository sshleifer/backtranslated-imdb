Gandhi, the great: <br /> <br /> Greatness in the world is associated with people such as Alexander the Great, Ashoka the Great for lying in their glorification more than humans. Gandhi is called grandeur because he is not really great but more human, because I always think that the output of humanity in us is where the greatness of human lie. Gandhi was a humane and striving man for humanity willing to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity but not for his enemies. Let me turn to review the film now. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi and my father: Gandhi My father is not a film about Gandhi but about his son Harriel Gandhi. In telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans walking on this earth, the director managed to film the story. The film succeeded in telling the story of a misguided son of a father leading a nation to greatness. Criticizing Gandhi's failure as a father to his son, I would rather say that it was a sacrifice given by Gandhi as the father of a son to achieve justice as the father of a nation. <br /> <br /> I hope the essence of this film prevails not only in India, the land of Gandhi, but through the hearts of all the peoples of the world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is the real human being.
