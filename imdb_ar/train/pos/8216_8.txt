*** Vandals *** *** Vandals *** After two games ("Magnum Force" and "Port"), Harry seems to have gotten back his step in the "sudden impact", a thriller movie that dominates the play wisely for its strengths : The charisma of Clint Eastwood, also directed by him, and a story that spends enough time in the exhibition and keeps its card for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> One time, Harry takes the case outside his home town of San Francisco (where he again faces a problem with his superiors because of his tactics "shoot first, ask questions later"), on the village of SÃ£o Paulo. There, (a warning: a potential spoiler), kills a group of hideous minorities, one by one, by a woman they raped years ago, and her sister was in Katatonia since the attack. <br /> <br /> The killer was filmed by Sondra Locke, making the Jennifer Spencer character an interesting mix of compassion and cold blood. Locke's cold eyes and cold voice, when she tries to either tame her sister in hospital or take revenge on the rapists, is very effective in drawing a picture of a mistaken woman who began years of suffering and anger to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> Many rapists are despicable, especially the commander, who has a "psychic nut" stamped on his forehead, and the lesbian appears to be one of the men, despite their inability to anathematically participate. The flashback scenes, although not graphically clear, are enough nightmares, and clearly aim to make the audience cheer for Jennifer as she kills her attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will dismiss the "sudden effect" as a waste: reckless, vengeful revenge tale. This is true at a certain level, but it is poorly neglected. What benefits the film is the power of Sondra Locke's performance, giving us a complex personality whose wounds appear more clearly in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is motion film with a view. <br /> <br /> You can take or leave the idea that some mistakes deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but when the mystery behind the killings becomes clear to Harry (realizing that he, wisely, has not been clarified by dialogue) - What to do about a murderer who can sympathize with his motives but whose behavior is legally bound to be intolerant. This makes the story more interesting than usual Dirty Harry fare. <br /> <br /> The quality of the other movie's recovery is Eastwood's trend. This, after all, is Dirty Harry, and Eastwood knows his character better than anyone else. The film is directed with elegance and wit, and is edited to give the traffic scenes a big profit. Some of the best "Harry's Moments" in the entire series are here, including Harry's famous line, "Go ahead - Make My Day". <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a film that contains the courage of its convictions to present a story about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that followed. It is also the story of the detectives installed, well made and well experienced. And certainly not boring. On these criteria, it succeeds greatly.
