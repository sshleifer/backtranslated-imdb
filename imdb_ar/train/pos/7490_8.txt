I have never seen this film before. He was filmed on groups of Old Dark House and Frankenstein and related to a small Bavarian village where the giant bat is supposedly sucking the villagers' blood. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it's a damn good movie with a wonderful ambience and a film that will not resign. Lionel Atwell, Dwight Fry, Faye Ray and Melvin Douglas play a character called Brettschnieder, which interests me since then. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully modified film that contains worrying linings and one that slowly builds up for its short running time and only lasts when, about ten minutes before the end, they realize they have little time to clear everything. From that point to the end, continue to race to the end with a little fun before. <br /> <br /> Leonard Malten and IMDb include a 71-minute running time and warn of shorter publications. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin could be wrong, and in that case I think that since a source I trust the most say the full operating time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). Quibbling about this I know it's crazy. Tend to work about 60-63 minutes the amount of material lost is much lower if its length is only 67 minutes. Personally I think this will not be important for five minutes at most, and I doubt very much that it will produce or break the film. <br /> <br /> What a runtime, if you love hard old movies, I do, by all means, watch this movie, it's a dark and stormy night movie.
