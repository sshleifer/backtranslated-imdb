The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and were not very funny and had a dramatic element as Bill (the mother) struggled with all the usual problems in life but this element was rather frustrating and did not mix well with comedies that might have been the reason for dropping it. It soon became one of the most popular comedy series created by the BBC! The chemistry between Bill's character and Ben was very funny and there was always a lot of wonderful drawings that were memorable in every series. Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show stopped when Principal Actor Gary Olsen died playing Bill, which is very sad because he was a great actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a very funny RIP man. <br /> This has disappeared Unfortunately, unfortunately, our TV shows are not repeated this much - although it appears on the UKTV Gold once in a while, but it must be repeated on BBC one or two to show this wonderful comedy to a new audience
