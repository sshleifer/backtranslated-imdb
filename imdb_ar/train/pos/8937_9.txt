This was a good example of how to produce an interesting film without using big stars and big influences. Just tell a real story about the struggle of two African American women over a turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This film challenges all of us to look at our personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white and black, etc. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a good message.
