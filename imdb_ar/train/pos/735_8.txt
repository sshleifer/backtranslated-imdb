A great cult film from 1979, where Vince Lombardi's high school students face the director of a new dictatorship called Miss Tugar (Marie and Ronov). Togar is a musical passion and blames the musical tastes of students for their transgressions. Riff Randell (PJ Soles), Ramones' No. 1 fan, who wants more than anything from the rock band to record her songs, tops the charge list. <br /> <br /> Now * This * is a movie impossible to resist. First and foremost, the incredible sound is unbelievable, with songs by artists such as Alice Cooper and Philvette Under Ground as well as a variety of Ramon songs. "Teen Lobotomy", "Sheena is Punk Rocker", and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. After that, the crew really gives everything they have, where Soles is an ideal choice for Riff's role; it's a real joy. Vincent Van Patten and Da Young are as serious as Tom and Kate, and Ronoff is very well dressed as a cocky and arrogant Tugar, and Clint Howard has one of his best parts ever like the professional businessman in the car wash room, Eaglebar, the world's new regulars like Dick Miller and Paul Bartel Especially as music teacher Mr. McGree) and Real Dunn Steele as enjoyable as ever. Of course, it's great to watch The Ramones playing themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie has a real spirit. The energy level is high, with storywriter and director Alan Arkosh bringing a great deal of taste to the proceedings. There is also a great sense of humor. Kite Fools are a great example of this. This extends to the "Clear" style of scene transitions. There are even the jolly giant mice created by the future make-up effects of Rob Putin, in one of the first vehicles. <br /> <br /> Get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a wonderful cult film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
