Back in 74 feet Eric Monte introduced the classic T.V Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmy Walker always seemed to be the star and not Esther Roll. John Amos felt most of the time jealous of the popularity of Jimmy Walker, who won millions of fans time to sit and watch the film Good Times could have been dead if the show was not JJ to save Kool Aid position always. KOOL AID was drinking like his favorite thing in the show. I was 3 when I came out and 8 when it was over. Instead of 1974-1979, it should have been longer in the eighties when I was growing up.
