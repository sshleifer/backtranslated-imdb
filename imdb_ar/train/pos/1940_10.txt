I was really impressed by this film. The writing was fantastic, and the characters were rich and simple. It is very easy to attach them emotionally. Creators in this film hit the nail directly on the head when it comes to creating real characters, making the viewer absorbed in their world. Moreover, the music is great. They used some independents to do the result, some soundtrack, and they do a great job adding to the film. If you have a chance to capture this film in a small theater or film festival (as I did), I highly recommend seeing it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this film. That's enough reason to go check it out.
