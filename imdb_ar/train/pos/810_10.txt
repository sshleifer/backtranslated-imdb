Maybe this is the best in all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The starting point for the film was almost like the fourth episode - the music of the space club and the ideas of the place of the club, where the danger of Japster the Hut increases even more. Luke was ordered to die in a hole in the basement of Bantha's bone-crushing teeth, which looked like a cross between a bear and a shark. The powers of Gidi Luke end the beast in the end. In addition to the surrendered rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of the fifth episode, Jaba was very angry that Luke had been sentenced to death in the Sarlak hole outside. <br /> <br /> But all the Star Wars members "good people", especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... Those other ideas repulsed Luke's execution; in the end, most of Jaba's soldiers died and Princess Leah was able to use force to choke Jaba to death. <br /> <br /> As in Episode 4, the star of death appears in Episode 6. When I analyzed the rebel fleet that was attacking imperial fighters around the Star of Death, I guessed that the members of the Star Destroyer team had accelerated the arming of the main laser, using the imperial fighters as a diversion. The 20-25 star destroyers that were lined up were ready to attack but were canceled and instead fired the laser weapon at the star of death in surprise. As soon as the fire was fired, the only hope of the rebel fleet was that the shield of the deflection of the star of death would fall. This affected Lando a lot because he wanted to destroy the star of death but he could not even take out the shield. It has been taken out of Lando's growing impatience. <br /> <br /> As in Episode 5, the Empire infantry appeared clearly with their twin guns, killing at least one Ewoks ... but the ancient Ewoks found an unusual way to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca, as well as another Ewok, were able to lead one of the infantry (and they were already using it for destruction from behind a pedestrian), and Ewoks used other logs to evict two other pedestrians. <br /> <br /> It is amazing what Luke can do with his serious abilities in the light of Saber, for example, the scene in Indore where Luke deviates from the laser shots coming from the Storm Trooper speeding bike, and uses Saber to toss part of the bike. Or, at the height, use Saber to break his father's arm during the final Saber battle with Seth Vader. <br /> <br /> You probably know the celebration of the Ewoks after the Star of Death bombing, complete with a brief fireworks display, the drumming on the spoils of victory (for example, the storm masks of the soldiers), and Luke finally meets Lia after the enemy of your Luke --- Darth Vader, dead now, burned in a holocaust. The celebration includes singing Ewoks but I think Lucas did not buy it - even with strong respect for the composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> In the home movie version, I think Lucas himself wanted a different end. In addition to the celebration of Indore, he wanted to get pictures of the celebratory scenes of many of the surviving rebel planets, including a ceremonial laser shot to destroy the Sith statue. Ewoks has been replaced with an alternative piece of music. Perhaps he wanted the extra things to prove that with the destruction of the star of death, the balance was restored to the rebel galaxies.
