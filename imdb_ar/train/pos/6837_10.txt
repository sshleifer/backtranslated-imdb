De Palma is a model of elegance and some scenes that will lead you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Surely the thing that makes this movie as good as the usual excitement is the style. It has some beautifully edited scenes and some really nerve-wracking scenes that will get you to the edge of your seat. The best scene from the film; museum scene and elevator death. There are some moderately dramatic scenes and the speed of the films may not be fast enough for the average viewer to appreciate this movie perfectly. Therefore, this film may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is very good but it really is the style that makes the movie work! This may be for the masses only but also for extraordinary viewers to appreciate the mounting tension in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some nice characters portrayed by good actors. Michael Caine is an interesting choice as Angie Dickinson behaves just as beautifully (not bad for a 49-year-old!). <br /> <br /> The musical result of Pino Donaggio is also De Palma, which you like and fits perfectly with the film, just like the other De Palma, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Great excitement to destroy nerves. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
