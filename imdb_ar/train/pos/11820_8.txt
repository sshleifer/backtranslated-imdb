Hey, if I told you to compare The Dark Knight with a 19-year-old movie that was modified with a 5.9-megapixel comic, would you let me go crazy? This just to attract your attention. Every day I meet people complaining about the lack of good films, they seem to know only modern film films. Searching for and exploring old movies is not bad, especially for those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those who can not be easily crossed, in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> The negative reviews mainly came from DT's "messed up" story. But it seems to me that the story is quite clear, and I did not have any problem tracking it. I have not seen the picture books, yet I'm not a huge American comic fan, but I appreciate filmmaking and high-level performances. Perhaps most people's expectations were too high for the story to tell. But if you see a movie that brings Madonna and Warren together together, what do you expect? I had some scratches on my head, and I can not help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? Although the role of the title, although as incompetent as it seems, he was still able to attract the public's attention and charm. Madonna was more outspoken than "not holding the breath" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was a funny and a miracle to himself. He seems bold enough to go mocking in his previously successful roles. We can see a group of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert de Niro punching our bellies to make us laugh. Thank you so much for the makeup. <br /> <br /> To me, not bad at all. The sense of surrealism really got me.
