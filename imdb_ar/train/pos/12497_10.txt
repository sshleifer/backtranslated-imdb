If you have not already seen Mary-Kate and Ashley's, all I can say is, "What are you waiting for?" It is a wonderful and wonderful film of fraternal twins that we all know and love so much! It's fun, romantic, sexy and exciting (breathtaking) scenery! Of course certainly; as always, Mary Kate and Ashley are the main scene here anyway! Do any real fan want it any other way? of course not! Anyway, it's a wonderful movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not already seen it, just now! I mean now too! What are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
