The film "L'Anglaise et le duc" by Eric Remer makes an ideal companion to Peter Watkins "La Comune (Paris 1871)". Both films, shown at the Toronto International Film Festival this year, illustrate the irony of how history is shaped by storytellers. Ironic, given the tragic events that took place in the United States during the festival. <br /> <br /> The film is in Paris during the French Revolution, a film based on "Grace Elliott" (Lucy Russell) memoirs. A direct account of how she survived those dangerous days. She also details her relationship with the Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who, unlike herself, is a pro-revolutionary. <br /> <br /> True model, you do not know his side of history Romer will descend. Romer is one of the first French directors of the New Wave, and has often been criticized for being too conservative. After all, in the midst of the days of the Viet Nam Youth Rebellion in the late 1960s and 1970s, he was portraying some romantic pastries like "Clare's Curry". But the old boy does not sell briefly; he has always been a student of human nature, not ideological, and L'Anglaise et le duc continues to do so. <br /> <br /> Romer characters are never "bad guys" or "bad guys"; they are first and foremost human beings capable of displaying a whole range of human potential - and limitations, and that is why his films are always provocative, Exception . <br /> <br /> Now for nuts and technological interdependence. <br /> <br /> Romer, despite making his way to his 80s, is still in the process of cinematic innovation. "Anglaise" looks like something you have never seen before, I guessed that, the old man - like many directors this year - has become digitally. <br /> <br /> All the outside scenes of the film seem to be In original Parisian settings in the 1880s, in fact, you might be distracted by the look of the film, which seems to have to come back again to take part in a second show to see the precise details of the psychological film - and yes, I will say - political insights. > <br /> Toronto has some of the world's leading young filmmakers this year, as well as some of the oldest in the world On the edges of the cinema directly next to the young. <br /> <br /> Young people live, aging, and long live Eric Romer
