I have voted well for the quality of representation, not for content. It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two of the previous negatives are traveling to their destination to steal a family of money from one of the downsides I learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to escalate, adding the soundtrack in the film to the general anticipation. After the killers finished their work at the farm, the next morning, the remains of the family were found by a friend of the daughter's church. The loud scream of blood, while scanning the scene on the phone with the broken wire, made my blood really cold and gave me the cold. That the killers met their just fate is a simple respite for this failed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Percy Smith. The book was also beautifully written by Truman Cabot.
