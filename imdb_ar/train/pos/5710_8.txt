Rene Claire is the leading musical. If you want to see where a song has led a story, this is the place to go. This is the story of a starving young artist who finds that he won the lottery exactly as his creditors call. Unfortunately, his ticket was in his coat, which is located in his girlfriend's apartment and was given to the fugitive who was then ... Oh, but that would be scary. <br /> <br /> This is the light and foam of the story where a large part of the dialog box is sung (most people think that this did not happen to Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It is the type of film he no longer made, and rarely did when they did. It is the sound of a film from the early days that it plays like a film of five or six years later. Clare is moving his camera in ways that Busby Berkeley did not do (although being honest, the comparison of film directors is unfair because Berkeley was mainly based on specific dance numbers and Claire was moving the camera through the "real world"). It's an amazing little movie. It is an enchanting film that will make you smile. It's just a piece of pleasant fun. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can not say more. It's just a cute little movie and that's really all you need to know.
