I love Claire Dance, and Kate Beckinsell looks surprisingly immature in her role. The film is only flawed because it appears that the defendants are in some convent, they work like monks in the grass and under a strict martial arts regimen. The representation, cinematography and amazing colors of what Thailand is supposed to be is remarkable, but Claire Daines steals the entire film, unexpectedly deep in learning the hard lesson of life itself to the end. From incredible selfishness to unheard of and totally unexpected in the real world. The flaws are accurate and I recommend the film, which seems buried forever sadly in rare TV shows. Personally, I want the movie for my group - a set of 10 films only. Watch it, you will be very touched.
