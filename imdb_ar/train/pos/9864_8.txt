I watched "Ice Age" in the cinema and loved the film. Although "ice age" includes many scientific faults and errors, such as humans, swords, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even the site where the story goes through (looks North America, but has some characteristics from Iceland for example) The planet enters the ICE era, and many animals migrate to the south where they are warmer. Sid is a stupid laziness left by his family behind him, and can no longer stand with him. Manfred, or how Mani is called a moody giant who is not interested in extinction or migration, will go north. Concerned that he was easily arrested, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey, they find a human mother with her child. The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and return the child to humans. Diego, one of the swords, decides to follow him and help him go to a shortcut to the human camp. What Manfred and Seid do not know is that Diego belongs to a Sabra clan that hates humans and wants to kill a child, and also pretends that they have betrayed each other to become food. What will happen, will depend on the behavior and conscience of Diego ... <br /> <br /> Known as the "Gilo era" - Brazil
