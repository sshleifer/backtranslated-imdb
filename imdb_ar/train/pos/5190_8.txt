The positives of this film are the amazing scenes of fighting - the very spectacular sword moves and the display of martial arts. Masterpiece of the real John Wu. The story tends to be a little week old, but it never overwhelms the overwhelming offer of acrobatics. If you're in martial arts movies, you'll love this!
