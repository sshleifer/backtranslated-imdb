I loved this movie was all I could not break it in tears while watching it, but it is really very exciting. I was struck by the performance of Ray Lotta, but in particular Tom Holsey's talent for his twin brother Ray, who is mentally slow because of a tragic and terrible childhood event. But Tom's character, though tragic, does not know self-pity and full of hope and life. This is a wonderful movie and do not miss !!
