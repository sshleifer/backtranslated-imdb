<br /> <br /> I assume this is not the best movie ever created, but I voted for it in 10 stars. Mainly because of my feelings in the end. I was impressed by all the people around me. This is something you do not feel much. We all feel a little ironic, tired of emotional feeling and lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. The film's story is centered around Jane, a young woman in the final stages of the multinational band, and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man about to collapse. This can be a boring and simply pathetic piece, but humorous and humane and lacks the emotions that win you completely and against the odds is a good movie feel. <br /> <br /> The representation of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is especially impressive and recent that is always incredible and powerful in its role. Chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards' masterpiece, an airplane made of scrap and old paintings. Flying here is a symbol of both life Richards and Janice live to the limit so one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A nice and funny film I recommend to anyone. Do not let the subject put you in trouble.
