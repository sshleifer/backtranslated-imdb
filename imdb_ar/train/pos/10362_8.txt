Meryl Streep is excellent in her delicate and delicate performance, such as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain, who was charged and tried for allegedly killing her child Azar Chamberlain and exploiting her for her lack of brutal gaps to defend her. Based on the book "Evil Angels" in its Australian version, A CRY IN THE DARK is a horrific film to watch. It presents a scenario that is very real for us in America: looking for someone against an objective is easy. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being the person who spoke about her opinion, the person who did not play the sympathy card, the person who was harsh enough to continue her life despite her terrible ordeal, was classified as a suspect and hated beyond understanding even when she obviously did not kill her child. The media began to tighten the noose and the progressive invasion of privacy that soon the whole nation glued to their groups as they broke the family piece piece. Through all this, Lindy remained as she always was, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. <br /> <br /> This position, of course, is the strength of power, not as sympathetic as it may seem, and people are going to respond strongly to it. They want to see a sad mother cry and cry sometimes at every turn, do not sit there and look empty. People do not understand that it does not grieve everyone the same way and when someone decides to stand strong, speculation begins. Meryl Streep embodies this highly polluted woman, creating a cold, but not feeling, woman who has stood by her convictions even if she has cost her freedom. Because of this, Sam Neill is allowed to slowly dissolve his personality into despair - someone has to do it, or Chamberlains will be very separate, and no one wants to see it. Except for the monster who was at the time of writing this media became. They will always eat the wreckage of the trains and feed the manure to the uninformed crowd.
