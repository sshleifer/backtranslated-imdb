I've seen this movie on the cable, it's been funny, from the police chief stereotypes to the wicked bad guys, Jay Leno, and Mr. Mayagi from the Karate Star in this good comedy about a typical car part. I compare this film to "RUSH HOUR" where a local policeman has to partner with an Asian police officer to resolve the case. Chasing through the Farmers Market in Downtown Detroit brings back memories. Interesting soundtrack, good script, give it 10/10.
