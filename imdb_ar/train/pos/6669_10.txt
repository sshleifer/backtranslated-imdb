I saw this film the day it was released last year. Hilarious I thought. Well, it's now on video and I saw it again. I like this film! The things they do are stupid at times, but that's what makes me my third favorite film ever. Special effects are fine, but the Smart Dialog box will make you roll over. I am the kind who will say that I am inspired by this film, so if you like dramas and others, avoid them. But for all others, enjoy it! Great acting. Hank Azaria is the best (he's not a coma or a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (ah, do not correct me. Messi offers his best performance (surpasses Fargo) praised everyone from Messi to Gravallo, but I think that Michel Mitchell was as good as Invisible Boy. Two problems: The most tedious part of the film is the sub-plot of romance between Stiller and Clare Forlani, and Casanova's conditional hearing. Some scenes present the story at all by no means, but it is a blast. Kinka and especially the book tend to drag on a scene until everything ends, but they start and you are ready for more. I swear after seeing that, you will tire of the explosive peak (which I think was fantastic) The camera is also great, moving fast with the actors. Also, Tom Waits performs prominently (he has this cool cool kind of calm for him) and, as someone else has said, the best part is when the characters show some humanity to them. Captain Amazing is very funny, (especially his speech to Kazanova about his ideal plan - you're trading) and the rush is as wonderful as Casanova. One beef: the most comedian ever (Eddie Isard) is almost lost, but his heart is in the right place. So in all, a wonderful movie. I give it twenty star and I hope everyone will one day see the brilliance in the best parody of the film, a man of six million. Now laughs as I think about it. 20/10
