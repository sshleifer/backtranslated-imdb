Come on!!! They did it on purpose !! Two of the current favorites on television (Meloni from "Oz", "L, O-SVU" and Janel from "West Wing") are connecting you to a nice nice / personal study. The plot is nothing fancy, but the representation is correct on the mark. Tim Busfield shows up for some neat bits. Well worth a look.
