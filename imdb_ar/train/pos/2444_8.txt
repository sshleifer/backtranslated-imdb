"George Lopez", in my opinion, is a classic ABC absolute! I have not seen each episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that you enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) walked in a moving piece of machinery. If you want to know why, you should see it yourself. Before I finish this, I would say that everyone has always performed very well, the production design has been great, the costumes have been well designed, and the writing has always been very strong. In conclusion, although you can watch new episodes now, I strongly recommend that you take them in the event of a break from the air forever.
