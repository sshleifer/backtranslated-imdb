This movie now appears on digital TV at least once a month, and I have seen it dozens of times or more, and it has not stopped cheering on me. If tomorrow I would see him again. This is the technique that Peter Ostinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians in acting, helped in any way to support the remarkable trio Carl Carlin, Bob Newhart and Robert Murley. Do not forget others in simple roles. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, simply told, about a former hijacker, a beloved thief, fighting and succeeding with the "New Age Technology" then, computers, and finding affection in the process. Even if it is small (tongue in cheek) unreasonable, so incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all, there is no awful way of working today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers about how to make a wonderful show of, and with, almost nothing ... except outstanding talent.
