"Presque Rien" is a picture that has been beautifully seen from the experiences of the young French gay. To avoid both stereotypes and preaching, it is a wonderful natural film, beautifully filmed, with a sense of the coastal city where the event takes place, and not always melodrama but often real. If anything is very unrealistic, where there is little traditional plot, only scenes of life. But the absence of traditional dramatic tensions is just as important as what happens in a skillful world. "Presque Rien" may not be the most exciting film ever; but its simple humanity serves well compared to the celebratory or fanatical views that often spoil the remedies of this subject. worth watching.
