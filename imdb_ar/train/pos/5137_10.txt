Interesting, fast-paced and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people watching a lot of TV shows and many of them. I stumbled during this show while I was sick at home with the flu one day, and I was hooked immediately. I have developed a crushing crush on John Burke. Both Ho and Claire did a great job of hosting the show together. You can really tell them that both love their work. <br /> <br /> The aggregation sections were excellent. I found myself interested in things I had never thought of before. <br /> <br /> What I really like to know is: What happened to Jack the dog? Did one of the hosts adopt it?
