La Maman et la Putain must be seen as a time-related film (post 68) and eternal in many ways. It is true that actors do not "act" ... True, they talk a lot ... but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying. The very long monologue spoken by Françoise LeBron may be the most accurate and moving text ever written about femininity, manhood and love. Not easy to translate accurately, though. This film is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
