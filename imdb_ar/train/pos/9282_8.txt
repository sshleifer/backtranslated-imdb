In Iran, women are not accepted into football games. Officially, they should be avoided by vulgar language and male public behavior. But of course it is about sexual discrimination. Women are less human forms. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. The soldiers catch them and hold some kind of cage until the police come and pick them up. <br /> <br /> Despite the crazy attitude, it's a movie with lots of fun. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways to fight persecution. You will touch at the same time where you have a lot of laughter. Good work by director Jaafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
