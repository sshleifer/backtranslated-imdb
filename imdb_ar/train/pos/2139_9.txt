I dealt with this film with low expectations but was surprised with great pleasure. I have been doing very well as he has been dancing dance movies in the dance hall in recent years, especially the "Hard Concert Hall". While the music is beautiful and colorful dancing, for me the film is not about dancing. This is the Japanese institution itself, which gives male office workers long distances at work and leisure time after work to entertain does not include their families. Here we have a guy with a full family and a great mortgage and a lifelong craving for life. Is attracted to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio passing through him, which leads him to try to dance in the dance hall. Also Japanese is the fact that the corrupt motives that have begun his new passion have become clear but somehow acceptable, at least in the end, by the family and the public. Attitudes of dancing in the dance floor, as mentioned in the film, are certainly non-Western, although discipline and music are two obvious cultural imports to Japan. Cultural contradictions are therefore interesting. Even without cultural ideas, the color, dance and enthusiasm of the actors make this movie fun to watch.
