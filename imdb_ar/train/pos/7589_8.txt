Jay Cho plays the role of an orphan who grew up in a kung fu school, but was expelled by the corrupt school principal after his fight with a group of thugs in hiring the evil villain. Happens with fraudster crook Eric Tsang, who immediately sees cash potential in the young man's skills. Basketball is the chosen path of wealth, and Tsang seeks to obtain it in a university team and promote it in the media. The overall success leads to a basketball tournament and a really bad opponent team run by the evil villain before. <br /> <br /> I think football is a little Shaolin, but it is not strange or ironic - the plot clings to its beauty. Close to the sports film conferences, and offers all the elements that the audience expects from the setting. I've seen it all before, but it's a kind of thing that never hurts to see it again when it's done well. Luckily, this is well done here (some may say "amazingly" with Chu Yen-Ping in the manager's chair ... I expect to have "good assistants") - delivers the text and the presentation is elegant and elegant. Jay Chu remains largely expressionless all the time, but this is his style, and when left to a passion that fades through him, he can have a very good comic effect. Eric Tsang makes up for a bigger character than his life has played several times before (in real life, for example) who gets many emotional moments movies. <br /> <br /> Since the movie revolves around basketball, it is good that the scenes of basketball matches are exciting. The cast shows some real skills, including Chou, and some improved wired works and CGI add this element of realistic kung fu skill that makes the viewer more entertaining (assuming you like this kind of stuff) and justifying the plot / existence of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is only one important fighting scene in the film, but it is popular in the "against many" style. Jay Cho seems to be doing a lot of his own moves, which is very impressive - it's obviously strong and fast for reality, and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography makes him look like a real military artist. I wish there was more, but at least it was a long battle. <br /> <br /> Pretty much the kind of new Chinese movies that you hope to be from the trailer and I recommend watching!
