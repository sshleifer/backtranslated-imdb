It is a high-level Finnish film this year, although Tango Kabaree is close to the film. Director Lampela directed another nice little film called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista two years ago (I loved a desperate woman). Beautiful film on a Saturday afternoon in a small village / town. The actors may not be beautiful or beautiful but they act beautifully. I certainly hope that many of them will get a statue of JUSSI (Finnish Oscar) next spring. I think this film can make it abroad as well.
