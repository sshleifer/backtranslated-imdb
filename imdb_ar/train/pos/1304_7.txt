Okay. Yes, this was a very tight budget film with continuity errors (like individual scenes that were clearly filmed under the sun and then in the shade and then mixed together), and as much as I liked Nick Mancuso, he often liked it in part, Support is very poor (in addition to using at least one representative for two different but distinct cycles). But come on. Richard Jericho was hysterical (his hair alone was worth the visit). Stephen Ford was very lovable. Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was very monotonous and uninteresting. Classic? Bad parts number? Yes really. Amusing? Yes great I would love to be on time for the day they decided on the type of hairdo Greco. "Are you fast?" ... "Do not fast."
