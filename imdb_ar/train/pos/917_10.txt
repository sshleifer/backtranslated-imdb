I saw this in July and even with the theme of Christmas, I found it touching and sensitive. It is not a person with a realistic mind because it is full of imagination and beautiful moments that sometimes make no sense. William Ross did a great job like Hank. I've only seen him in a remake of a long hot summer where he played a weak character. But in this expression, the expression was in his eyes all the time, as Hank considered the things that were happening to him, wonderful and compassionate. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and beautiful as usual and believable in this role. Peter Falk in Max's role was wonderful and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including scenes where Hank realized who Max was really in his life. It's not for everyone ..... especially those who are not in "feel good" movies and this is definitely one! If you want to have everything perfect and rational, avoid it. But I think it deserves re-viewing, which is why you recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have video devices. :)
