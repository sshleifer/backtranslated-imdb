Excellent series, brilliantly acted and directed, but unpopular (I was told) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn by one display after. It is now only viewable in special collections and through the British Film Institute at special request. It is very unfortunate that Ian Holm's meticulous portrayal of Bernard Samson is exhausting but his resolve is wonderful; one of his best performances. The cast, including young Amanda Donohue and Hugh Fraser, is wonderful. With Mel Martin, the opposing and cheating wife, and Michael Degen as Werner Mercurial, the story positively reflects the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the big game.
