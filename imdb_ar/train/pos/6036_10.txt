I'm definitely not in the target audience for this film. I am a nearly 50-year-old man found in the independent film world. This happened by chance, with the discovery of a film called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I noticed about that film were that they were (1) technically and 2) brilliantly. When I read an interview with the local newspaper's director and said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to feel interested. When he said his main effect was the "station worker", a film I saw on DVD a week ago, I decided to go and check it out. The result can be described in the same vein as the writings, although the two films are not both wise content. Both films suffer from technical errors that are overcome by stunning writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me revolves around a man who seems to force himself to be always preoccupied, always running in one way or another, filling His life is so small that he never has to deal with big things. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and influential. I can tell from my observation that not much has changed since I grew up, young people still face the same problems they always face. The writer wears these problems and themes in modern slang, character characters are wonderful and wonderful, making them do quite reasonable things. As far as independent cinema goes, this may not be technically ideal, but technically, it is very close.
