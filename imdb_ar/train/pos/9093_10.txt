I am the father of a child with special needs and I enjoyed the film so much! The love was warm and pleasant. I have long learned to see humor in things. I thought in particular that it was good how all the other characters were concerned about Frankie and who would take care of him after the death of his grandmother. I attended a screening of the film with other parents and my special needs children before editing the film. Everyone enjoyed the film and inspired really great discussions. We talked about how to make our children laugh and also talked about how worried we were about them. The screenwriter talked about how she worked with autistic children and other children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. It's based on a person's real personality. Our family has a sense of humor that has passed us through very difficult times. I give the film two thumbs !!!
