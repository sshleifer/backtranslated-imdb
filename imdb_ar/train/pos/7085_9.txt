I just bought the DVD and I must say, (after seeing Brazil and fear of hate in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. In addition to being a fan of Monty Python, the genius of Terry Gilliam in this science fiction film, played by Bruce Willis, plays a great role as James Cole, as well as (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt, who played Jeffrey Joyens. You must have science fiction lovers, or film lovers of any kind, because it includes suspense, drama, motion, etc. <br /> <br /> In any way the plot, in the future, 1% of the world's population survived a disease aimed at eliminating the human race, which was launched in the past by an "army of 12 monkeys." James Cole (Bruce Willis) was sent to 1996 (when the virus was unleashed) to know the disease, so scientists in his time could find a cure. Before I go further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals dominate the world on Earth because of the disease that will kill humans. However, when it is returned in time, it is actually returned to 1990, where it is sent to a mental institution because it tells people of the virus. During his stay, he met Jeffrey Joyens (Brad Pitt) who was later responsible for the elimination of mankind. He also meets his psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe), who eventually joins Bruce to save the world (as he sees it right). He is sent back and forth from time to time and eventually sent to 1996 where he then wonders about his mind but walks around in time Later to reveal the impressive quarter-end of the film and later arrive at its somewhat appalling climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus (not actually Brad Pitt) and is instead photographed by the police as the killer escapes.
