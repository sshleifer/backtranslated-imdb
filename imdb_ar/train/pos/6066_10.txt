When I first saw this film, it was a long video on VHS. I liked this movie, because it was fun and enjoyable. A few years ago I saw another film, The Amazing Andy Colby Adventure. In this film, parts of the Lost Wizards of the Kingdom Kingdom were. I started looking for the movie "KOR" which lasted many years, because I wanted to watch the whole movie, not just the parts used in the film * Andy Colby * -Movie. There is no place to rent this Cor-Core film and no store knows this movie. A few years ago I saw the old VHS tapes I had at home, what a wonder ... I had this movie many years ago at home, but the film had a different title, because in Germany it contains 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home, this time I had a lot of time watching * KOR The Conquerer again. The music is great during the movie pit, but the best part of photography with music is this moment, when KOR walks drunk during the green walk. The music in the background was a bit of magic. I love Bo Svensson, as well as the boy who played Simon in the film. They both did their job very well. Manfred Karatz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thanks for everyone to read my comment.
