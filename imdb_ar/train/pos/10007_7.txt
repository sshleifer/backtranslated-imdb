The Night Listener (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Tony Collett, Bobby Canaval, Rory Colkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Colom, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Hitchcockian's suspense for Williams offers a low-profile performance. <br /> <br /> What about celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia associated with the other and why is it almost standard? <br /> <br /> In the latest derange fan scenario, based on no less real events, Williams plays the role of a radio personality named Gabriel No one, who reads stories he wrote on the airwaves and has collected interesting fans. He formed a little boy named Logan's House (Kolkin), who presented a manuscript about the troubles of his troubled youth to the editor of "No One" Ashe (Morton) who "no one" gives to himself to read. <br /> <br /> No one is naturally annoyed but ultimately fascinated by the nightmare of a house that has been kidnapped and sexually assaulted for years until it was finally saved by a nurse named Donna (Collette gives excellent performance) adopted a boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that the house Die of AIDS. Of course, no one wants to meet the fans, but suddenly doubts their potential hidden motives when the seed is planted by his vulgar mistress Jesse (Canaval) who was not for her sudden departure from her New York City apartment. Anyone in an emotional predicament has now grown only into a storm in a teacup When he decides to conduct some investigations into Donna and Pitt's background to discover some facts he did not expect. <br /> <br /> Written by Ernested Mobin (co-scriptwriter with his former sweetheart Terry Anderson and director Steiner) and based on a true story about a fan trick, he discovered that he had some Hitchcock moments working on a full tilt like a crucible kettle Old fashioned. Williams is an excellent contender and he really wants to believe that his true admirer is really true and loves him (the only thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some disturbing moments with the creepy Collet, whose physical character I will He mentions but the desperation of her character that can bother you to the core. <br /> <br /> But the film is running out of gas and in the end it becomes fairly repetitive and predictable despite a tricky piece of mystery and mystery from Stettner, it pays to hear your inner voice: Be careful what you hope for.
