Jesse and Sileen (Ethan Hawk and Julie Delby) are strangers on a European train. The two came from different backgrounds on a large scale. He was an American and a French woman, having talked a little about the train that Jesse had managed to get from Celine to leave the train and explore Vienna with him. Over the next few hours, two of Vienna toured everything the city had to offer and became madly mad. But will this newly discovered relationship continue in the sunrise in the past? <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy represents a breath of fresh air to a kind that is diminishing. Written and directed by Richard Linclitter (Angry and Confused), "Before the Sunrise" is never forgiven for his "small crew". In fact, it thrives because of strings that make you love her characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Intelligent dialogue makes this a necessity for romance lovers.
