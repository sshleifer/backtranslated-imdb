For the first time, Tom Kish turns a winning film in the spirit of dark comedy. They shot a simple budget, but I enjoyed the taste of a simple brother movie in the film Coen Brother Simple Blood ... and throw some Monty Python flavors to take off! He needs to see more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more goodies from this writer and director.
