I do not claim to be the authority on the actors who played Othello, but I never saw a performance of a play, a movie or on stage. Othello was portrayed with more humanity and originality. <br /> <br /> According to biographical notes, Fishburn did not receive any professional training as an actor. Perhaps this explains why his representation, in this beautifully edited film, is more believable and powerful. Instead of chewing the scene in a way that is supported by such strong roles, Fishburn's image focuses more on Othello's love for his wife, and on his deep sadness at her presumed betrayal, rather than on violence and revenge. In short, performance is too low and became more impressive through the very clever interpretation of Fishburne than it could have been. <br /> <br /> The representation in every place is wonderful, and the speeches (abbreviated) are a blessing of light editing. (Even then, Shakespeare can be improved, time after time - if this is a betrayal, take advantage of it!
