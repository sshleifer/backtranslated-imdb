Critics did not like this film. It has been bombed in the United States and as a result has received only a limited offer in Britain. This was a great shame, because it represents British humor and not American, and was supposed to appear in Britain first. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks stunning and Russian is quite convincing. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman from the film "Alumni" and "Birthday Girl" has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of this classic story in the 1960s (although it is a different story!). <br /> <br /> It certainly changes several times from comedy to black comedy to the thrill of adventure - but it is unforgettable, moving and breathing a huge air compared to the huge demand for the huge budget. <br /> <br /> Watch it with an open mind!
