I watched this film two days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. My last evening in the French capital was the best farewell I could have chosen. These twenty episodes prompted me to lighten the impressions I gathered in Paris in a warm way to the heart without drifting into the downscale art or schmaltz. Each episode is full of surprises, strong emotions, animations, and every short film directed at the story of a good short story. For me, this type of film requires much more talent and character than any director and storywriter than any two-hour epic drama, all of which have done their job well! The stories were carefully chosen in relation to their conformity with Arrondissement and the expression of a perfectly appropriate taste. Each episode of a different ankle was seen, had a different theme, and a different style, and the 20 stories still lead to a harmonious band of films. The most prominent feature of the film concept in my opinion is based on the fact that you can switch between a wide range of emotions and moods without risking overload, just in the other direction: the plight of sadness, depression, total joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion This film is unique and fresh. And do not forget the theme of love! Love between characters, love between characters and Paris, as well as the love of directors and actors / actresses for this project. I do not want to go into the details of the episodes because there are many of them, but I have to highlight the world famous actors and actors from all over the world and their approach to this project. Some played with their image, some broke it completely, and some interpreted the stereotypes associated with their country or the roles they had played before, so all intertextuality was given through the film. All in all I can recommend this great compilation and will look forward to releasing it on DVD.
