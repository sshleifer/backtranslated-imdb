That is why the historical films / biography are very important to all of us, moreover when they are done well, such a movie! <br /> <br /> Before I saw The Young Victoria, I knew some things Queen Victoria, but in the end I got to know her bigger. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is simply as wonderful as Victoria (who will guess that!) and may get nominated at the Oscars this year. I personally encourage her ... <br /> <br /> For technical issues, I am pleased to say that this is a very successful production, with a wonderful artistic direction / decorative set, and of course, as I expected it to be, the design of my outfit is fantastic! <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage is that I want to see more and learn more about this interesting queen, but above all an incredible woman and woman! <br /> <br /> Bravo: 9 out of 10!
