The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are a direct translation of what Greene wrote; for example the quiet but gloomy humor that penetrates the scenes with Boy and Laurie, or the obsession of the murdered child who takes some plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to ridicule. <br /> <br /> However, I do not want to point out that the film is bad in any way. Always look the part and keep the story in mind as good. Some small figures were stock representatives who could turn their hands to anything. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
