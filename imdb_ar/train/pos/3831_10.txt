This is a free adaptation of the Clarence Mulford novels; Willaim Boyd film fans are likely to feel a little bit of the sea here (the reviews here reflect so far). But I knew the story of Hobalong from the novels first, and I never cared about Boyd movies as soon as I walked around. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice - he did not take a "Western" nostalgia. . Instead, he approached Cassidy's story as a slice of what we call "Americana"; or what he called the older critics "homespun". When the film burst, I found myself more and more reminded of the great version of the movie "Hallmark" by Mark Twain, "Roughing It," with James Garner's novel. <br /> <br /> Both films remind us of this, although the films about "The Old West" may always be legendary for Americans, and they should not be "western"; they can be just films about what it means to be an American At that time, that place. <br /> <br /> I never felt connected to watching this film; there is no effort to remove the legacy of Boyd Cassidy down our throats, nor a paradox, nor a camp. So I felt that these characters had walked - or stretched horses - through some of the real Western America that I could walk a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Because of this, the simplicity of the film - positively avoids anything we have come to "style" - is all in its favor; the simple representation of performers fits this accurately; my God, I really feel that some stories revolve around fire fighting In the Cattle Drive - no visual veneer, just quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from a good narrative of the adventures. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer set aside interested expectations, he / she would find great fun in it. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 9 stars, but I'll be giving it a dozen because most of the reviewers here have completely missed this point; I urge them to put their memories of Boyd aside and give this film another chance. <br /> <br /> Note 1: One of the reviewers complained that Hopalong shoots the dead in this film, instead of shooting at their hands. (Ala Boyd Cassidy); first, Cassidy shoots the dead in the novels. Second, if Cassidy was a real sponsor he would have been shot dead - the problem of firing from people's hands is that they can always get another gun - which is part of the sub-text of this particular film. <br /> <br /> Remark 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, and they have the director of "Godfather" among whom can provide all the opportunities for them to produce films I can not; but the good film is a good film. This is a good film if by someone called "Coppola", well, that's just as it is. America is the land of opportunity (or, until Bush took office) - that's what the great American novels are about.
