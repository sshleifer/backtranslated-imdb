One of the most sensible comics to hit the Indian cinema screens. A new version of the film "Preadarshan" In the 1980s, Malalayam hit Boeing Boeing, which was a new version of the 1960's "Holly", with Garam Masala raising the level of comedy in Indian Cinema. <br /> <br /> He has proved to be one of the best Indian film stars who can do comedy. I have combined well with a great new piece by John Abraham. However, John is still in the shadows of Akshays and fails to rise to the proper level. <br /> <br /> The new girls are nice and play a full role in achieving justice. <br /> <br /> You should see comedy. Leave your mind away and laugh for two hours !!!! After each laugh is the best medicine! Ask Breadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
