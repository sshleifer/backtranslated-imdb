Marion Davis starred in this wonderful comedy "Show People" by MGM in 1928. Davis plays a huge role in Savannah, Georgia, which reaches Hollywood with her father (Del Henderson). The Chalabi they reach is a hustle - as is the outrageous South Davis. Davis drowns a job in a slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but brings her success. She meets her smiling star colleague William Haines, who was immediately struck with her. Well, Davis gets a job at a more famous studio ("High Art Studios") and gets a job in deep cut. She shows her handsome but fake actor (Andr√© Telfer) the ropes of how to be a Hollywood star of the typical buzz. Davis gives up her bad friend and father for a good life, but of course you learn that this is not really it. Marion Davis is wonderful all the time, she - outrageously - runs a series of emotions required of a "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comic character, and there is a veil by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars today, including the film's director, King Fedor. This is a silent movie with some "sound effects" where the audio images only appear. Treasure Movie.
