I really liked this movie because I have a husband like the guy in this movie. This film revolves around Lindsay that meets Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season is not there. Fall in love, but when spring comes, she is traumatized in her life when she is placed on the pedestal Ben has put on. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all Ben's obsession with baseball. He can not separate from what he likes most, which makes it funny and why many women can contact Lindsey in real life. People sitting with them in baseball games are just as obsessed. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie and you will not hit it if you rent this movie.
