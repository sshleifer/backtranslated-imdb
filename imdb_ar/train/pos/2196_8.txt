So what happened in those 10 minutes that were so terrible that they had to get it out of the original film? Three years have passed since the production of the film ... Barbara Stanwyck played the lead role in the original play, but here, Carol Lombard played Maggie King. Co-star Fred McMurray is likely to be known for "double compensation", with Stanwyck, and his famous television program "My Three Sons." Stay tuned for Dorothy Lamor (Young Bob Hope Films) and the wonderful Franklin Bangbourn, who dazzles every film on the tape. Of course, works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add Samia Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and smart joking at first. Jean Dixon, Maggie's friend, Eli, who was the best friend of "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High", Maggie meets the soldier who leaves the army. Maggie lacks her boat when she leaves the port and intertwines with the soldier. The 20-year-old Quinn Hotel features a small scene at the local pub in Panama, where Johnson (MacMurray) plays on the trumpet. Maggie and Harry (Butterworth) and Skid band together and tried to figure out how to return to the United States. Some good singing by Lamor. Good performance (but short) by Cecil Cunningham as "Morph", the wise and helpful owner of the local salon in Panama. While others regretted his poor condition, it was not too bad, and it was a bit strange, as the fake Central American language was prepared for the first half of the film.
