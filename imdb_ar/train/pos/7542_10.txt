This film will not sit well with some, but it should be seen. I am glad that someone finally brought up for discussion the facts about how African-American couples worked to form a name in societies and how many felt they were trying to stay there with the transition of "other" African Americans. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little movie is similar to Spike Lee Joint ... You have an African-American male (Danny Glover) making his way to leading positions in White law career in 1970. Like any American, moving his family to be compatible with his escalating mobile status but forgotten, there are still a lot of problems occur. The only African Americans in the neighborhood at that time were maids. One owning a home? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the blending started. He asks his wife (Wobi Goldberg) to "get involved" to do what all the other women in her area do. Only when the man thinks he and his family are "in", a nearby African-American comes in because they have won "Mo'nique" and in his eyes and does not want to do anything with them because he does not want the neighborhood to think they are alike . Is, of course, better caliber, his new neighbor "ghetto" should not be there! Who is having trouble now? <br /> <br /> What this movie shows you is the great pain that this family needs to suit them, and how to lose itself in this process. It makes you wonder where racism starts and ends ... and with whom. It shows that regardless of your color and how much money you have, you can still close yourself up from the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African American children, when they "merge" in such neighborhoods, fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit culture (full of blond hair and blue eyes, around you). They laugh along with jokes, do not know they are jokes and do not know ... why. <br /> <br /> In general, this film revolves around "people." Regardless of the race you are in, this film revolves around the extent of the fear that can be toward your neighbor and towards each other ... all in order to reconcile you ... all because you feel you have more money than others, You are the best - and you forget the conflicts you have faced and those that stand behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, not everyone. But take a look and judge yourself. <br /> <br />
