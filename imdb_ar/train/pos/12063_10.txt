The Woman in Black (1989) is a television movie of Susan Hill's classic classic story, published only a few years before the film. Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD, and as far as I know, it was deleted on VHS. Its availability contrasts directly with its popularity among those who know horror movies. The story revolves around events in a coastal society in the early 20th century, when a young lawyer was sent by his company to complete the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died in her marshland home. What he thinks will be a routine and possibly arduous task turns into a nightmare because he discovers that the old woman was inhabited until her death, and that the ghosts of her past are not satisfied with the rest. The story is listed in a subtle but concise manner, never indulging in self-glamor or over-induction. The tight budget may have contributed to a meaningless approach, but that is exactly what the story needs and why it works well. This does not see those fears. Having said that, there is a particularly terrifying scene that depends on the visual image and works on perfection. I watched this movie during the day and still gave it nightmares about a week later. If you love horror, do what you should get and watch a copy of The Woman In Black.
