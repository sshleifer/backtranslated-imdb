Like his early masterpiece "Elephant Man" Lynch proves to his critics that he can tell a straightforward story without losing a touch of art. This is a true story about a retired old man (expertly playing Richard Farnsworth) decided to ride a tractor across a few states to do his separate brotherly visit that now stands at the door of death. It is a beautiful result of Badalamenti, a wonderful portrayal of rural life (I love those aerial snapshots of the corn field), and the hand of a lathe reveals the basic human humanity, it is a beautiful slice of life film. The pace of some viewers has slowed too slowly to sleep, but those who stay along for the ride will be rewarded in the end.
