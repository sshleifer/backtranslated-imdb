Even though I'm too young to remember the first show of the series (Just Being a Child), I later discovered it on television in the late 1980s, only when I was interested in the war and all its aspects. My grandfather was the first to introduce me to this series and also gave me my first concerns, which relate to his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then she has devoured many books and watched numerous television series about the Second World War era, with divergent views. British television stations are generally very good at producing, where the world can easily witness, with many of the gems produced by the BBC and independent companies. I highly recommend titles such as "The Nazis - Warning of History", "Flash War" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain in War in Color", with its accompanying series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​is of a very high level. The "world in war" is by far the best, and despite his age, he has not failed to achieve it. There will always be a new revelation about the war that will continue to emerge clearly and that is not included in the series. Of course, World War II took place on a large canvas to produce a series containing every detail that requires more time, money and then anything else, even if such an undertaking Is possible. What I feel I should say to those who criticize it that it does not include everything is that the "world in war" can not really do it as a chain but it certainly can push you to do more research - and make it fun. This has certainly worked: I now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs, tapes and CDs. Recommend to anyone who even has fleeting interest. The series is so well made that they find it hard to disagree that it is very good and useful programming.
