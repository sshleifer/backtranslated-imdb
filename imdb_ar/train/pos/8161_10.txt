When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very wonderful. But this film does not suit everyone, especially people who do not like the mysterious scenes because Dentist has many wonderful sights. For this reason it has been rated R18. It is about the dentist in Beverly Hills Dr. Alan Finston, who finds his wife Brock betraying him with a pool man. It is best to go to your dentist "before" you see this. But if you do not like going to the dentist already, it is best not to see this because you may postpone going to life. The dentist has the best bloody revenge I have never seen before. Anyone who has ever seen a movie containing a dentist (spoiler) pulls all the teeth of his deceptive wife and cuts her tongue without anesthetizing a really terrible flick, but not for everyone.
