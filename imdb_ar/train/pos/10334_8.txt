This film has never been seen until recently on traditional Chinese medicine, and found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer Nazi occupation of local towns like many other European cities, for example: Norway. World War I ended and people in this city still suffer from their missing and wounded soldiers who are always created by war. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm C.) Gorky Park returns from the war with his lost leg and was a former school teacher in the city. He grew up a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and did not accept him in turn either. When Hitler's party grew to power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish town for their treatment of him, which was really in his mind. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pasekowski), "Chloe Prayer", played a prominent role as a woman who lost her husband and romantically participated with Jim Wilhelm. There are many past memories and some real facts about how the Nazis destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle cars are displayed in this picture as Jews go to Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie, and such a theme, give it some of your time; this movie is very up to the 1944 film and the story will not forget it very quickly.
