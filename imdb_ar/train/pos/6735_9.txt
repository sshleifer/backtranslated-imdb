Wonderful! Stacy Peralta followed Dogtown and Z-Boys with a stunning documentary about the history of the great surf culture in America. Combining archival footage from the inside and interviews of surfing legends, we are moved to the bold and free life of the early pioneers who encouraged their passion for this sport to an industry that touches the lives of millions today. <br /> <br /> is to identify these symbols and stories that give the movie warmth. You can feel Peralta's respect for this group and we hear stories about Greg Nol stepping out of a group of his fellow skiers on the beach to challenge them 50 feet off the coast of northern Hawaii. Or Jeff Clarke, wandering around the dangerously dangerous Maverick area off the coast of northern California alone for 15 years before being discovered and became a surfing destination in California. The History of Short Stories by Laird Hamilton, Icon Surf Today. When you hear Greg Nol points out to Hamilton with a longing that the best player ever sent chills at all in the spine. <br /> <br /> aside, Noll and Clark and others in Sundance Noll's show had modestly described himself as old, surfer up the hill, and was deeply moved by his public reception and cinema. ) <br /> <br /> The Giants ride pays tribute to these extraordinary athletes while simultaneously rewarding us with insight into the strength of the waves they want to overcome, the awesome power they are subjected to, the painful vertical droppings required to reach them, and the almost incomprehensible combination Of adrenaline and the fear of my surfers' experience every time they take the monster. <br /> <br /> All this, the film has more. For those of us who did not live in California in the 1960s, we got insight into the impact of web surfing on American pop culture. (Surprisingly, Gidget's impact on surfing!) Peralta is also woven into an introduction to some of the technical aspects of sport and the history of equipment innovation. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of Sundance, I was fascinated by this film. Peralta screams his claim as the Big Kahuna of American documentaries.
