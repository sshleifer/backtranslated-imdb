A wonderful film, based on a real story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her little daughter. She insists that the Deng baby took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film actually revolves around the media circus that took place on the issue, the way the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the mentality of mobs that ultimately led to the condemnation of women, on the basis of any strong evidence. I like movies that question the media, as well as films that take a closer look at how people intersect with the judicial system. I always thought that the jury had to show 12 angry men before they took up their duties. It is not a liberal film, as has been said so much, but a clinical view of how we as human beings interpret events based on our biases and our desire for revenge. Cry in the dark my bed likewise. Schepisi is keen not to make the film at all melodramatic. Some may find the film tedious or dry, but I found it interesting.
