Any badminton plot and dubious descriptions do not affect when the movie is fun to watch. The exciting and amazing movement - for their day - this movie gives some real zip code. There is some actual comedy of chemistry shredding between two leads. Quinn also makes a good villain, although his role has completely overwhelmed him. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the hard, broad role played by Maureen O'Hara, as sexy as any Hollywood movie of this age. You may be able to forgive it because of the time it was made, but it is still difficult to overcome. Despite all the horrific and hideous positions and competitions off the screen, this is still a little more than a good time for teenagers.
