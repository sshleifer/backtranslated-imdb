For the record, I am not related to production in any way. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan movie that contains most of the episodes that have been produced so far. Over the course of 7 seasons (this is the last) they produced about 50 episodes or so. <br /> <br /> This is not a feat in having almost no budget and everyone is volunteering their time and energy. <br /> <br /> With their own consent, early seasons do not have good production qualities like subsequent seasons, but as they progress, the green screen improves and everything works. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to "roll back" to "so I started from the beginning and watched all the way." HF benefits from the story bows just like all the best sci-fi and fits beautifully in the Star Trek world where he was assigned. Enter characters and "relatives" from the original series to the stories and add a lot to the sense of stories, and sometimes the characters improve on the original. <br /> <br /> The entire experience includes an excellent web site, the blooper reels, a high-profile forum frequented by many actors and staff Production and weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for high-resolution, high-budget productions, this may not be for . <br /> <br /> If you're looking for ongoing adventures in the world of Star Trek through the stories are appreciated Star Trek and make you think, this is the story.
