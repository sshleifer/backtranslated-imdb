This is the optical adaptation of the manga with very little dialogue. What dialogue is there appears in the word baloons as in the manga. This plot exists but was only vaguely calculated. There is a problem with the manga on which this is based in English in the Explosive Book Collection, Underground Cartoons Japan, and has an actual explanatory dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here. I recommend checking out this sound if you like this, because it explains some "plot" movie, which is inexplicable otherwise. This wise cartoon is very decent, good non-intrusive use of computers and pictures are mostly well realized. She jumps out of the rings, where the characters, the cat and his big sister kill the brain in and out of a series of exotic images: a boat, a circus and a desert. For half an hour they pass through a number of charts and settings, leading me to believe that the director chose a number of long-lasting manga versions to adapt to randomly, but primarilly was chosen visually. Knowing what happens may increase somewhat of appreciation. This reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on mtv, a sushi cartoon, especially a cat-chasing clip chasing a rough man around the house. Only in this case are the cats more like hello kitty and expanded their adventure to include death, reincarnation and a number of other subjects [though not easy to know what is going on]. This DVD contains the director's hangout and Make features, but I can not comment on that because I did not go around with them. I give this 8/10 at the moment, here is not much to compare it to the anime, I hope more like that.
