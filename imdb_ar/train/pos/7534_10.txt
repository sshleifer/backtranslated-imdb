I do not agree with other opinions altogether. All of which are fundamentally negative. I took the opportunity in this film and I was happy because I did already. I could not find any fault in that. There is no period. Native script. The actors are all lovable and convincing. De Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady from Brady Bunch. But this picture can really work. The setup in the Australian remote areas is ideal. wounderful seen. Fantastic soundtrack by Paul Kelly. God bless Paul Kelly. Also here. I watched this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably see it again. It is interesting. It makes you think. Perhaps Cannes was better than nine tenths of the so-called famous Hollywood movies that were also out during this time. Back Of Beyond. Well photographed. I could not find any fault in that. check it out! My first rating!
