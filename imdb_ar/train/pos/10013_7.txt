As one former commentator said, this was the basis for a great film, but something happened on the way to delivery. This is a waste because Collett's performance was strange and Williams was reasonable. I kept waiting until I got better. I do not think it was bad at editing or in need of another way out, it was possible to have a movie. It appeared as a Canadian movie, like the first few chapters of the X files. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, he needed more suspense. Something that makes you jump out of your seat. The film reached that moment and faded. Kind of like a false peak. I can see how pessimistic it was to get away from the "fact" of the story, but I thought that this part was reached when Gabriel was in hospital looking for the boy. This movie needs to cut out a way to fix these problems.
