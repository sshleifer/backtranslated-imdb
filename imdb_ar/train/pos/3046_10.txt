All good movies "inspire" some flick directly video. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not a really good film, because I did not watch any film that resembled anything remotely resembling anything Romanian on new releases for months. Then the latest demo of Full Moon, Demonicus. I admire the Puppetmaster series from Full Moon and Blood Dolls, but I never saw one of their non-lethal puppets. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus lists what happens to a group of campers in the Alps. A campman, James, finds a cave with old artifacts from the wrestler, and feels pushed to remove a helmet from a body and try it. He became possessed, and as with the demonic wrestler Tyrannus, he was forced to kill his friends to revive the corpse, which is the real Tyrannus. <br /> <br /> Like many many Moon movies, I have been awarded little or no. budget. Sometimes, the editing and direction was very amateurish and I swear I was watching Blair's witch project. Attempts to cut off limbs and heads remind me of the play by Monty Python. The weapons, although they appear to be genuine, look plastic. It seems literally that this was filmed by a group of friends using a digital video camera on the weekend. Granted, there is nothing wrong with making these films, do not hire this expected masterpiece. It seems that there have been attempts to search for the script too, because although Tyrannus really does not act much like a gladiator to the end, he speaks at least Latin. <br /> <br /> All the trash aside, I really enjoyed this movie. Not as much as a movie killer dolls, maybe, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing I was disappointed with was that there was not a Full Moon Videoozone site at the end!
