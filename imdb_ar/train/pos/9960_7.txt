I noticed that this film was getting litter well before it hit the theaters and I had little hope of it. I thought it was another kind of "You Got Served" with some nice dance movements and terrible acting. I was in the theater and decided between this and I knew the scotters and picked up this. To my surprise the acting was not bad at all and the film was really good. The fact that being rated less than You Got Served is very ridiculous. Instead of listening to the trash posted here, I recommend watching the show for this movie so do not spend too much. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how wrong everyone is. When it comes to dance movies, it is certainly one of the best films with much superior acting than many other films. Go to see the movie and judge yourself. We hope that ratings will rise after they appear on the DVD and more people are checking the film instead of judging it based on the comments before the movie is released. She gave her more than 1000 people a rating of 9, which is a little too high but at least helps to compensate the ridiculous votes of 1.
