I am a fan of ART art, I liked nothing about art, loved paintings, sculptures, etc. This film shows that, so I liked it a lot, and shows how women want to paint anything about art, especially bare bodies, but can not do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the film, she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for her drawings, But her family did not allow her to paint naked men because they were against morality. Artemisia, however, can paint her boyfriend and her technical school completely naked. She falls in love with her artistic teacher, and the art teacher seems to love her perfectly, so in the end he sacrifices his freedom to lie by lying. He said he raped her, but that was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she said she would suffer greatly, because at the trial where Artemisia, her father and the arts school were, someone was hurting her artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this is a wonderful movie about art and artistic love, it's worth watching. Valentina Serve is as wonderful as Artemisia, and she acts very well, as I like her performance in "Portrait of a Lady" like Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
