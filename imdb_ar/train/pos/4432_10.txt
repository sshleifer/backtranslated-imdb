Luckily, I admit that I am a sucker for a beautiful film, and that the movements of the camera and its creative angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film. Gojoe was not the length of one, although it contained some of the most prominent cinematograph I have seen since the Korean MUSA period. However, Gojoe provides more than just beautiful images (as does the MUSA ... does not mean that variation) - the second largest power is the wonderful acting, and a wonderful story with some very dark philosophy. I must admit that I am not entirely sure of the point that she was trying to raise in the end, but it certainly raises some ideas along the way. Those are vague, but definitely ideas: p <br /> <br /> One of the films that could have been better is action. There is a huge amount of bloodshed in the film, but the entire procedure was filmed through close-motion shots, often obscured by objects in the foreground. It creates some impressive visual images, but it was good to see some actual moves, which makes it even more believable that the bad guys can roam through entire armies wasting everyone. <br /> <br /> However, the film is definitely one of the most beautiful and interesting films I've seen in a long time. Recommended!
