I have had the opportunity to watch a show for this film recently. I think it will be in theaters in Canada some time on Mother's Day. If in a theater near you ... GO! It's not a great movie that feels comfortable - it's more like a feeling and thought in a movie. <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job of developing the character - allowing you to heart, mind and pain. Something went wrong. At first, her attitudes and behaviors are meaningless. When her story unfolds, you become someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found her likable at the end of the film - especially when she opened her heart to the young man in the cottage next to the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with her children is painful - and this is reflected in many of our experiences in this world. Her younger son, John, is full of life and adventure, the viewer moves to the edge of his seat - and in a kind of genuine and very rare passion. <br /> <br /> It's good to see Ellen page behaving in this movie. She is very different from the young woman she plays in Juno. It gives me a wider appreciation of its ability to act. If you love her in Juno, you'll love her at The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Ellen Bernstein as a migraine. There is probably no way to express power as strongly as the actor can make you forget every other character you've ever played. I never thought of the movie "Ellen Bernstein" once in this film - I always thought of Hagar. She attracted me to her personality - the hook, the line and the diver. <br /> <br /> Carrie Skogland's ability to portray this famous book by one of Canada's most admired writers is impressive. She brilliantly brings to the screen both the stone and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hajar - the stone angel.
