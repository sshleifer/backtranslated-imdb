This afternoon, we took the kids to the cinema and we saw Neil Geiman's Stardust and all I can say is Wow. <br /> <br /> It's rare for me to be completely surprised by anything but perhaps this is the greatest fantasy film I've seen before, probably the best movie of any kind, and it was all wrong Neil Jiman. <br /> <br /> Sure, it was possible to be absorbed through the wonderful dialogue that was clever, flow smoothly, and make the characters completely believable. <br /> <br /> I could have gone on for days about stunning acting, Charlie Cox as perfect as Tristan, and a wonderful Claire Dines like Evin, and Robert De Niro steals the film almost The Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The sheer joy of humor that managed to laugh loud and funny enough to make the first Shrek look like a Sitcom game in the 1980s, perfectly blended with the rest of the movie alone made this movie great. <br /> <br /> Special effects were almost perfect, if it were not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but wherever they were, they were exactly what was called, not much to distract you from the movie itself and blending them with the story altogether. <br /> <br /> Then there is the story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story that contains all the components of the classic fairy tale formula that comes not just as another Princess Prince knockout. It is able to be familiar and comfortable but is completely new and refreshing at the same time. <br /> <br /> Any of these things would have made this film a good one, all of which make it a wonderful but pale film compared to the rich and fascinating world these elements combine to show life well. Again Neil Geyman did this, pushing another dagger into my heart by creating a world of imagination so beautiful and charming that I would do almost anything to live in and gave me only a brief glimpse of him. I did not want to end, I wanted to suck through a whirlpool to Sturmold's land and meet Tristan and Evin personally, travel in her fields and valleys, walk around her markets and meet her people alike. Friendly and stay there forever. It is a feeling that I noticed that whenever I read anything by Geyman, Sandman, the American deities, Corralen, all of me left feeling deeply saddened when I finished reading it because it was over, I could not see anything more in the worlds it created and which looked more vibrant and vital than those forced To live in and watch the Stardust were not different. <br /> <br /> In the end I'm sure Neil's writing will not have the same effect on everyone, but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie. It's easily one of the best 5 movies I've seen it at all and I can guarantee that anyone with the soul at all will at least like it.
