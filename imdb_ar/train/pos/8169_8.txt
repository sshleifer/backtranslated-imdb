This is a big mess and very convincing. Corbin Prinson leads the film largely through his brilliant portrayal of a maniac obsessed with controlling a stranger. Linda Hoffman plays his deceptive wife and is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her, the little "attempt" with the man of blessing brings a severe punishment in the way that the good doctor knows - shame on that beautiful smile! The last half-hour of the film was devoted to the character of Berenson and completely lost the spotlight on a young actress named Virginia Kenny. She is a very talented performer, and she puts pressure on the lights from the moment the armrests begin. Nice legs, too!
