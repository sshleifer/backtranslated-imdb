Wow I love this movie! It is about normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy, honesty, love and surrender. Great! It's about the things everyone faces in life. You have to do things passionately. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and "what neighbors will think" is more important than following their heart. Do not let anyone's opinion prevent you from achieving your dreams and your passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really ordinary people, and this may be my family. There are no great pros, but all the people you love during the movie.
