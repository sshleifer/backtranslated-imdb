There are many types of reunions. One type is where the old actors are removed from moth balls and assigned to recreate characters they have not played for twenty or thirty years. These have mixed results. "Back to Mayberry", though a little messed up, was fine; "Back to Green Acres" as an executable (Eddie Albert used a word for the text I will not repeat here, but both the film and the foul smell); "Rescue from Gilligan Island "A necessary gap was filled in the story of the untouchables, although the presentation itself was absurd even from the point of view of" Gilligan Island. " In most cases, scripts are weak; sometimes they appear silly in scripts that are very knowledgeable? In comedy it is almost always fatal that characters realize they are funny. New characters are offered not fit the mix. Mainly, these performances are a weak reunion. The second type of "reunion" is the kind in which actors put their past aside but sit around, tell stories, and remember, interspersed with memories of the past. Then there are program-based movies, which are rarely good; and movies based on the date of the show ('Brady Bunch' happened to each of them, with different results). <br /> <br /> "Back to Batcave" uses all of the above, with a great twisting view, making it the best in reunion shows and inspiring others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Bert Ward are summoned to the show from the original Batmobile. While they are there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> Adam West of the film is a demented man. Called Jerry, his servant, Alfred. He opens a Shakespeare statue in his apartment and reveals a hidden column sliding into the garage. He is obsessed with being a criminal fighter, while in fact he is just a washed-up actor. When a Batmobile car is stolen, he does not think it is his duty as a crime fighter to recover it, but Vert tries to intercept Ward as his assistant. <br /> <br /> The pursuit of his steadiness is largely remembered, as West Ward of the old days is broken by "memories of the past" with actors playing West Ward in the old days. Modern sights and "memories of the past" both have a curious lack of reality preserved exhibit. There are also some gags that show that West is able to make fun of himself: in a book about his time in the program, he speaks frankly about sexual desire in the West and also about being chills (West makes Ward pay for everything in his quest, down to tips and fare) The bus). Their clues and the characters they meet (even in the flashback) are all consistent with the old chain mentality, and there are several greetings, including the fist fight with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is very funny and it is done with great panache. There is also a veil by Julie Newmar (looks like she has one too many beautification) and Frank Gorshen, reminds us of why he has such worship. Gorshen will become angry when he forgets Jim Carrey, his obvious successor. The film builds into a fairly obvious but funny climax. <br /> <br /> This offer is a sample of reunion offers? Unfortunately, there is little that can fit the style. The actors had to re-represent their old characters; the young actors were playing a film about the making of the show; actors West Ward remembered; and a recent film with real Adam West playing Adam West. She has it all. If you like the old display, this is the bottle stopper.
