As a person living near Buffalo, New York, this film recorded points with me before I see it, because the story is based here. There are even some sections that contain news reporters and real life from the city of Buffalo, and once the area is not touched. Glory be to Allah! <br /> <br /> Wise theology, Les !!! God is still forced to consider and think as human beings ... Of course, be a little on the liberal side. Since it is a lightweight comedy, nothing should win any prizes, but it is still amusing and is a fun way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some laughable comedies, and we hope that the audience - from Christians to atheists - will hear something in addition to some laughs, like what prayer should really be. Glory to the book at least to correct this theology and give a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good-intentioned film that should hurt a very few.
