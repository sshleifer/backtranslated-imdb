First of all, I must start this comment by saying that I am a huge nightmare for Elm Street fans. I think it is the greatest horror series ever. For me, Freddie is a jig! Of course, Freddy Dade, who tried to be the last chapter at the time, is a strange film. It does not have the same atmosphere of previous movies. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some believe it makes him less scary, which he agrees with. This, in my opinion, is exactly the point. There is this film so we can know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he was, how he became a man chasing our dreams. For some people, it's bad, it's better to never know because it's scary not knowing the cause of evil. It is clear that these people will not like reshaping the zombie Rob Zombie. To truly enjoy this, you have to see things differently. It's not about a stranger hiding in the jungle in your dreamland waiting to scare hell out of you. This was the first one and was fabulous. Over the years, Freddy killed more and more people, and no one could ever get rid of him. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil and the psychological aspects of the terrorist Freddie world. Beside the story of Freddy's past, I also liked the atmosphere of the film. There are no more children in Springwood, just adults. The nightmare scenes are all fantastic. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially the opening song "I'm Awakened Now" performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe it is worth less. Maybe misunderstood, or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has lots of scary moments as well as very funny moments, lots of wands! Be prepared for something different and you may not feel disappointed.
