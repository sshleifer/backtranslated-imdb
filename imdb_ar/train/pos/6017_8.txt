There is no way to confront "Zabriskie Point" from a rational point of view or attempt to describe it using the words and conventions you use for other movies. This is because it is not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling that filmmakers have somehow turned into ordinary objects like film. What we see is not a conspiracy, but a series of events that we do not see in films every day, but imagine it happening only as a backdrop we ourselves will give when we hear about some tragic events in news or friends. We see our imagination of people who are abstract to us - no one we know, but we have undoubtedly heard them in a book, on television or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, they lead, and they inevitably flee. Only escape is an intangible thing - it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of civilization has allowed to exist despite laziness, or ... human nature. In the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players act in the face of contemporary misery and modern response. These creatures are empty panels that can effectively display any feature we can imagine if we wish. Although the actions taken may be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not criminal in themselves. They are human beings seeking to return to a familiar and unproductive existence beyond the normal life they are exposed to every day. Not that they are happy or sad at all, but they achieve some kind of self-realization when they move away from the suicide of modern life. They only achieve real life in the natural world, although this is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, 'Zabriski Point' is a tribute to humanity's relations with the natural world. As the most devastated part of the earth surrenders to our notions of progress, we lose our lives on the path of the death of the human spirit.
