The creators of this wonderful film did a great job of engaging you in characters, who suffered from this terrible ordeal. The horrific scene in the forest was so wonderful that you forgot that these guys were just actors and played parts. You have never indulged in a film like I have this movie. Was not the best performance of Kurt Reynolds and John Voight, as well as great performances by Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox and Bill McKinney. The man who wrote the book on which the film is based, as the leader of my eye. It is a little disturbing, and of course children must be protected from it, but this is a wonderful and dramatic cinema.
