One of the best love stories I have ever seen. It's a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but it's beautiful though ... Big Edie and Little Edie look like some family members after watching this movie over and over again, they quote: "It's a damn beautiful day, and now will you just shut up? "The opening interpretation of Little Edie's clothes is just that the film will last forever, as well as Big Edie" The World Famous Singer "and Little Edie" The World Famous Dancer ".
