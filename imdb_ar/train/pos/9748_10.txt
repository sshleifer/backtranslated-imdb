I saw this movie when it was shown when I was 17 and in classic rock music (I'm still ...) <br /> <br /> I've never loved opera before because I hate soprano sounds, but it's all changed. He was fantastic in the film and he had a wonderful voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died tonight at home because of pancreatic cancer, and we will miss him, and certainly left his mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this movie if I can find, watch and enjoy it. * Smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and take a look before selling it.
