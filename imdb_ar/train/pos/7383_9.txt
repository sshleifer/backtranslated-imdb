The very tense excitement of urban chaos in Sao Paulo, the biggest and most nightmare nightmare of the Third World in Brazilian Urbana. In order to make it easy for anyone interested in curiosity about this really exciting film, it is characterized by the fortunes of the Mexican film "Amores Perros" with a character not too far from Max Cady, of both Cape Fears, although this is not, A film about mentally ill. Two partners (Alexander Borges and Marco Rika) in the building company of the assassin Anicio (Miklos) are paid to his third partner (and the majority holder) in the aforementioned construction equipment. The murder has been blamed in the city, but things are starting to look very bleak when Anisio decides to be associated with attractive and bold walking prizes. He does not want to be around the nervous partners in the crime, not just the abuse of others, but more importantly, dismantling Strict social laws. Which constitute Brazilian society. Anisio converts poverty to a position and wants it. The appearance is almost full-spirited, gracious, and outstanding performances all the time, especially as the first actor (and a member of the Brazilian pop band Tit√£s), Paolo Mikulos, delight and amazes the viewer with his very funny social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw the film at the Brasilia Film Festival in November 2001. Since then it has achieved great success in Sundance and Berlin. Clipper Mendonso Filho
