Although this film is somewhat sterile (because it was produced at a time when people did not talk about sex), it is a short film that is very useful for showing girls before puberty so they know what to expect during menstruation. It is not surprising that Kotex has paid for it, although what may surprise many is that Disney produced this film - because it produced a lot of educational films during the 1940s and 60s. However, the film has been well made, I think the movie maker wasted a real opportunity. Instead of a nice narrator's voice and relatively nice videos, it would be great if they used a mini mouse and the rest of the Disney band !! I know this would give Old Walt a heart attack, but wow would be a great movie! By the way, although the idea of ​​sex has barely hinted at the film, it only explains menstruation in general. However, it lacks some details (especially about sexual intercourse) which I assume are included in the accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now if I can find out why I saw a cartoon about menstruation.
