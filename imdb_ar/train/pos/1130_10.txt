"Eugenia" is the great achievement of Michael Kakoyanis. This brilliantly designed play was adapted to the screen and animated by a great crew. Cacoyannis achieved impossible. Managed to portray a Greek tragedy on the screen without losing its effectiveness and importance. Greek cast starfish help him in this. The newcomer Tatyana Babamushu is very impressive like Evgenia. Equally impressive, Irene Papas, who sometimes looks over the top, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek film, beautifully written and directed by Michael Kakoyanis, with an excellent musical score by Mikis Theodorakis, ideal for every scene. Rumor has it that the film lost the best foreign language film Oscar by only one vote !!!
